<P>
   Every few months, Japan comes under pressure to offer a
``proper'' apology for its conduct during some of the bloodier
parts of this century. Then, almost regardless of what it says, it
finds itself under some sort of fire.
</P>
<P>
   During Emperor Akihito's state visit to Britain in May it was
criticized for seeming niggardly in its contrition; and even during
the recent successful visit to Japan of South Korea's President Kim
Dae Jung, in which warm words were exchanged and a fulsome apology
provided, some unkind souls wondered why it had taken Japan so long
to say sorry for its colonial deeds.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, however, Japan has been firmly in the right _
but this time for not offering a fulsome apology.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the visit to Tokyo of China's President Jiang
Zemin, the first ever by a Chinese head of state. For sure, Japan
has plenty to feel sorry about concerning its actions in Manchuria
and elsewhere in China during the 1930s and 1940s; the only
sensible debate about the period turns on how many millions of
Chinese citizens were slaughtered, not the reality or morality of
the actions, and it would be best if Japan, particularly its
schools but also its politicians, were to come to terms with this
past.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even in the contrition business, the wider
context also matters. And it is that which makes this Japanese
refusal welcome.
</P>
<P>
   That context begins with President Jiang and his fellow
communists. To treat this Chinese leadership as fitting recipients
of an apology would frankly be pretty stomach-churning.
</P>
<P>
   The only entity that this century has outdone the Imperial
Japanese army in the killing of Chinese citizens is the Communist
Party of China itself _ in policy-induced famine, in prison camps,
in the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution, and in Tiananmen Square
in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Where today's Japanese government is genuinely of a different
generation and political system from its 1930s predecessors, the
difference between President Jiang's government and those of Mao
Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping is one of degree, not kind.
</P>
<P>
   For all his urbane charm, and willingness to cite poetry and
sing songs, President Jiang remains head of a nasty regime. To use
him as courier for a contrite message to the people his party still
brutalizes would be ironical, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the use to which the war-guilt issue is put.
Plainly, and for many years, the Chinese have deployed it as a
negotiating weapon, often in association with entirely groundless
claims that Japanese militarism is again on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   It has no moral value to them nor is the sincerity or otherwise
of the apology of particular relevance. Rather, it is a way of
putting Japan on the defensive and of extracting concessions from
it, usually in financial form.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite China's apparent outrage about this week's
apology-refusal, the tactic nevertheless still worked: Japanese
loans worth YEN 390 billion ($3.2 billion) over the next two years
were announced while President Jiang was in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important piece of context is the island which
China calls a ``renegade province'': Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long retained close business and political links with
its former colony. Under new security-treaty guidelines agreed with
the United States, Japan has left open for itself a possible role
for its navy and air force as far south as Taiwan, and China would
dearly like that role to be renounced. Yet Japan refuses to do so _
and maintained that refusal during President Jiang's visit this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The right approach to Taiwan in general, and to the question of
whether outsiders would intervene militarily to support the island,
is one of aggressive ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders should not, by their actions or threats, give China an
excuse for military action. But they deter such action most
effectively when China is left guessing about what they might do,
while the outsiders still make it clear that military moves against
Taiwan would not be considered merely an internal Chinese affair.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Japan's flat refusal to close off its options is so
welcome. Indeed, it has given less ground on Taiwan than did
President Bill Clinton on his visit to China this summer, when he
signed up to a Chinese declaration against Taiwanese independence
or political recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, relations between China and Japan promise to
be among the region's prickliest. Many in China think it will soon
be able to take its rightful position as East Asia's economic and
political superpower, and that the country standing most clearly in
its way is Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Another, plausible view is that Asia's next big problem is
Chinese economic collapse, with possible consequences for internal
political stability and rising nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, an important ingredient of regional stability is for
Japan to stand firm: to make it clear that it is not going to be
pushed around. That was the welcome sight in Tokyo during the past
few days. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in increasingly intolerant times. Signs proliferate
demanding no smoking, no spitting, no parking, even no walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No blacks'' signs have thankfully disappeared _ but elsewhere
the imperative of denial seems to be ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking, once prohibited only in a few train cars or sections of
aircraft, is now banned totally in many offices, on most public
transport and even in many bars.
</P>
<P>
   Posh clubs and restaurants have long had ``no jeans'' rules, but
these days you can be too smart. Some London hostelries have ``no
suits'' policies, for fear that boisterous city traders in suits
might spoil the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long demanded all sorts of bans on cars.
Mobile telephones are the latest target: some trains, airline
lounges, restaurants and even golf courses are being designated
``no phone'' areas.
</P>
<P>
   If intolerance really has to be the spirit of this age, The
Economist would like to suggest restrictions on another source of
noise pollution: children.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you dismiss this as mere prejudice, we can even produce a
good economic argument for it. Smoking, driving and mobile phones
all cause what economists call ``negative externalities.'' That is,
the costs of these activities to other people tend to exceed the
costs to the individuals of their proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible hand of the market fumbles, leading resources
astray. Thus, because a driver's private motoring costs do not
reflect the costs he imposes on others in the form of pollution and
congestion, he uses the car more than is socially desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it is argued, smokers take too little care to ensure
that their acrid fumes do not damage other people around them.
</P>
<P>
   Governments typically respond to such market failures in two
ways. One is higher taxes, to make polluters pay the full cost of
their anti-social behavior. The other is regulation, such as
emission standards or bans on smoking in public places. Both
approaches might work for children.
</P>
<P>
   For children, just like cigarettes or mobile phones, clearly
impose a negative externality on people who are near them. Anybody
who has suffered a 12-hour flight with a bawling baby in the row
immediately ahead or a bored youngster viciously kicking their seat
from behind, will grasp this as quickly as they would love to grasp
the youngster's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a clear case of market failure: parents do not bear the
full costs (indeed young babies travel free), so they are too ready
to take their noisy brats with them. Where is the invisible hand
when it is needed to administer a good smack?
</P>
<P>
   The solution is obvious. All airlines, trains and restaurants
should create child-free zones. Put all those children at the back
of the plane and parents might make more effort to minimize their
noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of letting children often pay less and babies go
free, they should be charged (or taxed) more than adults, with the
revenues used to subsidize seats immediately in front of the
war-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers could then request a no-children seat, just as they
now ask for a no-smoking one. As more women choose not to have
children and the number of older people without young children
increases, the demand for child-free travel will expand.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it is a bit intolerant _ but why shouldn't parents be
treated as badly as smokers? And at least there is an obvious
airline to pioneer the scheme: Virgin. &QL;

<P>
   We live in increasingly intolerant times. Signs proliferate
demanding no smoking, no spitting, no parking, even no walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No blacks'' signs have thankfully disappeared _ but elsewhere
the imperative of denial seems to be ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking, once prohibited only in a few train cars or sections of
aircraft, is now banned totally in many offices, on most public
transport and even in many bars.
</P>
<P>
   Posh clubs and restaurants have long had ``no jeans'' rules, but
these days you can be too smart. Some London hostelries have ``no
suits'' policies, for fear that boisterous city traders in suits
might spoil the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long demanded all sorts of bans on cars.
Mobile telephones are the latest target: some trains, airline
lounges, restaurants and even golf courses are being designated
``no phone'' areas.
</P>
<P>
   If intolerance really has to be the spirit of this age, The
Economist would like to suggest restrictions on another source of
noise pollution: children.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you dismiss this as mere prejudice, we can even produce a
good economic argument for it. Smoking, driving and mobile phones
all cause what economists call ``negative externalities.'' That is,
the costs of these activities to other people tend to exceed the
costs to the individuals of their proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible hand of the market fumbles, leading resources
astray. Thus, because a driver's private motoring costs do not
reflect the costs he imposes on others in the form of pollution and
congestion, he uses the car more than is socially desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it is argued, smokers take too little care to ensure
that their acrid fumes do not damage other people around them.
</P>
<P>
   Governments typically respond to such market failures in two
ways. One is higher taxes, to make polluters pay the full cost of
their anti-social behavior. The other is regulation, such as
emission standards or bans on smoking in public places. Both
approaches might work for children.
</P>
<P>
   For children, just like cigarettes or mobile phones, clearly
impose a negative externality on people who are near them. Anybody
who has suffered a 12-hour flight with a bawling baby in the row
immediately ahead or a bored youngster viciously kicking their seat
from behind, will grasp this as quickly as they would love to grasp
the youngster's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a clear case of market failure: parents do not bear the
full costs (indeed young babies travel free), so they are too ready
to take their noisy brats with them. Where is the invisible hand
when it is needed to administer a good smack?
</P>
<P>
   The solution is obvious. All airlines, trains and restaurants
should create child-free zones. Put all those children at the back
of the plane and parents might make more effort to minimize their
noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of letting children often pay less and babies go
free, they should be charged (or taxed) more than adults, with the
revenues used to subsidize seats immediately in front of the
war-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers could then request a no-children seat, just as they
now ask for a no-smoking one. As more women choose not to have
children and the number of older people without young children
increases, the demand for child-free travel will expand.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it is a bit intolerant _ but why shouldn't parents be
treated as badly as smokers? And at least there is an obvious
airline to pioneer the scheme: Virgin. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In one of the advertisements aired before his smashing
victory in last month's election, Governor George Bush of Texas
could be seen, upright and with a sober expression, inspecting a
forlorn parade of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup took place at a ``Tough Love Academy,'' the local
euphemism for a boot camp. Such academies lick errant youth into
shape the old-fashioned way. Offenders are stripped, shaved,
dressed in orange jail-garb, and hustled through something like
army drill with doses of Bible study. It is hard punishment, but at
least the aim is rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the state's prisons. Texas has spent over $2 billion
to lock up offenders in new prisons and keep them there.
Rehabilitation is an afterthought, and that suits most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the highest rate of incarceration in the country:
a Texan is seven times more likely than a Minnesotan to find
himself behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   And the hard-line approach (helped no doubt by a booming
economy) seems to be working. Crime in the Lone Star state is at a
20-year low. Murders last year, politicians proudly report, were
down 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet long sentences without parole offer little incentive for
good behavior. Texas prisons, murky hells at the best of times, are
getting more violent, and the violent are getting more organized.
Increasingly, inmates find hope and purpose in a potentially
devastating form of organized crime, prison gangs.
</P>
<P>
   These gangs were founded for self-protection: protection from
rape, assault and being cut open in the showers. Federal prison
reforms were partly responsible for their growth.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 ruling allowed inmates in other prisons to write to each
other, creating the structure that characterizes prison gangs. A
1979 ruling desegregated prison cells, and the ensuing racial
tensions saw gangs gather around their racial and ethnic banners.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1982 came the abolition of the ``building-tender''
system. Building-tenders were mostly older white inmates, who were
set up like prefects at a British boarding school to enforce order
among other inmates. Gangs grew in the vacuum they left.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5 percent of Latino inmates in Texas _ and around 15
percent of the known or suspected gang members in Texas jails _
belong to the Mexican Mafia, the state's biggest prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   Members style themselves Emes (pronounced ``eemmee'' after the
Spanish letter M). They organized in the early 1980s to protect
Latino inmates from racial attacks. Today they are opportunistic
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Emes deal in chiva (heroin), mota (marijuana), soda (cocaine)
and compadres for those who want to knock boots (have sex). ``We
will traffic in drugs, contracts of assassination, prostitution,
and robbery of high magnitude,'' says the Mexican Mafia's
businesslike constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since their tentative early days, the Emes have coalesced into a
fraternity for hard-line criminals. The gang now coordinates drug
deals on the streets of Texan barrios from inside the state's
jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organized crime, no different from the gang warfare that
took place in Chicago in the 1930s,'' says Allan Polunsky, the
chairman of the Texas prison board.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike loud and loosely organized street gangs, prison gangs
tend to be secretive and highly structured. Street gangs drift
apart as their members get older; prison gangs are committed for
life. Street gangs are often riven by feuds; prison gangs are
characterized by respect.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is ruthlessly enforced. A member of the Texas
Syndicate _ the rival Latino prison gang to the Mexican Mafia _ was
shot dead in his Austin home last year when gang bosses suspected
him of snitching to the police. Intelligence reports repeatedly
describe prison gangs as coldhearted, loyal, violent and without
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, too, these gangs are getting out of prison and making
their presence felt on the street. Of 30,000 inmates released on
parole from Texas state prisons in 1997, 3,000 had some gang
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Emes were indicted in San Antonio recently on
racketeering charges. Police say the gang has been responsible for
14 murders in San Antonio, including the city's worst mass murder
in which Emes killed five people.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs move into the barrios, where they enforce a 10 percent
street tax from small-time drug-pushers. The money is used to
support gangsters' families and pay legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest of the gangs, though, are the white supremacists,
who rally around ideology rather than racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white guys are solid,'' a Texas inmate explained recently
to the Houston Chronicle. ``They are the most violent in the
system. They'll kill in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   This was bloodily demonstrated in June, when three white men
lynched a black man in east Texas by chaining him to their pickup
truck and dragging him behind it. Two of the killers (though not
the third, who claimed no white supremacist links) had apparently
picked up their violent racism in jail.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 425 members of the Aryan Brotherhood in Texas
prisons. The gang was founded in California's San Quentin in the
1960s with the motto, ``Kill to get in, die to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more white inmates have been linked with the KKK and the
Aryan Circle, which are officially listed as groups rather than
gangs. Reformed white supremacists say prison is the primary
recruiting ground for neo-Nazis. The large numbers of blacks in
jails, who often speak an impenetrable street dialect, provides an
easy excuse for hatred.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the gangs, parole boards are now obliged to take gang
membership into account when releasing criminals. Gangsters are
closely monitored with an electronic bracelet, and their telltale
tattoos are photographed upon release. Later, these can be checked
for new gangster markings.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to curbing the growth of gangs, there is
little the state can do. Its own vigilance in locking up violent
offenders has spawned crime syndicates, ruthlessly organized and
racially segregated, which make Al Capone look soft. &QL;

BCS STILL IMPERFECT SOLUTION  
 3 UNBEATEN TEAMS CAUSING QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Bowl officials never openly root for a football team
to lose. They do, however, quietly pray on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the pants of Fiesta Bowl officials are becoming a
bit worn at the knees these days. Life would be much simpler for
them if one of the top three teams in the country, all of which are
undefeated, were to lose Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State win, the possibility of a
split national championship exists, which would raise the cry of
those who think a playoff is the only rational way to choose the
nation's best team.
</P>
<P>
   If those three teams finish undefeated, a complicated formula
comprised of polls, computer rankings, records and strength of
schedule will determine which teams will meet in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And football, the game of inches, will have been turned into one
of decimal points.
</P>
<P>
   The only people happy about that would be mathematicians,
computer geeks and the fourth-grade teachers who warned that we
would someday have to know fractions and decimals.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker
took offense with a suggestion in ``Sports Illustrated'' that the
national championship could be won by a team playing in a bowl
other than the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Junker offered to bet the magazine $1,000 that the national
championship would be settled in the Fiesta Bowl. Magazine
officials took him up on it, and the loser will send the money to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Should he lose, Junker, who was traveling and unavailable for
comment, will at least be able to write it off as a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Entering today's games, Tennessee is No. 1 in the BCS standings,
followed by UCLA and Kansas State. Jeff Sagarin, whose computer
ranking is one of three used in the BCS formula, predicts that
Kansas State and UCLA will play in the Fiesta Bowl if all three
teams win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee enters Saturday's games with a lead of .04 over UCLA,
which is 1.28 points ahead of Kansas State. The Volunteers beat
Vanderbilt, 41-0, last week but saw their lead shrink by .60
because their strength of schedule rating dropped 15 spots to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State would benefit from a huge boost in strength of
schedule because the Wildcats are in the Big 12 title game against
Texas A&AMP;M, which is rated higher than the other two opponents in
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarin is projecting Kansas State's strength of schedule will
improve from 62nd to 39th no matter the outcome of the Big 12 game.
That's a gain of .92.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which plays Miami, and Tennessee, which plays Mississippi
State in the Southeastern Conference title game, should gain, but
not that much.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State can move up from third in the computer rankings
of the ``New York Times'' or the ``Seattle Times,'' it should be
enough to jump into the top two slots.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, more to it than that. Strength of schedule
takes into account not only a team's opponents, but also the
opponents' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee fans should root for Marshall to beat Toledo because
Marshall played South Carolina, which played Tennessee. And the
Vols should also hope that Brigham Young beats Air Force in the
Western Athletic Conference title game because Alabama, a Tennessee
opponent, played BYU.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State and UCLA meet in the Fiesta Bowl, the Volunteers
would go to the Sugar Bowl, where they probably would play Florida
State. If that happens, Tennessee fans will complain louder than
they did last year when Peyton Manning didn't win the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, however, would still have a chance to win a share of
the national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl, its sponsor, Tostitos, and the network that
televises the four BCS games, ABC, have been promoting the game as
a national championship. But it would be hard for AP voters to
overlook the Vols, ranked No. 1 in that poll, should they win their
bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, ranked No. 1 in the coaches' poll, also could
share part of the national title if it went to the Sugar Bowl and
beat Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   This whole process is confounding to many and invites the
question: Is this a better system than existed before?
</P>
<P>
   It is but it will never be as definitive as a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year the Rose Bowl has joined a bowl alliance,
making the Big Ten and Pac-10 teams available to the BCS. Just last
year, UCLA would have gone to the Rose Bowl instead of the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS, however, has not eliminated back-room dealing among
bowls, which more than ever need to fill seats.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS bowls _ the Fiesta, Sugar, Orange and Rose _ will rotate
as hosts of the game featuring the top two teams. In other years,
they will have conference affiliations. The Big 12 champion will
come to the Fiesta under most circumstances. The SEC champion will
go to the Sugar, and the Orange will have its choice of the
Atlantic Coast or Big East champion, with the other assured of a
spot in the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two at-large teams, and bowls don't have to pick the
highest-rated available team. A team's drawing power at the gate
will be the No. 1 factor in those selections.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Fiesta Bowl chose Kansas State over UCLA last
year, and that's why the Orange Bowl is expected to take No. 7
Florida, with two losses, over No. 5 Ohio State, which has lost
once.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales are more important than ever to bowls. Under the
BCS, all money from sponsorship goes to ABC. The bowls still must
pay about $4 million apiece to be a part of the BCS, and the No. 1
way to raise that money is through ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Kansas State, whose fans travel by the thousands to
see their team, is more attractive to the Sugar Bowl than Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   The bowls need the money to survive, but fans want to see the
best teams play each other. Those two desires have clashed since
bowls became big business.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS arrangement looks less like a destination and more like
another way station on the way to a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be patient because it's better than what we
had,'' said Jim Livengood, Arizona's athletic director. ``I'm going
to give it a chance. But I'm not sure it's not driving us quicker
to a playoff.'' &QL;

TYSON MAY BE RETURNED TO PRISON  
 NO-CONTEST PLEA COULD VIOLATE PROBATION TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 and SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson resumed training at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden
on Thursday as his probation officer in Indianapolis said he will
file papers next week that could result in the former heavyweight
champ's return to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well,'' Tyson said after a closed workout. He had no
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Before his workout, Tyson registered as a sex offender with the
Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and plans to ``abide by the law
and train to win'' while in Arizona, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the small gym near 17th Avenue and West Van Buren
Street, Tyson didn't answer any questions while he signed
autographs for a small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Tyson's entourage said he would not do interviews
Thursday. His publicist, Dean Delorean of New York, said Tyson was
``dealing with legal issues.'' Delorean said he wouldn't have
anything to say until the issues were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   George Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court, told the Associated Press in Indianapolis that Tyson might
have violated terms of his probation as a result of his no-contest
plea Tuesday to misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has been on probation since he was released in 1995 after
three years of a 10-year sentence on a rape conviction. The
probation expires in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' said Walker, who intends to file papers in court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said his petition would not be a recommendation for
possible prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we actually say on the petition is to give the facts, the
facts we all read in the paper,'' Walker said. ``We want to go
ahead and get this on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson started the day at the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office
being photographed and fingerprinted as part of the sex-offender
registry requirement. He listed a Scottsdale address, according to
a source. He said last week he was living in Scottsdale, but that
he would look for a different residence in the Valley, which he
said is his new home.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's local attorney, Darrow Soll, said it was unclear whether
Tyson was legally required to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute seems to imply that you have to be continually
present (in the state), and he's a person who travels often,'' Soll
said. ``Nonetheless, he wanted to be law-abiding, so he decided to
err on the side of caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson returned to Phoenix two days after his court appearance in
Maryland in an attempt to re-establish a training regimen for a
projected fight on Jan. 16 against South African Frans Botha at Las
Vegas' MGM Grand. An official announcement of the bout had been
expected this week, possibly Thursday, at a news conference in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Associated Press report in Las Vegas, the
announcement was rescheduled for Tuesday. However, Delorean said
nothing is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson intends to train at the central Phoenix gym until Dec. 26
for his first bout since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears on June
28, 1997. He then would move his training camp to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether there will be an immediate decision in
Indiana on Walker's petition.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson entered his plea on Maryland charges that were filed as
the result of a scuffle with two men after a minor auto accident in
August. An out-of-court settlement was reached. A sentencing date
in Maryland has not been set. Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel expects
it to be scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Marion County prosecutor's office in
Indianapolis said Tyson's no-contest plea complicated the probation
questions. In Indiana, there is no such plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would be wise to wait and see what happens with
his sentencing in Maryland,'' Beverly Phillips said. &QL;

   Not so in the state's prisons. Texas has spent over $2 billion
to lock up offenders in new prisons and keep them there.
Rehabilitation is an afterthought, and that suits most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the highest rate of incarceration in the country:
a Texan is seven times more likely than a Minnesotan to find
himself behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   And the hard-line approach (helped no doubt by a booming
economy) seems to be working. Crime in the Lone Star state is at a
20-year low. Murders last year, politicians proudly report, were
down 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet long sentences without parole offer little incentive for
good behavior. Texas prisons, murky hells at the best of times, are
getting more violent, and the violent are getting more organized.
Increasingly, inmates find hope and purpose in a potentially
devastating form of organized crime, prison gangs.
</P>
<P>
   These gangs were founded for self-protection: protection from
rape, assault and being cut open in the showers. Federal prison
reforms were partly responsible for their growth.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 ruling allowed inmates in other prisons to write to each
other, creating the structure that characterizes prison gangs. A
1979 ruling desegregated prison cells, and the ensuing racial
tensions saw gangs gather around their racial and ethnic banners.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1982 came the abolition of the ``building-tender''
system. Building-tenders were mostly older white inmates, who were
set up like prefects at a British boarding school to enforce order
among other inmates. Gangs grew in the vacuum they left.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5 percent of Latino inmates in Texas _ and around 15
percent of the known or suspected gang members in Texas jails _
belong to the Mexican Mafia, the state's biggest prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   Members style themselves Emes (pronounced ``eemmee'' after the
Spanish letter M). They organized in the early 1980s to protect
Latino inmates from racial attacks. Today they are opportunistic
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Emes deal in chiva (heroin), mota (marijuana), soda (cocaine)
and compadres for those who want to knock boots (have sex). ``We
will traffic in drugs, contracts of assassination, prostitution,
and robbery of high magnitude,'' says the Mexican Mafia's
businesslike constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since their tentative early days, the Emes have coalesced into a
fraternity for hard-line criminals. The gang now coordinates drug
deals on the streets of Texan barrios from inside the state's
jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organized crime, no different from the gang warfare that
took place in Chicago in the 1930s,'' says Allan Polunsky, the
chairman of the Texas prison board.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike loud and loosely organized street gangs, prison gangs
tend to be secretive and highly structured. Street gangs drift
apart as their members get older; prison gangs are committed for
life. Street gangs are often riven by feuds; prison gangs are
characterized by respect.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is ruthlessly enforced. A member of the Texas
Syndicate _ the rival Latino prison gang to the Mexican Mafia _ was
shot dead in his Austin home last year when gang bosses suspected
him of snitching to the police. Intelligence reports repeatedly
describe prison gangs as coldhearted, loyal, violent and without
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, too, these gangs are getting out of prison and making
their presence felt on the street. Of 30,000 inmates released on
parole from Texas state prisons in 1997, 3,000 had some gang
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Emes were indicted in San Antonio recently on
racketeering charges. Police say the gang has been responsible for
14 murders in San Antonio, including the city's worst mass murder
in which Emes killed five people.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs move into the barrios, where they enforce a 10 percent
street tax from small-time drug-pushers. The money is used to
support gangsters' families and pay legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest of the gangs, though, are the white supremacists,
who rally around ideology rather than racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white guys are solid,'' a Texas inmate explained recently
to the Houston Chronicle. ``They are the most violent in the
system. They'll kill in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   This was bloodily demonstrated in June, when three white men
lynched a black man in east Texas by chaining him to their pickup
truck and dragging him behind it. Two of the killers (though not
the third, who claimed no white supremacist links) had apparently
picked up their violent racism in jail.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 425 members of the Aryan Brotherhood in Texas
prisons. The gang was founded in California's San Quentin in the
1960s with the motto, ``Kill to get in, die to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more white inmates have been linked with the KKK and the
Aryan Circle, which are officially listed as groups rather than
gangs. Reformed white supremacists say prison is the primary
recruiting ground for neo-Nazis. The large numbers of blacks in
jails, who often speak an impenetrable street dialect, provides an
easy excuse for hatred.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the gangs, parole boards are now obliged to take gang
membership into account when releasing criminals. Gangsters are
closely monitored with an electronic bracelet, and their telltale
tattoos are photographed upon release. Later, these can be checked
for new gangster markings.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to curbing the growth of gangs, there is
little the state can do. Its own vigilance in locking up violent
offenders has spawned crime syndicates, ruthlessly organized and
racially segregated, which make Al Capone look soft. &QL;

A TRUE HOMECOMING GAME FOR UCLA'S JOYCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cody Joyce wanted UCLA to reschedule the Miami
game, but for a different reason than his coaches and teammates.
Today's trip to South Florida is a homecoming for Joyce, a redshirt
freshman receiver who was raised in Clermont, Fla., before moving
to Newhall four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for me to see my buddies,'' Joyce said. ``My
dream was always to play for or against Miami. They were such a
powerhouse when I was growing up. I just wanted to be on the same
field with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Clermont is five hours from Miami, but Joyce was transfixed by
the Hurricanes' success and style. He had Miami posters on his
bedroom walls. He sketched Miami players on his school folders, and
he had a Hurricanes helmet on his keychain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lost to Alabama (in the 1993 Sugar Bowl), I thought
I was going to cry,'' he said. ``I liked the style of the
Hurricanes. They had pizzazz. They were ornery. It wasn't good
sportsmanship, but it was fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes recruited Joyce after he moved to Newhall and
enrolled at Hart High for his sophomore year, but he opted for UCLA
and has one catch for 6 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided this was the place I could win the national
championship,'' he said. ``And now we have a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Look-alikes: In its athletes and aggression, Miami's defense is
similar to USC's. The Hurricanes attack out of a standard alignment
and yield just 344 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their front is better (than USC's), the linebackers are a
push, but SC's secondary is better,'' UCLA offensive coordinator Al
Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has one senior starter on defense, but he's a good one:
end Derrick Ham, who has 12 sacks and will be matched against UCLA
All-American Kris Farris, who has not allowed a sack this season.
</P>
<P>
   BCS update: The Bowl Championship Series formula may change next
season, according to co-creator Charles Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fiddle with it in the offseason, maybe add another
computer poll or two, like The Sporting News,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if BCS executives are pleased with the developments, Bloom
said: ``We felt all long the two best teams would play in the
Fiesta Bowl. This is the best way to do it without a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   James Gang: Miami's junior tailback, Edgerrin James, is one of
the best the Bruins have faced this season. He's not in Ricky
Williams' class, but he's probably as good as Oregon's Reuben
Droughns and Arizona's Trung Canidate. James is averaging 111.7
yards per game. In the last five, he's gained 749 yards and scored
12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Receiver Jon Dubravac missed most of the week with
a strained right hamstring but said Thursday that he will play....
Cade McNown is one of three finalists for the Davey O'Brien Award,
given to the nation's top quarterback. The others: Kansas State's
Michael Bishop and Kentucky's Tim Couch.... Coach Bob Toledo was
named Region 5 Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Practice schedule: With dead week followed by finals week, the
Bruins will practice on Friday and Saturday only (Dec. 11-12 and
18-19). They'll also practice Dec. 21-23 before breaking for
Christmas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO _ This week Chile mounted its most concerted effort yet
to win the release of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, moved on from
London to Madrid, arguing in both places that extraditing the
ex-dictator from Britain to Spain to face charges of murder,
torture and genocide would threaten Chile's transition to democracy
and that, if he is to be tried, the best place is Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's chances of success looked slim. He received a polite
hearing in both countries, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   Some support for his mission came from the United States, which
strongly hinted that General Pinochet should be returned to Chile,
on the same grounds. But the American government also said it would
publish secret documents about human-rights abuses committed by the
Pinochet regime _ before backing away from that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing Insulza was the fact that his
arguments appeared to be based on false premises. Most Chileans do
not now believe their country's democracy is seriously threatened.
And the chances of General Pinochet being put on trial in Chile are
almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's arguments in Europe neatly reflected public opinion at
home. According to the first big poll on the issue carried out in
Chile since General Pinochet's arrest in London, almost two-thirds
of respondents believe that he did indeed commit crimes during his
17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly half, apparently disliking foreigners poking into
Chile's affairs, still disapprove of his arrest abroad, according
to the survey by MORI, a polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   The solution backed by six Chileans in ten: if he is freed to
return to Chile, put him on trial there.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounds fair, but how? Even Insulza was careful not to
make any specific promises to the British and Spanish. Since the
beginning of the year, a dozen or so cases against the general have
been filed in Chile, and the government is now thinking of adding
its own to the list. But, with good reason, human-rights lawyers
doubt that any of these cases will result in a real prosecution,
let alone a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, General Pinochet is a senator, enjoying
parliamentary immunity as long as he remains one _ and he is a
senator for life. He could be charged only if the Supreme Court
were to strip him of his immunity, which is most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The court has already dealt the government a blow by refusing to
appoint a member of its ranks to take over the Pinochet cases,
currently in the hands of an appeal-court magistrate. Without the
participation of a Supreme Court judge, the cases run the risk of
being transferred to a military tribunal, which would certainly
allow them to die.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a case eventually came to court, the general's own
amnesty law would probably prove an insurmountable obstacle. Still
on the statute books, the amnesty covers 1973 to 1978, the first
five and most violent years of General Pinochet's rule. No one has
ever been sentenced for crimes committed in Chile during this
period.
</P>
<P>
   The government could, of course, ask Congress to repeal the
amnesty. But it would be unlikely to succeed. Without the votes of
the right-wing opposition, which wants the amnesty to stay, any
hope of repeal would be doomed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   True, even without a trial General Pinochet could still be
questioned about the accusations against him. But as a former army
general, he would be entitled to be interrogated in the privacy of
his own home.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a small moral victory, human-rights lawyers are not
confident that much would be gained. In an earlier case in which
several army generals were questioned, they claimed, according to
the prosecution lawyer, not to remember even the most simple facts.
General Pinochet, at 83, could easily claim to suffer from the same
amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   A failed attempt to try or interrogate the general would dent
the government's credibility, abroad and at home. But it must be
seen to be making the case abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it is bracing itself for the reaction from right-wing
extremists if Britain's home secretary authorizes extradition
proceedings, a decision he must make by Dec. 11. Enter the politics
of Insulza's (and the American State Department's) argument.
</P>
<P>
   But here too the ground is shaky. If the decision goes against
General Pinochet, hardly anyone in Chile seriously expects the army
to launch another coup, even though the top brass, who served under
him for 25 years, are extremely upset about his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The era of military coups has passed; any attempt would have
neither public nor (as the general had in 1973) American support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government is worried by the reappearance of the
extreme right-wing Fatherland and Liberty group, which was active
in the early 1970s; and by death threats received by some
politicians of right, center and left alike.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians say that General Pinochet's supporters
are still restrained by the hope of getting him home soon. The mood
could change if Britain allows extradition hearings to proceed. And
an actual court appearance in Britain could incense the general's
admirers still more.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Yet when Britain's law lords ruled against the general
last week, there were fears of violence _ and little, in fact,
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   British flags were burned, roads were blocked by Pinochet
supporters and the British and Spanish embassies were the scene of
angry protests, but these incidents were small and isolated.
</P>
<P>
   And even many sympathetic to the general have calmed down since
the early days of the affair. For most Chileans, life continues
much as before.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this is that, according to the new poll, their
voting intentions for next year's presidential elections have
barely shifted since the arrest, leaving Ricardo Lagos, the
Socialist candidate, way out in front.
</P>
<P>
   He, for the record, has said he wants the general brought home,
to be followed by judicial reforms that would let him be tried. &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Oakland Raiders executive Bruce Allen thinks it's
a cop-out that his team blamed the officials for the 13-10 loss at
Baltimore last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Coach Jon) Gruden, `You say you prepare your team and
you weren't ready for them having 13 guys (players) on the field _
the dreaded 5-3-5,' '' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   At least he can laugh about it.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson felt like crying last Sunday
when two questionable calls in the final six seconds cost the Bills
a 25-21 game at New England. ``We got robbed,'' Wilson said. ``It
was awful. This was the worst. It was embarrassing to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials answered back Thursday by fining Wilson $50,000
for criticizing the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NFL can't fine the many fans who are in a frenzy over
the recent rash of bad calls. Everything from a coin flip to a
``Hail Mary'' pass has been botched.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL hasn't announced any fines for referee Phil Luckett
blowing the coin toss in overtime of the Pittsburgh-Detroit game on
Thanksgiving Day. But it did change the coin-toss policy, requiring
the call to be made before the coin is thrown into the air and
instructing the back judge and field judge to accompany the referee
to midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the how they fix the officiating problem,'' one Pro
Bowl player said. ``Only in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have been victimized as much as any team. Wide
receiver Rob Moore was involved both times, and in each case the
league wrote back that ``we're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Moore caught an apparent touchdown pass with 8:33
left, but after a conference, referee Larry Nemmers signaled that
Moore landed out of bounds and that the pass was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was beyond bad,'' Cardinals deep snapper Trey Junkin
said. ``It was ridiculous _ pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials knew they had blown the call before the
league announced ``we're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An official came to our sideline and told our doctors,
thinking they were coaches, `I don't know how that got overruled.
He was clearly in bounds,' '' a Cardinals assistant said.
</P>
<P>
   The many blown calls have some crying for the return of instant
replay. It has been out of the league since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill remains opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the game should be left on the field,'' he
said. ``In our game (in Kansas City), the official on the spot
called it a touchdown. He apparently was talked out of it.
Everybody makes mistakes _ players, coaches and officials. But the
tempo of the game should stay at its current pace and leave the
game on the field.'' &QL; 
Full-timers needed &QL; 
Others want the NFL to hire full-time officials.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Coach Bobby Ross is in favor of hiring 16-18 full-time
officials, and each referee would be responsible for preparing and
handling his crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they can't get anyone to do it, but that's baloney,''
Ross said. ``You have to pay them good money, but the league has
the money to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland owner Al Davis thinks the league should establish an
academy for officials where they would learn fitness and training.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are those who want the current crop of officials to
be fined, dumped or tar and feathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they throw the flag, sometimes they don't,'' Raiders
wide receiver Tim Brown said. ``I don't think there's anything the
league can do besides fining these guys and making them responsible
when they miss plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tim Brown is constantly doing the wrong thing, then sooner
or later Tim Brown is not going to have a job. If they don't take
that attitude with officials, it's going to keep going downhill.'' &QL; 
League tap dance &QL; 
NFL executives maintain that criticism of officiating happens every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like ``Groundhog Day'','' league spokesman Greg Aiello
said. ``It's very predictable. During a season, there will be
controversial calls, and everyone focuses on it for the week. This
is that week.''
</P>
<P>
   What a week it has been. It started in the Thanksgiving game
when Lions defensive back Robert Bailey recovered a fumble and
intercepted a pass but wasn't given either call by Luckett's crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like every time you look up at the replay on the
scoreboard, you were disappointed again,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in overtime, Luckett thought he heard one of the Steelers'
captains say, ``heads-tails'' before the coin flip. Television
replays showed that running back Jerome Bettis called ``tails,''
meaning the Steelers should have been given the ball. Instead, it
went to the Lions, who scored on their first possession to win. &QL; 
Bunglers were busy &QL; 
Before last Sunday had ended, the officials had botched the Moore
touchdown and cost the Bills a game. First, they allowed Patriots
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson to make a fourth-down catch out of
bounds with six seconds left. The grab kept the Patriots' winning
drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday), they can't hear the coin toss; this week they
can't see the guy out of bounds,'' Bills defensive end Marcellus
Wiley said. ``They're losing all their senses. What's next, they
won't be able to feel someone run into them?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson then predicted the officials would call pass interference
on the Bills when Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe threw into the
end zone on a ``Hail Mary'' play. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Bills safety Henry Jones was called for going over the back of
wide receiver Terry Glenn's chest, giving the Patriots a first down
at the 1. They scored the winner on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could call the stock market that well,'' Wilson
said. &QL; 
He's been there &QL; 
Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said he could feel
for the Bills coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gut-wrenching,'' he said. ``What if you went through what
the Pittsburgh Steelers went through with the coin toss? It's too
hard to win in this league, anyway. It gives you a helpless,
helpless, helpless feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGinnis' boss, Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, said he just
wants consistency on the calls, particularly on pass interference,
where every officiating crew seems to interpret it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a penalty called on a `Hail Mary' play before,
but if a penalty is made, it should be called _ whether it's on the
first play or the last play,'' Tobin said. ``If you can't have a
penalty on a `Hail Mary' play, you should tackle the receiver and
not let him off the line of scrimmage.'' &QL; 
Enough with the grades &QL; 
Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney blames NFL administrators for the
officiating problems. He said they have caused officials to be more
concerned about their grades than making the right calls,
``bureaucratic stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gun-shy now. If they make some little mistake and they
don't call something, they're going to be graded down,'' Rooney
said. ``You're considered a good official or bad official on the
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they work at taking judgment away from the officials,
and I think the officials should have judgment for what they're
doing.'' &QL; 
Accountability, please &QL; 
Tim Brown said they need to be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says, there's no way those guys in
striped shirts should be a reason a team wins or loses,'' he said.
``It's happening too much in the league _ two or three times with
us and God knows how many other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the officials) are doing it on purpose so they can
get full-time jobs. Otherwise, they have to make some serious
changes in the off-season.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO _ This week Chile mounted its most concerted effort yet
to win the release of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, moved on from
London to Madrid, arguing in both places that extraditing the
ex-dictator from Britain to Spain to face charges of murder,
torture and genocide would threaten Chile's transition to democracy
and that, if he is to be tried, the best place is Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's chances of success looked slim. He received a polite
hearing in both countries, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   Some support for his mission came from the United States, which
strongly hinted that General Pinochet should be returned to Chile,
on the same grounds. But the American government also said it would
publish secret documents about human-rights abuses committed by the
Pinochet regime _ before backing away from that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing Insulza was the fact that his
arguments appeared to be based on false premises. Most Chileans do
not now believe their country's democracy is seriously threatened.
And the chances of General Pinochet being put on trial in Chile are
almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza's arguments in Europe neatly reflected public opinion at
home. According to the first big poll on the issue carried out in
Chile since General Pinochet's arrest in London, almost two-thirds
of respondents believe that he did indeed commit crimes during his
17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly half, apparently disliking foreigners poking into
Chile's affairs, still disapprove of his arrest abroad, according
to the survey by MORI, a polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   The solution backed by six Chileans in ten: if he is freed to
return to Chile, put him on trial there.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounds fair, but how? Even Insulza was careful not to
make any specific promises to the British and Spanish. Since the
beginning of the year, a dozen or so cases against the general have
been filed in Chile, and the government is now thinking of adding
its own to the list. But, with good reason, human-rights lawyers
doubt that any of these cases will result in a real prosecution,
let alone a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, General Pinochet is a senator, enjoying
parliamentary immunity as long as he remains one _ and he is a
senator for life. He could be charged only if the Supreme Court
were to strip him of his immunity, which is most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The court has already dealt the government a blow by refusing to
appoint a member of its ranks to take over the Pinochet cases,
currently in the hands of an appeal-court magistrate. Without the
participation of a Supreme Court judge, the cases run the risk of
being transferred to a military tribunal, which would certainly
allow them to die.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a case eventually came to court, the general's own
amnesty law would probably prove an insurmountable obstacle. Still
on the statute books, the amnesty covers 1973 to 1978, the first
five and most violent years of General Pinochet's rule. No one has
ever been sentenced for crimes committed in Chile during this
period.
</P>
<P>
   The government could, of course, ask Congress to repeal the
amnesty. But it would be unlikely to succeed. Without the votes of
the right-wing opposition, which wants the amnesty to stay, any
hope of repeal would be doomed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   True, even without a trial General Pinochet could still be
questioned about the accusations against him. But as a former army
general, he would be entitled to be interrogated in the privacy of
his own home.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a small moral victory, human-rights lawyers are not
confident that much would be gained. In an earlier case in which
several army generals were questioned, they claimed, according to
the prosecution lawyer, not to remember even the most simple facts.
General Pinochet, at 83, could easily claim to suffer from the same
amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   A failed attempt to try or interrogate the general would dent
the government's credibility, abroad and at home. But it must be
seen to be making the case abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it is bracing itself for the reaction from right-wing
extremists if Britain's home secretary authorizes extradition
proceedings, a decision he must make by Dec. 11. Enter the politics
of Insulza's (and the American State Department's) argument.
</P>
<P>
   But here too the ground is shaky. If the decision goes against
General Pinochet, hardly anyone in Chile seriously expects the army
to launch another coup, even though the top brass, who served under
him for 25 years, are extremely upset about his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The era of military coups has passed; any attempt would have
neither public nor (as the general had in 1973) American support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government is worried by the reappearance of the
extreme right-wing Fatherland and Liberty group, which was active
in the early 1970s; and by death threats received by some
politicians of right, center and left alike.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians say that General Pinochet's supporters
are still restrained by the hope of getting him home soon. The mood
could change if Britain allows extradition hearings to proceed. And
an actual court appearance in Britain could incense the general's
admirers still more.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Yet when Britain's law lords ruled against the general
last week, there were fears of violence _ and little, in fact,
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   British flags were burned, roads were blocked by Pinochet
supporters and the British and Spanish embassies were the scene of
angry protests, but these incidents were small and isolated.
</P>
<P>
   And even many sympathetic to the general have calmed down since
the early days of the affair. For most Chileans, life continues
much as before.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this is that, according to the new poll, their
voting intentions for next year's presidential elections have
barely shifted since the arrest, leaving Ricardo Lagos, the
Socialist candidate, way out in front.
</P>
<P>
   He, for the record, has said he wants the general brought home,
to be followed by judicial reforms that would let him be tried. &QL;

SWANN SAGA SHOWS NFL'S SEEDY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Inside Eric Swann's knee is a lot of bone, very
little cartilage and a big, fat excuse.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cardinals, a convenient reason to gripe and moan.
</P>
<P>
   A convenient reason to lose.
</P>
<P>
   They can do us all a favor. They can stand behind one of their
best players, trust in his decision, see the future as well as a
tenuous present. They can look in the mirror and find a way without
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they allow Swann to drift alone in the winds of
conjecture and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It is times like this when you are afforded a window into the
brutal realities of the NFL. How medical opinions can be skewed to
short-term benefits. How coaches are blinded by the immediacy of
their jobs. How legs and limbs matter only if they're available for
the next game. How useless you are if they're not.
</P>
<P>
   So before you question Swann's heart, examine your own.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, they have operated on his knees. Twice on his left,
four times on his right. And here he is, 28 years old, crawling
from game to game, prodded by the coaching staff to suck it up for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   And here is one of the most respected orthopedists in the nation
telling Swann that his career might be over if he listens to his
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Who are you going to believe? And who's looking out for the good
of whom?
</P>
<P>
   If Swann tried to play this season, he might blow out his knee
for good. Even if he did return, the Cardinals are not going to the
Super Bowl in 1999. But if this surgery works, they might get there
in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   It always gets back to vision.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to pain tolerance, Swann is no warrior.
Not a member of the wrap-it-up, tape-it-up, shoot-it-up fraternity.
He doesn't have unconditional acceptance because he's never fought
through an injury. He doesn't help himself by hiding out, talking
through agents.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a long jump from there to the damning perception that
Swann is taking the selfish and cowardly route to next season
because that's who he is.
</P>
<P>
   If this were anybody else, the team would be signing get-well
cards. But this is Eric Swann, and his reputation is clouding
everything. A reputation the Cardinals are doing their best to
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving, they released a statement saying Swann was
considering ``elective'' surgery and had ``solicited'' a second
opinion. Implicitly, they were indicting their own player.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Cardinals are upset because Swann broke
protocol. He flew on his own to Colorado, listened to Dr. Richard
Steadman, then phoned in his decision. He denied the request for a
third opinion.
</P>
<P>
   They are upset because Swann had the gall to question Simeon
Rice's work ethic in training camp. Upset because he's making so
much money, more than the combined salaries of eight defensive
starters. Upset because he doesn't have to practice and, with all
these concessions, he still won't keep the door open on a possible
return this season.
</P>
<P>
   They are also embarrassed because Steadman's diagnosis makes
their doctors look insensitive and short-sighted. On Thursday, in a
session of spin control, Dr. Russell Chick finally spoke. He
claimed the team's procedure on Oct. 28 is nearly identical to
Steadman's course of action, a claim Steadman disputed. Chick added
that Swann wasn't cleared to play anyway, and wasn't going to be
until after this week's game against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Swann should trust their procedure, that the
pain might alleviate soon and he might be able to help the
Cardinals in their push for the playoffs. In a year that will
determine the future of the head coach, some of his staff and a
stadium that exists on blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he's not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, it
doesn't take much to spot motive. And if I'm Swann, I'm off to see
an independent specialist, too.
</P>
<P>
   And if I'm Swann, I'm wondering about loyalty, back-stabbers and
an organization that should be building a future, not risking it
all for the benefit of now. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
RADIO VOICE SEES COYOTES' POTENTIAL  
 KEILBACK'S BEEN THERE SINCE '79 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ After 20 years behind the mike with the same
team, Curt Keilback has seen a lot of hockey as the play-by-play
voice of the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes. And a lot of ``bad''
hockey at that.
</P>
<P>
   He's been with the organization as long as anyone, since the day
the franchise first joined the NHL in 1979. Along the way, after
broadcasting some 1,600 games, there were very few shining seasons
to remember.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Desert Dogs from Phoenix are making Keilback
forget about the dog days in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all that time, the two teams that stand out in my mind are
this one right here, and the 1984-85 team,'' Keilback said. ``But
they were as different as night and day from this team. This team
wins games, 2-1. Those guys won games, 6-5.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet both teams share similar traits 14 years removed from
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984-85 Winnipeg Jets won a club-record nine straight games.
The 1998-99 Coyotes had won eight in a row before losing a wild one
in Edmonton on Wednesday, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also had a 13-game unbeaten streak in which they went
10-0-3 and finished with a club-record 96 points for second place
in the old Smythe Division. This season, the Coyotes did them one
better, going 14 straight games (12-0-2) without a loss until
running into the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '85 Jets team actually went 15 games unbeaten,'' said
Keilback, whose father, Jim, was the broadcast voice of the
Roadrunners during their days in the Western and Central hockey
leagues. ``It was the last 13 games of the season, and then they
won the first two games of the playoffs against Calgary.''
</P>
<P>
   After dispatching the Flames, who just happen to be the Coyotes'
next opponent Saturday night in Calgary, the Jets got swept in four
games by Edmonton in the second round of the playoffs. The
franchise has only made it out of the first round one time since,
in 1987, when the Oilers knocked the Jets out again, this time in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '85 club had a chance, but the Oilers were in their heyday
with (Wayne) Gretzky and all those guys and were just too
dominating to beat,'' Keilback said. ``The Jets had plenty of
offense, though. They had six guys on that team who scored 30
goals, including their third-line center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what really hurt them was Dale Hawerchuk went down with
broken ribs in the third game of the playoffs against Calgary and
that just killed them.''
</P>
<P>
   The six players and their goal totals: Hawerchuk (53), Paul
MacLean (41), Laurie Boschman (32), Brian Mullen (32), Doug Smail
(31) and Thomas Steen (30). They were one of only three teams to
ever accomplish the feat, and so far, they've been the last to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is fun to watch for different reasons,'' Keilback
said, ``but that Jets team played just a wide open, let-'em-go
style and that was exciting hockey. Barry Long, the coach of the
team, that was his philosophy. He used to always say, `Hockey's
supposed to be entertaining. It's not supposed to be dull and
boring.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Coyotes team has practiced and preached defense
first, and they've played it almost to perfection. In 17 out of 19
games, the Coyotes have not allowed an opponent to score more than
two goals. On Wednesday in Edmonton, the club gave up four goals,
but it limited the Oilers to only 22 shots on goal and only nine
legitimate scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Coyotes borrowed a page from the 1984-85
Jets, playing some fast-break hockey of their own by peppering the
Oilers with a season-high 48 shots. The fans got their money's
worth, according to both head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone left this building and wasn't thoroughly
entertained, I'm not sure you're a hockey fan,'' Oilers Coach Ron
Low said. ``I don't know if there's enough entertainment in the
game. A lot of people walk away a lot of nights feeling cheated out
of the money they paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk, however, couldn't care less if a
game appears dull and boring _ as long as his team keeps playing
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (Low) and a lot of people like to see it wide open,
but I don't like that,'' Tkachuk said. ``If we're going to be
successful, we can't play a wide-open game. We've done that over
the years and look at the results we've gotten out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring, of course, to the dog days in Winnipeg, the
times Keilback remembers well but would just as soon love to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a feeling about this team, though,'' Keilback said.
``It's early, but this is definitely one of the best teams I've
seen play.'' &QL;

DEATH ROW ESCAPEE IS FOUND DEAD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two off-duty corrections officers fishing at a bridge
on a creek leading to the Trinity River late Thursday afternoon
came across the body of Martin Gurule, the convicted murderer who
had been the target of a statewide manhunt since Friday, when he
became the first inmate to escape from death row in Texas since
1934.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's body, still clad in prison-issue clothes and shoes, was
found at 5:30 p.m. caught in the current outside the town of
Riverside, about a mile from the Texas prison system's Ellis Unit.
The maximum security facility, surrounded by farms, dense piney
woods and the Trinity River, is 15 miles northeast of Huntsville
and is home to the largest population of condemned inmates in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   It took prison officials only a short time to confirm what
seemed obvious, that the body, which the authorities said had been
in the water for a while, was indeed that of the 29-year-old Corpus
Christi man. Gurule was sentenced to death in the 1992 murder of a
restaurant owner and a cook during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said of Gurule, ``We do not have a cause of death but we
suspect drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the body was found with cardboard wrapped around
the chest, which the authorities believed was used to help Gurule
get across the razor wire in his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was one of seven inmates who plotted to escape from the
largest death row in the nation by cutting through a fence
surrounding a prison recreation yard and moving onto a nearby roof.
At 12:20 a.m. Friday, the men dropped to the ground and began to
move toward the two perimeter fences surrounding the Ellis Unit
when officers in two guard towers 200 feet away opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   All but Gurule surrendered. Grule made it over the two 10-foot
fences, topped with razor wire, and into the woods that flank the
facility on three sides.
</P>
<P>
   Police dogs later lost his scent down a nearby road and the
authorities began a six-day manhunt that included guards posted
along all roads near the prison, boat patrols on the Trinity River
and teams of officers on horseback and officers with dogs picking
through the woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend one dog team found the two-inch piece of
hacksaw blade that Gurule and the others apparently used to cut
their way through the fence. But before the discovery of the body
on Thursday, there was no sign of what had become of the escaped
inmate, which led to growing speculation that he had slipped past
the officers and out of the rough woods surrounding the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The long manhunt transformed Gurule, before his escape a
little-known inmate on Texas' death row, into a nationally known
fugitive, and there were many reported sightings of him throughout
the state. What might have happened to him became a hot topic of
conversation. There was speculation that he was still hiding in the
woods or that he had made it past the police lines and forced his
way into a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   All the time, though, prison spokesmen said they remained
convinced that Gurule was still somewhere in the woods, largely
because they had no hard evidence that he was not and because the
vast majority of escapees are caught before getting more than a few
miles from prison.
</P>
<P>
   As tension mounted and pressure built on officials to explain
what had happened and where Gurule had gone, Allan Polunsky, the
chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, said prison
officials intended to bring Gurule back ``dead or alive, and it
really doesn't make any difference in my opinion which it will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials changed their tactics, easing up on the
dog and horse patrols into the woods, hoping to make Gurule believe
that the pressure was easing and it was safe for him to move.
Still, there was no sign of him.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier on Thursday, as the manhunt moved into its sixth
morning, prison officials announced a reward for information
leading to Gurule's capture.

DOCTOR DEFENDS SWANN'S TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Chick, the Cardinals orthopedic surgeon, broke his
silence about the knee problems of tackle Eric Swann on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And Chick said the procedure he performed on Swann's arthritic
right knee in October is essentially the same thing that Dr.
Richard Steadman is scheduled to do Monday in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But Steadman said that Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, was truthful
when he said that Steadman had told Swann he had ``very little
choice'' but to have the second procedure, and that playing this
season on the knee as it is could cause further injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd say that's accurate,'' said Steadman, who maintains
his method is different.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the controversy is whether Swann, who already
has had six knee operations, could play again this season without
further surgery, or whether he would be risking his future by
trying help the Cardinals in their playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensitive topic for both sides, and Steadman said there
is ``no right or wrong in this.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect both definitely agree upon is that the 28-year-old
Swann has a bad problem, degeneration of the cartilage in both
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Swann is tentatively scheduled to undergo a full microfracture
procedure by Steadman, and then undergo six to seven months of
rehabilitation. The Cardinals had hoped that, with Chick's
procedure, Swann might play this season.
</P>
<P>
   The team initially announced that Chick''s Oct. 28 procedure was
an ``arthroscopic flush'' of Swann's right knee. Chick revealed for
the first time Thursday that he also did a ``microfracture''
procedure, in which holes are drilled in the bone near the area of
the defect.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said he and Steadman are in agreement on the treatment,
but disagree on whether the six-week interval between the last
procedure and the next is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what Dr. Steadman told (Swann), his recommendation
was to continue his rehabilitation and if he didn't improve, and
continued to have problems, that he might consider having the same
procedure done over again using a little different technical spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that he would protect him on crutches for nine to 10
weeks. Same procedure, exactly the same procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadman confirmed that he told Swann to continue his
rehabilitation until the end of the six weeks. But he said it is
his experience that if progress hasn't occurred after four weeks,
it won't. Steadman said his method provides the possibility of
long-term relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different procedure,'' he said. ``The same concept, but
a different procedure. It's a long shot to believe the procedure in
October is going to make a cartilage cap on the bone with the
rehabilitation done the way it was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interpretation is, when Dr. Chick operated about five weeks
ago, he was just trying to do as much as possible to decrease the
pain and actually let (Swann) continue playing through the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing so, he made some holes in the caps of the bone in a
way that allows the bone marrow to come out of the bone and it also
decompresses the bone. A lot of times the pain comes from increased
bruising in that area of the bone where cartilage is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadman said that when he examined Swann, the Cardinals tackle
could not get into a correct stance and push off without pain. He
told Swann to continue his rehabilitation for two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dr. Chick did was try to make it work out for the
season,'' said Steadman, who was asked if Swann could continue to
play with the knee as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of negatives about doing that,'' he said.
``One is, at least when I saw him, he couldn't really do anything
physically with the knee bent more than about 35 or 40 degrees. If
his position could be played with his legs almost straight, then he
could do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't really push off, he can't come from that position
with power and be competitive. That's one factor. The second factor
(is) the bone that doesn't have any cartilage cap on it. If it's
successful, what Dr. Chick did, the blood comes out and it feels
fine; but I think there's a potential for weakening that area with
the drilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadman said there could be a risk of bone fractures in the
area that was drilled. And he said his procedure offers a 70
percent chance of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   However, some members of the orthopedic community dispute
Steadman's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Carter, who is the orthopedic surgeon for Arizona State
and has done extensive research on the subject, said a study done
in Europe failed to support Steadman's data. Carter said the
``fibro-cartilage'' that is created by the microfracture procedure
is not as durable as normal cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, there are no miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are looking for someone to give them the same knee
their parents game them,'' Carter said. ``We can't do that. There
are no magic cures.'' &QL;

   Big oil is dead: long live Enormous Oil.
</P>
<P>
   This week, three months after BP agreed to buy Amoco for $48
billion, Exxon and Mobil, America's biggest oil firms, announced a
$77 billion merger that will make Exxon-Mobil the world's biggest
oil firm _ and, on some measures, the largest firm altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities could still block the deal, but most
analysts think this is unlikely: with minor exceptions, the merged
firm will not dominate any significant segments of the retail
market in America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger is already starting to transform the world's
oil industry. It has lit a fire under oilmen. Firms that were once
considered big, such as Chevron and Texaco, are rushing to find
partners.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even in Europe, where national champions have
traditionally resisted pressures to merge: this week France's Total
announced that it was buying Belgium's Petrofina for some $13
billion. Everybody in the business expects more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it happening now? Part of the answer lies in the dramatic
collapse of oil prices over the past year, thanks in part to the
Asian crisis. This is squeezing margins and pushing firms to slash
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, prices are at their lowest for 25 years. More
important, the industry has given up hope that prices might rebound
soon. The last chance of a quick fix was dashed recently when OPEC,
which once had a stranglehold on supply, failed to agree on
production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That news, though hardly a surprise, pushed oil-futures
contracts on exchanges in both London and New York to record lows
of around $10 a barrel, for it showed conclusively that producers
no longer have any control over prices.
</P>
<P>
   This has sharpened the focus of oilmen, who are famously
defensive of their fiefs and have long resisted consolidation in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because most big oil companies have spent much of this decade
slashing costs, they are already fairly lean. Now the only way to
make further cost savings may be through big mergers, followed by
ruthless restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, reckons Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, an
investment bank, is the fact that the net income per employee of
the biggest oil firms _ Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon, before its
merger _ is nearly 50 percent higher than it is at smaller
companies, such as Texaco, Phillips and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is looking for savings of $2.8 billion within a few years
from its merger with Mobil; some analysts say it could save more
than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the biggest source of merger fever is not the low oil
price, although that has made things more urgent. The real reason
is that oil shares have performed worse than any other group of
industrial shares over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   While information technology has rewarded investors handsomely,
oil firms have consistently destroyed shareholder value _ that is,
their returns on capital employed have been lower than the cost of
that capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley, institutional
investors, who hold perhaps three-quarters of the shares in listed
oil companies, have started to respond by shifting their money into
other businesses. They will do so ever faster unless oil companies
start offering higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they would have pushed ahead with their
mergers if the oil price were, say, $20 a barrel, the bosses of
both Exxon and BP emphatically say yes _ not just in order to cut
costs, but to improve returns in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to improve returns on capital nowadays is to expand
outside the mature markets in North America and Europe, where
competition is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Those oil companies, Shell and Exxon among them, which have a
strong international presence have clearly outperformed those with
a mainly domestic focus. While there will always be a role for
scrappy entrepreneurs in the oil business, size is becoming
increasingly important.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a great deal of capital _ and a matching appetite for
risk - to succeed in such dodgy places as the Caspian or West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling a $6 billion oil project in China, for example, as both
Shell and Exxon are doing, will be a huge effort for Texaco, even
with its revenues of some $50 billion _ but small potatoes for
Exxon-Mobil, which will be four times that size.
</P>
<P>
   Another force behind the merger mania may be a perverse result
of weak oil-share prices: it is now cheaper to buy oil reserves on
Wall Street than by drilling your own well. This curious situation
has prompted all sorts of takeover artists to buzz around the oil
industry, looking for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks Muse, one such firm, recently bought America's Triton _
and got its reserves for about $3 a barrel. YPF, a privatized
Argentine oil giant, has gobbled up Canada's Bitech, and paid less
than a dollar a barrel for its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, points out Edward Morse of the Energy
Intelligence Group, an industry publishing firm, the cost of
getting oil from new wells remains stubbornly high, at $5-6 a
barrel or more.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that oil companies are finally giving up the
illusion that technology will help to make oil in such places as
the Caspian, the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea as cheap as in the
Arabian Gulf _ home to three-quarters of the world's reserves _
where it costs $2 a barrel or even less to extract.
</P>
<P>
   All of this points to a rude awakening for oilmen, who have long
operated as though market forces did not really apply to their
business. Even now, some old hands think they may not, or at least
not fully. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Jungels, chief executive of Enterprise Oil, an
exploration firm based in London, complains that financial analysts
misunderstand oil companies; he insists that valuations such as
return on capital employed are misleading, given the long-term
investments that firms such as his need to make to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Euan Baird, chairman of Schlumberger, the most successful
oil-services firm, insists that ``there is no big structural change
here _ this is just the typical oil-industry overreaction to the
bottom of the price cycle.'' He says he has seen such worries
surface every time the oil price hits bottom _ and dissipate once
more when it rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is right. Perhaps all the talk of market forces,
efficiency gains and higher returns will go away if the oil price
recovers _ though, it should be said, there is little hint of that
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps political instability, a perennial wild card, will
resurface and skew the economics of the industry once again. Bill
Richardson, America's energy secretary, says he wants to build up
America's ``strategic petroleum reserve'' now, when oil is cheap,
as a hedge against a future oil shock. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the changes unleashed by the mergers look
unstoppable. There was a shadow hanging over Texaco's annual
meeting with financial analysts, held the day after the Total and
Exxon deals were confirmed. The firm's boss confided that he was
completely surprised by the mergers, though publicly he said that
Texaco had been thinking of doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now a dozen other chief executives are scrabbling about looking
for appropriate suitors. After all, Exxon and BP, two of the
sharpest as well as biggest firms in the oil game, have shown the
way. The rest of the industry has little choice but to follow. &QL;

   Tackling a $6 billion oil project in China, for example, as both
Shell and Exxon are doing, will be a huge effort for Texaco, even
with its revenues of some $50 billion _ but small potatoes for
Exxon-Mobil, which will be four times that size.
</P>
<P>
   Another force behind the merger mania may be a perverse result
of weak oil-share prices: it is now cheaper to buy oil reserves on
Wall Street than by drilling your own well. This curious situation
has prompted all sorts of takeover artists to buzz around the oil
industry, looking for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks Muse, one such firm, recently bought America's Triton _
and got its reserves for about $3 a barrel. YPF, a privatized
Argentine oil giant, has gobbled up Canada's Bitech, and paid less
than a dollar a barrel for its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, points out Edward Morse of the Energy
Intelligence Group, an industry publishing firm, the cost of
getting oil from new wells remains stubbornly high, at $5-6 a
barrel or more.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that oil companies are finally giving up the
illusion that technology will help to make oil in such places as
the Caspian, the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea as cheap as in the
Arabian Gulf _ home to three-quarters of the world's reserves _
where it costs $2 a barrel or even less to extract.
</P>
<P>
   All of this points to a rude awakening for oilmen, who have long
operated as though market forces did not really apply to their
business. Even now, some old hands think they may not, or at least
not fully. &QL;

exploration firm based in London, complains that financial analysts
misunderstand oil companies; he insists that valuations such as
return on capital employed are misleading, given the long-term

</P>
<P>
   Euan Baird, chairman of Schlumberger, the most successful
oil-services firm, insists that ``there is no big structural change
here _ this is just the typical oil-industry overreaction to the

</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is right. Perhaps all the talk of market forces,
efficiency gains and higher returns will go away if the oil price
recovers _ though, it should be said, there is little hint of that
happening.

<P>
   Or perhaps political instability, a perennial wild card, will

<P>
   Big oil is dead: long live Enormous Oil.
</P>
<P>
   This week, three months after BP agreed to buy Amoco for $48
billion, Exxon and Mobil, America's biggest oil firms, announced a
$77 billion merger that will make Exxon-Mobil the world's biggest
oil firm _ and, on some measures, the largest firm altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities could still block the deal, but most
analysts think this is unlikely: with minor exceptions, the merged
firm will not dominate any significant segments of the retail
market in America or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger is already starting to transform the world's
oil industry. It has lit a fire under oilmen. Firms that were once
considered big, such as Chevron and Texaco, are rushing to find
partners.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even in Europe, where national champions have
traditionally resisted pressures to merge: this week France's Total
announced that it was buying Belgium's Petrofina for some $13
billion. Everybody in the business expects more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it happening now? Part of the answer lies in the dramatic
collapse of oil prices over the past year, thanks in part to the
Asian crisis. This is squeezing margins and pushing firms to slash
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, prices are at their lowest for 25 years. More
important, the industry has given up hope that prices might rebound
soon. The last chance of a quick fix was dashed recently when OPEC,
which once had a stranglehold on supply, failed to agree on
production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That news, though hardly a surprise, pushed oil-futures
contracts on exchanges in both London and New York to record lows
of around $10 a barrel, for it showed conclusively that producers
no longer have any control over prices.
</P>
<P>
   This has sharpened the focus of oilmen, who are famously
defensive of their fiefs and have long resisted consolidation in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because most big oil companies have spent much of this decade
slashing costs, they are already fairly lean. Now the only way to
make further cost savings may be through big mergers, followed by
ruthless restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting this view, reckons Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, an
investment bank, is the fact that the net income per employee of
the biggest oil firms _ Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon, before its
merger _ is nearly 50 percent higher than it is at smaller
companies, such as Texaco, Phillips and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is looking for savings of $2.8 billion within a few years
from its merger with Mobil; some analysts say it could save more
than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the biggest source of merger fever is not the low oil
price, although that has made things more urgent. The real reason
is that oil shares have performed worse than any other group of
industrial shares over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   While information technology has rewarded investors handsomely,
oil firms have consistently destroyed shareholder value _ that is,
their returns on capital employed have been lower than the cost of
that capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Terreson of Morgan Stanley, institutional
investors, who hold perhaps three-quarters of the shares in listed
oil companies, have started to respond by shifting their money into
other businesses. They will do so ever faster unless oil companies
start offering higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they would have pushed ahead with their
mergers if the oil price were, say, $20 a barrel, the bosses of
both Exxon and BP emphatically say yes _ not just in order to cut
costs, but to improve returns in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to improve returns on capital nowadays is to expand
outside the mature markets in North America and Europe, where
competition is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Those oil companies, Shell and Exxon among them, which have a
strong international presence have clearly outperformed those with
a mainly domestic focus. While there will always be a role for
scrappy entrepreneurs in the oil business, size is becoming
increasingly important.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a great deal of capital _ and a matching appetite for
risk - to succeed in such dodgy places as the Caspian or West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling a $6 billion oil project in China, for example, as both
Shell and Exxon are doing, will be a huge effort for Texaco, even
with its revenues of some $50 billion _ but small potatoes for
Exxon-Mobil, which will be four times that size.
</P>
<P>
   Another force behind the merger mania may be a perverse result

DID NOT ABUSE LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout0 JUDGE FINDS STARR'S AIDES(sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's prosecutors did not forbid Monica
Lewinsky to call her lawyer when they first confronted her at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Jan. 16, and in fact gave her several
opportunities to call anyone she chose, a federal district judge
concluded in a finding unsealed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to that finding, issued last April but kept sealed
until now, President Clinton's lawyers and House Democrats have
argued that prosecutors mistreated Ms. Lewinsky by repeatedly
refusing her the opportunity to call her lawyer, Francis Carter.
They maintain that the incident illustrates Starr's
overzealousness, perhaps even misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, part of a ream of
documents ordered released this week by a federal appeals court,
sheds further light on the controversial episode at the
Ritz-Carlton, which occurred five days before the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal became public.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's prosecutors approached Ms. Lewinsky
there to try to win her cooperation in an investigation of whether
Clinton or others had lied under oath to cover up his affair with
her.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Judge Johnson expressed concerns that
prosecutors' talks with Ms. Lewinsky about a possible immunity deal
had occurred outside the presence of her lawyer, but she said she
would take no action. She said lawyers and agents from Starr's
office had not barred Ms. Lewinsky from calling her lawyer and had
``acted within the ethical rules in questioning Ms. Lewinsky
without her attorney present.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued under seal on April 28, this week drew the
interest of Clinton's legal team, which is preparing to present its
defense against impeachment of the president next week to the House
Judiciary Committee. On Wednesday, White House lawyers demanded
that the Judiciary panel permit them to examine all decisions
``addressing the question of whether Ms. Lewinsky was denied access
to her counsel, Mr. Frank Carter, on Jan. 16.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said lawyers had not
reviewed the newly unsealed documents and would have no comment on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles G. Bakaly III, said: ``This is an
example where our prosecutors did not discuss rulings that would
have helped us to respond to attacks against the office. We were
prohibited from discussing it because it was under seal, and we
adhered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson based on her determination on affidavits filed by
Carter and Ms. Lewinsky, as well as those of prosecutors and agents
who were at the Ritz-Carlton that day.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of immunity discussions, the judge did note that
prosecutors began talks with Ms. Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton
meeting without obtaining her lawyer's permission, in violation of
Justice Department regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court expresses its concern,'' Judge Johnson wrote, ``that
the Office of Independent Counsel may have acted improperly in
conducting immunity negotiations without the presence of her
counsel but declines to take further action on this particular
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ruling was upheld by an appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, Ms. Lewinsky's spokeswoman, also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr testified before the Judiciary Committee two weeks
ago, Abbe Lowell, counsel for the committee's Democrats, suggested
that prosecutors and agents had held Ms. Lewinsky against her will
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Lewinsky's own account, one prosecutor at the hotel told
her that she could go to prison for 27 years if she was convicted
of perjury, and, when she said she wanted to call her mother to
seek advice, Jackie Bennett, Starr's deputy, told her: ``You're 24.
You're smart. You're old enough. You don't need to call your
mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned before the Judiciary Committee, Starr testified
that Ms. Lewinsky had been free to leave the hotel at any time and
had never been threatened or otherwise mistreated. He also said she
had been given several opportunities to call anyone she chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her perception was incorrect,'' Starr said. ``We made
it clear to the witness that she was, in fact, free to leave. And
the Ritz-Carlton, shall I say, is a fairly comfortable and
commodious place.''
</P>
<P>
   At no point in his testimony did Starr mention the rulings that
had exonerated his office.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation of mistreatment was first raised by Ms. Lewinsky
and Carter last winter. Ms. Lewinsky had hired Carter to help her
draft an affidavit in the Paula Jones case in which she denied
having had a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was filed on Jan. 16, several hours after Ms.
Lewinsky had been approached by Starr's prosecutors and agents at
the Ritz-Carlton, in suburban Virginia near the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Johnson that resulted from the
Lewinsky-Carter accusations was sealed until now because some of it
related to grand jury testimony. It was unsealed by court order
this week because that testimony has since become public knowledge,
largely through Starr's impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the judge's ruling, statements by two lawyers and
three agents from Starr's office were released on Thursday, and
they portray in detail the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky at the
hotel. Their accounts contrast sharply with Ms. Lewinsky's
recollection that prosecutors refused her repeated attempts to call
her lawyer and tried to bully her into agreeing to cooperate with
their inquiry.

 &HT;    Good boy Gill brings his charm, sincerity to music
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Vince Gill, a six-time winner of the Grammy Award
for best male country vocal performance, didn't have a great deal
of formal musical training as a child, but what he got apparently
had substantial effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some violin lessons,'' he said recently from his home
in Nashville, Tenn. But they didn't last long. ``I can't read
music. But I can kind of see where things are, and I know the
rudimentary stuff, like `Every Good Boy Does Fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An often-used mnemonic device to remember note names E, G, B, D
and F on the musical staff, the phrase seems to have sunk into
Gill's psyche on a deeper, more essential level.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Oklahoma, the singer-songwriter-instrumentalist is
generally thought of as an all-around nice guy, not only by fans
who respond to his seemingly open, ``oh, shucks'' demeanor, but
also by colleagues who appreciate his apparent willingness to share
the spotlight with fellow musicians.
</P>
<P>
   And as a good boy of note, Gill _ who's bringing his new
Christmas show to Wright State University tonight _ has done very
fine indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned to play by ear, and seemingly able to play any
hand-held string instrument put in front of him, Gill is a bona
fide country star _ down home enough to tap into the hearts and
minds of listeners who connect with his lyrics and personal style;
skilled enough to earn multiple awards for his musicianship and
stage acumen; and yet smooth enough to become the unofficial
perpetual host of the Country Music Association's annual televised
awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight didn't turn on Gill right away, though. He started
out as a sideman in such bands as the Bluegrass Alliance and Byron
Berline's Sundance, becoming the lead singer for the group Pure
Prairie League in 1979. He performed PPL's hits Let Me Love You
Tonight and Still Right Here in My Heart in 1980-81, but then
returned to sideman work in the Cherry Bombs with Rodney Crowell
and Roseanne Cash.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Nashville in 1984 coincided with his first country
recording contract _ with RCA Records _ but most of his work still
came from backing others in the studio or hitting the road with
Emmylou Harris. His own solo career didn't really take off until
1990 _ on the MCA Nashville roster _ with the release of the hit
single ``When I Call Your Name,'' soon followed by the equally
plaintive ``Never Knew Lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirited, up-tempo singles, such as ``Liza Jane,'' ``One More
Last Chance'' and ``What the Cowgirls Do,'' climbed the charts
throughout the '90s between the release of such aching ballads as
``Look at Us,'' ``Pocket Full of Gold,'' ``I Still Believe in You''
and ``Whenever You Come Around.''
</P>
<P>
   The sincerity of Gill's straining tenor gives his songs, the
ballads especially, a truthful twang that seems to come from lived
experience. But assuming they have any particular autobiographical
meaning is a mistake that causes Gill some distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seem to be (autobiographical), seem to be,'' he said. ``
`Seem' is the operative word.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, ``The Key to Life,'' on his recently released album
``The Key,'' is about his father, who died summer before last. And
``Go Rest High on That Mountain,'' from the year before, was
inspired by the memory of his late brother. But Gill insists his
songs are primarily fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's painful,'' he said, especially when stories
appear in the tabloids claiming to have information about his
personal life. ``They think everything's verbatim to my life.''
When Gill's marriage to Janis Oliver Gill _ who with her sister,
Kristine Arnold, make up the country-music duo Sweethearts of the
Rodeo _ ended less than two years ago, a wire story circulated
suggesting that fans should have seen the breakup coming based on
the songs he'd released. Gill scoffs at the idea. ``They don't know
when a song was written.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes, however, that misrepresentation and mistaken
understanding of his work is part of being in the public eye. You
see people on television, hear them on the radio, and you feel like
you know them, even though you really can't. On the flip side, he
said he has felt the disappointment of ``loving somebody's work,
and then meeting them, you find out they're a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   He also realizes that people may hear meanings in songs based on
their own life experiences. ``It's all about perception,'' he said.
``I'm not going to whine about that. People live their lives
through some of these songs. I've seen some of the power of some of
these songs.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of that power comes from the other musicians who bring
the songs to life, Gill said. ``The way I approach records is the
way you might cast for a movie. Every bit of the process is equally
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his collaborative spirit in the studio, Gill has
reportedly sung and/or played with more than 400 different
musicians, including a bevy of fabulously voiced female backup
singers. ``I'm a fan,'' he said simply of the singers, many of whom
were just getting a foothold in Nashville when he brought them on.
One recent find, Sonya Isaacs, formerly of the Middletown-based
gospel group the Isaacs, will soon release her debut solo album,
which Gill is producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ego is such that I don't want to be the star,'' he said.
``The guitar player, the banjo player, they all bring to the table
something special, and that makes music matter to me. All those
people have different voices, different souls.''
</P>
<P>
   For tonight's show at WSU's Ervin J. Nutter Center, one of 12
stops on the entertainer's two-week ``A Christmas To Remember''
tour, Gill said he'll bring along an eight-piece band; three backup
singers; and Grammy-winning performer, songwriter and producer
Michael Omartian, who'll conduct a ``Holiday Orchestra'' of about
30 Dayton-area musicians contracted for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they'll perform a three-hour program of seasonal music
culled from Gill's two Christmas albums _ the just-released
``Breath of Heaven'' and the 1993 platinum-selling ``Let There Be
Peace on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of elements to merge together from one city to the
next, but Gill says he trusts the musical abilities of the hired
instrumentalists. ``That's the neat thing about people who know how
to play (sheet) music and can sight read,'' he said, noting his own
inability to do either.
</P>
<P>
   He really only has one big fear about the show: ``I just pray I
can fit into the tuxedo,'' he said with a chuckle, referring to his
continuing, but far from lost, battle with weight.
</P>
<P>
   Weight issues aside, the tuxedo represents the distinctive
character of the holiday show, which while not formal in nature,
certainly doesn't aspire to the rowdiness of a honky-tonk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like `What the Cowgirls Do,' '' he said. ``It's very
different. The audience is, well, just the response is different.
The applause seems to last longer, and there's not as much
cheering. There's a reverence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill toured a holiday show in 1993 that included half seasonal
music and half country hits. This time, with two albums of material
to draw from, it's all holiday-related.
</P>
<P>
   He said he finds the program personally inspirational on many
levels: ``musically, spiritually, all kinds of ways. I really enjoy
the content of so many of the (traditional) songs. It kind of makes
you stop and think.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's happy to focus the entire show on Christmas music,
he knows some fans might be disappointed about not hearing their
favorite hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope nobody goes away mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Always the good boy trying to do fine.

PAC-10 AWAITS BIG PAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For three months, they were UCLA's fiercest
rivals, hoping to knock the Bruins from their first-place perch.
But for three hours Saturday, when the Bruins face Miami in the
Orange Bowl, they'll be UCLA's biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   From Tucson to Pullman and all points between, the Pac-10 will
be rooting for 76 players and 10 coaches in powder blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended our (Thursday) morning staff meeting with a `Go
Bruins' cheer,'' said Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood, who
expects the Wildcats' first-ever Rose Bowl berth if UCLA advances
to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be watching and cheering for UCLA,'' said Oregon
athletic director Bill Moos, whose team's Holiday Bowl invitation
depends on the Bruins. ``Once we realized we weren't going to the
Rose Bowl, we became great UCLA fans. The Bruins have unified the
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's stakes begin with UCLA's 20-game winning streak and
skyrocket from there:
</P>
<P>
   _ A probable berth in the Fiesta Bowl, against either Tennessee
or Kansas State, for the national championship on Jan. 4;
</P>
<P>
   _ A potential recruiting windfall for every UCLA sport;
</P>
<P>
   _ $6 million in unbudgeted money to be split among the Pac-10
schools;
</P>
<P>
   _ Unprecedented exposure and prestige for a conference fighting
its time zone and the eastern bias;
</P>
<P>
   _ Arizona's berth in the Rose Bowl instead of the Holiday and
Oregon's berth in the Holiday instead of the Aloha.
</P>
<P>
   And because it all depends on UCLA getting to the Fiesta Bowl,
not winning it, Saturday's game is perhaps the most important event
in conference history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can certainly make that argument,'' Pac-10 commissioner
Tom Hansen said. ``It's as big a football game as I can remember,
and same with other events.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Section 18 is nestled in the southwest corner of Arizona
Stadium, across the aisle from the seats given to visiting fans.
For 16 years, a group of 40 Wildcats supporters have been the
vanguard of Tucson, defending Arizona's honor in victory and
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a particularly bad performance against hated
Arizona State, a Section 18 member bit the toe of a Sun Devil party
doll, deflating it and salavging a morsel of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Section 18 members have been interviewed on local television.
Last week, on the eve of the ASU game, a few received permission to
watch highlights of past Arizona-Arizona State games in the
athletic director's box of an otherwise dark and empty stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Section 18 will gather at an east-side sports bar and
bleed powder blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be as big a UCLA fans as we are Arizona fans,''
said Jay Gonzales, a Tucson native and Arizona graduate (1981).
``(The Miami) game is as important to us as if it were
Arizona-Arizona State. It's an extension of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the only Pac-10 school never to participate in the
Rose Bowl. But if UCLA advances to the Fiesta, the 11-1 Wildcats
are expected to receive an at-large bid to play Wisconsin in
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   It would instantly join the 1997 NCAA basketball title as the
primary sources of pride for a college town forever in the shadows
of Phoenix, its big brother to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The potential recruiting benefits are enormous as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be able to tell recruits, `You can go to Arizona and
go to the Rose Bowl,' '' Livengood said. ``That's been hanging on
us. People say, `(Dick Tomey) is a good coach, and the kids love
him, but . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``It would disprove more things than it would prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as UCLA making the Fiesta puts Arizona in the Rose, it also
catapults Oregon to the Holiday Bowl in San Diego, probably against
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins lose and the Pac-10 bowl deck collapses, then UCLA
goes to the Rose Bowl, Arizona would play Nebraska in the Holiday
Bowl and Oregon would go to the Aloha Bowl and probably face
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The primary issue for Oregon is not pride or money, but six days
of recruiting exposure. The Ducks have 30 players from Southern
California, including tailback Herman Ho-Ching (Long Beach) and
receivers Tony Hartley (Los Alamitos) and Damon Griffin (Monrovia).
Also, quarterback Akili Smith is a San Diego native. Continuing
that pipeline is essential if they hope to compete with the Pac-10
elite in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holiday would be very important for us, not just for the
national exposure but because we recruit very heavily in Southern
California,'' Moos said. ``It's an opportunity to showcase our
program and do some recruiting during the allowable windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to be watching UCLA for a variety of reason,
perhaps us and Arizona more than the rest of the conference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The six Bowl Championship Series member conferences (Pac-10,
ACC, Southeastern, Big Ten, Big 12 and Big East) are guaranteed at
least one participant in the four BCS games (Rose, Fiesta, Orange,
Sugar). They'll receive approximately $11.5 million to be
distributed among the member schools after expenses. In addition,
there are two at-large spots in the BCS worth $6 million to
whichever conferences fill the slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to spread the money,'' Pac-10 assistant
commissioner Jim Muldoon said. ``The BCS schools didn't want to
make a second participating spot worth $11.5 million because that
would be an overwhelming financial windfall for one or two
conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Pac-10 is guaranteed $11.5 for the Rose Bowl, whether
it's Arizona or UCLA, and the schools budgeted accordingly last
spring. The Bruins' berth in the Fiesta would bring an additional _
and unbudgeted _ $6 million. After expenses, approximately $4.5
million would be divided equally among the schools.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, which begins a $19 million Adidas contract in July,
the additional $450,000 won't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   For Oregon and Arizona, the Fiesta money would help replenish
cash reserves depleted in recent years by facility upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   But no school needs the money more than Oregon State, which has
an $8 million deficit because of poor management, tuition increases
and sagging football attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help a great deal,'' Oregon State athletic director
Mitch Barnhart said. ``I don't know where it would go specifically.
We'd have to see where it settled into the finances, but we've got
to reduce that deficit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won its only national title in 1954 but did not play in a
title game because of the Rose Bowl's no repeat rule. (UCLA lost to
Michigan in the 1953 game.) Bing Crosby tried to organize an
unsanctioned UCLA-Ohio State game, but the NCAA rejected his
proposal. As football games go, the Bruins have never experienced
anything like this season's Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   What of the school's first basketball title in 1964? Financial
benefits were meager, and not only wasn't it televised, it wasn't
on national radio.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis and former assistant Jim
Milhorn were attending a conference in Berkeley at the time. After
huddling in a car and futilely tuning the radio dial, they called
home to Los Angeles to get the final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (the players) this is the biggest game of their life,''
UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``It might be the biggest game in the
history of UCLA. We have the opportunity, if we win, to do
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen believes the most important football game in Pac-10
history was Washington's 44-8 victory over Wisconsin in the 1960
Rose Bowl. It signalled the conference's national emergence, he
said, and foretold the dominance of USC and Washington for three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But for exposure and monetary reward, it cannot match next
month's Fiesta Bowl. Even USC's best teams had to share their Rose
Bowl victories with other Jan. 1 bowl game winners, and none
generated $6 million for the league.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Jan. 1 games are over, the national spotlight will
descend on the Fiesta Bowl for three days. All UCLA has to do is
get there, and everything else _ including the respect and prestige
it covets _ will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a college football fan from the midwest or
southeast, there's probably a biased feeling toward the Pac-10,''
said former Ohio State quarterback and current ESPN analyst Kirk
Herbstriet. ``Fans are so brainwashed in those parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who don't respect the Pac-10, then UCLA making the
Fiesta Bowl is a golden opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one.

KANSAS STATE PUNT RETURNER HAS ALWAYS BEEN TOUGH, FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The jukes and jives of the NCAA's most
prolific punt returner began to blossom on Littlejohn Avenue in
southeast Fort Worth, where David Allen regularly joined neighbors
in an exercise called ``sideline kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules were simple: Street football games were of the touch
variety up and down Littlejohn, unless the man with the ball veered
toward the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you were fair game,'' said Chris Freeman, 25, a Fort
Worth truck driver. ``If you ran toward the sideline, the other
guys could lay you out in the grass in somebody's yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, nobody ever laid out David Allen. Although he was
the youngest participant in those games of roughly a decade ago, he
was also the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, nobody could catch him,'' said Freeman, who is five
years older than Allen. ``And if you did get in a good lick, he was
a tough little kid. His nose would be bleeding, but he'd just wipe
it off on his shirt sleeve and keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials about Allen's elusiveness and toughness do not
surprise teammates at Kansas State, who have watched him return an
NCAA record-tying four punts for touchdowns this season. Allen's
713 yards in punt returns have been a major factor in helping the
Wildcats, 11-0 and ranked second in The Associated Press poll, land
a berth opposite No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M (10-2) in tomorrow's Big 12
championship game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, Allen has 185 more yards in punt
returns than any other NCAA Division I-A ``team'' in 1998. His
22.3-yard average is a Big 12 record, as is his 172-yard
performance in a 48-7 rout of Texas that included a career-best,
93-yard touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who moved from Fort Worth to Liberty, Mo., before
entering junior high school, is such a factor in the Wildcats'
arsenal that A&AMP;M punter Shane Lechler said he would alter his
normal approach in tomorrow's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't kick any balls straight to him,'' said Lechler, an
All-American who averages 43.5 yards per punt. ``I'll make him
handle everything on the run or just kick it out-of-bounds. The
last time I did something like that was against \RFlorida State's\S
Peter Warrick. And this guy is a couple of notches above Warrick.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said Allen, 20, is ``as good as I've
seen'' as a punt returner at the college level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he touches the ball, it's, `Look out,''' Slocum
said. ``This week will be a big challenge for our coverage team.''
</P>
<P>
   Proper deployment of Allen could prove to be a dilemma for
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder as well. The 5-foot-9, 185-pound
sophomore normally is the Wildcats' No. 4 tailback. But starter
Eric Hickson is doubtful with an ankle sprain, and backup Marlon
Charles is out with a fractured hip.
</P>
<P>
   If Hickson does not play, the Wildcats' tailback duties will be
shared by Allen (29 carries, 171 yards) and Frank Murphy (54
carries, 253 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'll get a few more carries this week,'' said Allen,
who rushed for 1,471 yards and 19 touchdowns as a high school
senior. ``I came here to play running back.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has been as a punt returner that Allen has found his
niche. Snyder, in turn, doesn't want to wear down his special-teams
standout with carries that might make him ineffective as a return
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very valuable to our football team because he has a nice
knack for what he does,'' Snyder said. ``Everyone tries to do
something to limit his opportunities ... but 700 yards is an
incredible figure.''
</P>
<P>
   It represents a number Allen considered unreachable when he
volunteered to return punts last season as a replacement for the
departed Chris Canty, a first-round pick of the New England
Patriots in the 1997 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a way to get on the field,'' said
Allen, who returned a few punts in high school but not on a regular
basis. ``I tried it and did well at it. So I set a few goals for
myself. But I never expected them to be this high or at this level.
My success has been a big surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen points to good blocking and natural instincts as his
primary survival tools. He also listed something else, a trait he
might have developed during his days as a 10-year-old playing with
teen-agers on Littlejohn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having no fear,'' Allen said. ``Nothing bothers me back there.
Regardless of where the ball is, I want to catch every punt. And
every one I touch, I have the mind-set I want to score with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who fail to score, after all, are in danger of being
reduced to ``sideline kill'' by the bigger guys in the
neighborhood.

GRITTY OLD MEN: STARS BUILD SENIOR CITIZENS LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Guy Carbonneau said he doesn't
feel 38, so why should he play that way.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the guy is willing to drop the gloves and throw a few
punches if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes,'' said Carbonneau, with the sly smile that
shows the wear and tear of having played 1,194 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has taken with the
most veteran members of his veteran-heavy team. The Stars have the
second-oldest roster in the NHL, but instead of trying to hide the
age, Hitchcock is reveling in it. Recently, he sent out a line that
composed of Carbonneau, Brian Skrudland, 35, and Dave Reid, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics can insert their Geritol jokes here, but opponents
aren't laughing. And neither is Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said he's studying the Stars' senior citizens as an
anchor line in a plan that could see the ``second'' and ``third''
lines shuffled slightly, with Jamie Langenbrunner possibly moving
from left wing to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams around the league have really strong play from
their top three lines and then their fourth line has definition,''
Hitchcock said. ``That's what we want from Reid, Skrudland and
Carbonneau. We can play that line as a checking line, and we can
play them a lot or a little depending on the score. They give us a
lot of versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   While the geriatric trio isn't about to speed past an opponent
or light up the scoreboard _ not one of the three has scored a goal
this season _ they know all about the hard work it takes to stay in
an NHL lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was left unprotected in the preseason waiver draft and was
shuffled around during training camp. Yet, he has been a healthy
scratch only twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Reid saw the challenge and he took it head on,''
Hitchcock said. ``He didn't want to lose his spot, and he fought
hard to get it back''
</P>
<P>
   Reid beat out younger legs such as those of Jamie Wright, now
with the Stars' International Hockey League affiliate in Kalamazoo,
Mich., and Jason Botterill.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, they didn't need to bring anyone in to
challenge me _ I knew I hadn't played well,'' Reid said. ``But I
worked hard and I have to continue to work hard. There's still a
lot that I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland, likewise, said he has to improve. He was scratched
for two consecutive games in November and had a heated chat with
Hitchcock about his role on the team. Now, he's back playing center
and enjoying the challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau, who ranked third in the NHL in faceoff winning
percentage last season, has had to move to the right wing for the
first time in his 17-year NHL career. But that's part of the
sacrifice of playing for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done it before, but I will do it,'' he said.
``Everyone on the team has to do this, do whatever it takes to make
things work.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Stars' most veteran line understands that as well as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line has real chemistry right now, and we don't want to
take away from that,'' Hitchcock said. ``They're making a
difference for us.''
Chambers hurt
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Shawn Chambers left Wednesday night's game against
San Jose in the second period after the index finger on his right
hand was broken by a slash by Sharks winger Owen Nolan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who missed 25 games with four separate hand injuries
last season, is expected to be out at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Dan Keczmer or Sergey Gusev are likely replacements.

RACE IS CLOSE FOR PRESIDENT OF TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs 7th graf for updated vote totals)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four decades after his famous father was elected president of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James P. Hoffa was in a
close race Thursday as a federal monitor began counting ballots in
the election for the presidency of the powerful union.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hoffa's campaign manager has sought to lower
expectations, making it clear that Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer,
would not win a landslide victory over his main challenger, Thomas
Leedham of Portland, Ore., director of the union's warehouse
division.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is hoping to win this year's race after losing narrowly in
his 1996 race against Ron Carey, whose victory was overturned when
a federal election monitor found that his aides had improperly
siphoned more than $700,000 in union money into the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   John Metz of St. Louis, director of the Teamsters' public
employees division, is the third candidate in the race, but he has
not mounted a serious campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said David Lyle, a Hoffa
spokesman. ``We do not anticipate a blowout one way or the other.
Leedham is an incumbent, and he and the other slate have squabbled
over who gets control of the incumbent arsenal, but all their guns
have been pointed at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the federal election monitor, had hired 450
workers to count the 420,000 ballots that have been mailed in,
representing less than 30 percent of the union's 1.4 million
members. The count is being conducted in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, with about 10 percent of votes counted,
union officials said Hoffa had 14,282 votes, Leedham had 13,197 and
Metz 1,063.
</P>
<P>
   All those ballots were from the South, which was being counted
first, followed by the East, the central states, the West and
finally Canada. Cherkasky said he hoped the count would be complete
by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the count, Cherkasky said, ``We obviously have a
very, very strict protocol so that we can assure the government and
the Teamsters that every vote is going to be counted and there
isn't going to be any fraud in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carey won in 1996 by 52 percent to 48 percent, many Hoffa
supporters said the previous federal monitor had distorted the
count in Carey's favor. Those charges were never substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Trossman, a Leedham spokesman, said he was encouraged by
the closeness of the count, because Leedham expects to run strongly
in the East and the West. The Hoffa forces expect to do well in the
central states, the stronghold of Hoffa's father.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've started from nowhere, and we've turned this into a horse
race,'' Trossman said. ``Hoffa's been campaigning for four years.
He's spent millions of dollars. He has the most famous name in the
history of American labor. And still this is going to be a close
race. This shows the reform movement is rejuvenated.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham has sought to pick up the somewhat tarnished Carey
mantle, pledging to continue the cleanup that Carey began when he
was first elected in 1991. Hoffa has pledged to reunite a union
that became badly fractured in the Carey years. In his campaign he
has relied largely on the backing of Teamster leaders around the
United States.

RODRIGUEZ AGENT SAYS CATCHER OPPOSES TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers may or may not be willing to
trade catcher Ivan Rodriguez to the Toronto Blue Jays for
right-hander Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Let this, though, be known: Rodriguez does not plan on playing
for the Blue Jays beyond the 1999 season should the seven-time
All-Star be sent to the Great White North.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who signed a five-year contract extension worth $42
million on July 31, 1997, would demand a trade if sent to the Blue
Jays while in the midst of this multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the Rangers would trade the best catcher in
baseball after the commitment the two made to each other,'' said
Jeff Moorad, who represents Rodriguez. ``However, in the event
there was a trade ... a Trade I demand would be filed before these
trade papers were even finalized. It would be a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin spoke yesterday with Blue
Jays general manager Gord Ash in Chicago, but he declined to
elaborate on whether his colleague inquired about Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not commenting on any players in regard to Clemens,''
Melvin said last night after returning to his home in Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin declined to divulge whether the Rangers made an offer for
Clemens or whether common ground exists between the organizations
for a potential trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's hard to say,'' Melvin said. ``I'm probably
not going to talk much about anything in regard to Roger Clemens.
It's best not to and let it take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's stance against this potential trade could chill the
Blue Jays' interest if the Rangers' plans include offering the
27-year-old catcher as part of any deal for Clemens. Rodriguez
could demand a trade after the 1999 season and force the Blue Jays
into their plight now.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who lives in the Houston suburb of Katy, informed the
Blue Jays of his desire to be traded to an organization closer to
his home or a playoff contender. The Rangers, Houston Astros, New
York Yankees and Cleveland Indians appear to be the most interested
suitors for the 36-year-old pitcher, a five-time Cy Young Award
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of information suggests that the Rangers might not be
too far along in their discussions with the Blue Jays. Melvin has
not discussed the matter with manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team would love to have Roger Clemens,'' Oates said last
night from his home in Virginia, ``but sometimes you just don't
have enough bullets to get the deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would be in need of a catcher should the
organization trade Rodriguez. The organization lacks a minor-league
catcher ready to play at the major-league level, and Gregg Zaun _
who this past season hit only .188 _ is the only other catcher on
the major-league roster.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Steinbach, Scott Servais, Tom Lampkin, Mike Macfarlane,
Joe Oliver, Kirt Manwaring and Chad Kreuter represent the best the
free-agent market bears.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers do not appear to be the leading
candidate to acquire Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees have the most to offer,'' one major-league
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, according to one Blue Jays official, offered
right-hander Ramiro Mendoza, second baseman Homer Bush and one of
the following three pitchers _ left-hander Andy Pettitte or
right-handers Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and Hideki Irabu _ for
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros discussed parting with some combination of
right-hander Scott Elarton, right fielder Derek Bell, center
fielder Richard Hidalgo and left-hander Mike Hampton in their
attempt to acquire Clemens before the July trade deadline this past
season.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation regarding a Clemens-for-Rodriguez trade leaves the
Rangers' seven-time Gold Glove Award recipient distressed,
according to friends. Rodriguez bypassed his opportunity for free
agency after signing his five-year contract extension with the
Rangers. The Rangers planned to trade Rodriguez to the Yankees at
the July 1997 trade deadline had the two parties not reached an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That contract ensures Rodriguez $8 million annually for each of
the next three seasons and $9 million for 2002. Rodriguez also will
receive $2 million in severance pay from the organization upon his
departure from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sad right now,'' said Luis Mayoral, the Rangers' liaison
for Latin American players. ``He's not happy. He loves the Rangers.
He wants to die a Ranger.''

CRYSTAL CLEAR: UCLA DESTINED TO FACE TENNESSEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We don't need an MIT graduate with no apparent
life to gaze at computer spreadsheets and tell us which teams will
play for the national title in Tempe, Ariz. Not when a high
priestess of alchemy already has a crystal-clear picture of the
Fiesta Bowl matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Madame Bea C. Ess eschews computers for her crystal ball,
logarithms for tarot cards and slide rules for star-gazing. We hear
she's also a pretty fair fortuneteller.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Madame Bea C. Ess is convinced she has the Fiesta Bowl
wired. All of her empirical research points to the divine:
</P>
<P>
   It'll be UCLA versus Tennessee for all the chips.
</P>
<P>
   She needed no magic formula to figure this out, she smugly
informed us. She could have done it even without her advanced
degree in the occult, she said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   We humored her with a smile, then tried gently explaining to her
that nothing possibly can be set in stone until after the outcome
is known of Saturday's games pitting the Volunteers against
Mississippi State and the Bruins against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At which point Madame Bea C. Ess cut us off with a cackle.
Heavens to Bea, she said, some people just can't see the writing
for the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And then she spelled it out for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me,'' she whispered conspiratorially, ``when did UCLA's
20-game winning streak start?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sept. 13, 1997, in a 66-3 blowout at Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And who did the Bruins play the week before that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee,'' we said.
</P>
<P>
   The picture she was painting was starting to take form.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Madame Bea C. Ess's voice was singsong now, ``do you
remember what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course. The Bruins fell behind hyped-to-the-heavens
Peyton Manning and the rest of the Rocky Top gang, 24-3, in the
first half before mounting a creditable counterattack and losing
30-24.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely,'' Madame Bea C. Ess said, triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK,'' we said, conceding her point. ``So assuming the
Bruins get by Miami this weekend, there would be a certain, well,
celestial symmetry to UCLA playing for its first national football
championship against the last team that defeated it. An unbeaten
Vols team, at that. But then there's unbeaten Kansas State...''
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing,'' Madame Bea C. Ess cut us off again sharply. Her
eyes narrowed and her tone turned serious. ``There's more to it
than that, don't you see? Think about it. How did Tennessee turn
back Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In overtime,'' we replied, ``after the Gators missed the
game-winning field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how did the Bruins beat Oregon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In overtime, after UCLA place-kicker Chris Sailer missed the
game-winning field goal in regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' she said. ``Now answer me this. What iced Tennessee's
win over Arkansas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner's fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what iced UCLA's win over Stanford?''
</P>
<P>
   We had to admit, the pattern was starting to scream at us. It
was as though we were seeing it on one of sportscaster Chris
Berman's sports coats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford receiver Jeff Allen's fumble,'' we said, sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good.'' Madame Bea C. Ess beamed at us as a mother would after
extracting the desired-upon response from an obdurate child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now then,'' she continued, ``what potentially crippling loss
did the Bruins suffer in the second game, at Houston?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easy,'' we said. ``Their big-play receiver/kick
returner Freddie Mitchell fractured his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.'' Madame Bea C. Ess squirmed in her seat as she
mentally replayed the hit that caused Mitchell's injury. ``And what
about Tennessee? What calamity befell its offense?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' we said. ``Quarterback Tee Martin has played so
well it's easy to forget the Vols lost their starting tailback
Jamal Lewis in their fourth game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking of Tee Martin,'' Madame Bea C. Ess said, ``aren't his
stats just so-so?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes,'' we said, ``but the thing about him that doesn't
show up in his numbers is his knack for making big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what you've been saying all season about UCLA's
quarterback, Cade McNown?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Touche,'' we said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more thing,'' Madame Bea C. Ess said. ``Did you catch what
Kentucky coach Hal Mumme said about the Vols before his Wildcats
played them?''
</P>
<P>
   We did. ``He said Florida was the better team but that Tennessee
seemed to be getting all the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Madame Bea C. Ess could hardly contain herself. ``Remind you
of anybody else?'' she asked gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You betcha. It was just like when USC coach Paul Hackett
called Oregon the best team in the Pacific-10 right after the Ducks
had lost to the Bruins. He insinuated that UCLA got lucky because
Oregon basically fumbled the game away.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Bea C. Ess stared at her polished nails for a few
seconds. She said nothing, giving us a chance to cogitate.
</P>
<P>
   At length she spoke:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, then, doesn't it seem perfectly clear that UCLA and
Tennessee are on a championship collision course?''
</P>
<P>
   We had to admit, it certainly does. &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Saying his club has a ``tremendous appetite'' for the situation,
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. pledged Thursday a
bend-but-don't-break approach in the pursuit of five-time Cy Young
Award winner Roger Clemens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros won't be alone, as at least a handful of clubs,
including the Texas Rangers, are among the front-runners to land
the 36-year-old righthander, considered one of the most dominating
pitchers of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers beware: If Toronto has its way, any club with
remote interest in landing the Rocket will have to promise the moon
and the stars in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the tremendous appetite we have for this, but
it has to be reasonable,'' said McLane, who along with general
manager Gerry Hunsicker attended a special meeting Thursday in
Chicago regarding escalating player salaries. ``We have to be
careful. Last time we talked with (Toronto last July), they wanted
most of our outfield and one or two good pitchers. It can't be an
unreasonable trade. Getting a player like Roger would be
phenomenal, but you have to be careful not to lose three or four
key players.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens set off a wave of inquiries after Wednesday's
announcement that he wanted to exercise a trade option from Toronto
because of the club's lack of commitment to spend money to build a
contender. By Thursday, several clubs had made preliminary contact
with Toronto GM Gord Ash, including the Astros, who plan to hold
further discussions today.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said he would like to formalize a deal within seven to 10
days, although some baseball insiders believe the process could
last longer as Toronto's asking price isn't expected to be cheap.
The Blue Jays are taking a ``star-for-a-star'' approach in dealing
Clemens, reportedly asking about such marquee names as Astros
second baseman Craig Biggio and Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker acknowledged Thursday's brief discussion with Ash was
fact-finding and to ``let them know we had interest exploring the
possibly of acquiring his (Clemens') services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to approach this trade like another other. Does it
make sense?'' Hunsicker said. ``Is it going to make the team
better? We're trying to win in 1999. If we have the chance to
improve ourselves via this particular trade, we're going to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Rangers have
the resources with their thick-wallet tactics, don't count out the
Astros, who have one important factor working in their favor _
location, location, location. Clemens has made his preference known
that he would like to remain in Texas, playing for either the
Astros or Rangers. If that can't be arranged, he wants to play for
another contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were among four teams _ the Yankees, Cleveland and
Texas were the others _ who made formal offers for Clemens prior to
the July 31 trading deadline last season. Each time, Toronto
rejected the offer, only to make counteroffers that were shot down
by the respective clubs because of the hefty asking price.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' biggest needs include a power-hitting outfielder;
a starting pitcher, preferably a lefthander; a designated hitter;
and a third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Blue Jays asked the Astros for Shane Reynolds, a
19-game winner last season, and outfielders Derek Bell and Richard
Hidalgo. Toronto later asked for righthander Scott Elarton instead
of Reynolds, but the two sides still could not reach agreement and
the Astros sent three minor-league prospects to Seattle for
lefthander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Bell (.314, 22 home runs, 108 RBIs in 1998) has been the center
of trade talk on several occasions the past few seasons and could
be a key figure in a possible package that would include Elarton
and minor-league outfielder Daryle Ward. The Astros could also
offer infielder Russ Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Star also reported Thursday, citing unidentified
sources, a ``mega-deal'' between the Astros and Toronto could be in
the works. The Astros have interest in outfielder Shannon Stewart,
although the Blue Jays are pushing Jose Cruz Jr., whose father is
an Astros coach. Hunsicker declined to specifically name players
who could be involved in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary issues the Astros will address is avoiding
any unnecessary disruptions that could come as a result of
subtracting too many players off the current big-league roster,
Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start subtracting, you have to be careful not to end
up less competitive,'' he said. ``When you're trying to trade one
of the best pitchers in the game, you try and get somebody to
overpay. I would try to, too. You have to try and be careful and
not get caught up with the intangibles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees appear to have the most to offer Toronto, with third
baseman Mike Lowell, outfielders Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee and Shane
Spencer and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza, among others, as trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   And wherever the Yankees are, you can almost certainly expect
the Indians to be right behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more available now than a week ago,'' Cleveland GM
John Hart said. ``I now have the Jays' number on my speed dial.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone isn't expected to stop ringing any time soon. There
will be plenty of interest in Clemens, who went 41-13 with two Cy
Youngs in two seasons with the Blue Jays. Last season, Clemens went
20-6 with a 2.65 ERA, going 15-0 in his last 22 starts after
beginning the season 5-6. He led the AL in ERA and strikeouts and
tied for the lead in wins after finishing first in all three
categories in 1997. Clemens earns $8 million each of the next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, teams such as the Astros will begin lining up
for the chance to obtain Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a waiting game when Toronto will get to the point
they are ready to make a deal,'' said Randy Hendricks, one of
Clemens' Houston-based agents. ``Until then, there isn't anything
overly urgent to talk about.''

MIAMI LOSES ITS SWAGGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most extraordinary thing about the University of Miami
football program over the years isn't the four national
championships it won in a nine-year period, or the 18 first-round
NFL draft choices it produced since 1987, or the NCAA-record,
58-game home winning streak it built at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   What's most remarkable is that the Hurricanes have worn white
helmets all these years.
</P>
<P>
   The villains, after all, are supposed to wear black hats.
Nobody's played that role better or badder than the 'Canes.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame brawls, taunts and cheap shots were identifiable with
the program as much as winning. If the Hurricanes wanted to tell
the world who was No. 1, they often had a hard time deciding which
finger to use.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, thanks to NCAA sanctions that cost Miami 31
scholarships over three seasons, the swagger has been replaced by a
stagger.
</P>
<P>
   That point was driven home last week when the 'Canes were
thumped by Syracuse, 66-13. It dropped Miami's record against
ranked teams to 1-7 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the alumni have taken the head-in-the-sand approach
about the probation,'' said Miami coach Butch Davis, whose team has
rebounded from its first losing season since 1979. ``Certainly last
Saturday was a little bit of a reminder. When we climbed to 7-2 and
18th or 19th in the country a lot of people said, `Oh, well, we're
out of the woods. Everything's back to normal.'''
</P>
<P>
   If it were, the Hurricanes would be playing for something more
than pride Saturday when they host No. 3 UCLA at the Orange Bowl in
a makeup of the game scheduled for Sept. 26 that was postponed by
Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the team isn't what it used to be, although this
game is selling better because of the attention surrounding the
Bruins and their national title shot. Attendance last year fell to
an average of fewer than 29,000 _ less than half the Orange Bowl's
capacity and a 17-year low. The Hurricanes are drawing better this
season, but only their game against Florida State was watched by
more than 42,000.
</P>
<P>
   Miami hasn't just lost the once-raucous crowd, but also its
edge. After going nearly 10 years without a loss at the Orange
Bowl, the Hurricanes have lost eight of their last 14 games there.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a former assistant under Jimmy Johnson at Miami and with
the Dallas Cowboys, is in his fourth season as the head coach. He
says it's no mystery why the Hurricanes are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose 31 scholarships over three years and it's pretty
difficult to just snap your fingers and bring not only the talent
level, but the depth and experience to where it was,'' Davis said.
``If we had 10 more seniors, 10 more juniors and 10 more
sophomores, we'd probably be a little different football team than
we are today. But we are where we are and there's nothing we can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Davis can do something about is the Hurricanes' image,
which he's trying to change from Miami Vice to Miami Nice.
</P>
<P>
   The taunting and trash talking has been muted. Players are more
involved in community service and academic support has been stepped
up. Davis has stood firm when it's come to discipline, kicking off
defensive tackle Chad Pegues, a two-year starter, for breaking an
undisclosed team rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a mandate,'' Davis said of his attempt to soften
Miami's image. ``It was just something that went along with the
staff's personality and my personality and I think clearly even the
football players were ready for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The departments' low point came in the 1991 Cotton Bowl when
Miami whipped Texas, 46-3, despite piling up 202 yards in
penalties, the majority for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were saying, `These boys are nothing but a
bunch of thugs and clowns,''' said receiver Darryl Jones, a native
of Dallas. ``The whole state of Texas was pretty upset the way they
were out there clowning. When the referees came around our high
school to talk about the new rules (against taunting), they called
it `The Miami Rules'.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' off-the-field behavior did little to alter this
image, succinctly summarized on T-shirts for the heated Notre
Dame-Miami rivalry in the late '80s: Catholics vs. Convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Jammi German, a former receiver, once punched a track athlete
for calling him a gay epithet. Players were cut deals by boosters
on living arrangements or rental cars. Some obtained loaned cars or
money through agents.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1993 season was beginning, rap star Luther Campbell, a
Miami native, threatened to tell the NCAA who on the team was
receiving money if Ryan Collins, a black quarterback, wasn't named
the starter ahead of Frank Costa, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   The program was finally brought down by academic adviser Tony
Russell, who landed Miami in trouble with the NCAA for falsifying
Pell Grant applications for 91 students, including 57 football
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all very upset and frustrated,'' said offensive line
coach Art Kehoe, who played at Miami in the late '70s and has been
a part of the coaching staff since. ``We just about got the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What irritates me is that we got on probation because of the
Pell Grants and people try to make us out to be some hood program,
where there was cheating and that we were a vagabond, run-amok
program. We certainly did some things that we weren't proud of, but
we were never out-and-out buying kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we've had some bad kids, but I don't care where you go,
some of 'em aren't going to be angels. I'll tell you what, though,
we didn't win four national titles because we had a bunch of
punks.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami forged 8-3 and 9-3 seasons in Davis' first two years,
getting by on the available talent. But this year's senior class,
the first of the probation era, has produced only four starters.
The Hurricanes start eight underclassmen on defense and have
started a pair of redshirt freshmen on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows up in a lot of areas,'' Davis said. ``Practice-wise,
not having full scholarships like everyone else, our scout teams
are never quite as physically talented and gifted as you'd like 'em
to be to try to get your players ready during the course of the
week. You end up playing a lot of kids in starting offensive and
defensive positions (and) sometimes it waters down the special
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The country has gotten two glimpses of just how far Miami has
fallen. The Syracuse loss and last October's 47-0 walloping by
Florida State were the 'Canes worst defeats since 1944 and both
were on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet there are a lot of people who aren't losing sleep
over what happened to us,'' said quarterback Scott Covington, a
fifth-year senior from Dana Hills and the only scholarship
Californian on Miami's roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are some people out there who see us and hope
for ill will. It's the same situation here as at a place like Notre
Dame. When anyone can beat a Notre Dame or kick 'em when they're
down, they will. I think it's similar here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, despite the sanctions, have still been able to
attract some of the nation's top recruits. Jones, the receiver from
Dallas, and linebacker Nate Webster, both true sophomores, are
former prep All-Americans. So is the quarterback of the future,
redshirt freshman Kenny Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Hurricanes will field a team with 85 scholarships
for the first time since 1993 when they finished No. 3 in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe we've made great strides and that we have
some very good young football players,'' Davis said. ``In the next
couple years I think we're going to field a very good football team
and bring Miami's credibility back.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE clock is winding down, the season is on the line, and it
doesn't take a JumboTron to know the score in this NBA lockout
game.
</P>
<P>
   History 101, NBA players 99.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment the NBA owners probably have been waiting for
all along. This battle has reached that gut-wrenching point of
desperation when the biggest stars in basketball must step up and
do something huge. Somebody must take a last-second shot at saving
the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, many of the NBA's richest and most heralded
somebodies _ Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, David Robinson,
Dikembe Mutombo and even Michael Jordan in a surprise and
well-choreographed appearance Thursday _ arrived in New York and
went back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   They swooped in moments before the final buzzer of this forsaken
season like the heroes they are, apparently finally ready to make
their big moves and save the day. They came hoping to put an end to
this labor dispute, although Thursday's long session ended with the
ball hanging menacingly in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the significance of the league's superstars showing a
renewed commitment toward giving and taking, toward honest
negotiating and ultimately finding a resolution, should not be lost
on anyone. Neither should it be lost why this is happening now,
after both sides walked away frustrated with one another after
their last formal meeting Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   As much as owners also want to have some semblance of an NBA
this year, they realize it is the players who know the score that
matters most.
</P>
<P>
   History 101.
</P>
<P>
   Any history professor will tell you the majority of uprisings in
this world have occurred only when the masses became hungry. We can
only assume this is that moment for NBA players, and this is what
the owners have been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Time-changing moments always hinge more on growling stomachs and
bare feet than political or philosophical differences. Uprisings
usually occur only when the great unwashed begin to feel cheated,
forgotten and mistreated, but mostly when they're out of money and
food.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the NBA's low-end players, those who earn $1 million or
less a year and account for nearly 40 percent of the players
union's population, are beginning to hear their stomachs growl.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players missed their second paychecks of the season this
week. And this one the majority of players had to have felt, which
is why the biggest stars headed back to New York looking for peace
and a way to settle the rank-and-file grumblings.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Jordan, Ewing, Robinson, Mutombo and Mourning
average nearly $20 million per year and still have not
significantly felt the lost paychecks, but many others have.
</P>
<P>
   No NBA player figures to go hungry or shoeless, of course, but
when you make more, you usually spend more. Christmas still should
be Christmas for the rank and file, but some of them figure to get
their cranberries out of a can this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, dissent from the NBA's low-end players is rising and
the union's leadership is feeling it. Why else do you think
super-agent David Falk, who is pushing most of the buttons for the
players in this standoff, had Jordan show up for Thursday's
session?
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan arrived in dramatic style _ in a New York taxicab, no
less _ as reporters swarmed and cameras clicked. For years, Jordan
has been a noted limousine patron whether that city was New York or
New Braunfels. He even has his own limousine and personal driver in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's appearance by Jordan was one made for the
simmering masses, a posed picture of the players' leader marching
to the union's beat. Had Jordan stepped out of a limousine while
the Tim Leglers and Matt Maloneys of the NBA world watched, it
might have been too much to handle.
</P>
<P>
   It has been for some, although few have gone public. Most
recently, Washington's Legler complained about the Nike-dragging in
the negotiations, saying: ``The (superstars) are the ones who are
going to feel it if we sign the (current) offer. That's why the
deal is not signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The private anguish of such players will only grow as the
lockout drags on. The low-end players have watched their checks all
but torn to pieces. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of these players seem to be wondering if
the superstars leading their cause are looking out for the entire
league or only for that 50 to 60 percent that stand to gain the
most from the issues most often discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues have to do with revenue percentages, escrow
accounts, the Larry Bird exception, drug testing and others.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of this lockout might come down to something
simpler. It might be a study in History 101. The rank and file is
tired, worn and hungry. And that's never good for a cause.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ It was as though Texas A&AMP;M running back Dante
Hall had been grazed by a runaway tractor-trailer rig and left
wandering the highway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   HallFriday, the senior tailback had been denied 1,000 yards
rushing for the second straight year in a regular-season finale. As
a team, the Aggies had been held to minus-seven yards rushing. And
by Texas, whose defense had been shaky against opposing runners
most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hall never envisioned any team handling the Aggies' runners in
such a manner, especially the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not like that,'' Hall said Tuesday. ``You can contain (the
running game). But we averaged like one yard a carry. That was
awful. Besides Kansas State last year, I don't think we've ever had
anything that bad. I didn't think that would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary news is that having been belted in the chops by the
Longhorns, the Aggies must regroup and face Kansas State, which has
the nation's second-best defense, on Saturday in the Big 12
Championship Game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean anything to me,'' Hall said. ``Our defense
was ranked No. 2 going into the Texas game. Look what they did to
us. It's just a matter of going out and finding a way to beat that
defense. Every defense has a way to be beaten; you have to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas found the ways to beat our defense. Just because of
(Kansas State's) stats, it doesn't mean anything. Most of that
probably came against not-too-good teams anyway. So it doesn't mean
anything. That's paper stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Aggies can convince themselves by game time Saturday
at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats have been a load this season. Versatile
quarterback Michael Bishop has turned the offense into one of the
most dangerous, diversified attacks in the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   David Allen's brilliance returning punts and kickoffs and Martin
Gramatica's outstanding kicking has the Wildcats' special teams
rated among the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   With a linebacking corps of high-caliber players such as Jeff
Kelly, Mark Simoneau and Travis Ochs, K-State is ranked No. 2 in
scoring defense, No. 6 in pass-efficiency defense and No. 7 in rush
defense. Opponents have averaged 95.5 yards on the ground against
the Wildcats, 156.1 through the air and 11.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Aggies are optimistic. Win, and the Big 12 South
champs will have salved the wounds of the bitter 26-24 loss to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for all the chips here,'' said wide receiver
Chris Cole. ``We're playing for a big-time bowl bid. We're playing
for the league championship. As far as our confidence, (the
Wildcats are) just a little obstacle in the way to a bigger goal.''
</P>
<P>
   With a win, the Aggies would capture the Big 12 championship and
perhaps position themselves for an invitation to a Bowl
Championship Series event, all while providing Hall the chance to
reach his goal of 1,000 yards. Statistics from Saturday's game will
count toward regular-season totals. Hall, a junior from Nimitz,
needs 89 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If me getting the amount of yards to get 1,000 and we win,
I'll take that,'' he said. ``But at the same time, at this point in
time, getting 1,000 yards is not even close to my mind. I just want
to win to go to one of those big-time bowls, more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies are convinced the trauma of Friday's loss at Texas is
a thing of the past. Similarly, they believe the adjustments needed
to get the offense out of its rut and a defense that gave up nearly
500 yards back on track are attainable, despite facing No. 2 Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for us is we don't necessarily look at our
opponent this week as much as we look at ourselves,'' said
offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe. ``We've got to get
corrected the things that we need to do. And that's throwing and
catching the football and being able to sustain some running plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at any football team. You go out and rush for
minus-seven yards, I don't know very many football teams that are
going to win football games. We've got to certainly be better
running the football. And if the opportunity is there throwing the
ball, we've got to be better in terms of taking advantage of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When A&AMP;M, then ranked No. 14, visited Kansas State (No. 20) last
year in Manhattan, the result was a 35-17 Wildcats win. Hall
carried one time for two yards but was injured on the first play
from scrimmage and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M was ranked fifth nationally in rushing (278 yards per game)
but was held to minus-35 yards. The longest run of the day was
three yards. Entering the game, the Aggies averaged 440 yards of
total offense but got only 90.
</P>
<P>
   The task Saturday might be even more difficult, given last
week's defeat. But Hall, who finished 1997 with 973 yards rushing
on 134 carries, has found a silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good thing _ we've got a quick turnaround,'' he
said. ``It's unfortunate that we lost to Texas, but it's not the
end of our season. We can still win the entire Big 12 championship
and go to a big-time bowl. That's the bright side, coming off a
loss like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bounced back from the Florida State game (a 23-14 loss in
the season opener). There should be no reason why we can't bounce
back from this game. Any good team does that. And I think we're a
very good team.''

   KANATA, Ontario _ Their situation growing more dismal by the
day, the Kings decided Thursday morning to convene a 90-minute
players-only meeting to sort out their feelings and try to right
themselves before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as day became night, the Kings stepped onto the ice at
the Corel Centre to face the Ottawa Senators and try to avoid their
10th loss in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made few defensive mistakes, limiting the Senators to
18 shots. At the other end, they peppered Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt
with 32 shots, many from close range. The Kings played with
emotion, and they played hard from opening faceoff to final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the result was numbingly familiar _ their fourth straight
loss, and third in a row by a 3-1 margin on a trip mercifully at an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell you,'' said an extremely emotional
Luc Robitaille, who scored the Kings' goal 15 seconds into the
third period, briefly tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to win. They get a lucky (bleeping)
break and score. Everybody battled their hearts out. I'm so
disappointed. We played so hard. We were proud to be Kings tonight.
It was a good feeling to be a part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings outshot the Senators, 25-10, in the first two periods,
but for the third consecutive game, they trailed, 1-0, after 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal by the Senators (12-7-3), late in the opening
period by Andreas Johansson, resulted from the failure by
defensemen Mattias Norstrom and Sean O'Donnell to clear the puck
from their zone.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, 10 minutes after Robitaille tied the score,
Alexei Yashin scored the game-winner when Philippe Boucher lost the
puck behind the Kings' net. Magnus Arvedson completed the scoring
with a last-minute empty-net goal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Kings (6-16-3) wanted to think positively, it was
easier than after most of their setbacks. To a man, they said the
improved effort sprang from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talked about, we're going to keep it between the
guys,'' Norstrom said. ``It was good to see the veteran guys
stepping up and showing more leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the meeting, Robitaille said: ``We're dead last in
the (Western Conference). I think it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in recent games, the Kings consistently drove to the net
and jumped on rebounds. As in recent games, their efforts went
mostly unrewarded. Eric Lacroix, Vladimir Tsyplakov, Ray Ferraro
and Yanic Perreault all were stopped by Tugnutt from point-blank
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bang-bang plays,'' coach Larry Robinson said. ``They're
just not going in for us. We're all looking for an answer for why
the puck is not going in.... It's moved to the
is-it-ever-going-to-turn-around stage. It's tough to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got a major scare in the game when Ottawa defenseman
Wade Redden dropped center Jozef Stumpel with a knee-to-knee hit
late in the first period. Stumpel, who has missed 13 games with
assorted injuries, stayed down for several minutes but returned for
the last two periods despite a charley horse to his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Redden received a major penalty for kneeing, a game misconduct,
and a severe pounding from O'Donnell. The Kings came out of the
situation with a three-minute power play, but did not capitalize.
Their miserable power play, again a decisive factor despite more
scoring chances, went 0 for 5 and is 9 for 111 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was heartened to see O'Donnell respond to Redden's hit,
and pleased with just about everything but the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuck up for each other all night,'' he said. ``Sooner or
later, it's going to turn around. We can't do as many good things
as we did and not see some good results from it.''

7-YEAR-OLD SON OF SLAIN LAPD OFFICER OFFERS SAD TRIBUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Only 7 years old, Dylon Brown insisted on
speaking out, standing tall before the world and declaring how much
he loved his father, an LAPD officer gunned down Sunday by a gang
member.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an oversize baseball cap with ``LAPD'' in block letters,
Dylon didn't cry until he finished saying what was on his mind
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best. He was a great police officer and I really
loved him and I'm going to miss him,'' said the boy, standing on a
chair and leaning into a forest of microphones. ``He was a nice
man. . . . He just loved me so much. I didn't want him to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylon stood at attention during the news conference, waiting
patiently as city and Los Angeles Police Department leaders made
tearful speeches in praise of his 27-year-old father, Brian.
</P>
<P>
   And he held it together until those last two words, when he fell
into his grandfather's arms in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father would have been proud, very proud,'' said LAPD Sgt.
Craig Herron, a friend and leader to the slain officer from his
first days in police academy. ``That was like a little Brian up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the way to the news conference, Herron, who also
supervised Brown at the LAPD's Pacific Division, said the boy's
grandfather asked several times whether he was sure he wanted to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Dylon said, ``Yes, I want to talk; I want people to know about
my dad,'' according to Herron, who was in the car with the family.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brown's father also addressed the media gathered at LAPD
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been four days since our son was killed while doing
a job he loved: helping and protecting the people of Los Angeles,''
said Dennis Brown. ``My family and I would like to express our
heartfelt thanks to everyone for their show of love and support for
Brian's son, Dylon, and our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brown, who was wounded in Somalia while serving in the
Marine Corps, died in an exchange of gunfire Sunday while chasing a
drive-by shooting suspect in suburban Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's partner fatally shot the suspect, a 23-year-old gang
member. Officers also shot a still-unidentified second suspect
after a chase that ended at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office released
the identity of the drive-by shooting victim, whose killing kicked
off the chain of events that led to the officer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Sernas, 18, of suburban Santa Monica was described by
police as an innocent victim. He did not appear to have any gang
affiliation and maintained two jobs while living with his family,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks both mentioned Brown's superiority as an officer, Herron
said he knew about the man's superiority as a single father.
</P>
<P>
   Herron said that as a recruit, Brown got up at 2:30 a.m. so he
could keep living in Vista, about 100 miles south of L.A. in San
Diego County, while other cadets living on the academy premises
near downtown Los Angeles woke at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian didn't want to disrupt his son's life,'' said Herron,
who was one of Brown's supervisors at the academy. ``When it
involved his son, he gave everything and never asked for special
favors, even though they probably would have been granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron said Brian Brown's military experience made him a model
for other officers when it came to shining shoes and looking like a
law enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   His son was a mirror image, standing and waiting to speak about
his father like he was preparing for an inspection, wearing
spotless black footwear, a neatly pressed shirt and tie and
formally clasping his hands below his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Even when talking about the Nintendo video-game cartridges he
wanted for Christmas, the boy mentioned James Bond and other law
enforcement figures.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brown received a Purple Heart after being shot in the leg
in Somalia. Dylon received an honorary medal after the news
conference, delivered with a hug by the state commander of the
Military Order of the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his wife divorced several years ago, and she lives in
Texas, police officials said. She and hundreds of others are
scheduled to attend Brown's funeral, scheduled for 11 a.m. today in
the Old North Church at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Texas-born Brown will be buried at the Houston
National Cemetery.

DEMOCRATS RETURNING TO L.A. FOR FINAL CONVENTION TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An eight-member delegation of the Democratic
National Committee returns to L.A. this weekend for a two-day
session to determine if the city will play host to the party's
national convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving Sunday, the group has planned the meetings to explore
the budget of the L.A. Convention 2000 host committee as well as an
examination of the convention facilities and hotels available for
the event.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Los Angeles, in its competition with Boston and
Denver for the right to host the convention, is the prospect of
seeing the city's economy boosted by $137 million.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has offered a $35.3 million package -- all
privately financed -- of security, transportation and other
services for the right to host the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hard review of figures and facilities, the
delegates also will meet with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, L.A. Mayor
Richard Riordan and other local officials and members of the host
committee at a power breakfast Monday at the Pacific Dining Car in
downtown Los Angeles where they will be urged to select the city.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key features of the city's bid is the prospect of the
convention being held in the Staples Center sports arena. While it
is still under construction, it is ahead of schedule for its
October 1999 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of the arena said they are willing to make changes in
their construction and design plans to accommodate the convention.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on where the event will be held is expected shortly
after the first of the year when the delegates visit the two
competing cities.

   MOSCOW _ The Russian government and UNESCO are launching an
international appeal for money to restore the world-famous Bolshoi
Theatre, which is on the verge of falling down.
</P>
<P>
   Chandeliers have yet to drop on the heads of the opera-loving
public but the 19th century wooden foundations are rotting and
pipes recently burst in the administrative offices, spraying
scalding water onto the desks of managers.
</P>
<P>
   News of the fund-raising drive came earlier this week after the
first meeting of a new Russian-UNESCO organizing committee. The
campaign itself will be launched at a charity performance next May.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in finding out about the restoration plan and
how to help can visit the Bolshoi's Internet website
(www.Bolshoi.ru).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bolshoi Theatre is not only our national heritage but the
heritage of the whole world,'' said Valentina Matviyenko, the
deputy prime minister in charge of Russia's social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia might be having difficulty paying wages and pensions but
the significance of the Bolshoi was such that funding would be
found, she said. Any additional contributions from abroad would be
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   On a par with the wonders of Prague and Venice it may be, but
the 173-year-old Bolshoi is at present in a very sorry state.
Dampness is rising from the underground Neglinnaya River on which
it stands and the original wooden foundations are disintegrating.
Not only that, but the building has not been rewired since the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no danger to the public, otherwise we would have
closed the theatre,'' said the administrative director, Vladimir
Kokonin. However, in his next breath, he admitted that a
``fountain'' of hot water had overwhelmed his desk when the pipes
burst a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi management intends to keep the familiar outward
appearance of the pink-stucco theatre, changing only ``dated
symbols'' such as the Stalin-era stage curtains with their hammer
and sickle designs.
</P>
<P>
   However, in many invisible ways, the structure will be
strengthened and modern facilities provided. Experts have been
consulted to ensure that whatever alterations are made the
acoustics do not suffer. The estimated cost of the 10-year project
is $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Already, with the help of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, an
alternative stage has been built, so that the troupe of the Bolshoi
can remain in the public eye during the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic crisis, Ms. Matviyenko said the federal
government had found 45 million dollars to start work on the main
building and this month Russian firms would be invited to tender
for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi may be crumbling physically but spiritually it is in
better health than it has been for years under its new artistic
director, the former dancer, Vladimir Vasilyev.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, new ballets for the Christmas and New Year
season were previewed. And February will see the opening of
``Oprichnik,'' Tchaikovsky's rarely performed opera about the
secret police under Ivan the Terrible, which would have been
politically incorrect in Communist times.
</P>
<P>
   Vaslilyev, who criticized the way the Bolshoi used to sit on its
laurels when it held a monopoly, would be the first to admit that
his theatre has benefited from some healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road is the Novaya Opera (New Opera) of Vladimir
Kolobov, who spent years working in a disused cinema until Mayor
Luzhkov built him a splendid new opera house. And there are also
several opera studios that make Moscow, in the dead of economic
winter, a musical boomtown. &QL;

``Oprichnik,'' Tchaikovsky's rarely performed opera about the
secret police under Ivan the Terrible, which would have been
politically incorrect in Communist times.
</P>
<P>
   Vaslilyev, who criticized the way the Bolshoi used to sit on its
laurels when it held a monopoly, would be the first to admit that
his theatre has benefited from some healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road is the Novaya Opera (New Opera) of Vladimir
Kolobov, who spent years working in a disused cinema until Mayor
Luzhkov built him a splendid new opera house. And there are also
several opera studios that make Moscow, in the dead of economic
winter, a musical boomtown. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than 60 years after the pioneering aviator
Amelia Earhart disappeared without a trace over the Pacific Ocean
during a round-the-world flight, a group of American academic
researchers believes it is close to cracking the much-debated
mystery of where and how she died.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with new archival and analytical evidence, The
International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), a
nonprofit foundation based in Delaware, says Earhart and her
navigator, Frederick J. Noonan, almost certainly crashed on the
island atoll of Nikumaroro, which was uninhabited at the time. They
died either of thirst or starvation when rescue efforts failed to
locate them.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the group believes that key evidence in the case
was dug up by the British colonial administration in the Western
Pacific in 1940, three years after the crash, but was prevented
from coming to public attention because of forensic incompetence
and an insistence by the High Commission to keep the affair top
secret.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Commission's files, which TIGHAR has unearthed
in Fiji, London and Hanslope Park, the British administrator
charged with populating and governing Nikumaroro _ then called
Gardner Island _ discovered fragments of shoes, a sextant box, and
some human bones which made him immediately think of Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   The High Commissioner, Sir Harry Luke, swore him to secrecy on
the grounds that ``thinnest rumors which may in the end prove
unfounded are liable to spread.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of officials examined the evidence, but concluded that
the sextant was too old-fashioned to be used in modern aviation,
and that the bones belonged to a man, not a woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to TIGHAR, the British assessment was hasty and
inaccurate, assuming, for example, that Earhart was alone. Not only
was Noonan with her, but he had a habit _ according to evidence
garnered from his possessions _ of taking an old-fashioned sextant
box with him as a backup to a more modern aeronautical bubble
octant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bones, they were examined by a medical officer on
Fiji called D.W. Hoodless whose competence, according to TIGHAR,
appears to have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent studies commissioned by TIGHAR with the benefit
of modern forensic know-how examined the measurements and other
figures provided by Dr. Hoodless and concluded that the bones in
fact belonged to a woman of Earhart's stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most dramatic archival and scientific evidence to
date about Earhart's fate,'' said Richard Gillespie, TIGHAR's
executive director, who returned from a week-long research trip to
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office facility in Hanslope Park at
the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   What is still missing, however, is conclusive proof to crown
TIGHAR's painstaking detective work.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling piece of evidence would be the bones
recovered from Gardner Island, but nobody knows where they are.
They were put into a kanawa wood coffin ordered into storage by the
British High Commission immediately after Dr. Hoodless's
examination but the trail of paperwork on them runs out on April
17, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Earhart's fate has exerted an extraordinary fascination on
amateur historians and conspiracy theorists ever since she vanished
from the radar screens, aged 39, on the morning of July 2, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Already famous as the first woman to pilot a plane across the
Atlantic, among other feats, she was attempting a perilous
2,500-mile flight from New Guinea to Howland Island, about 350
miles northeast of Nikumaroro, when she announced over her radio
that she was coming in to land. That was the last anybody heard
from her.
</P>
<P>
   A massive U.S. Navy search concentrated its efforts around
Howland Island. Over the following days planes flew over Gardner
Island, part of the Phoenix Group, and noticed signs of habitation.
But nobody noticed signs of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the wildest theories began to circulate, particularly after
the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor. Earhart had been captured by
the Japanese and executed as a spy, some said.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappearance was orchestrated by the U.S. military as an
excuse to fly over the Marshall Islands where the Japanese were
suspected of building weapons installations, cried others.
</P>
<P>
   A Hollywood movie expanding on the espionage theory, ``Flight
for Freedom,'' was made in 1943 with Rosalind Russell and Fred
MacMurray. As late as the 1960s, books were being written
suggesting that Earhart was alive and well and posing as a nice old
lady novelist in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHAR's own efforts to unearth the truth began 10 years ago,
and from the beginning Gillespie and his colleagues chose to
concentrate on Nikumaroro.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 they found pieces of shoe including a replacement heel,
a rubber sole and a brass shoelace eyelet. These were subsequently
identified as coming from a woman's size nine blucher oxford of a
kind frequently worn by Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHAR also found some airplane fragments that may or may not
have come from Earhart's Lockheed Model 10E Special Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of TIGHAR's findings has been fraught with
controversy, however, with members of Earhart's own family
contesting her shoe size and Lockheed employees failing to identify
the airplane parts as an Electra or any other model.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Aeronautics Department at the National Air
and Space Museum in Washington, Tom Crouch, remains skeptical of
TIGHAR's claims and says he wants to see a ``smoking gun'' before
shifting from his view that Earhart and Noonan simply ran out of
fuel and crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gillespie of TIGHAR does not pretend to have answered
all the questions yet, and his group plans further field trips to
the Pacific and elsewhere in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the elements are there for a great mystery, and Amelia
Earhart has turned into an icon for many people,'' he said, ``so
anything we discover is bound to be controversial. But just because
we are criticized doesn't mean our evidence has been disproved.'' &QL;

WANT TO SHOCK A CALIFORNIAN? OFFER A GLASS OF TAP WATER

newspaper in London.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Want to know how to shock a Southern Californian?
Offer a drink of water, that's how. From the tap.
</P>
<P>
   In a part of the world notoriously wary of the ill-effects of
alcohol and caffeine, it isn't too surprising, perhaps, that people
like their water out of bottles.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just about fads or dietary preferences. It
borders on paranoia: offer a glass of tap water and you won't just
get a polite refusal, you'll get a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you drink it? It tastes awful,'' says one of our
neighbors. ``It is full of industrial effluent and you're poisoning
your children with it,'' says another. ``You can't drink the water
because the municipal pipes are full of lead and give you
Alzheimer's disease,'' says yet another.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very puzzling, since the Metropolitan Water
District, which covers the six counties of Southern California,
actually has some of the cleanest, and tastiest, water in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In a competition between different public water supplies held at
the Festival of the Waters in Virginia last year, it came out
number one in a blind tasting test. Its quality is tested hundreds
of thousands of times a year. But nobody seems to know this, or
even want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent Californians drink bottled water because they think it
is healthier and they prefer the neutral taste. Poor Californians
drink bottled water because many are first or second generation
immigrants brought up in cultures _ Latin American, especially _
that say you'd be crazy to trust the municipal authorities to keep
the water clean.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that everyone (well, everyone apart from a few
stubborn eccentrics like your correspondent) spends a small fortune
each week on bottles or giant coolers from one of the thriving
private water concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People even pay a premium for ``purified'' water on sale outside
supermarkets, even though this is no more than municipal water put
through a filter.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger companies offer to deliver water to your door, and
their salesmen spend considerable energy canvassing the unconverted
in suburban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was I buttonholed by a man from Sparklett's, one of the
most successful private companies, not least because its agents
have a reputation for catching and overpowering daytime criminals
and rapists.
</P>
<P>
   I almost overwhelmed him with the news that I drank out of the
tap. ``You can't do that,'' he explained in shocked tones. ``Tap
water contains a deadly bacteria called crypto!'' Crypto, it turns
out, is short for cryptosporidium, a genuinely unpleasant bug
derived from animal faeces that can get washed into reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin a few years ago, an estimated 100,000 people got
sick in a cryptosporidium outbreak. But Southern California has
never been perturbed by it, and the MWD has now developed a new
detection system to keep it out of the supply for good.
</P>
<P>
   There are more grounds for concern from industrial effluent.
Trichloroethylene, a potent factory cleanser, seeped into the
ground water of the San Fernando Valley at an alarming rate in the
late 1980s, forcing a costly clean-up and lengthy arguments between
the government and private manufacturers about who should foot the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   More recently a chemical called MTBE, which is added to gasoline
to make it burn more cleanly, was found to be leaking into ground
water aquifers. Several wells were closed until the mess was
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   Ammonium perchlorate, a rocket fuel component that can cause
thyroid problems and cancer, has recently been discovered in
Sacramento and in parts of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But even in these cases the risk to public health has been far
lower than the scaremongers _ actively encouraged by the private
water companies _ have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The ammonium perchlorate, for example, was found to exceed the
provisional ``maximum contaminant level'' of 18 parts per billion.
But this level was deliberately set extremely low. It takes at
least 3,000 parts per billion to trigger thyroid problems, and
200,000 parts per billion to induce risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Water is a sensitive subject in California at the best of times
_ Los Angeles stole most of its supply from upstate farmlands at
the beginning of the century _ and big private interests have often
been happy to distort the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Discrediting the public water authorities is a time-honored
tactic by property developers seeking to minimize the effects their
projects will have on groundwater levels.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why the bottling companies find it so easy to
win customers. ``They want to make big bucks and they feed on the
public's phobias,'' says Lynne Plambeck, an environmentalist and
former water board official in northern Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not required to do the testing that public water
agencies are and are undoubtedly not as safe. But in a town that
pays big bucks for a grande cafe latte, is it any wonder we want to
buy water as well?'' &QL;

   SEATTLE _ The remarkable thing about the Randy Johnson story is
that it just keeps going, like the Starr investigation. Most people
don't want to hear any more, but it has its own life now, and we're
all powerless to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest episode has the Mariner brass finally spitting back,
after many months of silence on the subject of how they could let
the game's dominant pitcher get away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Johnson is secure with the Arizona Diamondbacks for
more money than it would take to put a retractable roof over the
Grand Canyon, the presumption is that the Mariners can tell their
side without looking silly and petty.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, it doesn't work. But now that Johnson
has achieved his agenda of having his ego and bank account
engorged, for just a 20-minute commute from home, he comes off as
duplicitous and even more unprofessional than when he last wore the
compass rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner president Chuck Armstrong contends that Johnson long has
wanted to play for the Diamondbacks, a claim generally dismissed by
those who believed there was no way Johnson would waste the final
years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Johnson's agents, Barry Meister and Alan Nero,
informed him of Johnson's intent at an August 1997 meeting, in
which they urged him not to pick up Johnson's one-year option for
1998, and don't bother with a contract extension offer. In a rare
bit of documentary evidence in the case, Armstrong's claim is
backed by a story in the Arizona Republic in February 1996, in
which Johnson flat-out says, ``I've got two years left (with the
Mariners), and then I'll be coming down, playing with the
Diamondbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Johnson denied everything. But in hindsight, he was
telling the truth, albeit recklessly, in the Republic story. So
Armstrong's subsequent claim that the agents presented a plan to
get Johnson to Arizona in a trade has some credibility, even though
the D-backs officials deny any knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners spurned the advice of the agents and in September
1997 exercised their 1998 option for Johnson. That put the club in
a box with three weak options:
</P>
<P>
   -- Offer him a contract extension right away, which would have
to be around Greg Maddux's annual salary of $11 million. Two
problems: If the offer was low, the ultra-sensitive Johnson would
claim insult, however preposterously; if the offer was accepted,
ownership, panicked by ballpark-cost overruns, would have to pay
about a fifth of the club's payroll to a guy who plays in a fifth
of the games.
</P>
<P>
   -- Let him pitch through '98, win another division title and
hope good results would change his mind about staying.
</P>
<P>
   -- Trade him in the '97 offseason, and face the wrath of an
incredulous public trained that they gotta love these guys.
</P>
<P>
   As Seattle fans know, the Mariners chose Door No. 2. It turned
out to be a bag of donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Mariner official: ``In nine out of 10 cases, the player
in his (final) contract year overachieves to get a new deal. This
was the one out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't exactly quit on the Mariners, but his 9-10 record
and cranky moodiness belied his own written spring-training
statement that he would put contract issues aside.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mo Vaughn, Bernie Williams, Kevin Brown and other quality
free-agents-to-be, Johnson was unprofessional, not to mention
deceitful. Obviously, that means little to him, especially now that
it got him what he wanted. It's just a shame he smeared an
otherwise sterling legacy in a Seattle baseball history that has so
few.
</P>
<P>
   As for club management, it now creates the appearance of seeking
a measure of victimhood. The problem with that is it concedes that
the tail, in this case Johnson's agents, wagged the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Agents can make all sorts of knotheaded demands. It's up to the
club to dictate policy and direction. If the Mariners ignored the
agents and made a bona fide $10 million, three-year offer that
Johnson rejected, they could have watched Johnson cry his crocodile
tears in front of a skeptical public.
</P>
<P>
   A trade in the winter of '97, while still controversial, likely
would have brought more to help in '98 and beyond than the
midseason swap with Houston. Even though clubs would know he had to
be traded, he was still at the top of his game, and his new team
would have him at least a full year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst that could have happened, from the Mariner view, was
that Johnson accepts a generous Seattle offer, pitches well for
three more years and management pays for the deal out of its
postseason take. But since management was already convinced he was
headed to Arizona no matter what, there was little risk he would
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the possible permutations, the fact is the affair has
become one of those lose-lose deals where everybody comes out
looking bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could be that all this was for naught, because
Johnson really left to get away from the Mariner bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly an unreasonable position. If true, well, sorry
about the criticism, Randy.
</P>
<P>
   And good luck with those 72-win Diamondbacks.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Making his strongest statement to date on the possible cancellation
of the NBA season, commissioner David Stern emerged from a lengthy
negotiating session late Thursday night and proclaimed the season
unlikely to occur.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As I stand here today, it's more likely we won't have a season
than we will have a season,'' Stern said. ``It may sound difficult
to believe, but we met for 10 or more hours and made little or no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting of owners and the players' union, the first
since Nov. 20, ended just before midnight EST, the longest session
of the lockout. There was no indication when the next meeting would
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Billy Hunter was unhappy with the continuing
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being oppressive, overreacting, and we are not
inclined to give in,'' said Hunter, whose request for mediation was
rejected by the owners. ``We're not turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan was summoned for last-gasp heroics that perhaps
not even he can supply. After saving so many games for the Chicago
Bulls, Jordan is being asked to help save the NBA season, but that
might be difficult even for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was just one of the National Basketball Players
Association's big guns sitting across the table from NBA owners,
joining union president Patrick Ewing and vice president Alonzo
Mourning in New York in an effort to hammer out a
collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's presence meant the union intended to take the
discussions as far as possible in an effort to reach an agreement
before the season slipped away. But neither side seemed interested
in presenting new ideas, apparently content to hold firm on
proposals that have been deemed unacceptable for 157 days and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the two sides spent the first few hours ``feeling
each other out'' before breaking for lunch. They met again
afterward, with Stern's plea to the players to save the season
being the highlight of the day.
</P>
<P>
   After saying the season was unlikely, Stern softened somewhat,
saying, ``We don't say this is our last, final, no-holds-barred
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   So everything is pretty much where it was when all this started,
even though both sides agree the season probably will be canceled
if an agreement is not reached within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something has changed, but right now I can't be very
optimistic,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said upon his
arrival. ``We've taken a few (steps) back since our last meeting,
so we'll see. There's a sense of urgency, but the owners have said
they won't operate our business in a way that makes no financial
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hopeful talk the bargaining sessions could mirror those
in the 1994-95 NHL lockout, which wasn't settled until mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possible result here,'' Granik said. ``Obviously, our
seasons are not that different.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL played a reduced 48-game schedule, and sources say the
NBA has a 56-game schedule drawn up, with play beginning in early
January, if a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Progress had been made in the previous full bargaining session
Nov. 20, with owners coming up to 53 percent from their proposal of
a 50-50 split of basketball-related income, and the players
relenting on their demand for a 60-40 split, dropping to 57
percent. But the league has a problem with the players asking for
57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is not with individual issues; it's with the
entire mindset,'' Granik said. ``If the players really believe that
they have to receive 57 percent, or anything like it, then we can't
make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   They were close to a deal in that Nov. 20 session, but a
misunderstanding of how to implement a complicated escrow system _
one that would have had players withholding 10 or 15 percent of
their paychecks to give back to owners should spending on overall
player salaries exceed an agreed-upon percentage of revenues _
caused all the progress in that meeting to be erased. So one of the
first items on Thursday's agenda was whether to scrap the escrow
system, which would be in place for the final three or four years
of a six- or seven-year agreement. The players would like the
owners to share the burden of overspending, with a tax levied on
the highest-spending teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been skeptical of this whole escrow system for a while,''
Granik said. ``We just might have to start over with something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides remain far apart on other issues, such as the owners'
proposal for a change in the ``timing rules,'' which would force
teams that sign another team's free agent to forfeit the right to
go over the salary cap to re-sign their own Larry Bird-exception
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   It is a change the players refuse to accept.

SEAHAWKS' SHAWN SPRINGS HOPES TO MAKE STATEMENT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ As NFL trash talkers go, there aren't many
better than Keyshawn Johnson and Shawn Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Each is young and talented, and will likely let the other know
about it Sunday at Giants Stadium when Springs, the second-year
cornerback for the Seahawks, matches up against Johnson, the
third-year wide receiver for the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   These two grew up around the game, Springs as the son of former
Dallas Cowboys running back Ron Springs and Johnson as a ballboy
for six years at USC. They entered the NFL through the penthouse
door, Johnson as the first pick overall in the 1996 draft and
Springs as the No. 3 pick last year.
</P>
<P>
   They know the game. They know there are few who play it better.
</P>
<P>
   But their mutual respect for each other's games prompted some
bland comments this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn is a good player,'' Johnson said. ``Obviously he's
probably going to be looking to get some revenge from last year,
because we won that game and I caught some passes on him. But he's
a real talent and he's going to be for a long time in this league.
He'll have some Pro Bowls down the line. He's on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Springs, ``Keyshawn is a good player. Any time you get
a chance to go up against a young player who's an up-and-coming
receiver like Keyshawn, you've got to get up for a game like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. If only they could be miked on the field Sunday. Springs
and Johnson consider trash talking a part of the game, and each
believes it makes the game more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Springs is more concerned about making a statement of another
kind this week. He believes he's having a Pro Bowl season. He knows
others agree. He just hopes there are enough to send him to Hawaii
for the NFL all-star game in February.
</P>
<P>
   This week's matchup with Johnson in the glare of the New York
spotlight is one last chance for Springs to impress players and
coaches before they cast their votes next week. The AFC and NFC Pro
Bowl squads will be announced Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   And Springs will shadow the 6-foot-3 Johnson, just as he did in
Dallas two weeks ago against the Cowboys' 6-2 Michael Irvin.
Normally, the Seahawks have their cornerbacks play sides of the
field _ Springs on the left and Willie Williams on the right. But
Williams is 5-9, as is nickel-back Fred Thomas. At 6-foot, Springs
is not only the best option against the growing number of big
receivers in the league, but the only option. It's the biggest
reason they traded up in last year's draft to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Springs has come up huge for the Seahawks this season,
especially for a player who missed six games during his rookie
season with a fractured thumb.
</P>
<P>
   He not only has five interceptions, he has returned two for
touchdowns and came close to scoring with a third. But the
touchdown returns came in the first two games of the season, and
against NFC opponents. Since then, teams have not thrown to
Springs' side as much, limiting his opportunities to make more big
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the price you pay,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Springs has allowed only one touchdown pass this season, when
6-5 Mikhael Ricks out-jumped him for a pass in the end zone during
the Seahawks' Week 8 victory over the San Diego Chargers. Springs
also has a club-high 16 passes defensed and has improved his play
against the run, as evinced by his 59 tackles that rank fifth on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   But is it enough?
</P>
<P>
   New England's Ty Law leads the AFC with seven interceptions and
Miami's Sam Madison and Terrell Buckley each have six. Five other
corners also have five picks _ including the Jets' Aaron Glenn, who
was voted to the Pro Bowl last year; Baltimore's Rod Woodson, a
seven-time Pro Bowl selection while with the Steelers who will draw
votes for his reputation and out of respect for his comeback from a
serious knee injury; and Pittsburgh's Dewayne Washington, who like
Springs and Woodson has two returns for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn is right there in the hunt,'' said veteran cornerback
Terry McDaniel, a five-time Pro Bowl selection while with the
Raiders who joined the Seahawks in September. ``He has made the
plays that drew attention to him early and has continued to play
well each week. To get over the hump, you have to make the big
plays that get you noticed. Then it's a matter of playing
consistently well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brown agrees, especially with the comment about
consistency. He is the only Seahawks cornerback ever voted to the
Pro Bowl. That was in 1984. Brown now coaches the position for the
Seahawks and knows players don't always make the Pro Bowl the first
year they deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn is having a much-improved year. Whether it's a Pro Bowl
year, I don't know,'' Brown said. ``We have four games to play in
the season, and it's this time of year that the Pro Bowl players
usually come on. It takes being consistent for a full year, not
just a couple of good games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Shawn is progressing right along.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that is Springs' ultimate goal. To become the best,
one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I really try to do,'' Springs said, ``is get better
each game and every time I get on the field.''

DIANNE FEINSTEIN ANNOUNCES BID FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision
not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of
intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her
plans for re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senator said Thursday that she will seek
re-election in 2000, and will begin the effort later this month
with a fund-raiser in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I didn't run for governor is that I want to
continue in the Senate,'' Feinstein said Thursday in an interview.
``I believe I can continue to be effective in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   After three statewide campaigns in the 1990s, the 64-year-old
former San Francisco mayor has become one of the most recognized
and popular politicians in the state. Feinstein is frequently
mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic
presidential nominee in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not planning on that happening. . . . It's not a
possibility at this stage,'' Feinstein said. ``At this point,
everything in me is going to work toward continuing in the United
States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no Californian has ever done it, state election
officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at
the same time. Were she to win both elections, Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, would appoint a temporary replacement until voters elect
a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, bolstered by their strong showing in last month's
elections, believe they have a chance to regain control of the
Senate in 2000. Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 advantage,
but Democrats hold fewer of the seats up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and has earned
a reputation as a no-nonsense centrist who works well with
Republicans as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Her fiercest critics have been civil libertarians, who have
decried her efforts to restrict information on the Internet
(ranging from the dissemination of personal data to instructions on
how to build bombs) and gun advocates, who oppose her ban on
assault weapons, which was passed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans have expressed an interest in the seat,
including Rep. Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, who recently transferred
campaign contributions into a Senate campaign account in order to
keep his options open. Other Republican candidates mentioned as
possible contenders include Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., California
Secretary of State Bill Jones and State Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire Al Checchi, who made a bid for the Democratic
nomination for governor earlier this year, laid to rest rumors that
he might be interested in challenging Feinstein in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be senator,'' Checchi said Thursday from his
Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein estimated that she will need to raise at least $15
million to defend her seat, and will begin the process with a
women's event in San Francisco later this month. Large fund-raising
events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles
early next year. Feinstein has enlisted the help of longtime
political advisers Kam Kuwata and Bill Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that may boost her chances for re-election, Feinstein
has reclaimed her seat on the influential Senate Appropriations
Committee, which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual discretionary
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Feinstein gave her seat on the committee to Sen.
Barbara Boxer as a way to help her fellow California Democrat's
chances for re-election. Boxer used the position to help lobby for
_ and then boast about _ tens of millions of dollars for California
projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San
Francisco Bay. Boxer will now take Feinstein's seat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her priorities for the next Congress, Feinstein said
she will push for the construction of new schools and work to
discourage the practice of ``social promotion,'' in which students
are moved from grade to grade without any testing of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she will revisit the issue of guns and may
introduce legislation to require child safety locks, regulate
``Saturday night specials,'' and close a loophole in the assault
weapons ban that permits the import of large bullet clips.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate may be consumed with a trial of President Clinton if
the House approves articles of impeachment later this month, an
ordeal that she complained is evolving into ``Melrose Place on
Lafayette Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein initially issued an angry rebuke of Clinton after he
admitted to deceiving the nation about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Now, although open to a resolution to censure the
president, she has ``not seen anything'' to make her think Clinton
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's extraordinarily important that this chapter be
closed. I think worldwide the United States looks worse and
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein will have a good opportunity to gauge the president's
reaction to the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry. She has
accepted a White House invitation to accompany Clinton on a trip to
the Middle East on December 12, the day the House Judiciary
Committee is expected to complete its impeachment proceedings.

DIVIDED OVER THE FAMILY CHRISTMAS REUNION
</HEADLINE>
  (Adds city and state signatures to questions.) 
 FOR USE FRI., DEC. 4, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER. 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: It's that home-for-the-holidays season that's supposed
to bring us joy, but it's really tough this year. Both sets of
parents live fairly close and want us with them for the holidays.
My wife thinks we should go to her family's celebration, but I say
let's be with my mom, who is alone this year for the first time. I
know my wife doesn't like Mom, but I think she's being callous and
unreasonable. _ Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I suspect this problem has been going on for a long
time, but this is the year it's chosen to roost. It sounds as
though neither of you has worked out the ``where do we spend
holidays'' blues. You have been able to finesse it so far, but
finesse time is over. If you had started with a plan, you wouldn't
be in today's pickle.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get to it: With both families close by, holidays and
weekends can be negotiated by spending Christmas Eve with one and
Christmas Day with the other. Do a Thanksgiving/Easter tradeoff.
One year you can give one family first choice and the next the
other set of in-laws. Scheduling may be a pain in the neck, but it
can avert hurt feelings, nagging and fights.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed for you this year is your mom's status. She's
lonely, sad and needy. Your wife is afraid she'll never see her
folks on holidays again. You may view it as a temporary change, but
odds are that neither your mom nor your wife is looking at it that
way. What to do now? Sit down with your wife and work out that
holiday/weekend schedule which will reassure everyone. You don't
even have to stress your mom's special needs right now if your
schedule shows your willingness to be fair and open to both your
wife's and her parents' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're so close to Christmas Day, you may even be able to
negotiate a special, one-time-only joint celebration for both sides
of the family, and if you're really lucky, everybody will have such
a great time it may become an annual event!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for 12 years and
unhappy for the last 5. We've talked divorce, but we decided to
stay together for the sake of the kids. If we have agreed that's
the only reason we're still married, is an affair legal? _ Los
Angeles
</P>
<P>
   DR.JOY: Trust me, nobody stays together for the sake of the
kids. People stay together because they're afraid to be alone, or
because it's cheaper to support one household than two, or because
they're afraid of losing contact or status or money or friends, and
sometimes because they really care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   People who say they are staying together for the sake of the
kids are kidding themselves. Kids are almost always aware of the
tension, the whispers, the fights, the secret phone conversations
and the lies.
</P>
<P>
   So let's face it: Neither of you is staying together for the
kids. To pretend that you are uses them as chess pieces and more
importantly allows both of you to ignore your real feelings, so
nothing will get resolved. You and your spouse must sit down and be
honest with yourself first and then with each other about what each
of you wants and what each of you is willing to offer in return.
</P>
<P>
   Because you do have children in common, you will always have a
bond with each other, so the more honest you can be now, the better
your long-term prospects for calm and dignified interaction and
THAT is for the sake of the kids as well as one another.
</P>
<P>
   As for an affair, no-fault divorce has made affairs less
dangerous if both of you can agree and a great deal more dangerous
if you can't. The point is an affair is only going to complicate
matters now. Work on your marriage or junk it, but don't lie to
yourself or to each other about why you're together. And involving
someone else in this mess is just plain nasty!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I hate my body and there's lots of it to hate. I've
tried every diet known and I still look like the Titanic. My
husband nags me, my mother chides and I eat and eat and eat. Short
of having my mouth glued shut, is there any good way for me to lose
weight? _ Pelham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: From the sound of it, you are a professional dieter.
You know better than almost anybody how to lose weight, but the
problem is keeping it off. To do that, you need a better
understanding of why you eat, what you eat, when you eat, how you
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you have to understand is that you can't lose
weight for anybody but yourself. When it's just you and that jelly
doughnut, eyeball to eyeball, there is no amount of Mom or husband
that is going to keep you from blinking. It's you and only you. Ask
yourself if you are eating to assert your independence? Or to put a
buffer between you and the world? Is your weight giving you an
excuse for not finding a job or friends or clothes or being sexual?
</P>
<P>
   Start writing down everything, and I mean everything, before you
put it in your mouth. The very act of writing it down will force
you to ask yourself whether you really want it and help you
document when, why and how you eat. And put a picture of yourself
thin OR heavy on the refrigerator door for motivation (a naked
photo is best if there aren't kids around). Wait a half-hour to eat
whatever you were thinking of engulfing. Keep only good stuff _
that means non-fattening _ in the house, so you and your family
won't snack on trash. Think about getting out of the house. When
we're bored we are more likely to think about food.
</P>
<P>
   We put on weight when we take in more calories than we burn and
lose weight when the opposite is true. The former means better
eating habits, the latter means exercise. Exercise not only makes
you feel more in contract of your body and your life, but it gets
you away from the demon refrigerator and helps you metabolize food
more efficiently. If you think this is an argument for less dieting
and more exercise, you've read me loud and clear.

MINIMIZING HOLIDAY TRAVEL WOES  
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers can be especially un-jolly this time of year.
Airports and planes are full of people who don't travel very often.
While these are perfectly nice people, they don't know the tricks
of travel. Many of them don't use the technological toys --
laptops, cell phones, pagers -- that business travelers take for
granted. To help lessen the travel trauma, here are ways to cut
down on the hassles of holiday travel.
</P>
<P>
   Book early for bargain fares. If you don't book early, you are
not going to be able to find either an inexpensive flight or a
flight that's convenient. If you have to book a flight on short
notice during this season, be prepared to pay full fare. Flights
are usually overbooked, and someone is going to get bumped. The
full-fare passengers are more likely to be the bumper rather than
the bumpee. If you have to pay full fare, consider using your
frequent flyer miles to upgrade to first or business class.
BizTravel has a service called BizMiles that keeps track of your
points on both the airlines and hotel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Use the Web to check on your flight before leaving home. Most of
the airlines post flight information on their Web sites. Even with
a confirmation that the flight is leaving on time, you still need
to get to the airport early. The admonition to arrive two hours
before the flight is not to be taken lightly during heavy travel
periods. The earlier you check in, the less likely you are to get
bumped from a flight. Also, holiday travelers have lots of luggage.
Both curbside check-in and the ticket counter will have long lines,
so it will take twice as long to check in.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be an unwritten law of travel that all connecting
flights must be at the farthest point from your arriving gate. It
won't cut down on the run, but getting an idea of the layout of the
airport can at least let you plan your mad dash more efficiently.
QuickAid has links to the layouts and services of all the major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   The usual advice is to travel light and never check your bags.
It slows down your exit from the airport if you have to wait for
your luggage. But during holiday travel, do the opposite. Take only
the essentials (delicate electronics, any medication, and
toiletries) on the plane. Infrequent fliers don't seem to know what
can and cannot fit under the seat and in the overhead compartment.
You'll spend a lot of time waiting for too many of them to accept
that the bag they brought on board is too big and needs to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure batteries on all electronic gadgets are charged in
case you need to demonstrate to security personnel that they are
what they appear to be. Each airport seems to have its own rules.
Major American airports that are international hubs, like Los
Angeles and New York's Kennedy, tend to be stricter about checking
electronic equipment. For the rest, it is an even bet that you will
be asked to turn on your laptop after going through the security
check. The last time it happened to me, in Indianapolis, I had a
dead battery and had to go into a nearby office to plug it in. I
nearly missed my flight.
</P>
<P>
   Once through security, turn off all the gadgets, especially
pagers, that emit either infrared or radio waves before boarding
the plane. The jury is still out on what effect these devices have
on sensitive equipment aboard the plane, but why take a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Take public transportation into the city. It's not just airport
traffic that piles up during the holiday season, Most of the
highways to the airport are also the fastest way to major malls.
Avoid the stress of sitting behind the wheel of your rental car
stuck in a traffic jam. If you must drive, check road conditions at
RWA Direct's road conditions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Get to the hotel very early or very late. Checkout in most
hotels is noon, but most will tell you that check-in is after 3
p.m. If you arrive early, before 8 a.m., you're likely to get a
room that wasn't occupied the night before. Also, the check-in
lines will be non-existent -- everybody's checking out. Arriving
late, after 5 p.m., gets you a nice clean room and no check-in
line. You can find out the hotel's check-in and check-out policy on
its Web site. Many hotels are now starting to accept e-mail at the
front desk. If yours doesn't, it will surely have a fax machine,
and you can use your computer to fax them your arrival time. I once
did this from a plane that circled Boston for three hours, using
the AirFone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to take a client out to dinner, make a
reservation before you leave home, since restaurants can be busy
this time of year. You can use the Internet to find a good
restaurant. Check any of the city guide sites or Internet phone
books like Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to confirm your returning flight. A couple of hours
before you leave for the airport, check to make sure your flight is
on time and has not been canceled. You might try one of the pager
notification services like the one offered by Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient with your fellow travelers. It's only a couple of
days a year that you have to deal with the overload. Relax. This
too shall pass and you can go back to dealing with the problem of
talkative seatmates.

periods. The earlier you check in, the less likely you are to get
bumped from a flight. Also, holiday travelers have lots of luggage.
Both curbside check-in and the ticket counter will have long lines,
so it will take twice as long to check in.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be an unwritten law of travel that all connecting
flights must be at the farthest point from your arriving gate. It
won't cut down on the run, but getting an idea of the layout of the
airport can at least let you plan your mad dash more efficiently.
QuickAid has links to the layouts and services of all the major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   The usual advice is to travel light and never check your bags.
It slows down your exit from the airport if you have to wait for
your luggage. But during holiday travel, do the opposite. Take only
the essentials (delicate electronics, any medication, and
toiletries) on the plane. Infrequent fliers don't seem to know what
can and cannot fit under the seat and in the overhead compartment.
You'll spend a lot of time waiting for too many of them to accept
that the bag they brought on board is too big and needs to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure batteries on all electronic gadgets are charged in
case you need to demonstrate to security personnel that they are
what they appear to be. Each airport seems to have its own rules.
Major American airports that are international hubs, like Los
Angeles and New York's Kennedy, tend to be stricter about checking
electronic equipment. For the rest, it is an even bet that you will
be asked to turn on your laptop after going through the security
check. The last time it happened to me, in Indianapolis, I had a
dead battery and had to go into a nearby office to plug it in. I
nearly missed my flight.
</P>
<P>
   Once through security, turn off all the gadgets, especially
pagers, that emit either infrared or radio waves before boarding
the plane. The jury is still out on what effect these devices have
on sensitive equipment aboard the plane, but why take a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Take public transportation into the city. It's not just airport
traffic that piles up during the holiday season, Most of the
highways to the airport are also the fastest way to major malls.
Avoid the stress of sitting behind the wheel of your rental car
stuck in a traffic jam. If you must drive, check road conditions at
RWA Direct's road conditions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Get to the hotel very early or very late. Checkout in most
hotels is noon, but most will tell you that check-in is after 3
p.m. If you arrive early, before 8 a.m., you're likely to get a
room that wasn't occupied the night before. Also, the check-in
lines will be non-existent -- everybody's checking out. Arriving
late, after 5 p.m., gets you a nice clean room and no check-in
line. You can find out the hotel's check-in and check-out policy on
its Web site. Many hotels are now starting to accept e-mail at the
front desk. If yours doesn't, it will surely have a fax machine,
and you can use your computer to fax them your arrival time. I once
did this from a plane that circled Boston for three hours, using
the AirFone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to take a client out to dinner, make a
reservation before you leave home, since restaurants can be busy
this time of year. You can use the Internet to find a good
restaurant. Check any of the city guide sites or Internet phone
books like Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to confirm your returning flight. A couple of hours
before you leave for the airport, check to make sure your flight is
on time and has not been canceled. You might try one of the pager
notification services like the one offered by Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient with your fellow travelers. It's only a couple of
days a year that you have to deal with the overload. Relax. This
too shall pass and you can go back to dealing with the problem of
talkative seatmates.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 ARTS EDUCATION GETS A TECHNOLOGICAL BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gift-giving seasons come and go, but gloomy reports about the
state of the educational system appear to be as eternal as a
holiday fruitcake. Fortunately, a slew of new online and off-line
arts-education resources has arrived to help alleviate the latest
slice of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of schoolchildren is close to being
arts-illiterate, according to a recent study by the National Center
for Education Statistics. The survey of eighth graders found that
fewer than one in four attend schools where dance or theater is
offered, and only 25 percent could pick out a Cubist work from
among four paintings. (The nation seems to be training a population
of bad guessers, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley said the study
``verifies that most American children are infrequently or never
given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music,
the arts or theater. That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What's right is that an increasing number of educators are using
technology to interest children in the arts, just as their
colleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics
of reading, writing and 'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said last week that it
would spend $27 million to add a new children's center to its famed
Media Laboratory. Areas of research will include new digital
techniques for music, dance, storytelling and the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Arts education is important, and technology will be an essential
element in that educational process, said Mitchel Resnick, an
associate professor at MIT who is involved in planning for the
children's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the richest learning experiences come when people are
involved in designing, creating and expressing, and generally there
aren't enough of those experiences in the lives of children,'' he
said. ``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new
technologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with
those technologies than previous generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger
paints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited. We
want to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling
clay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of
expressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one intriguing program is already under development at
MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will
allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments
such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar.''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two
other high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already
opened their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Zeum, an art and technology center for children that
opened on Oct. 31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for
interactive art. Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot
structure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp -- a skateboarder's
dream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a
crew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using
visuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising. Ultimately, the
videos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of
recent creations can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila
Bergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and
indicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.
Already, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for
teens.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an
interactive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's
extensively renovated performance complex. In the A-Musing Room,
young visitors plug their hand-held ``instrument boxes'' into a
computer system that introduces them to such musical basics as
rhythm and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Many new digital arts-education resources can be experienced at
home. The composer Morton Subotnick has just premiered ``Making
More Music,'' a CD-ROM that provides more advanced exercises than
the fundamentals found in its highly regarded predecessor, ``Making
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   At the disk's core are two areas, ``Rhythm Band'' and ``Chamber
Music,'' that enable aspiring composers to draw marks on a page of
on-screen sheet music. The marks can then be converted into
standard musical notation and, more important, audible sounds.
Hearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of
photographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom. The disk's
graphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly
overcome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even
when a string of random marks is drawn on the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy
arts-education ventures. ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the
ever-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last
month and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying
teachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.
</P>
<P>
   But there is already much fun to be had. The student-activities
section of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth
of interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary
(``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated
(``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always know they're interested in the (art)
object,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director. ``One of the
things that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a
variety of life experiences. There's so many stories there, there's
so many opportunities to be charmed by discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but
similar program in the works. ``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be
launched Dec. 12, will provide interactive exercises like a
Java-enabled area for making collages. However, a recent addition
to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal
mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's
display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.
</P>
<P>
   Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an
educational vision. And that, said MIT's Resnick, is perhaps the
most essential element of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact of getting a lot of technology out there will
not necessarily do anything for the arts,'' he said. ``In fact,
without active effort, it won't be productive at all. You can put
all the finger paints in the world out there in kindergarten, and
that's not necessarily going to lead to great artists.''

LAPTOP PROGRAM RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gay S. Keyes, the mother of a sixth grader in Beaufort
County, S.C., first heard about a local school district program
encouraging middle school students to obtain portable computers,
she was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to a meeting in September to find out more, she
emerged with a case of sticker shock. To participate, Keyes
learned, she and her husband would have to buy the computer
outright for about $2,000, or arrange for private loans of about
$30 to $80 a month, depending on the repayment schedule and the
lender.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Keyes decided to forgo the purchase -- instead
putting in extra hours as a substitute teacher to buy a new desktop
computer for the whole family. She also decided to join other
parents raising vocal public questions about the program and its
costs. Keyes was one of the speakers at a school board meeting
earlier this month, where parents presented a petition, signed by
53 people, protesting the program as inappropriate for a public
school system dedicated to equal opportunity for all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong to be talking about that kind of investment
-- $2,000-- to families who don't have the means to consider it,''
she said in an interview this week. ``Public school is not designed
to be this way. It's supposed to mean access for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort County is one of about 515 school districts and private
schools around the country participating in the
increasingly-popular school laptops program, which is sponsored by
Toshiba and Microsoft. Families buy or lease the computers, bundled
with word processing and other software programs, with the hope
that portable computers can offer their children the ability to
take notes more easily, write papers and do research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 60,000 students and teachers in the United States
participate in the program, a big jump from two years ago, when it
was kicked off in 52 institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort County, a diverse oceanside community that includes the
wealthy Hilton Head area as well as numerous families so poor that
they qualify for free school lunches, was one of the pioneer
participants. Today, about 1,950 students, or about half of those
enrolled in Beaufort's three middle schools, have laptops through
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, the cost of leasing the machines was
subsidized for all participants by a nonprofit group set up to help
with the portables program, with the biggest subsidies going to the
poorest families. But this year, subsidies were restricted to 300
poor families, in large part because the fundraising efforts of the
program could not keep up with demand for the computers.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that middle class parents like Keyes were told
they would have to pay for the laptops themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was just asking too much, said Sheree P. Wright, a
mother of three, including one middle school student. ``People were
having to decide between buying a laptop or putting braces on their
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she said, parents questioned whether the
educational bang from the laptop program was worth the big bucks it
demanded. Wright noted that in parent-teacher meetings this year,
teachers have told her that her honor roll daughter is not missing
out academically by not owning a portable computer. And, she said,
she has heard stories that students who have had laptops for a year
or so do not make extensive use of them.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyes said it is unclear to parents how, exactly, the
devices are being used in classrooms, many of which are already
equipped with personal computers. ``We don't know what are the
benefits to the kids and how do they compare to just taking a
computer class,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another issue, too. Parents assert that even though
school administrators say the initiative is voluntary, anxious
young teens who want to feel part of the group feel pressure to
participate -- pressure that they in turn exert on their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol. You ask any sixth, seventh or eighth
grader who doesn't have it. They feel left out. You have enough of
that sort of thing with Hilfiger outfits,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor the program say it has ample precedents in
schools. Parents are routinely asked to contribute to everything
from field trips to the purchase of musical instruments, said
Margaret D. Rushton, a parent who believes that having a laptop has
helped her daughter become a more fluent writer.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Williams, a spokesman for the district, said laptops do
give children an academic edge. He said soon-to-be-released test
results, comparing middle school students who have the devices with
those who don't, show that on average the laptop owners are able to
avoid a slump in test scores that typically occurs with other sixth
graders.
</P>
<P>
   Williams conceded that to date there may be teachers who are not
making good use of technology in the classroom, but he said that
should change shortly, because teachers are receiving technology
training. ``In the worst cases, the laptop is probably used just
for note-taking,'' he said. ``We expect that to be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   As for peer pressure, Williams said parents could use the laptop
question as ``a valuable lesson to kids that Mom and Dad can't
afford everything under the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Toshiba and Microsoft say the Beaufort
parent protest is not the first time the program has encountered
resistance from parents who balked at the price. But, they insisted
that the program, which is voluntary in all districts where it has
been introduced to date, is generally accepted with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   However, for Wright, the program violates a principle of public
education, that no one child is better off than another because of
family income. ``It can't be voluntary if you don't have $2,000
laying around,'' she said.

LAWYERS ON THE BOTTOM TAKE AIM AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year when thoughts turn to ... salary
bonuses. That is, if you are a lawyer at one of the nation's top
law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are a few Web sites where young, overworked lawyers --
known as associates -- can go to trade the latest news and rumors
about end-of-year bonuses and salary pay scales. There is also
plenty of gossip about law firm culture, hiring possibilities and
the grind of making it at a competitive firm.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of a bulletin board ``club'' on Yahoo called ''
Greedy Associates,'' whose screen name is ``nowhitenoise,'' wrote
in a ``Founder's Message'' that the club is ``designed to give the
whiny overprivileged lawyers at the nation's most prestigious law
firms a place to discuss such pressing matters as whether or not
this $20,000 bonus is really going to pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   The club has grown to 125 members since it was founded in
September. According to access statistics on the site, 37 members
logged on Wednesday morning, and 219 non-members visited. Messages
on the site can be viewed by anyone, but only members may post
comments. Membership is free.
</P>
<P>
   The unvarnished notes, written anonymously by people with screen
names like ``DebitBoyz,'' ``Body_Count_Rising,'' ``NYCglamourgirl''
and ``happylawyer,'' can be childish, supportive, informative or
scandalous. They give a glimpse of what is on the minds of young
lawyers who toil late into the night on a dry legal memo or the
sixth draft of a motion concerning a business dispute between
toothpaste companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``jmkm'' described himself in a message on the board
as a ``greedy associate-to-be,'' indicating that he is probably a
law student. He noted that while an $87,000 starting salary at the
top San Francisco law firms was ``a ridiculous amount of money,''
it still trailed behind the $95,000 starting salary in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next day, a ``Greedy Associates'' member replied to
the message with a combination of self-pride and self-pity: ``JMKM,
I take it you mean that $87,000 is a ridiculously high amount of
money. When you are expected to work ridiculously long hours, pay
ridiculously high rents and service ridiculously high debts, I can
assure you that $87,000 will seem ridiculously low.''
</P>
<P>
   A young lawyer out of law school can make around $100,000 at a
major New York City firm during his first year of employment,
</P>
<P>
   according to the New York Law Journal, a newspaper that tracks
salaries and bonuses at the top firms in New York and that first
reported on the Greedy Associates sites. The figure includes a
routine annual bonus of several thousand dollars. But this year,
some firms are offering additional ``boom year'' bonuses'' of
$10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Greedy Associates'' discussion group, unaffiliated
with the Yahoo club, is located on a message board site called
``Inside the Web.'' It, too, hosts an exchange of gossip about
salaries and bonuses, along with other topics. Members include
``DeathbyLoans,'' ``MoMoney,'' SnobbyNewYorkloser'' and
``overworked_skadden_fool,'' a likely reference to the powerhouse
New York-based law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, correspondents discussed whether a law student was
better off taking a job at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett or Skadden
Arps (both have their good points, the members said). Others
tackled the question of which town on Long Island was a commuter's
paradise. One member touted Long Beach, with its yuppie-friendly
bars and boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Law students who are eyeing their first stint of real legal work
at firms during summer break now have their own place to gossip.
Earlier this month a new Yahoo club was formed, ``Greedy Summer
Associates.'' Founded by someone named ``Perks4US,'' the groupswaps
information on the size of summer associate offices at various
firms, the number of weekends off and the types of free sports
tickets offered by management.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Henning, a senior vice president and general counsel at
Hildebrandt, a law firm management consultant, said associates
already have ``a pretty good network'' of information about pay
scales thanks to articles in trade magazines, headhunter calls and
chats with colleagues. The ``greedy associates'' sites add to the
mix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Henning questioned the validity of the information on the
sites, given the notorious inaccuracy of anonymous postings on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms aren't going to be buffaloed by associate demands, even
though it is a seller's market for associate talent,'' he said.
``The best impact of these sites would be to stimulate the powers
that be at the firms to do a reliable survey,'' one that is not
based on Internet gossip, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sites' latent function as a pressure-valve for law
firm drones, Henning said gossip has always gone on in coffee rooms
and bars every Friday night after work. ``The Net just makes it
more available,'' he said.

   TRY THESE DELECTABLE COOKIES FOR MEMORABLE HOLIDAY TREAT
</P>
<P>
   Use these holiday cookies only as a guide _ we suggest
variations, but there are many more you could try. For the cut-out
cookies, we created the designs free-form _ only the French hen and
cow cookies were made with cutters, available from Wilton, the
cake-decoration company. Cutters can be found at most stores that
carry kitchen equipment, as well as in kitchenware shops or by
mail-order from baking companies.
</P>
<P>
   Linzer tarts are classic at the holidays, and with festive red
raspberry filling, they are lovely with any cutout you choose. The
same dough is used for cookies No. 1 (the pear cookie with
partridge cutout); No. 4 (calling birds, with drizzled icing); and
No. 12 (small drums, also with icing).
</P>
<P>
   LINZER TARTS
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla or almond extract
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 jar seedless raspberry jam (or your choice of filling _ see
below)
</P>
<P>
   Cream the butter, sugar and egg until soft and creamy. Beat in
vanilla and milk. Mix flour, baking powder and salt in separate
bowl; stir with whisk. Stir dry mixture into creamed ingredients to
make a uniform dough.
</P>
<P>
   Knead several times in the bowl, then flatten dough to a
3/4-inch thick rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for
2 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the chilled dough to 1/3-inch thick on a lightly floured
surface. (Keep unrolled dough in refrigerator to prevent dough from
becoming sticky.)
</P>
<P>
   For partridge and pear cookies, and calling bird cookies, cut
out six 7-inch tall pears. From three of the pears, cut out
partridge shapes. From dough scraps, cut out three leaves.
</P>
<P>
   For drum cookies, cut out rectangle drum and strips for drum top
and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookies on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake cookies at
350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until edges just begin to
brown. Cool on sheets one minute before transferring to wire rack
to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   To sandwich cookies: Spread uncut pear or drum bottom with
preserves. Top with cutout pieces. Dust with powdered sugar or use
icing as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 7-inch partridge-in-pear cookies.
</P>
<P>
   For the calling birds: Bake the partridge cutouts at the same
time as you bake the pears. Use icing of choice, or dust with
cinnamon-sugar for a snickerdoodle taste.
</P>
<P>
   For the drums: Cut out squares for the bottom layer, and small
half-moons or strips for the drum. Bake the dough and spread with
preserves. Use a squeeze-on icing for the x's.
</P>
<P>
   Variations and suggestions: Change the flavor and color of the
filling as desired; use any fruit preserves. Pear preserves are a
good choice for flavor; mint jelly for appearance. You also can
sandwich these cookies with chocolate, or roll nuts or coconut into
the dough. Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to half the dough to create
black-and-white layered cookies.

<P>
   The turtle doves of the song inspired us to bend the song a bit,
and make turtle-shaped cookies. Our version of the holiday favorite
has a realistic shape, thanks to the vanilla wafer ``shell.''
</P>
<P>
   TURTLE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter-flavored shortening (to prevent chocolate from
seizing)
</P>
<P>
   38 caramels, unwrapped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   25 vanilla wafers
</P>
<P>
   125 pecan halves, (about 1 pound), toasted
</P>
<P>
   Grease a foil-lined cookie sheet. Arrange five pecan halves for
each turtle, placing one pecan for the head and four others for
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Melt caramels with cream in double boiler. Or melt in
microwave-safe bowl on high power for 20 seconds. Remove and stir,
then microwave again on high for 15 seconds, repeating as needed to
completely melt candies.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle enough caramel to hold pecans together _ about 1/2
teaspoon. Add a vanilla wafer to the top of each set of pecans,
press to adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dollop about a teaspoon of caramel on top of the vanilla wafers.
Swirl the caramel, but try not to let it drop onto foil. Rinse
spoons in hot water as needed. Re-melt the caramel in microwave in
15-minute increments as needed to keep it workable.
</P>
<P>
   Place chocolate in zip-top plastic bag. Place bag in bowl of hot
water; allow to melt. Knead bag with fingers to make sure all
pieces are melted. Keep chocolate warm until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Snip corner of bag containing chocolate and gently squeeze out
dots or circle of chocolate on top of each turtle. Spread with fork
tines to create turtle-shell design.
</P>
<P>
   Chill to set.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 25 turtles.

</P>
<P>
   The yellow French hens and cute leaping lords are made from a
ginger-dough cutout. They're decorated with sugar icing that's been
made with lemon juice for extra flavor. Color the chicken with
yellow food coloring, and use tuxedo colors for the lord. (Note:
Black food coloring is available at stores that carry
cake-decorating supplies, or you can combine other colors to create
a dark blue or dark red for a more festive lord.)
</P>
<P>
   GINGER CUT-OUT DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dark molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground mace
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon orange extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   For icing:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons meringue powder _ see note
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice (more as needed for consistency)
</P>
<P>
   Melt shortening and transfer to a large mixer bowl. Add
molasses, brown sugar and dissolved baking soda; blend. Add spices,
orange extract and salt; blend again. Gradually add flour and mix
well, using hands if needed to work in all the flour. Wrap the
dough in plastic, refrigerate until ``ripened'' for best flavor _
at least overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough into fifths and
refrigerate all but one portion. Place dough on floured surface and
lay a large piece of plastic wrap on top to roll out to 1/4-inch
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out the dough into shapes with cutter or free-form. Transfer
dough to parchment-covered cookie sheets and bake until very light
brown, 4 to 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent overbrowning.
</P>
<P>
   Allow cookies to remain on sheet for 2 minutes before
transferring to wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Continue rolling and baking as above. Store cooled, iced cookies
in tins.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dough can be formed into logs, chilled very well, and
sliced very thin for simple, round Morovian-style cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Mix icing ingredients in small bowl. Use more sugar or lemon
juice to produce correct consistency for piping.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate cooled cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 8 dozen French hens, or 2 dozen leaping lords.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Meringue powder is available wherever cake-decorating
supplies are sold.

   The five golden rings and geese nests were made from the same
coconut macaroon dough. The one trick to these cookies is baking on
a day with low humidity. The dough, and cookies, will be very
sticky if made on a humid or rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT MACAROON WREATHS AND NESTS
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups grated coconut _ fresh is preferred, see note
</P>
<P>
   Decorations:
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon candies
</P>
<P>
   Candy-covered almonds
</P>
<P>
   Note: If using canned pre-sweetened flaked coconut, reduce the
sugar in the recipe to 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and lightly flour cookie sheet.
In medium bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar, flour,
salt and almond extract; mix well. Stir in coconut; drop by
tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased and floured cookie
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   To make wreaths, press dough into round shape and using the
handle of a wooden spoon, make a hole in center.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 325 degrees for 13 to 17 minutes or until set and light
golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For nests, press thumb into center of each cookie. Add 2 or 3
Jordan almonds to each. For wreaths, add cinnamon candies to
represent holly berries.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 12 cookies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Lovely meringue swans can grace your dessert tray _ if you're a
confident baker. Piped into delicate shapes, these are the most
fragile of all cookies and baking them is a test of patience.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make them the easy way _ and they're a nice
addition to the dessert tray for those who cannot have flour or
gluten _ you can merely drop the mounds of meringue onto a baking
sheet and hollow them to fill with a favorite flavor.
</P>
<P>
   MERINGUE SWANS
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup superfine sugar, or granulated sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   For coconut-whipped cream filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 250 degrees (cq); move both racks toward center
of oven. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or lightly
grease and flour sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Add cream of tartar
and salt. With beaters on high speed, add sugar a little at a time,
beating well after each addition. Test results by rubbing meringue
between fingers _ if grainy, continue beating. Beat until smooth
and mixture is shiny.
</P>
<P>
   Using a pastry bag and small star tip, pipe meringue onto cookie
sheets lined with lightly greased parchment paper (or drop by
dollops if desired).
</P>
<P>
   The swan necks and bodies are created separately. To make the
necks, pipe out the figure ``2.'' Using a large serving spoon, form
an oval mound shape for the bodies, and pull spoon up at one end
for the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookie sheets in oven and bake for 1 hour. Turn off oven
and allow to bake 1 to 2 more hours; watch to prevent browning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make filling: Whip cream until stiff. Add sugar and
whip until incorporated. Fold in coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Handling carefully, remove cookie sheets from oven. Carefully
remove swan bodies and necks one at a time from sheet and place on
work surface. With tip of very thin, sharp knife, cut a small oval
from top of body. Hollow body slightly with knife. With teaspoon,
mound coconut filling into swan body. Place swan neck in front,
pushing carefully into filling. Use cut-out oval pieces from swan
body to make wings; set into filling in swan's back.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 small swans.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Best when eaten right away if filled; if left plain, they
can be stored for a month in an airtight container.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A cookie cutter was used to create the cheesecake cow,
representing eight maids a-milking. A much simpler, and just as
pretty design, is to cut them into diamond shapes right in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   EASY CHEESECAKE BARS
</P>
<P>
   For crust:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   For filling:
</P>
<P>
   2 large packages cream cheese (16 ounces total)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   For topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 pint sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix crust ingredients and press
firmly into bottom of 13-by-9-inch pan.
</P>
<P>
   Mix filling ingredients and beat until very smooth. Pour over
crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Remove and cool 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together topping ingredients. Spoon and smooth on top of
filling. Return to oven for 10 more minutes. Remove and cool;
refrigerate. Chill very well if attempting to cut into shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 bars or diamonds.

</P>
<P>
   These delicate lace cookies, shaped into ladies' dancing skirts
and rolled into pipes, are also called Florentines. They are
elegant and the perfect accompaniment to a cup of hot espresso.
Don't let the kids help with these _ the hot-sugar dough can burn
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   LACE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   1 stick plus 2 1/2 tablespoons butter (don't substitute
margarine)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup light corn syrup (grease measuring cup for easy pouring)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons almond extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Move oven racks to center thirds of
oven.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy bottomed saucepan, mix and bring to a boil butter,
sugar and syrup. Remove from heat, but keep warm. Whisk in flour,
salt and extract. Dough will be thick liquid. Keep pan warm so
mixture remains pourable.
</P>
<P>
   Using nonstick cookie pans, or lightly greased parchment-lined
pans, drop 1 tablespoon liquid dough onto greased pan. Note:
mixture spreads widely; make only four cookies per pan. (You must
work fast to complete shaping of cookies once they are taken from
oven; do not make more than six cookies per batch.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake, watching carefully. When cookies are beginning to brown
around edges and are slightly brown in center, remove pan from
oven. Cool one minute only _ or until cookies do not wrinkle as you
slide spatula under them.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, roll up around chopstick to form pipes, or
drape over neck of funnel or around curve of wine bottle to form
curved shapes.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION: Both liquid dough and cookies are extremely hot _ keep
ice water for dipping fingers in after handling to prevent burns.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies will become crisp in a matter of seconds. If cookies
become hard before you can shape them, return them to the oven
briefly to soften for shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 18 large rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Add 1/3 cup finely chopped almonds to dough. Form
into shells by shaping on the back of muffin tins and fill with
cream cheese, whipped cream and sliced fruits for a formal dessert.
Dip edges of rolled cookies into melted chocolate and crushed nuts.
</P>
<P>
   DO'S AND DOUGHS
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips to make cookie baking easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the weather forecast before baking. South Florida's
humidity will wreck cookies made with cooked sugar, and those made
with egg whites. It also kills effectiveness of yeast, baking
powder and baking soda; replace those after three months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always preheat the oven unless otherwise stated in a recipe.
Move the oven racks as close to the center as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wipe and regrease cookie sheets between batches. Allow sheets
to cool to room temperature before washing and before dropping
dough onto them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chill rolled doughs for best results. Freeze slice-and-bake
doughs for uniform cutting. Use dental floss or fishing line to
make thin slices from the rolls, and to cut cheesecakes cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost all drop cookie doughs can be made into bars. Press
into a greased pan and bake at 350 degrees until done. A 9-by-9 pan
takes about 20-30 minutes at 350.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freeze most cookie doughs for up to three months. Drop cookies
or slice dough onto waxed paper-lined cookie sheets; freeze the
dough until hard and remove to pack into freezer containers and use
individually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use meringue powder instead of raw egg whites for royal icing.
It's available where cake decorating ingredients are sold.

   Linzer tarts are classic at the holidays, and with festive red
raspberry filling, they are lovely with any cutout you choose. The
same dough is used for cookies No. 1 (the pear cookie with
partridge cutout); No. 4 (calling birds, with drizzled icing); and
No. 12 (small drums, also with icing).
</P>
<P>
   LINZER TARTS
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla or almond extract
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 jar seedless raspberry jam (or your choice of filling _ see
below)
</P>
<P>
   Cream the butter, sugar and egg until soft and creamy. Beat in
vanilla and milk. Mix flour, baking powder and salt in separate
bowl; stir with whisk. Stir dry mixture into creamed ingredients to
make a uniform dough.
</P>
<P>
   Knead several times in the bowl, then flatten dough to a
3/4-inch thick rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for
2 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the chilled dough to 1/3-inch thick on a lightly floured
surface. (Keep unrolled dough in refrigerator to prevent dough from
becoming sticky.)
</P>
<P>
   For partridge and pear cookies, and calling bird cookies, cut
out six 7-inch tall pears. From three of the pears, cut out
partridge shapes. From dough scraps, cut out three leaves.
</P>
<P>
   For drum cookies, cut out rectangle drum and strips for drum top
and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookies on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake cookies at
350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until edges just begin to
brown. Cool on sheets one minute before transferring to wire rack
to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   To sandwich cookies: Spread uncut pear or drum bottom with
preserves. Top with cutout pieces. Dust with powdered sugar or use
icing as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 7-inch partridge-in-pear cookies.
</P>
<P>
   For the calling birds: Bake the partridge cutouts at the same
time as you bake the pears. Use icing of choice, or dust with
cinnamon-sugar for a snickerdoodle taste.
</P>
<P>
   For the drums: Cut out squares for the bottom layer, and small
half-moons or strips for the drum. Bake the dough and spread with
preserves. Use a squeeze-on icing for the x's.
</P>
<P>
   Variations and suggestions: Change the flavor and color of the
filling as desired; use any fruit preserves. Pear preserves are a
good choice for flavor; mint jelly for appearance. You also can
sandwich these cookies with chocolate, or roll nuts or coconut into
the dough. Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to half the dough to create
black-and-white layered cookies.

   The turtle doves of the song inspired us to bend the song a bit,
and make turtle-shaped cookies. Our version of the holiday favorite
has a realistic shape, thanks to the vanilla wafer ``shell.''
</P>
<P>
   TURTLE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter-flavored shortening (to prevent chocolate from
seizing)
</P>
<P>
   38 caramels, unwrapped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   25 vanilla wafers
</P>
<P>
   125 pecan halves, (about 1 pound), toasted
</P>
<P>
   Grease a foil-lined cookie sheet. Arrange five pecan halves for
each turtle, placing one pecan for the head and four others for
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Melt caramels with cream in double boiler. Or melt in
microwave-safe bowl on high power for 20 seconds. Remove and stir,
then microwave again on high for 15 seconds, repeating as needed to
completely melt candies.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle enough caramel to hold pecans together _ about 1/2
teaspoon. Add a vanilla wafer to the top of each set of pecans,
press to adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dollop about a teaspoon of caramel on top of the vanilla wafers.
Swirl the caramel, but try not to let it drop onto foil. Rinse
spoons in hot water as needed. Re-melt the caramel in microwave in
15-minute increments as needed to keep it workable.
</P>
<P>
   Place chocolate in zip-top plastic bag. Place bag in bowl of hot
water; allow to melt. Knead bag with fingers to make sure all
pieces are melted. Keep chocolate warm until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Snip corner of bag containing chocolate and gently squeeze out
dots or circle of chocolate on top of each turtle. Spread with fork
tines to create turtle-shell design.
</P>
<P>
   Chill to set.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 25 turtles.

   The yellow French hens and cute leaping lords are made from a
ginger-dough cutout. They're decorated with sugar icing that's been
made with lemon juice for extra flavor. Color the chicken with
yellow food coloring, and use tuxedo colors for the lord. (Note:
Black food coloring is available at stores that carry
cake-decorating supplies, or you can combine other colors to create
a dark blue or dark red for a more festive lord.)
</P>
<P>
   GINGER CUT-OUT DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dark molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground mace
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon orange extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   For icing:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons meringue powder _ see note
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice (more as needed for consistency)
</P>
<P>
   Melt shortening and transfer to a large mixer bowl. Add
molasses, brown sugar and dissolved baking soda; blend. Add spices,
orange extract and salt; blend again. Gradually add flour and mix
well, using hands if needed to work in all the flour. Wrap the
dough in plastic, refrigerate until ``ripened'' for best flavor _
at least overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough into fifths and
refrigerate all but one portion. Place dough on floured surface and
lay a large piece of plastic wrap on top to roll out to 1/4-inch
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out the dough into shapes with cutter or free-form. Transfer
dough to parchment-covered cookie sheets and bake until very light
brown, 4 to 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent overbrowning.
</P>
<P>
   Allow cookies to remain on sheet for 2 minutes before
transferring to wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Continue rolling and baking as above. Store cooled, iced cookies
in tins.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dough can be formed into logs, chilled very well, and
sliced very thin for simple, round Morovian-style cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Mix icing ingredients in small bowl. Use more sugar or lemon
juice to produce correct consistency for piping.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate cooled cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 8 dozen French hens, or 2 dozen leaping lords.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Meringue powder is available wherever cake-decorating
supplies are sold.

   The five golden rings and geese nests were made from the same
coconut macaroon dough. The one trick to these cookies is baking on
a day with low humidity. The dough, and cookies, will be very
sticky if made on a humid or rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT MACAROON WREATHS AND NESTS
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups grated coconut _ fresh is preferred, see note
</P>
<P>
   Decorations:
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon candies
</P>
<P>
   Candy-covered almonds
</P>
<P>
   Note: If using canned pre-sweetened flaked coconut, reduce the
sugar in the recipe to 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and lightly flour cookie sheet.
In medium bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar, flour,
salt and almond extract; mix well. Stir in coconut; drop by
tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased and floured cookie
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   To make wreaths, press dough into round shape and using the
handle of a wooden spoon, make a hole in center.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 325 degrees for 13 to 17 minutes or until set and light
golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For nests, press thumb into center of each cookie. Add 2 or 3
Jordan almonds to each. For wreaths, add cinnamon candies to
represent holly berries.

   Lovely meringue swans can grace your dessert tray _ if you're a
confident baker. Piped into delicate shapes, these are the most
fragile of all cookies and baking them is a test of patience.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make them the easy way _ and they're a nice
addition to the dessert tray for those who cannot have flour or
gluten _ you can merely drop the mounds of meringue onto a baking
sheet and hollow them to fill with a favorite flavor.
</P>
<P>
   MERINGUE SWANS
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup superfine sugar, or granulated sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   For coconut-whipped cream filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 250 degrees (cq); move both racks toward center
of oven. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or lightly
grease and flour sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Add cream of tartar
and salt. With beaters on high speed, add sugar a little at a time,
beating well after each addition. Test results by rubbing meringue
between fingers _ if grainy, continue beating. Beat until smooth
and mixture is shiny.
</P>
<P>
   Using a pastry bag and small star tip, pipe meringue onto cookie
sheets lined with lightly greased parchment paper (or drop by
dollops if desired).
</P>
<P>
   The swan necks and bodies are created separately. To make the
necks, pipe out the figure ``2.'' Using a large serving spoon, form
an oval mound shape for the bodies, and pull spoon up at one end
for the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookie sheets in oven and bake for 1 hour. Turn off oven
and allow to bake 1 to 2 more hours; watch to prevent browning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make filling: Whip cream until stiff. Add sugar and
whip until incorporated. Fold in coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Handling carefully, remove cookie sheets from oven. Carefully
remove swan bodies and necks one at a time from sheet and place on
work surface. With tip of very thin, sharp knife, cut a small oval
from top of body. Hollow body slightly with knife. With teaspoon,
mound coconut filling into swan body. Place swan neck in front,
pushing carefully into filling. Use cut-out oval pieces from swan
body to make wings; set into filling in swan's back.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 small swans.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Best when eaten right away if filled; if left plain, they
can be stored for a month in an airtight container.

   These delicate lace cookies, shaped into ladies' dancing skirts
and rolled into pipes, are also called Florentines. They are
elegant and the perfect accompaniment to a cup of hot espresso.
Don't let the kids help with these _ the hot-sugar dough can burn

</P>
<P>
   LACE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   1 stick plus 2 1/2 tablespoons butter (don't substitute
margarine)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup light corn syrup (grease measuring cup for easy pouring)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons almond extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Move oven racks to center thirds of
oven.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy bottomed saucepan, mix and bring to a boil butter,
sugar and syrup. Remove from heat, but keep warm. Whisk in flour,
salt and extract. Dough will be thick liquid. Keep pan warm so
mixture remains pourable.
</P>
<P>
   Using nonstick cookie pans, or lightly greased parchment-lined
pans, drop 1 tablespoon liquid dough onto greased pan. Note:
mixture spreads widely; make only four cookies per pan. (You must
work fast to complete shaping of cookies once they are taken from
oven; do not make more than six cookies per batch.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake, watching carefully. When cookies are beginning to brown
around edges and are slightly brown in center, remove pan from
oven. Cool one minute only _ or until cookies do not wrinkle as you
slide spatula under them.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, roll up around chopstick to form pipes, or
drape over neck of funnel or around curve of wine bottle to form
curved shapes.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION: Both liquid dough and cookies are extremely hot _ keep
ice water for dipping fingers in after handling to prevent burns.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies will become crisp in a matter of seconds. If cookies
become hard before you can shape them, return them to the oven
briefly to soften for shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 18 large rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Add 1/3 cup finely chopped almonds to dough. Form
into shells by shaping on the back of muffin tins and fill with
cream cheese, whipped cream and sliced fruits for a formal dessert.
Dip edges of rolled cookies into melted chocolate and crushed nuts.
</P>
<P>
   DO'S AND DOUGHS
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips to make cookie baking easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the weather forecast before baking. South Florida's
humidity will wreck cookies made with cooked sugar, and those made
with egg whites. It also kills effectiveness of yeast, baking
powder and baking soda; replace those after three months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always preheat the oven unless otherwise stated in a recipe.
Move the oven racks as close to the center as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wipe and regrease cookie sheets between batches. Allow sheets
to cool to room temperature before washing and before dropping
dough onto them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chill rolled doughs for best results. Freeze slice-and-bake
doughs for uniform cutting. Use dental floss or fishing line to
make thin slices from the rolls, and to cut cheesecakes cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost all drop cookie doughs can be made into bars. Press
into a greased pan and bake at 350 degrees until done. A 9-by-9 pan
takes about 20-30 minutes at 350.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freeze most cookie doughs for up to three months. Drop cookies
or slice dough onto waxed paper-lined cookie sheets; freeze the
dough until hard and remove to pack into freezer containers and use
individually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use meringue powder instead of raw egg whites for royal icing.
It's available where cake decorating ingredients are sold.

 &HT;    Rubin Carter urging Gov. George W. Bush to delay execution
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, who
spent 20 years fighting to erase his own wrongful conviction in a
murder trial, is heading to Austin to make the case for a Canadian
man on Texas Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, like U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, is
urging Gov. George W. Bush to delay the scheduled Dec. 10 execution
of Joseph Stanley Faulder.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Carter, director of the Toronto-based Association
in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted, say Texas may have violated an
international treaty by not notifying Faulder of his right to
contact Canadian consular officials after his arrest in the 1975
death of Inez Phillips in Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
   A similar argument was raised unsuccessfully last year prior to
the execution of Mexican national Irineo Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case once again brings international scrutiny to Texas
and the unprecedented pace of its executions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials say they didn't know that Faulder, a former
Alberta resident, was Canadian. He was imprisoned for 15 years
before the Canadian government and his family, who believed he was
dead, learned of his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, would be the first Canadian executed in the United
States since 1952. He was convicted twice for the slaying of
Phillips, matriarch of a wealthy oil family in Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was arrested nearly two years after the murder on
unrelated offenses in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, whose case was a 20-year cause celebre, said Faulder is
entitled to further review of his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the Canadian government didn't know of his
situation for 15 years is a clear violation of the treaty,'' he
said. ``That is the starting point from which all else flows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Governor Bush will listen. We hope the parole
board will listen. We are not coming down there to disturb or
disrupt. We just want to slow this thing down,'' he said. ``From
all the evidence that we have gathered we think there is a very
strong likelihood that perhaps you have the wrong man.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's conviction drew national attention after the
publication of his 1974 book ``The Sixteenth Round'' and a Bob
Dylan song entitled ``Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, while he was among the world's top middleweight boxers,
Carter was arrested after three people were gunned down at a
Patterson, N.J. bar. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1976.
A retrial led to a second conviction. But Carter was cleared in
1988 when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a New Jersey federal
judge's ruling that prosecutors committed ``grave constitutional
violations'' in a case that led to convictions based on ``racism
rather than reason and concealment rather than disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office confirmed that Margaret Wilson, his general
counsel, is scheduled to meet with the Canadians on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright expressed her concerns in a Nov. 27 letter to Bush,
saying, ``The consular-notification issues in this case are
sufficiently troublesome that they may provide sufficient grounds
for according discretionary clemency relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a Thursday letter saying the Board of
Pardons and Paroles, which is now reviewing the case, has had
sufficient time to consider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a board recommendation for clemency, Bush's only power
is to grant a 30-day delay in the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has had sufficient time to review Mr. Faulder's
petition in detail and should not require additional time to
examine the issues raised in the petition,'' Bush told Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Also pending is a case brought on behalf of Faulder and other
Death Row inmates by Austin lawyers who claim the clemency process
is illegal because the Board of Pardons and Paroles does not meet
in open session to review cases. State District Judge Paul Davis,
in a preliminary order that does not block the execution, sided
with Faulder and the other inmates this week.
</P>
<P>
   At a Thursday press conference, Bush offered up little sympathy
for Faulder's claim, noting that the consular-communication claim
has been raised unsuccessfully in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is in our state people get treated fairly,''
said Bush. ``But on the other hand we are going to uphold the laws
of Texas. People can't just come in our state and cold-blood murder
somebody. That's unacceptable behavior regardless of their
nationality.''

 &HT;    Man files lawsuit in battle to build fence
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Joseph L. Howard became disabled by
post-traumatic stress disorder after three tours of duty in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to find peace and privacy behind a 6-foot-high fence
around his Beavercreek home.
</P>
<P>
   The city's refusal to grant him a zoning variance to build the
fence has turned into another battle for Howard, who retired after
27 years with the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow people to have stockade fences all the way to
the front of their property,'' said Beavercreek City Manager Dan
Dubruiel.
</P>
<P>
   Dubruiel was responding to a lawsuit Howard filed recently
against the city in U.S. District Court in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the fence began on Aug. 10, 1997, when Howard
sought a variance to a zoning code that states, ``No fence, wall or
hedge shall rise over 3 feet in height within any required front
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   To justify the fence at his home, Howard attached a statement
from his physician detailing his condition and need for such a
fence.
</P>
<P>
   At a May 14 meeting before the Board of Zoning Appeals, Howard
said, he described how ``his handicap mandated that he have a
6-foot privacy fence to prevent him from injuring himself in
response to harassment by his neighbors which exacerbated both his
post-traumatic stress disorder and his heart affliction,''
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, the excessive amount of leaves that blew on to
his property from his neighbors yard that was causing him to rake
his yard was dangerous to his previously diagnosed heart
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the BZA's refusal to let Howard build the
fence violates the handicap discrimination provisions of the
federal Fair Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   Dubruiel said he has not seen the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Howard also wanted to build his fence to the
street while fences are usually set back 30 to 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks $1.1 million in damages and an order barring
the city from preventing Howard from building the fence.

 &HT;    Low oil prices means lost funds for universities
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cheap oil prices are a boon for consumers at the
gas pump, but they are a bust for a Texas university endowment that
earns money from selling oil and gas leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough time,'' said Dan Burck, executive vice chancellor
for business affairs at the University of Texas System. He
estimated that endowment income from oil and gas leases is down 35
percent this year, especially after the most recent lease sale
attracted few buyers and low bids.
</P>
<P>
   Construction projects and educational programs at the UT and
Texas A&AMP;M University systems are the beneficiaries of the $7.2
billion Permanent University Fund, which is made up of 2.1 million
acres of oil and gas lands in 19 West Texas counties. In past
decades, money from oil and gas revenues contributed the lion's
share of the money in the Permanent University Fund. That money was
invested in stocks and bonds, primarily, and today, oil and gas
income is about $3 billion of the overall fund, Burck said.
</P>
<P>
   An overall strong stock market this year will compensate for the
loss in oil and gas revenues, he added. A semi-annual lease sale
Nov. 18 raised$577,821 compared with $7.75 million a year ago. Only
31 oil and gas leases were sold covering 8,948 acres compared with
93 leases on 30,690 acres a year ago. The average winning bid per
acre this time was $64.58 compared with $252.56 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened is people are simply not prepared to spend
money leasing land for oil and gas exploration when the price of
oil is so low,'' said Pam Bacon, a UT System attorney and secretary
to the Board for Lease of University Lands. ``The companies simply
can't afford to spend more and make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said she was not surprised by the poor sale. The price of
oil is down to about $11 a barrel, its lowest level in a dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   While UT would like to have the lease money it earned last year,
she said, several million dollars won't break a fund that's in the
billions. ``Given the size of the fund, the $7 million is not
critical,'' Bacon said. UT officials, however, are concerned about
the oil market and have been trying to drum up interest in the oil
and gas leases by cutting the minimum lease price and reducing
royalty payments if operators meet certain conditions, Burck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are searching and striving to work with industry to
maintain a level of activity, but we also recognize the operators
are in dire straits right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot is the Board for Lease managed to stimulate
interest in unexplored territory in West Texas, he said. It sold
leases on frontier land in Hudspeth County for the first time in
July. In all, 414 oil leases were awarded, bringing $2 million into
the university fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had sales that were 10 times better than we thought
they would be,'' Burck said. ``But now we've kind of hit the
wall.''

 &HT;    MTV host: `It's not about being beautiful' (Yeah, right)
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So it's Tuesday afternoon and supermodel
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is sitting in Miami Beach with an aloe leaf
stuck to her chest. California girl and swimsuit model gets
sunburn. ``You think I'd know by now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She has been outside all day filming a fashion show for MTV's
House of Style, of which she is the host. She has maybe three hours
before bedtime. She goes to bed at 7 or 8 every night. That's
beauty sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's no problem for her husband of two months, actor John
Stamos, because he does the same thing. (By the way: He proposed to
her in the buff, she reports, after a ``very intimate moment.'')
</P>
<P>
   She has a few minutes before dinner to talk about model life.
Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Age: 26.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Modeling for eight years. Was a student at UC-Santa
Cruz when a modeling agent in San Francisco talked her into moving
to Paris. Her first ``gig'' was the cover of French Elle. You might
have seen her in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, or in Tommy
Hilfiger ads, or J. Crew catalogs. She's been the House of Style
host for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now lives in: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on: Just shot the upcoming SI swimsuit issue and
can't talk about it, except to say they are doing something ``very
tantalizing'' they've never done before.
</P>
<P>
   Going topless? ``Not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Location of shoot: A secret.
</P>
<P>
   Penalty for talking about it: Getting her photos cut out of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Worst photo shoot ever: ``A horrible, horrible shoot for a
Japanese car ad with a German photographer who did not let us sleep
for three days. We were in the Mojave Desert and drove roughly nine
hours a day, and we slept roughly from 1 to 4 a.m. with no
breakfast. I kept trying to walk off the job, but there was nowhere
to go. I finally walked up to him and said, `This is insane.' He
didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   How to tell if it's going to be a bad shoot: No communication
between the people in charge and the ``talent.'' No respect.
</P>
<P>
   Best shoot: ``The SI shoot in Kenya last year. We took a safari
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Number of safaris on this year's shoot: ``I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Number of deep-sea diving excursions on this year's shoot: ``I
can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Is modeling something you have to practice? ``It's something you
learn. If I look at my early pictures I go, `Oh my God, I can't
believe I worked the light that way.' You learn your good side.''
</P>
<P>
   Her good side: The right side. ``My nose is crooked, and it
looks smaller from the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tattoos: A little one on her left ankle of the letters ``j,''
``r,'' ``s'' and ``e'' intertwined. She and her three best friends
got the identical tattoos when she was 18. The initials stand for
``Jennifer,'' ``Rebecca,'' ``Susannah'' and ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan to prevent aging: ``I'm looking forward to aging. It's not
something scary to me. I've seen some models stop working at 25 and
let their lives dwindle away.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous people she'd like to see as models: ``The thing is,
everyone can be on a magazine cover these days. The face of fashion
has changed so much. It's not about being beautiful anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Number of people with braces she's seen on magazine covers:
Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast: Three eggs, two waffles.
</P>
<P>
   Workout: Three hours of Pilates a week.
</P>
<P>
   Last thing she checks in mirror before making an appearance:
``First I make sure nothing is coming out of my nose. Then I check
that my eyebrows are not messy. And I check my teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids: Going to wait a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Swimsuit-wearing advice: Work out. Black is always a good color.
Don't necessarily follow swimsuit fashion. ``I just wore a monokini
_ a bikini attached down the middle with a tiny strip. I didn't
find that very flattering. And if you have any bosom at all,
bandeau tops are deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice on how to keep a swimsuit bottom from riding up: None,
unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Worst elementary-school photo: ``My dad used to get me and my
sister ready for school every morning, and he would come to me with
a handful of those little plastic barrettes and ask which ones I
wanted to wear. I would say, `All of them.' I took my kindergarten
picture like that. And in second grade I had my hair in Princess
Leia buns, with a cold sore on my lip.''

 &HT;    Another year, another Christmas card picture: Make it memorable
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Nicole Piscopo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The annual Christmas picture. Chase the
kids around and force them into their best holiday clothes. Stand
them in front of . . . in front of . . . something and click off a
few frames. Then fetch the pictures from Walgreens and wonder why
everyone looks as joyful and relaxed as British beefeaters.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers at The Post aim to spread a little good cheer with
a few picture-taking suggestions. The tips are point-and-shoot
friendly (even the pros use those in their spare time) and useful
all year around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just about every ``rule'' is broken at some point,
often with wonderful results, says photo editor Mark Edelson. ``But
there are some basic pointers beginners can keep in mind that will
usually improve the quality of their pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Choose a clean background that doesn't distract from your
subject.
</P>
<P>
   2. Use outdoor light, if possible, but time your shoot for
earlier in the day and later in the afternoon (before 10 a.m. or
around 4 p.m., this time of the year.) Northern light is always the
softest, but cross light _ when a ray skims across a person's face
_ can be flattering, too. Avoid sun directly in your subject's
face.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shoot a lot of film. ``Four pictures won't cut it,'' photo
editor Mark Edelson says. ``Shoot an entire roll or more. The
relative expense is tiny.'' The more you shoot, the better the
likelihood there will be of at least one really good shot of
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   4. Shoot children at their level. ``So many of us adults tend to
point down our cameras,'' says Photo Director Pete Cross. ``In my
daughter's case, she was too young to stand so I laid her down on
the rug, then shot her from a ladder overhead. But we're at the
same eye level.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Look at everything. Don't focus so much on the kids that you
forget to eyeball what's around them. ``If there's a part of the
frame that has someone's foot, or telephone lines in it, or
whatever, it will also appear in your card,'' says Cross. ``Look at
everything before you press the button to avoid that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, just bending down six inches or a foot can make a
big difference in cleaning up what's in your picture,'' says
Edelson.
</P>
<P>
   6. Make faces prominent. For the most part, it's best to avoid
standing back and shooting full length. And ``amateurs tend to put
people's heads in the middle of the frame, leaving a lot of space
at the top.'' says photographer Sherman Zent. ``But if there's
really nothing interesting at the top of the frame, put your
subject's head there.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Avoid filling the frame entirely. Mass processing almost
always ensures part of the image will be lopped off, and card
frames shave off more of the image. (Edelson recommends composing
the picture you like and then stepping back a foot.)
</P>
<P>
   8. Experiment. ``Shoot what you think is a person's best angle,
then try a few more,'' says Edelson. Hint: Shooting up the nostrils
is almost always unflattering.
</P>
<P>
   9. Bribe. Clown around and be silly. Have treats standing by.
Commanding everyone to smile won't work, unless you like a stiff,
frozen look. ``The goal is to make everyone happy,'' says Edelson.
``You can always punish them later!''
</P>
<P>
   10. Avoid the ``say cheese'' rut. On the other hand, every
picture doesn't have to include smiling children. Children cry.
Children get cranky. ``Get some shots of them looking natural,''
says Zent. ``If you don't, every photo you have will be of your kid
smiling.''

 &HT;    REVIEW: `Love is the Devil'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If ever a painter's surname hinted at the flavor
of his work, Francis Bacon's came bloody close. For instance, when
I think bacon, I think slaughtered farm fauna and greasy slabs of
livid meat. When I think Bacon, I get the same image, though
without the side of home fries.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Love Is the Devil,'' an ultra-bleak biopic of the
late British artist, which has sufficient blood but little meat _
literally and narratively. Bacon's estate barred the use of his
work in the film, so we never see those apocalyptic canvases, those
fetid visions of exalted morbidity: riven carcasses, screaming
human figures and molested crucifixes, all dunked in the bruised
hues of viscera.
</P>
<P>
   We do see Derek Jacobi's courtly Bacon slather goopy globules of
pigment across canvases in convulsive herks and jerks. But, like
these hinted-at paintings, the story of Bacon and his turbulent
love affair with a troubled young man remains fractured and
incomplete. The film is almost totally devoid of engaging drama,
let alone a clear portrait of Bacon's life and career, relying too
much on visual pyrotechnics and one or two interesting character
sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devil,'' written and directed with conceptual exuberance by
John Maybury, is in dizzy, implacable love with the voluptuous.
Maybury caresses textures, wringing from them the metaphorical.
Some of the images _ the fun-house mirror reflections of characters
in water and metal surfaces, disquieting fish-eye close-ups _
become key visual motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybury scrapes Bacon's id, not his ego, and this makes for
mounds of inscrutable psychological doodling and scarce coherence.
The whole thing, as striking and haunting as it is, shivers in the
clammy, disjointed rhythms of a fever-dream. It's a phantasmagoria
of sex (largely homosexual), squalor, death, art and epic
dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic about nothing,'' says Jacobi in voice-over,
and then the film might cut to a naked man who looks freshly
skinned, bent on all fours atop a perilously thin plank, yowling
into the void. Part of a Bacon painting? The primal scream of the
artist's inner demon? Bad gas?
</P>
<P>
   This opaque sequence, and the many like it, revel in baroque
artifice, which tantalizes us as it wears. Linear clarity is often
sacrificed for the fantastical: When Bacon's face is splattered
with blood from a boxing ring, he is seized by glassy-eyed rapture,
deriving an erotic charge from the bloodbath. Bun(tilde)uel would
be proud.
</P>
<P>
   Hiccups of story tell how George Dyer, Bacon's lover and model
of seven years, enters the cantankerous artist's life (with a
dramatic crash) and how the couple emotionally batter one another
until Dyer attempts suicide. Yet Dyer (an elusive Daniel Craig)
exerts a galvanizing effect on the older man, who in turn tries to
assimilate the youth into his coterie of bibulous friends, whom he
dubs his ``concentration of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi's vain and bitchy Bacon bubbles with Wildean wit, but his
doling out of tidy epigrams at will _ ``Champagne for my real
friends, real pain for my sham friends'' _ becomes schematic and
implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the dazzle Maybury lavishes on his tale, we never get
to know Bacon's casually cruel monster, nor decipher his abstract
love for Dyer, who seems little more than a trophy beau, an X-ray
in Bacon's bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Cinematically, ``Love Is the Devil'' has a great deal to
recommend it, and I do. I relished its horrible beauty, even as its
sensorial feast left me hungry.
</P>

 &HT;    Keep your Christmas simple
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Don Andrus is doing his part to turn a
shop-worn cliche into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal Jupiter resident peddles bumper stickers every
December urging all to ``Keep Christ in Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrus, 68, distributes about 3,000 stickers through his modest
crusade in Guilford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping seems to be the principal culprit that threatens to
shut Christ out of his own birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   The season's endless list of gifts to buy and cards to address
exhausts the faithful and perverts the holiday. The poor and
outcast for whom Christ was born are often unable to take part in
the extravagant celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jews suffer from a commercial Christmas madness that
ripples into their Hanukkah celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the message of Christmas itself, there is hope. For
some, the shopping orgy has peaked, and they are shaping new ways
to keep Christmas centered on Christ.
</P>
<P>
   A few courageous souls do no holiday shopping at all. Others buy
gifts through the year and resist the lure of the mall in December.
</P>
<P>
   Still others make original gifts or give the best presents of
all: themselves, their time and attention.
</P>
<P>
   The brave send fewer Christmas cards, learn to say no to some
parties and concentrate on their families.
</P>
<P>
   More people are trying to plan the holiday around family, food
and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we want most of all, maybe, is a greater sense of
the divine,'' said Bill McKibben, author of a ``Hundred Dollar
Holiday, The Case for a More Joyful Christmas'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1998, 96 pages, $12.) ``It's a shame that Christmas is so
surrounded by other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McKibben spreads a gospel that Christmas doesn't come from a
store and urges people to consider spending no more than $100 for
the holiday. Give fewer gifts or make your own presents, he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The best present of all may be a gift certificate that is a
claim on your time to take a walk, read a book or do the dishes for
someone.
</P>
<P>
   McKibben claims that many American Christmas customs were shaped
in the 19th century when the country was poor and hard working.
What made the holiday special then was having a lot of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But, in this time of affluence that is no longer true. Many
people have all they need and more than they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make Christmas really special to have a heap of
presents,'' McKibben said.
</P>
<P>
   Now we want time with family and opportunities to build
relationships and talk with one another.
</P>
<P>
   We should shape our Christmas traditions to meet those needs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital chaplain Kenneth Bowling agrees. He will not waste time
or money shopping in December. He has children and grandchildren,
but he buys them things all through the year, he said. Christmas is
not about gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to go to the mall,'' said Bowling, 50, a chaplain at
Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach. ``We do Christ a
disservice when we get caught up in gift-buying, even though He is
the ultimate gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Families with young children have a particular challenge to
focus on the meaning of the Christmas event often dominated by
Teletubbies, a red-nosed reindeer and Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Locke, 7, and her sister Shelley, 4, share Christmas
stories in December with their parents. They read a children's
devotional Bible every night before bed, said their father, the
Rev. Dale Locke. He is pastor of Community of Hope United Methodist
Church in Royal Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockes take advantage of the largely forgotten church season
of Advent to hold at bay the secular forces that start Christmas
celebrations in November.
</P>
<P>
   The four-week period of anticipation and preparation before
Christmas is often marked with a wreath of greens and four candles.
</P>
<P>
   Each night a family member lights a candle, reads a portion of
Scripture and offers a prayer. An additional candle is lighted to
mark each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built an Advent wreath through the month,'' Locke said.
``Another year we opened a different little gift each night, an
angel, a wise man, to hang on the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lockes keep a tight budget and buy nothing on credit for
Christmas. That helps stem the temptation to spend too much.
</P>
<P>
   A few people have given up Christmas traditions completely, trim
no tree, give no presents, accept no invitations, prepare no
banquets and do not worship, but they love Christmas, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They use the holiday for reflection and retreat from the busy
world and as a time to serve their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed our focus,'' said Elaine St. James, author of
``Simplify Your Christmas'' (Andrew McMeel, 1998, 270 pages,
$14.95) ``We began to look at what we can contribute to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James admits most people do not want to discard Christmas
completely as she has. Her book includes 100 ways to make the
holiday simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her suggestions are about resisting the urge to shop.
Turn off the television in December, stop reading women's magazines
and shut out the commercial cry that shopping is the only way to
celebrate the birth of Jesus, she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas gift-giving even challenges Jews who try to mark
Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day holiday begins on Dec. 13 this year and is
burdened by its proximity to the Christmas madness.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews celebrate that festival of religious freedom by
capitulating to Christmas trees, cards and presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to what the holiday is,'' said Susan Levine, a
member of Temple Judea in West Palm Beach. ``It is a celebration of
rededication and religious freedom. Don't get caught up in the
gift-buying frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   The demands of gift-giving that mean spending inordinate time,
energy and money shopping can make the faithful lose sight of the
reason for the holiday. The celebration becomes a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is possibly something demonic in the huge toy
stores,'' said the Rev. Fred LaCrone, pastor of Grace Episcopal
Church in West Palm Beach. ``I wonder what we are teaching our kids
_ to be frantic and acquisitive? That's the opposite of what Christ
teaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Give a gift to your church or to a homeless shelter or soup
kitchen in honor of Jesus' birth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And recover Advent as a way of preparing for Christmas with
expectation rather than exasperation. We can do that, he said, by
saying yes to fewer parties and no to more gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, LaCrone loves the joy, even the frenzy, of the holiday.
He would never favor a return to colonial times when Christmas
celebration was banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all in favor of celebration and parties and jumping
around,'' said LaCrone. ``I think the Puritan Christmas must have
been terrible.''

 &HT;    New books just in time for Christmas
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sterling Publishing Co. is out with two very handsome
new books for woodworkers, just in time to make some Christmas
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine Decorative Boxes'' by Andrew Crawford ($19.95 in
softcover) and ``Making Shaker Woodenware'' by Kerry Pierce ($17.95
in softcover) both concern the construction of small things, and
both are handsomely-made books, but the similarities fade after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's book offers 10 projects preceded by a 17-page
discourse on tools and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's designs for the projects range from the very elegant
to the somewhat inelegant. The box carcases are constructed of
high-quality 3/8-inch plywood and covered with fine veneers, which
are then detailed with various inlays.
</P>
<P>
   Much use is made, in the more successful designs, of curved lids
and sides.
</P>
<P>
   The last section of the book is a gallery, and to many
woodworkers it will be the best part. There are some simply
incredible pieces here, some made by the world's premier box makers
such as Po Shun Leong and Michael Brolly. The only piece I don't
care for in the entire gallery is an otherwise very nice box by
Fiona McVey whose sides are joined with clunky machine-made
dovetails.
</P>
<P>
   You will find no machine-made dovetails in Pierce's book.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an American style of woodworking, it would have to
be Shaker. Its simplicity has to appeal to virtually every
woodworker, but its inherent elegance is not so easily achieved.
Shaker cabinetmakers were masters of the just proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the book is taken up with discussions of
Shaker woodworking techniques, design principles and tools as well
as a brief explanation of this strange sect, which never numbered
much more than 6,000, and which is, of course, now utterly defunct
because they were committed to celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   There follow 13 projects, all within the reach of a careful and
committed beginning craftsman. Kitchen projects include several
scoops and dippers and a couple of very typical high-sided serving
trays.
</P>
<P>
   There's a section on items for the sewing room, including
clothes hangers and a lovely little two-step stool.
</P>
<P>
   Items for the workroom are mostly boxes and carriers, which are
just boxes with handles and no lids.
</P>
<P>
   The book concludes with the ubiquitous oval bentwood boxes.
These are easily the most difficult pieces in the book, requiring
molds around which the soaked sides are bent, and delicetly scarfed
joints.
</P>
<P>
   If you admire the Shaker style and want to try your hand at
simple iterations of it, this is an excellent place to start. You
get a taste of the idiom and the reasoning behind it as well as the
technique.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ True holiday bakers know you can't make
just one kind of cookie. So how about 12? Here are a dozen ideas to
go with the Christmas carol. And don't forget to sing while you're
at it!
</P>
<P>
   12 drummers drumming
</P>
<P>
   Linzer tarts with raspberry filling
</P>
<P>
   11 pipers piping
</P>
<P>
   Rolled lace cookies

</P>
<P>
   Ginger cutouts
</P>
<P>
   9 ladies dancing
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Linzer tart with raspberry filling
</P>
<P>
   TRY THESE DELECTABLE COOKIES FOR MEMORABLE HOLIDAY TREAT
</P>
<P>
   Use these holiday cookies only as a guide _ we suggest
variations, but there are many more you could try. For the cut-out
cookies, we created the designs free-form _ only the French hen and
cow cookies were made with cutters, available from Wilton, the
cake-decoration company. Cutters can be found at most stores that
carry kitchen equipment, as well as in kitchenware shops or by
mail-order from baking companies.
</P>
<P>
   Linzer tarts are classic at the holidays, and with festive red
raspberry filling, they are lovely with any cutout you choose. The
same dough is used for cookies No. 1 (the pear cookie with
partridge cutout); No. 4 (calling birds, with drizzled icing); and
No. 12 (small drums, also with icing).
</P>
<P>
   LINZER TARTS
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla or almond extract
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 jar seedless raspberry jam (or your choice of filling _ see
below)
</P>
<P>
   Cream the butter, sugar and egg until soft and creamy. Beat in
vanilla and milk. Mix flour, baking powder and salt in separate
bowl; stir with whisk. Stir dry mixture into creamed ingredients to
make a uniform dough.
</P>
<P>
   Knead several times in the bowl, then flatten dough to a
3/4-inch thick rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for
2 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the chilled dough to 1/3-inch thick on a lightly floured
surface. (Keep unrolled dough in refrigerator to prevent dough from
becoming sticky.)
</P>
<P>
   For partridge and pear cookies, and calling bird cookies, cut
out six 7-inch tall pears. From three of the pears, cut out
partridge shapes. From dough scraps, cut out three leaves.
</P>
<P>
   For drum cookies, cut out rectangle drum and strips for drum top
and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookies on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake cookies at
350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until edges just begin to
brown. Cool on sheets one minute before transferring to wire rack
to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   To sandwich cookies: Spread uncut pear or drum bottom with
preserves. Top with cutout pieces. Dust with powdered sugar or use
icing as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 7-inch partridge-in-pear cookies.
</P>
<P>
   For the calling birds: Bake the partridge cutouts at the same
time as you bake the pears. Use icing of choice, or dust with
cinnamon-sugar for a snickerdoodle taste.
</P>
<P>
   For the drums: Cut out squares for the bottom layer, and small
half-moons or strips for the drum. Bake the dough and spread with
preserves. Use a squeeze-on icing for the x's.
</P>
<P>
   Variations and suggestions: Change the flavor and color of the
filling as desired; use any fruit preserves. Pear preserves are a
good choice for flavor; mint jelly for appearance. You also can
sandwich these cookies with chocolate, or roll nuts or coconut into
the dough. Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to half the dough to create
black-and-white layered cookies.

magazine, December 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   The turtle doves of the song inspired us to bend the song a bit,
and make turtle-shaped cookies. Our version of the holiday favorite
has a realistic shape, thanks to the vanilla wafer ``shell.''
</P>
<P>
   TURTLE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter-flavored shortening (to prevent chocolate from
seizing)
</P>
<P>
   38 caramels, unwrapped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   25 vanilla wafers
</P>
<P>
   125 pecan halves, (about 1 pound), toasted
</P>
<P>
   Grease a foil-lined cookie sheet. Arrange five pecan halves for
each turtle, placing one pecan for the head and four others for
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Melt caramels with cream in double boiler. Or melt in
microwave-safe bowl on high power for 20 seconds. Remove and stir,
then microwave again on high for 15 seconds, repeating as needed to
completely melt candies.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle enough caramel to hold pecans together _ about 1/2
teaspoon. Add a vanilla wafer to the top of each set of pecans,
press to adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dollop about a teaspoon of caramel on top of the vanilla wafers.
Swirl the caramel, but try not to let it drop onto foil. Rinse
spoons in hot water as needed. Re-melt the caramel in microwave in
15-minute increments as needed to keep it workable.
</P>
<P>
   Place chocolate in zip-top plastic bag. Place bag in bowl of hot
water; allow to melt. Knead bag with fingers to make sure all
pieces are melted. Keep chocolate warm until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Snip corner of bag containing chocolate and gently squeeze out
dots or circle of chocolate on top of each turtle. Spread with fork
tines to create turtle-shell design.
</P>
<P>
   Chill to set.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 25 turtles.

</P>
<P>
   The yellow French hens and cute leaping lords are made from a
ginger-dough cutout. They're decorated with sugar icing that's been
made with lemon juice for extra flavor. Color the chicken with
yellow food coloring, and use tuxedo colors for the lord. (Note:
Black food coloring is available at stores that carry
cake-decorating supplies, or you can combine other colors to create
a dark blue or dark red for a more festive lord.)
</P>
<P>
   GINGER CUT-OUT DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dark molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground mace
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon orange extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   For icing:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons meringue powder _ see note
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice (more as needed for consistency)
</P>
<P>
   Melt shortening and transfer to a large mixer bowl. Add
molasses, brown sugar and dissolved baking soda; blend. Add spices,
orange extract and salt; blend again. Gradually add flour and mix
well, using hands if needed to work in all the flour. Wrap the
dough in plastic, refrigerate until ``ripened'' for best flavor _
at least overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough into fifths and
refrigerate all but one portion. Place dough on floured surface and
lay a large piece of plastic wrap on top to roll out to 1/4-inch
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out the dough into shapes with cutter or free-form. Transfer
dough to parchment-covered cookie sheets and bake until very light
brown, 4 to 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent overbrowning.
</P>
<P>
   Allow cookies to remain on sheet for 2 minutes before
transferring to wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Continue rolling and baking as above. Store cooled, iced cookies
in tins.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dough can be formed into logs, chilled very well, and
sliced very thin for simple, round Morovian-style cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Mix icing ingredients in small bowl. Use more sugar or lemon
juice to produce correct consistency for piping.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate cooled cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 8 dozen French hens, or 2 dozen leaping lords.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Meringue powder is available wherever cake-decorating
supplies are sold.
</P>

Adams, 1992, Clarkson Potter.)
</P>

   The five golden rings and geese nests were made from the same
coconut macaroon dough. The one trick to these cookies is baking on
a day with low humidity. The dough, and cookies, will be very
sticky if made on a humid or rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT MACAROON WREATHS AND NESTS
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups grated coconut _ fresh is preferred, see note
</P>
<P>
   Decorations:
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon candies
</P>
<P>
   Candy-covered almonds
</P>
<P>
   Note: If using canned pre-sweetened flaked coconut, reduce the
sugar in the recipe to 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and lightly flour cookie sheet.
In medium bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar, flour,
salt and almond extract; mix well. Stir in coconut; drop by
tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased and floured cookie
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   To make wreaths, press dough into round shape and using the
handle of a wooden spoon, make a hole in center.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 325 degrees for 13 to 17 minutes or until set and light
golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For nests, press thumb into center of each cookie. Add 2 or 3
Jordan almonds to each. For wreaths, add cinnamon candies to
represent holly berries.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 12 cookies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Lovely meringue swans can grace your dessert tray _ if you're a
confident baker. Piped into delicate shapes, these are the most
fragile of all cookies and baking them is a test of patience.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make them the easy way _ and they're a nice
addition to the dessert tray for those who cannot have flour or
gluten _ you can merely drop the mounds of meringue onto a baking
sheet and hollow them to fill with a favorite flavor.
</P>
<P>
   MERINGUE SWANS
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup superfine sugar, or granulated sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   For coconut-whipped cream filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 250 degrees (cq); move both racks toward center
of oven. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or lightly
grease and flour sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Add cream of tartar
and salt. With beaters on high speed, add sugar a little at a time,
beating well after each addition. Test results by rubbing meringue
between fingers _ if grainy, continue beating. Beat until smooth
and mixture is shiny.
</P>
<P>
   Using a pastry bag and small star tip, pipe meringue onto cookie
sheets lined with lightly greased parchment paper (or drop by
dollops if desired).
</P>
<P>
   The swan necks and bodies are created separately. To make the
necks, pipe out the figure ``2.'' Using a large serving spoon, form
an oval mound shape for the bodies, and pull spoon up at one end
for the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Place cookie sheets in oven and bake for 1 hour. Turn off oven
and allow to bake 1 to 2 more hours; watch to prevent browning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make filling: Whip cream until stiff. Add sugar and
whip until incorporated. Fold in coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Handling carefully, remove cookie sheets from oven. Carefully
remove swan bodies and necks one at a time from sheet and place on
work surface. With tip of very thin, sharp knife, cut a small oval
from top of body. Hollow body slightly with knife. With teaspoon,
mound coconut filling into swan body. Place swan neck in front,
pushing carefully into filling. Use cut-out oval pieces from swan
body to make wings; set into filling in swan's back.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 small swans.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Best when eaten right away if filled; if left plain, they
can be stored for a month in an airtight container.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe adapted from The Joy of Cooking by Marian S. Rombauer.)
</P>
<P>
   A cookie cutter was used to create the cheesecake cow,
representing eight maids a-milking. A much simpler, and just as
pretty design, is to cut them into diamond shapes right in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   EASY CHEESECAKE BARS
</P>
<P>
   For crust:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   For filling:
</P>
<P>
   2 large packages cream cheese (16 ounces total)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   For topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 pint sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix crust ingredients and press
firmly into bottom of 13-by-9-inch pan.
</P>
<P>
   Mix filling ingredients and beat until very smooth. Pour over
crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Remove and cool 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together topping ingredients. Spoon and smooth on top of
filling. Return to oven for 10 more minutes. Remove and cool;
refrigerate. Chill very well if attempting to cut into shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 bars or diamonds.

   These delicate lace cookies, shaped into ladies' dancing skirts
and rolled into pipes, are also called Florentines. They are
elegant and the perfect accompaniment to a cup of hot espresso.
Don't let the kids help with these _ the hot-sugar dough can burn
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   LACE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   1 stick plus 2 1/2 tablespoons butter (don't substitute
margarine)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup light corn syrup (grease measuring cup for easy pouring)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons almond extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Move oven racks to center thirds of
oven.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy bottomed saucepan, mix and bring to a boil butter,
sugar and syrup. Remove from heat, but keep warm. Whisk in flour,
salt and extract. Dough will be thick liquid. Keep pan warm so
mixture remains pourable.
</P>
<P>
   Using nonstick cookie pans, or lightly greased parchment-lined
pans, drop 1 tablespoon liquid dough onto greased pan. Note:
mixture spreads widely; make only four cookies per pan. (You must
work fast to complete shaping of cookies once they are taken from
oven; do not make more than six cookies per batch.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake, watching carefully. When cookies are beginning to brown
around edges and are slightly brown in center, remove pan from
oven. Cool one minute only _ or until cookies do not wrinkle as you
slide spatula under them.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, roll up around chopstick to form pipes, or
drape over neck of funnel or around curve of wine bottle to form
curved shapes.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION: Both liquid dough and cookies are extremely hot _ keep
ice water for dipping fingers in after handling to prevent burns.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies will become crisp in a matter of seconds. If cookies
become hard before you can shape them, return them to the oven
briefly to soften for shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 18 large rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Add 1/3 cup finely chopped almonds to dough. Form
into shells by shaping on the back of muffin tins and fill with
cream cheese, whipped cream and sliced fruits for a formal dessert.
Dip edges of rolled cookies into melted chocolate and crushed nuts.
</P>
<P>
   DO'S AND DOUGHS
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips to make cookie baking easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the weather forecast before baking. South Florida's
humidity will wreck cookies made with cooked sugar, and those made
with egg whites. It also kills effectiveness of yeast, baking
powder and baking soda; replace those after three months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always preheat the oven unless otherwise stated in a recipe.
Move the oven racks as close to the center as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wipe and regrease cookie sheets between batches. Allow sheets
to cool to room temperature before washing and before dropping
dough onto them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chill rolled doughs for best results. Freeze slice-and-bake
doughs for uniform cutting. Use dental floss or fishing line to
make thin slices from the rolls, and to cut cheesecakes cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost all drop cookie doughs can be made into bars. Press
into a greased pan and bake at 350 degrees until done. A 9-by-9 pan
takes about 20-30 minutes at 350.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freeze most cookie doughs for up to three months. Drop cookies
or slice dough onto waxed paper-lined cookie sheets; freeze the
dough until hard and remove to pack into freezer containers and use
individually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use meringue powder instead of raw egg whites for royal icing.
It's available where cake decorating ingredients are sold.

 &HT;    Director Terrence Malick not worthy of buzz surrounding his
return
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ever since ``Days of Heaven,'' his slow,
minimalist paean to wounded hearts, wheat and small prairie
animals, director Terrence Malick has worn an oversized halo
presented by critics and industry types who routinely confuse
breathtaking cinematography for genius.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, an off-and-on Austinite since his youth, has made two
very good movies, ``Badlands'' in 1973 and ``Days of Heaven'' in
1978. These are his only films to date. He is considered one of the
greatest filmmakers of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Badlands,'' a hypnotically brutal drama, stars Martin Sheen
and a wraithish Sissy Spacek as killers on the lam making it up as
they go. ``Days of Heaven'' is a maddeningly elliptical film about
our place vis-a-vis the planet's natural order. Gassy with pretty
pictures, it plays like a National Geographic meditation,
fetishized images, sober narration and all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I like both films. I think ``Badlands'' is
the better one; its narrative engine is strong, its flavor for
people and place unerring, its sidelong wit great fun. Conversely,
``Heaven'' is poky and ponderous, a fugue in wide-screen.
</P>
<P>
   Malick's 20-year hiatus from film ends Dec. 25 when his
massively anticipated World War II epic ``The Thin Red Line'' is
released in New York and Los Angeles. (It opens in Austin on Jan.
15.) A giddy Hollywood and fans are scheduling their lives around
its opening, awaiting the Second Coming of Malick, ready to embrace
the well-buzzed movie like a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with everyone from Stanley Kubrick and J.D. Salinger to
God (why not Godot?), Malick's famous reclusiveness _ no press
interviews, no sanctioned photographs, a spotty work ethic _ has
won him mythological status. He made two fine movies, and then
vanished. A myth is born. Since then, his reputation has been fired
and inflated like a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Has ever an artist been canonized for doing so little?
</P>
<P>
   Malick isn't playing fair. He seems to me a cowardly artist, a
too-proud perfectionist mortally afraid of making a misstep. He's
hit two home runs and, worried about blowing his streak, has
declined another at-bat. That's a reductive presumption, of course:
Malick's labors on other (aborted) projects, as well as his script
doctoring over the decades, are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm reluctant to extol an artist who hasn't a body of
work _ ranging context that could provide a sort of full-figured
profile of the artist at his best and worst.
</P>
<P>
   A Malick associate was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying, ``Terry
had this notion of wanting to make the perfect movie. If he
couldn't, there was no point.''
</P>
<P>
   That's noble thinking, but does an artist have that luxury?
Surely it's a prerogative any craftsperson recognizes and perhaps
wishes for but also knows is foolhardy. Mistakes, gaffes and
disasters are the growing pains of creativity. All the great
filmmakers, from Chaplin to Scorsese, have detonated their share of
stinkbombs. Risks were taken, and occasionally the sublime was
struck.
</P>
<P>
   I'm loath to ascribe Malick's success to luck. He's a
demonstrably gifted filmmaker with profound ideas, visionary flair
and enormous originality. But as someone who so methodically
rejects the artistic spirit _ ``Produce, produce, for the night is
coming,'' one writer has implored _ Malick, I believe, has not
earned his station in the pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   And if for any reason, it is the prospect of artistic risk that
``The Thin Red Line'' should be awaited with bated breath.

 &HT;    Where's the info aisle?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's amazing how many people work in retail sales
jobs but don't know anything about the products they sell.
</P>
<P>
   They are happy to hover next to you and to ring up a purchase.
But they know precious little about the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any of these in blue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have them in red and black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see you have them in red and black in this display. But
do you have any in blue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine if we had any in blue they would be on
display.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Kenneth Starr. Do you know that you don't have any of
these in blue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that they even make them in blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they make them in blue, either. But in case
they do make them in blue, and in case you happen to have them in
blue, and if I could see one, I just might buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had any in blue, I'm sure they would be here on
display.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when store clerks told me that they didn't have
a particular item that I assumed they were right. Of course, there
was a time when that would have been a safe assumption. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy sales clerks who don't know their store's inventory now
often deflect questions they can't answer by telling customers that
they don't carry that particular item.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any Model 500 Widgets?''
</P>
<P>
   A ``yes'' answer probably means the store has Model 500 Widgets
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   A ``no'' answer could mean that the store doesn't have any Model
500 Widgets. It also could mean that you've gotten the brush-off
from a lazy sales person who doesn't know the answer to your
question and doesn't want to ask for fear of being told to learn
the store's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway Stores Inc. has stirred up dissension among some of its
employees for the company's ``Superior Service'' rules that attempt
to be more helpful and friendly to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway executives are trying to build a loyal customer base in
the highly competitive industry by having employees make eye
contact with customers, smile, offer greetings and help shoppers
locate items they can't find, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds good to me, and, according to Safeway officials, to
most of their customers. The employees who don't like the policy
think it is too forced and artificial. They also don't like the
idea that Safeway sends in ``mystery shoppers'' who monitor the
employees on a 19-point ``friendliness'' report.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly is fine. But frankly, I'd trade all the forced smiles
for helpfulness, which has to include knowledge of the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a problem I've experienced in grocery stores. Other
than asking the location of some item, I don't have any questions
that require answers.
</P>
<P>
   Many stores employ sales people who are perfectly friendly but
appear totally clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the battery life on this laptop computer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The batteries on most laptops run between two to three
hours.'' Big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this particular one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good batteries or we wouldn't sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What type of batteries are they? Are they nickel metal hydride
or lithium ion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our newest model so I'm sure it has top-of-the-line
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks a lot. I think I'll just look around.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you have been sold a product by a sales
person who knew the product inside and out, who made you want the
product, who made you happy that you bought the product and who
made you want to do business again in that store?
</P>
<P>
   When you find sales people like that, stick with them. They are
a dying breed.

 &HT;    Did you hear the one about the 3 guys ...
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are a few jokes I've been saving up for a slow holiday week
just like
</P>
<P>
   this:
</P>
<P>
   _Three men show up at St. Peter's gate at the same time. St.
Peter figures heaven is getting a bit crowded, and he tells the
trio to describe to him how they died. The one who died the most
horrible death would be admitted to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The first man starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long long suspected that my wife was being unfaithful
to me, but I'd never been able to catch her. So today I left work
early and went home. Sure enough, my wife was lying naked in the
bed. I looked around and found this man, wearing only gym shorts,
hanging from our balcony. We live on the 25th floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rage, I began stomping on his hands until he had to let
go. He fell 25 floors and landed in some bushes. It didn't even
hurt him!
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rage, I picked up a refrigerator and chunked it over the
balcony. It landed on the man and killed him. But that's when I had
the heart attack from all the exertion and died.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter agreed that was a pretty horrible story.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next man's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing my exercises on the balcony of my 26-floor
apartment, as I do every afternoon. I somehow slipped and tumbled
over the railing but luckily
</P>
<P>
   grabbed hold of the railing on the balcony below. That's when
this maniac comes charging out there and begins stomping on my
hands and cursing. Finally, I had to let go. Miraculously, I landed
in some bushes and wasn't even hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then that maniac heaved a refrigerator over the side of the
balcony, and
</P>
<P>
   it landed on me and killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew,'' St. Peter said. ``What a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The third man spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture this. I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   _Two guys come across a big hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reckon how deep that hole is?'' one asks the other. One man
tosses a rock into the hole and waits to hear the sound of it
landing. He hears nothing.
</P>
<P>
   His partner tosses a bigger rock into the hole. Again, both
listen but hear nothing.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad tie is nearby. The two men walk over, pick it up and
toss it in the hole. A few seconds later a goat comes flying by and
leaps into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' one man says. ``Reckon why that goat
jumped into that hole?''
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, while they're still pondering all this, a
farmer walks up and asks if they've seen a goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we saw one come running by and jump into this here
hole,'' one man replies.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer shakes his head. ``That can't be my goat. Mine was
tied to a railroad tie.''
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the game between Texas and Texas A&AMP;M, here are a
trio of Aggie
</P>
<P>
   jokes.
</P>
<P>
   _A University of Texas grad, a Baylor alumnus, and an Aggie had
all committed horrendous crimes and were going to be shot. The
Teasip was brought up and blindfolded. The general shouted,
``Ready, aim ...'' and the Teasip guy yelled, ``Hurricane!,''
everybody ducked, and he ran away free.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed at losing their first prisoner, the guards brought up
the Baylor student with renewed vigor. They blindfolded him and the
general commanded,
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready, aim...'' and the Baylor guy shouted, ``Tornado!''
Fearing for their lives, everybody ducked, and he ran away free.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Aggie has been watching all this and starts thinking,
``They all yelled natural disasters and they got away, so I will
too.''
</P>
<P>
   So they brought him up and blinded folded him, the general
shouted, ``Ready, aim...'' and the Aggie screamed, ``Fire!!''
</P>
<P>
   _An Aggie and a Longhorn are in hell. The Longhorn is chained to
an ugly old woman, and the Aggie is chained to Pamela Anderson. The
devil comes in and tells the two unfortunate souls that they will
be in this situation for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn asks the devil why he is chained to the ugly old
woman. The devil replies, ``This is your punishment for being so
mean to all those Aggies over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn then asks, ``If this is hell, why does the Aggie
get to be chained to Pamela Anderson''?
</P>
<P>
   To which the devil replies, ``That's Pamela Anderson's
punishment''!
</P>
<P>
   _An Aggie and a Longhorn are watching the news on TV. There's a
film story about a girl on the ledge of a building threatening to
commit suicide. The police were trying to talk her down when the
Longhorn says to the Aggie, ``I'll bet you five dollars that she
jumps.'' The Aggie took the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the girl jumps. The Aggie takes five dollars from
his pocket and hands it to the Longhorn. The Longhorn says, ``I
can't take your money. I saw the same film clip on the 6 p.m. news
today and knew she was going to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie says, ``I watched it, too, but I didn't think she
would do it a second time.''

 &HT;    Austin woos Legislature with parking
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you spend half your life making change so you
can park downtown, you've probably got several questions about the
new City of Austin policy that exempts Texas lawmakers from being
ticketed at parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for example, how do you get a cushy deal like this?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Run for office.
</P>
<P>
   The parking perk was just one of several announced Monday by
Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and other city officials. The city also is
giving each state representative and senator a fancy $35 snow globe
from Saks Fifth Avenue and free golf at city courses.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these gifts, Mayor Watson says, is to make it
easier for Austin to work with the Legislature, not because the
city is afraid the Legislature will clobber Austin during the
coming session for annexing 27,700 mainly ticked off suburbanites
against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure. And I'm a Hungarian ballerina. This is a snow job
with snow globes, OK? But let's forget the souvenirs and answer
your questions about this new free parking program.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1: Do state lawmakers everywhere get to skate like
this?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Jeff Tolbert, a parking meter reader with the City of
Albany, N.Y., the New York state capital, said New York state
representatives' cars parked at expired meters in Albany get
ticketed just like anybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it expires, you have to give it a ticket no matter what car
is there,'' Tolbert said. ``Except for a police car. I don't want
to mess up my paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 2: Will this program help Austin's needy?
</P>
<P>
   It should. Since the lawmakers don't have to feed the meters,
they'll have plenty of quarters in their pockets to hand out to the
panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 3: Should a lawmaker parking at a City of Austin
meter mark his car for immunity from ticketing by leaving his new
$35 Saks Fifth Avenue snow globe on the dashboard?
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not the way the state lawmakers' cars will be
identified as being exempt from $15 parking tickets, said John
Hrncir, government relations officer for the City of Austin. The
license number of the lawmaker's car _ one car per lawmaker _ will
be fed into the city's parking systems computer, Hrncir explained.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 4: Will this parking perk tick people off?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it will. This is Austin, international center of the
chronically riled.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 5: Does this mean state lawmakers will also get
their names on the guest list of Austin clubs such as Liberty
Lunch?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, because when I asked that question, Hrncir just
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 6: If a lawmaker wanted to, could he park his car
at a meter downtown in front of his favorite restaurant and leave
it there until, say, March?
</P>
<P>
   Hrncir wasn't sure. So maybe somebody should try it and see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 7: Now let's just say, for argument purposes, that
a state legislator was driving down, uh, South Congress Avenue, and
that the, uh, hookers returned to South Congress for the coming
session, and the legislator decided to pull over. Under the new
rule, could he park for free at a South Congress parking meter?
</P>
<P>
   No. But only because there are no parking meters on South
Congress Avenue.

 &HT;    The best toy to put in your kids' Christmas stocking
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that almost all of you have missed out on getting Furbys
(which, when you say it like that, sounds more like a disease than
a toy), you may be wondering what to get your kids for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   No one has asked my advice on this matter yet, though I have a
great deal of experience in buying children's toys. For a fact, I
have learned the perfect toy for all children regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   This knowledge has come to me because I have, during the course
of the last 16 Christmases, made every toy purchase mistake one can
make. I know everything not to get and, when you remove the culls,
only one toy is left for the buying.
</P>
<P>
   But more about that in a minute. First, you need to know all the
toys to
</P>
<P>
   avoid at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything educational. Think about it. Aren't your children
already smarter than you are? Do you really want them to get even
further ahead in the game? I don't think so. Toys that make
learning fun are just going to make it more difficult for you to
fool your children in the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything that takes batteries. Unless you want to be feeding
the Energizer Bunny for the rest of your days, stay away from toys
powered by batteries. However, if you have a pile of used
batteries, you can think of painting them and giving them as
slightly irregular round blocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video game systems. Let's think about your typical video game
for a moment, shall we? These games teach your child cunning and
stealth mixed with creative ways of ending the lives of various
unearthly creatures. It is not too far a leap for your children to
think of mother and father as they are playing Rip-a-Gut II. No, we
don't need to instruct our children in the ways of violence, lest
they use it against us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Books. Books contain ideas. Our children need no new ideas.
See the first item above.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crayons. This also goes for paints, markers, pencils and pens
of any kind or shape. You will only have to spend hours cleaning
off your floors and walls from the errant artists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything that makes any sort of noise whatsoever. Do I really
need to explain this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Small plastic figures. You know the kind of thing I am talking
about: diminutive dinosaurs, army men, cowboys and Indians, space
aliens. These seem fine _ after all, they make no noise _ until you
are going to the bathroom in the middle of the night sometime and
step on a little Sitting Bull or triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   By now you probably think that I have eliminated every toy on
the market
</P>
<P>
   but not so. One toy still stands out as the perfect, if not the
only, Christmas gift for children.
</P>
<P>
   Little round foam balls.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the little round foam ball fits all the parental criteria.
You can't learn anything from a foam ball. It does not take
batteries. It cannot be used to create any mark. It makes no sound,
even when you bounce it off the wall, and, if you step on it, it
almost has a pleasant feel. It doesn't hurt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but little round foam balls are nontoxic. Your
kids can munch on them between meals and not get so much as a tummy
ache. They come in every color in the rainbow and you can buy a
year's supply for the cost of one video game. Of course, little
round foam balls don't wear out all that often.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason I can't explain, the aisle with all the
little round foam balls is the the clearest throughout the
Christmas season. You can get all your shopping done in minutes and
not even need help carrying your purchases to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Stock up now before the secret gets out and they have
to start auctioning little round foam balls like Furbys.

 &HT;    Reminiscing on the downtown of holidays past
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's a time warp, a bittersweet one, strolling
past the Santaland animated display in the abandoned Lazarus
building. As I stand before the charmingly dated figures, with
their Twiggy eyelashes and herky-jerky movements, I can close my
eyes and almost take myself back to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. That bustling mechanical universe reminds me of all the
fun I had downtown as a kid _ but it also reminds me there was once
a bustling universe inside the store as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sign hanging above the display window trumpets, ``This
Space for Lease.'' Event posters from 1996 are taped to dusty
doors. A graffiti artist proclaims, cryptically, ``Downtown exposed
for can of corn it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   If only a time warp could take us back to the days when the
window display was the latest in animated technology. Shopping
downtown was the big outing of our family Christmas season. That
holiday department store smell _ a hybrid of perfume, candy and
evergreen _ hit you like intoxication the minute you walked into
Rike's. We waited in long lines to sit on Santa's lap; we
thoughtfully budgeted our purchases. How to buy gifts for everyone
with our fistful of money? A certain enterprising sister came up
with the solution: a package of combs, a practical gift for the
entire family.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to be ungrateful _ the display windows are nice and
nostalgic, and the city is trying _ but there's something
depressing about having a Santaland window, but no Lazarus. And no
Santa. For Santa, you have to go to the 'burbs, or to the downtown
Elder-Beerman on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we're lucky to have a downtown department store left.
The specter of Elder-Beerman's closing its Courthouse Plaza store
looms over us like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is America and we have the right to shop where we
please. But it's tough to make the argument that we're a big league
city and we deserve a minor league baseball team and a flourishing
Riverscape if we can't sustain even one downtown department store.
</P>
<P>
   Fight those mall crowds all you want. I'm heading downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 1: It's pleasant. You don't have to park several
football fields away from the store. You don't lose your Christmas
spirit elbowing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 2: You can make shopping an outing, an adventure,
with your kids. You can bribe them into good behavior with a visit
to the model train display in the lobby of the Kettering Tower, or
a visit to Elder-Beerman's Tike's Shop (yes, another relic from the
old Rike's).
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it an event with our kids,'' says Maureen Pero,
director of the Downtown Dayton Partnership. ``We go for a horse
and buggy ride and buy tickets for The Nutcracker. My kids hate
shopping, but if we say, `Lets go downtown,' for them it's a
Christmas event. It's more of a celebration of the holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 3: There are cool shops that aren't standard-issue
mall offerings, like the artists' gallery at DVAC or arty home
furnishings at Go Home. ``Downtown isn't the mall, and it's not
going to be the mall,'' Pero says. That's not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 4: Downtown needs us, and we need downtown.
</P>
<P>
   We can gripe all we want that city leaders aren't doing enough
to revitalize downtown, but they can't do it without us. The
throngs of families who enjoy the Grande Illumination on Courthouse
Square every year are a reminder of what the holidays downtown once
were.
</P>
<P>
   And could be again.

 &HT;    Annual Book Fair was like old times for Mad Dog, Inc.
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Third Annual Book Fair in Austin, Texas, recently it was
like old home week for me and a rabble of my old running buddies.
In case you haven't heard, I've got a new book just out and in
discerning book stores across the state;
</P>
<P>
   so, I was invited to this year's Book Fair as a ``featured
author.''
</P>
<P>
   Title of my new book is ``Confessions of a Maddog,'' (U. of
North Texas Press) referring to a group of Texas writers (writers
of song and story) who in our younger and friskier years in the
1960s and '70s formed a sort of social and literary club called Mad
Dog, Inc., Motto: ``Doing indefinable services to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Our slogan was: ``Anything that's not a mystery is guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   Members included such stalwart ``famous authors'' as Bud Shrake,
Gary Cartwright, Dan Jenkins, Jerry Jeff Walker and his wife,
Susan, Willie Nelson, and...well, you get the idea, I suppose. As
someone has written somewhere lately we were, ``a group of
hard-working and harder living writers of story and song.''
</P>
<P>
   We did enjoy ourselves much of the time back then and, due to
the rather eccentric character of most, if not all, the Mad Dog
membership, a close observer could recall, if he chose to do so, a
whole bunch of, shall we say, amusing tall tales that were mostly
true.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to do so, and my new book is the result.
</P>
<P>
   So, anyway, I was invited to participate in the Third Annual
Texas Book Fair thing in Austin, an event chaired by Laura Bush to
raise money for state libraries from book sales and a high priced
dinner the opening evening. The dinner this year starred Larry King
as master of ceremonies and famous authors David Halberstam and
Frank McCourt reading from their books.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam is a Pulitzer Prize winner who has written several
best sellers and McCourt's latest book, ``Angela's Ashes,'' has
been on most best seller lists for months.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't attend the dinner. Even us famous authors had to pay
$200 per for that deal so I chose to pass it up. But my sources
told me it was a success. Bud Shrake, who's nobody's patsy as far
as expressing his opinions, what ever they are, told me Halberstam
was ``very interesting'' and McCourt was ``a real performer.'' This
equaled a rave review because Shrake bores pretty easy.
</P>
<P>
   My appearance was on Saturday in a room in the capital
building's new extension, which was described by the same Bud
Shrake as looking like it was
</P>
<P>
   designed by Albert Speer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Albert Speer?'' I asked simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who was Hitler's architect,'' Shrake explained kindly.
``Not the one who lives over in Woodville.''
</P>
<P>
   We were at the time searching for the conference room in the
capital extension where we would help form a panel to discuss the
``Mad Dogs'' discussed in my book, ``Confessions of a Maddog.'' We
were to be accompanied on the stage for the panel discussion by
other Mad Dogs: Gary Cartwright, Larry L. King and Jan Reid, all
fairly well known writers of one sort or another.
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed by the enthusiastic response we got. I remembered
that after
</P>
<P>
   my first book came out some time ago, granted and in different
circumstances,
</P>
<P>
   my autographing sessions at bookstores were less than crowded.
In Waco at one bookstore there, the manager had free Cokes set out
beside the table where my books and I sat, ready with pen in hand
to smile and autograph, and the only person who paid any attention
was a small boy who wanted a Coke and was jerked away by his father
who frowned as if I might be a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   But in Austin at the Book Fair, the room where we told our Mad
Dog tales held a standing-room-only crowd, and in the signing tent
afterward all my books available were sold, and during our panel
discussion the crowd actually laughed out loud time and again and
broke into applause once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   My wife said she had more fun that day than she's had since our
wedding, which was attended by the same people who were on the Mad
Dog panel.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know for sure what that means, but it's probably
significant in some fashion.

 &HT;    Sandwiched by tradition
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNY, Ga. _ One of the obvious effects of global
warming is that years are a lot shorter than they used to be. When
I was growing up and waiting on another visit from Santa Claus,
Christmases were at least as far apart as world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Now a year is nothing but the Fourth of July, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving and Christmas all run together, not counting birthdays
and all the other days merchants set aside for special sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to start planning for Christmas,'' my wife said as
soon as she picked up the pre-Thanksgiving Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't be,'' I replied, thinking that the carcass of last
year's Christmas tree is still hidden behind the shop where she
can't see it. I've been meaning to take it to the dump first chance
I get.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you like for Christmas dinner?'' she asked.
``Pimento or tuna?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the world are you talking about?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a modern Christmas meal for a change,'' she
answered. ``Turkey and dressing is old-fashioned. Sandwiches are
in, turkey is out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas without turkey and dressing wouldn't be Christmas,''
I said. ``Who ever heard of sandwiches for Christmas dinner! Where
do you get those crazy ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the newspaper,'' she replied. ``It says here that a
fourth of the people who have Christmas dinner at home eat
sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She handed me the newspaper. There it was, on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``... According to a study in American Demographics, 25 percent
of Christmas home diners eat sandwiches, 11 percent eat pasta, and
10 percent beef.'' Probably hamburgers from McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe it now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be what somebody found out in a survey,'' I answered,
``but I can't believe they put stuff like that in the newspaper,
much less on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,`` she said. ``I think it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is true, the newspaper shouldn't print it,'' I
said. ``When I worked for the newspaper we had responsible,
patriotic editors. We'd never put something detrimental to the
country on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is printing a change in holiday eating habits detrimental
to the country?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because families are the fabric of the nation, and it's
destroying the fabric of families,'' I explained. ``Christmas
dinners with turkey and dressing, mashed potatoes, giblet gravy,
English peas, fruitcake and ambrosia with plenty of coconut and
cherries are one of the fundamental traditions that have made this
country great.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think this is a real threat to society as we know
it,'' I continued, ``just look at the ideas that story put in your
head. What you are talking about is doing away with Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   I reminded her of Christmas at Aunt May's house in Fayetteville,
Ga., where the extended family gathered for all-day togetherness.
We started early with Uncle Harry's eggnog, followed by three
shifts at the dining room table and then cigars in the living room
for the men while the ladies washed dishes and napped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine Aunt May serving pimento cheese and tuna
sandwiches?'' I asked. ``She'd have died a slow and painful death
before she'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be, but I think the new menu will appeal to a lot of
grandmothers,'' she replied. ``I spend at least three days cooking
and baking for our Christmas dinner. Then it's gobbled up in a half
hour so you and the boys can get back to either watching a football
game on television or working on an old tractor. I don't get
through washing dishes and putting things up until after
suppertime. I wonder if it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's worth it!'' I exclaimed. ``It's so festive.
It's spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just imagine,'' I sneered, ``all us sitting around the
dining room table, holding hands and saying the blessing over
pimento and tuna sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want sandwiches. we could call Domino's and have
pizza delivered,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to talk this way,'' I said, ``but I think there is a
good possibility God will punish us if we have sandwiches or pizza
for Christmas dinner. Christmas is supposed to be a religious
holiday, and I don't see how we can be religious or respectful if
we don't have turkey and dressing like God intended. I think it
says somewhere in the Bible that it's illegal to serve sandwiches
for Christmas dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you feel so strongly,'' she said, ``we'll stick with the
traditional turkey and all the trimmings for another year, provided
you make a few Christmas resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like peeling the potatoes, helping set the table, peeling the
oranges and grating the coconut for the ambrosia and helping wash
the dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   I agreed. I didn't have a choice. I wasn't going to surrender to
sandwich makers who stole Christmas.

FURBY DECONSTRUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZA TRUITT 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a brief sordid history of toys-of-the-year:
</P>
<P>
   Fisticuffs have erupted over Cabbage Patch Kids; Tickle-Me-Elmos
have been stockpiled and scalped for bank-breaking prices; Beanie
Baby counterfeiters have taken rubes to the cleaners; and this
year's toy-of-the-year--Furby--is already sold out of several
chains and is being auctioned off on eBay for up to $200 apiece
</P>
<P>
   The doll looks more like a Gremlin than a Galatea--furry, big
ears, big eyes, no neck. The source of its appeal, however, is
Galatea-like: You teach, it learns. It has a motor, internal
speakers, a computer chip, a light sensor, a sound sensor, and
touch sensors, so in addition to old-hat tricks like blinking and
``dancing,'' Furby knows whether you're in the room and will talk,
sing, and generally act cute. But most importantly, Furby responds
to Pavlovian conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   When you first get the Furby, for instance, you can tickle its
stomach and it may or may not give you a kiss. If it kisses you and
you immediately pat it on the back, you increase the likelihood of
it kissing you next time you tickle its tummy.
</P>
<P>
   Furbys also have their own language, Furbish, ``which is heavily
influenced by the languages of Thai, Chinese, Mandarin, and
Hebrew.'' Over time, your Furby will abandon Furbish and begin to
``learn'' English (actually, it doesn't really learn--it's just
programmed to begin speaking more English words after a while).
</P>
<P>
   The Furby can even communicate with and ``teach'' other Furbys
tricks and songs by means of infrared signals similar to the ones
in a TV remote control device. If one Furby sings a lullaby, the
other will fall asleep and snore. If you play music, the Furbys
will dance together.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very cool from an adult's perspective. From the
child's perspective, though, the Furby has drawbacks, such as:
</P>
<P>
   The Carapace Issue. In order to protect the various motors,
there has to be a rigid plastic shell under the fur, which makes
the thing hard to hug. Although press materials call it a ``cuddly
standalone animatronic pet,'' in my book, ``animatronic'' cancels
out ``cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Work Issue. Who wants to train a toy to kiss you, when every
kid knows that a regular stuffed animal kisses you every time you
touch its plastic nose to your cheek?
</P>
<P>
   The Breakability Issue. The delicate plastic ear bones are just
begging to be snapped, and the toy's many cool functions spark
curiosity about how it all works. In order to satisfy that
curiosity, you have to skin Furby and crack open the internal
plastic shell. Another way to see Furby's innards is to check out
the exquisite Furby Autopsy Home Page .
</P>
<P>
   The Grown-Up vs. Kids Issue. As soon as you read that Furby's
unique language is ``heavily influenced by the languages of Thai,
Chinese, Mandarin, and Hebrew,'' you know that this is a toy that
parents will like more than kids. Same goes for all the tricks
Furby learns that are cool in concept--but boring after about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Is your child too young for a Furby? Will it create more
frustration and heartbreak than happiness? Is $30 retail (or up to
$200 online) too much for what you get? Do you want a furry
animatronic pet that burps (and worse) after you ``feed'' it by
pushing down on its tongue? These questions are all worth
considering before you join in on a Furby auction, break into a
cold sweat over the grim warning on Furby fan pages: ``WAL-MART NOW
OUT OF FURBYS!!!!!,'' or smuggle a stun-gun into Toys-R-Us to
disable the competition.

BOEING GOING WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers in cyclical industries are used to uncertainty when it
comes to their jobs. But there weren't any Boeing workers who were
prepared for the company's announcement yesterday that it would be
cutting another 28,000 jobs, bringing total layoffs announced this
year to 50,000. And while in part these cutbacks represent an
aggressive response to a sharp falloff in demand from Asia, they're
also the result of a failure of management--production-line
inefficiencies, mismanaged capacity, and poor forecasting. Boeing
needs a new approach, and job-cutting alone isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has, after all, only one competitor--Airbus--in the
commercial aircraft market. And until Asia fell apart a year ago,
demand for airplanes was at a cyclical peak. Normally, that
combination would allow a company to rake in the dough. But instead
Boeing found itself turning out fewer planes than it needed to and
spending more on each plane than it should have. Boeing was
actually adding workers as late as 1996, and more recently asking
workers to pull extra overtime in order to deliver planes when
promised. As a result, the company never reaped the profits at the
top of the demand cycle that it should have.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that in recent years a number of management
theorists have suggested that Boeing's production model, suitably
modified, represents a possible future for global manufacturing.
Unlike a classic assembly-line company, which restricts the number
of potential options in order to reap the benefits of
standardization, Boeing customizes each of its planes. The number
of potential options is practically unlimited, which means that an
airplane factory looks nothing like the Modern Times classic model
of mind-destroying automation.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of this model is that customers get exactly what they
want, which in theory should allow Boeing to charge premium prices.
And what those management theorists see in the future is a world in
which computerization and e-commerce will combine to allow
companies to customize products like Boeing does while
simultaneously retaining the economies of scale that the assembly
line offers. The current Platonic ideal here is Dell Computer,
which builds its computers to order but still turns them out
quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ``flexible production'' only works if your
entire production system is set up to take advantage of the
approach. And although Boeing has been doing flexible production
forever, it has never really embraced a top-to-bottom reinvention
of the system. As a result, Boeing's approach has a lot of the
old-school craftsman in it and not enough Henry Ford. The company
still has multiple and incompatible computer systems. It has
resisted standardization where it shouldn't. And it has done a poor
job of managing inventory.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are supposedly in the process of changing. And
Boeing couldn't have anticipated what would happen in Asia. But the
50,000 job cuts we'll see between now and the end of next year are
simple testimony to the fact that now as much ever, management
matters.

ESCAPE ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Fixes repeated byline)  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prevailing wisdom about President Clinton's political fate
in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky affair is that he certainly
won't be removed from office, probably won't be impeached by the
House, and may well escape punishment altogether. It seems unfair
to many people that Clinton, having behaved despicably and then
lied to everyone about it, defeated the investigation of this
misconduct by evading, obstructing, and demonizing Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. But while Clinton may escape justice at
home, he faces a cruel sentence abroad: He must endure, at the
hands of Saddam Hussein, the same tactics he used against Starr. Of
course, Saddam has long been a master of these tactics. But there
is poetic injustice in the uncanny resemblance between his 10 point
strategy against U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler and
Clinton's campaign against Starr and the ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Belittle the subject. Clinton's henchmen dismissed Starr's
investigation as a detour into sexual matters that were nobody's
business. Iraq dismissed Butler's recent requests for documents as
a detour into matters that ``have no relations to the disarmament
procedures.'' Clinton's spinners said Starr had no grounds to
pursue evidence of his misconduct. Iraq says Butler has no
``technical or scientific grounds'' to demand that Iraq relinquish
specific evidence about its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invent privileges. To justify their refusal to testify or turn
over documents requested by Starr, Clinton and his allies stretched
some privileges (executive and attorney-client) and invented others
(``protective function''). To justify its refusal to turn over
documents requested by the weapons inspectors, Iraq stretches some
privileges (sovereignty) and invents others (``national
security''), backed by comparably bogus legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Play word games. Clinton evaded the law and its enforcers by
revising the meanings of words such as ``sexual relations,''
``alone,'' and ``is.'' Iraq, having promised to cooperate with the
weapons inspectors, now says ``cooperation'' doesn't entail
absolute capitulation to their requests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vilify the investigator. Clinton's team neutralized the
investigation of his misconduct by diverting scrutiny from Clinton
to Starr. They elevated Starr's profile, defined him as a vicious
zealot, and undermined the credibility of his investigation.
Likewise, Iraqi officials and newspapers are neutralizing the
investigation of Iraq's misconduct by elevating Butler's profile
and defining him as a ``devil'' and a ``mad bull.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Politicize the investigation. Clintonites accused Starr of
attacking Clinton at the behest of tobacco companies, Richard
Mellon Scaife, and right-wing senators and lawyers. Iraq accuses
Butler of staging confrontations in order to maintain cruel
economic sanctions and provoke a war. Butler seeks ``a new excuse
to be used by the United States and Britain in order to trigger a
new aggression against Iraq,'' says an Iraqi newspaper. Wherever
Clinton and Butler agree, Iraq infers collaboration. When Clinton
spelled out his demands for Iraqi cooperation and Butler
subsequently requested documents, Iraq's foreign minister charged,
``Butler has resorted to a new ploy ... the implementation of the
points made by Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Feign compliance. While erecting legal roadblocks andprivately
spurning Starr's requests to testify before the grand jury, Clinton
publicly vowed to tell the truth (``more rather than less, sooner
rather than later'') and professed that he was cooperating fully
with the investigation. Likewise, Iraq issues statements and
letters touting its compliance with ``surprise'' inspections, even
as it withholds documents sought by the inspectors. Clinton, having
averted Starr's subpoena by agreeing to testify before the grand
jury, spent his testimony fudging, lying, and reverting to his
previous circumlocutions. Iraq, having averted Clinton's Nov. 14
military assault by agreeing to cooperate with the weapons
inspectors, fudged, lied, and reverted to its previous
circumlocutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accuse the investigator of framing you. Clinton's defenders
accuse Starr's prosecutors of pressuring witnesses such as Betty
Currie and Susan McDougal to testify falsely against Clinton. Iraq
accuses the weapons inspectors and the United States of planting
nerve gas on an Iraqi missile warhead in order to implicate Iraq
falsely in weapons violations. Iraq's evidence for this charge was
no better than the evidence against Starr. But it succeeded just as
well in changing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's image war against Butler and the United States hasn't
matched the success of Clinton's image war against Starr, but it
has produced considerable gains. Having obliged Clinton to call off
his Nov. 14 military strike, Iraq continues to thwart the
inspectors. And on Nov. 24, when Butler briefed the U.N. Security
Council about Iraq's noncompliance, Russian and Chinese
representatives questioned the relevance of his document requests
and indicated that they would review the facts independently. The
charges against Butler are a sham, of course. It's too bad Clinton
lacks the authority to say so.

THE DISMAL LOGIC OF THE BODY'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am haunted by a vision in which medical science cures
everything and makes everyone immortal--and I am the last person to
die before scientists get it right. The New York Times nourishes my
vision with frequent reports of promising new treatments for cancer
and arteriosclerosis, which jointly account for the great majority
of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism of the Times' science reporters--and their sources
in the medical community--contrasts with the pessimism of
economists and poets, who continue to focus on the inevitability of
death, decay, and depreciation--at least in this world.
</P>
<P>
   The poetic invention economists most love to cite is ``The
Deacon's Masterpiece or the Wonderful One-Hoss Shay,''
built--according to Oliver Wendell Holmes--so it couldn't break
down. A breakdown, you see, requires some part to fail before
another. So the deacon deliberately made every part exactly as
strong as the rest and rendered that kind of failure impossible.
The result?
</P>
<P>
   You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,
</P>
<P>
   How it went to pieces all at once,--
</P>
<P>
   All at once, and nothing first,--
</P>
<P>
   Just as bubbles do when they burst.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, economists have used the phrase ``one-hoss shay
depreciation'' to describe machinery that works perfectly well
right up to the day when it fails beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes made gentle fun of the deacon's logic, which led him to
write charming poetry but bad economics. The deacon was wiser than
Holmes realized. Any designer--whether of a chaise, or an
automobile, or a living organism--would be well-advised to make
each part roughly as strong as the rest. If the wheels are destined
to disintegrate in 80 years, then it's a waste of effort to design
a floor that will last for 100. If your car engine won't last past
100,000 miles, you don't need a transmission that will last for
500,000 miles. (There's an exception to this rule for parts that
are easily replaceable.)
</P>
<P>
   So to a first approximation, well-designed mechanisms should
depreciate just like the wonderful one-hoss shay--all at once and
nothing first. The human body, for example, is a well-designed
mechanism, thanks to the pressures of natural selection. Therefore
(and I believe this observation was first made by the physiologist
Jared Diamond in his insightful book ``The Third Chimpanzee''), we
should not be surprised that our vision, hearing, mental faculties,
physical strength, arteries, and resistance to cancer all tend to
deteriorate at around the same time. Nature is a good economist.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything fails at exactly the same time--either in your
car or in your body--but that's only because designers can't always
predict the exact moment of failure. There is one circumstance in
which you'd design a part to last much longer than the whole: when
it's just as cheap and easy to make a part long-lived as to make it
short-lived. But Diamond argues that such
</P>
<P>
   cases are unlikely to arise in the human body. That's because
virtually all our organs require routine maintenance, and the
frequency of that maintenance is part of the organ's ``design.''
You can always make an organ last longer by maintaining it better,
but you can never do that for free because maintenance consumes
energy that could otherwise be available for gathering food or
fighting predators. If your stomach were designed to last 100 years
longer than the rest of you, your body would be well-advised to
conserve energy by taking less good care of your stomach--which
means your stomach wouldn't last 100 years longer than the rest of
you.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal conclusion is that even cures for the big
killers--cancer and arteriosclerosis--are unlikely to extend human
</P>
<P>
   life spans very much. Because evolution didn't expect you to
live past 100, it probably had the good sense not to give you too
many organs that will last till 110. To significantly extend your
life span, researchers will have to figure out how to extend the
lives of all those organs, not just a few. That's not a conclusion
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy with, but in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
``Logic is logic. That's all I say.''
</P>

HOW COMPUTERS CONNECT FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
  By BRONWYN FRYER 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 6-year-old Derek Fearon, who lives in a New York City
suburb, lost his first tooth, he longed to show his stubby white
prize to his grandmother, ``Bubbe.'' It hardly mattered that she
lived in Boca Raton, Fla. His mother simply turned on the computer
and clicked on an icon. In seconds, Derek could see and hear his
grandma as if she were in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed it to me and said, 'Look, Bubbe!''' recalls Derek's
grandmother, Judith Levy. 'What's better than seeing the face of my
grandchild?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a century ago, the telephone began to alter forever the
way human beings communicate. Today, the Internet is retracing the
telephone's path, not only changing the way we go about our
business but also transforming the way we keep in touch with our
loved ones. Electronic mail, videophones and family web pages are
allowing us to maintain close contact at a minimal cost, regardless
of distance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Videophones: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Levy's thrice-weekly conversations with grandson Derek are
hardly the stuff of science fiction. They come courtesy of
videophone technology _ in this case, Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera
Pack. The camera pack, which ranges in price from $149 to $300
(each party must have one), provides everything a computer-equipped
family needs for those virtual family get-togethers. Kodak's DVC
323 ($169) is another good choice.
</P>
<P>
   For Marcy Fearon, mother of Derek and 3-year-old Dylan, the
videophone has already transformed the family. ``Grandmother is no
longer someone the children hear about once in a while,'' she says.
``It's like she's actually in the house. It's a real blessing for
the children, who don't get to be with their grandparents very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Videophone technology typically consists of a camera that mounts
on a computer monitor, a video capture card that is inserted in a
slot inside the computer, and software that places calls and
transmits video images over a regular telephone fine.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the quality of the sound and picture can be
iffy. Also, the person on the other end has to be compatibly
equipped, and the telephone line must be working well. Some
technical novices find the installation and setup daunting. (Levy
had a technician install hers.) And the technical requirements are
generally too stiff for anything less than a fully equipped
multimedia computer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Family websites: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Steve and Leslie C. brought their new baby boy to their San
Francisco home, Steve's coworkers gave him a gift that keeps on
giving: a family website. ``I got the baby shower, and Steve got
the site,'' Leslie says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Steve and Leslie's site boasts regularly updated pictures
of their son, Sam, who now 1 1/2. As the child has grown from
infancy to toddlerhood, Leslie's brother in Massachusetts and
sister in Southern California have been able to see how he's
filling out and to share milestones _ like Sam's finally surpassing
the size of the family cat!
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to set up a website. With software like IBM's
deluxe version of the 1999 World Book Multimedia Encyclopedia
($70), families can employ easy-to-use templates to create their
own individual, group, or newsletter-style pages. The software also
helps families research information from the World Book to include
on their sites, like facts about the breed of the family dog, and
create links to other, related sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scanners: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To get your snapshots up on a site, the best way to go would be
to use a desktop scanner; these are now priced at $200 or less and
produce crisp color reproductions of ordinary photos. Just plug the
scanner into your computer and load the companion software. Place a
photo on the scanner, close the lid, click a button on your
computer screen, and voila: Your photo is digitized, suitable for
electronic use.
</P>
<P>
   Good scanners include the HP ScanJet 5100C ($299) and the AGFA
SnapScan EZ ($129). Once you have your digital pictures, you can
post them to your site.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet service providers offer free website service.
America Online, for one, gives its members free space for a site
and a simple, easy-to-use tool with which to build it. The effort
is worth it. Compared with the cost of developing, copying and
mailing photos, posting to a site is a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; E-mail: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most families with home computers have discovered that
electronic mail is an inexpensive alternative to the telephone.
Kelly and Kevin Jones of West Jordan, Utah, have discovered that
it's also a great way to send quick pictures of their three small
children _ Bryson, 3, Addisen, 2, and Corbin, 7 months _ without
having to pay for film, processing and postage.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses, who use a free e-mail service called theglobe.com,
regularly send text messages to the children's great-grandmother in
Springfield, Ore., and to their maternal grandparents in Portland.
``Today I sent my in-laws a message telling them how Bryson was
putting Addisen to bed,'' says their father. When he's finished
with his own message, he places Bryson on his lap and allows the
little boy to add a few lines of keyboard gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   When the text message is complete, Jones can attach a picture to
it. For this purpose he uses a tool from Play Inc. called Snappy
Video Snapshot, a $99 video grabber that plugs into the computer's
printer port. Jones plugs the family's video camera into a jack on
the computer; then he and his wife pose with the kids in front of
the camera. When they see an image they like, ``we just click the
mouse and the frame gets saved on the computer,'' he explains. Then
he selects the ``attach file'' option in his e-mail software,
clicks on the ``send'' button, and the photo arrives on
grandmother's desktop in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones notes that e-mail is an ideal communication tool for
young, budget-conscious families like his. ``It's a quick, easy,
inexpensive way to keep up with our family,'' he says. ``And that's
really been wonderful.''

FOREVER MISS PICKLES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of the author and her potbellied pig, Presten.
Also a sidebar with address of L'il Orphan Hammies. 
 By LISA TRYTKO 
 c.1998 WE magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Lisa Trytko, and I am 18 years old and live in Mount
Morris, Mich. I was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Not long
after potbellied pigs were introduced into the United States, I
knew that this was the pet for me. My father, however, was not so
easily convinced, and as time passed I gave up all hope of ever
receiving my wish.
</P>
<P>
   Then while I was away at summer camp, I received a letter from
my mother that said she was caring for the cutest baby girl. I
thought it strange my mother would take up baby-sitting. As I read
further, she elaborated: She was, in fact, caring for a 6-month-old
potbellied piglet. Best of all, she said it was my piglet. I was
overjoyed!
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after I arrived home, I had the privilege of the
very first visit with Miss Pickles, named by my mother, who had
noticed that her body formed the shape of a marinated cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Pickles grew fond of me and I of her, and we became the
best of friends. One of her favorite pastimes, naturally, was
eating, during which her unique personality came into play. When
she got her dinner, she made such a careful effort not to make a
mess, and she especially loved when I dropped spare watermelons and
cucumbers into her pen.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, her all-time favorite treat was mine as well. I
visited the pen of Miss Pickles as often as I could, bringing along
an enormous bag of marshmallows. As I offered them to her, she
would take them tenderly from my hands. Then, she gently licked off
the little sticky bits remaining on my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   She also had one odd trait: She despised getting her trotters
muddy. Whenever she did, her face twisted into an expression of
disgust. Then she carefully picked up a foot as she attempted to
clean it. Every time my mother cleaned her pen, she ran around it
oinking, as if to say, ``You missed this spot. And that one!''
</P>
<P>
   At about this time, I was in junior high school and my grades
were slipping because of kids who saw nothing in me but my
disability. They would tease me relentlessly and I would become
extremely stressed, which, in turn, caused me to go into seizures.
My constant comfort throughout the seventh and eighth grades was
Miss Pickles. I would confess my crisis of the day while she and I
munched on marshmallows. As I poured my heart out, her tall swished
and she oinked, as if attempting to give me counsel.
</P>
<P>
   I thought my guiding light would be with me all my life, but
life had other things in store.
</P>
<P>
   One day my mother had the vet come out for Miss Pickles' first
health examination and shots. The vet had to sedate her in order to
complete the examination, then gave her a clean bill of health. The
forecast was cold for the night, so the vet recommended we bring
her inside until the anesthetic wore off and then return her to her
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was opening my eyes the next morning, I heard mumbling
voices, then a cry, and, slowly, my mother entered my room to tell
me Miss Pickles had died in the night. As I heard those words, the
walls of security and happiness that had surrounded me shattered.
Grief entered my world.
</P>
<P>
   Mom had bookmarked a website where owners of potbellied pigs
from around the world share stories about their pets. She posted my
story, and then e-mails of condolence poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the generous offers of new pigs was one from Sue
Parkinson of L'il Orphan Hammies, a nonprofit, potbellied pig
sanctuary in Solvang, Calif., where her lifework is caring for
abandoned and disabled potbellied pigs. She said her own beloved
PJ, short for Pete junior, had died recently, and I could have not
one but two piglets!
</P>
<P>
   Once again, after many months of being pigless, I arrived home
from camp, this time to two special bundles, Presten and Westen.
Presten, on hearing the word ``circle'' as he's handed a treat, is
a downright showoff, spinning in circles like a tornado. Westen is
endearing but shy. The Boys, as we call them, recently learned to
swim in a kiddy pool in their pen.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for Presten and Westen brings me joy now and enables most
of the void within my heart to be filled. Part of it will never be,
and it is there that my cherished memories of Miss Pickles will
always rest in peace.

TIMELESS ADVICE ON AGING
</HEADLINE>
  With Internet address of Cicero website) 
 By HERBERT STEIN 
 c.1998 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old age is the new rage. That was apparent even before John
Glenn, aged 77, went up into space. There are more old people than
ever. Many of them have word processors. Many of those pass their
free time writing. And, following the advice of all teachers of
writing, they write about what they know, which is old age. So
there is a lot of writing on that subject. Even Jimmy Carter has
written a book about old age.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to keep up with this trend, I have just reread the
classic on the subject, Marcus Tullius Cicero's ``De Senectute.''
The last time I read it was 68 years ago. I read it then in Latin.
Today I read it in the wonderful Loeb Classic Library edition, with
the Latin on the left page and the English on the right. I read the
right page.
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly believe that I read it in Latin when I was a junior
in high school. And I can't imagine what I learned about old age,
reading it in my teens. We didn't read ``De Senectute'' to learn
about old age. My Latin teacher believed that reading Latin _ any
Latin _ made tiny grooves in your brain that increased your general
intelligence _ not just your capacity to read Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero wrote the essay in 44 B.C., when he was 62 years old. One
might think that was pretty old for a Roman of that time, but
Cicero evidently didn't think it was old enough to qualify him to
discourse on the subject. He wrote in the voice of Cato the Elder
in the year 150 B.C., when Cato was 84 years old. In fact, Cicero
did not live to experience much old age. The year after writing the
essay he was executed for being on the wrong side of a political
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The essay consists of a long answer by Cato to questions posed
by two younger men, one 35 and one 36. They ask him ``on what
principles we may most easily support the weight of increasing
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato breaks down the question. He identifies four reasons why
old age appears to be an unhappy time: First, it withdraws us from
active pursuits. Second, it makes the body weaker. Third, it
deprives us of all physical pleasures. And fourth, it is not far
removed from death.
</P>
<P>
   He then discusses these four concerns. Translating the answers
into the English of 1998, they almost all consist of saying that
the quality of one's old age depends on the investments one made in
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   I don't refer, and Cicero didn't either, to financial
investments that assure one a comfortable income in old age.
(Cicero came from a wealthy family.) I am sure that financial
investments are important, and I don't suppose Cicero would have
denied that. But there are other kinds of investments implicit in
Cicero's discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is investment in one's health and bodily
strength. I don't think the Romans of Cicero's time had a cigarette
problem. But it seems clear from the examples he gives that having
a satisfactory old age depends on adequacy of physical exercise and
moderation of eating and drinking in the years before.
</P>
<P>
   Another investment important for old age is friendships. Cicero
has Cato say, ``I have always had my club companions.'' Cato takes
pride in having been instrumental, when he was 30 years old, in
establishing certain clubs in Rome, ``and therefore I used to dine
with these companions _ in an altogether moderate way, yet with a
certain ardor appropriate to my age, which, as time goes on, daily
mitigates my zest for every pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Stoic, Cicero-Cato does not regret but rather welcomes
the decline of appetite for what he calls ``sensual'' pleasure. He
praises the value of the intellectual and aesthetic pleasures in
which an old man can still indulge. But to fully appreciate art,
science and nature in old age requires some prior investment in
cultivating them.
</P>
<P>
   An even older source reminds me of an investment for old age at
which Cicero only hints. Genesis 24:1 says, ``And Abraham was old,
well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all
things.'' According to my rabbi (I don't want to pretend to be a
student of such things), later commentators said that meant that
Abraham was blessed with the recognition that he had passed the
trials of his life with valor and devotion and could now enjoy a
peaceful retirement, content in his own eyes and in the eyes of
God.
</P>
<P>
   He had, in today's parlance, paid his dues. That is another
investment one can make for old age: so to conduct oneself in prior
years that one can feel one has paid one's dues.
</P>
<P>
   On the final question of how to invest to prepare for the
proximity of death in old age, Cicero is not very helpful. (Who
is?) He offers his ``philosophical'' view. Death brings at least an
end to those troublesome appetites and may open the way to
something better _ he doesn't say what.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one could indoctrinate oneself in that attitude in youth
and so prepare for old age. But obviously Cicero did not find that
philosophy sufficient. As the introduction to the Loeb edition
says, ``In February 45 (a year before he wrote ``De Senectute'')
the death of his adored and only daughter drove him into a frenzy
of writing in an effort to forget his grief.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not accept the fact of his daughter Tullia's death with
the thought that she had at least escaped all appetites. His
philosophy might have prepared him for his own death; it did not
prepare him for the death of one he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Later he wrote an essay titled ``Consolatio,'' which probably
dealt with this subject and which I have not read. If he was
rescued from his grief, it was apparently time and work, not
philosophy, that rescued him.

AMERICAN AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By NORMA BLAIR 
 c.1998 Ann Normansell 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the problems with moving to a foreign country is learning
the language. After nearly 30 years in the U.S. I still find myself
using expressions that produce blank stares from my listeners.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example of this came when I pronounced myself
``a little peckish,'' and saw the familiar glazed expression
appear. When I appealed to a bystander he was able to provide a
translation, but the experience brought home to me the fact that
the English and the Americans are more divided than united by their
common language.
</P>
<P>
   In self-defense one has to adopt certain terms for use in
everyday life. Thus I wash my windshield, not my windscreen, and
stash stuff in the trunk rather than the boot. I also check my
``skedule'' rather than my ``shed-yule'' if asked to do something,
which may be the reason that I am accused of ``talking American''
when I visit England, even though I am immediately tabbed as a
foreigner over here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I have yet to understand, though, is why I am
sometimes called ``veddy British.'' Is that really how the English
``very'' is heard? Shortly after we came to Virginia, I was
chatting with the mailman (not the postman!) and happened to
mention that we were from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's where you're from, is it?'' he replied. ``I thought
you were from one of those Northern states.''
</P>
<P>
   In England I had similar problems. While in college I got a
summer job at the seaside with a family who had a 12-year-old boy
and a 6-year-old girl. Being from the north of England, I build
sand castles (short ``a'') rather than cahstles.
</P>
<P>
   One day we were discussing home towns and, when the fact of my
northern origin emerged, the 6-year-old said, ``Oh, is that why you
don't speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   My acclimatization began on the day that we arrived in
Charlottesville, when we were welcomed into a colleague's home and
our children were offered ``peanut butter and jelly.'' Since jelly
is a gelatine dessert in England, and no mention was made of
``sandwich,'' I had a very strange vision of what was being
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterwards I realized that my English might be more
archaic than the local norm. I told one of the children in that
same household not to ``tread'' on something (not a snake!) and got
the soon-to-be-familiar blank stare. Her mother, a Tennessean who
became a good friend, recommended that I use ``step'' or ``walk''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   She was the person who said ``You have to be kidding!'' when I
said ``aluminium'' instead of ``aluminum.'' Yes, there really is an
extra ``i'' in the word in England, and it is one of the few words
I have learned to pronounce differently. Others, like ``tomayto,''
``vite-amin,'' and the Greek letters ``bayta,'' ``thayta,'' etc.
have been more difficult to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise slurring ``t's'' into ``d's.'' When our daughter went
to nursery school, she brought home tales of a child named
``Doddy,'' which seemed an unusual name for a girl. I knew it as
the nickname of the English comedian Ken Dodd, he of the buck teeth
and electric shock hair, who was popular then. It was not until I
met ``Marty,'' pronounced ``Mardy,'' that I made the connection and
realized that I had been hearing about ``Dottie.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, I was totally confounded when I met another ``Marty''
whose name turned out to be ``Mardie.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping can also be an interesting experience. When I asked
where I might find a ``Thermos flask'' in K-Mart, I got a very odd
look until the assistant divined that I might be looking for a
``Thermos bottle.'' And I would love to have been there when a
fellow alien asked for batteries for her ``torch'' _ it wasn't even
Olympic season!
</P>
<P>
   I have learned to avoid the obvious pitfalls, like abbreviating
pussycat, but I still goof at times when talking about waking
people up in the mornings. Long before alarm clocks and telephone
wake-up calls, there was a person in the north of England who
walked the streets in the predawn hours, carrying a long pole with
which he tapped on upper storey windows. His official title was
``the Knocker-up.''

PETER FONDA'S UNEASY RIDE TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Peter Fonda and
Katherine Heigl in ``The Tempest.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At 59 Peter Fonda has finally emerged on the Hollywood scene as
the most famous of the famous Fondas. It's taken him a long time.
 &HT;    He struggled for decades to emulate his dad Henry, Hollywood's
rock-solid attraction, who died in l982.
 &HT;    Then it was Jane's turn to become the hot Fonda: Fonda the sex
symbol, and the Oscar winner. Today Jane has taken herself out of
movies _ concentrating on her latest role as devoted wife to
entertainment mogul Ted Turner.
 &HT;    Then Bridget, Peter's daughter, had her flurry with fame and is
still going strong with her latest film ``A Simple Plan.''
 &HT;    But today it's finally Peter's turn. At last Hollywood regards
him as a star in his own right.
 &HT;    He started of course with a humdinger: He was ``Easy Rider'''s
wild Captain America in the '60s, riding a motor bike in black
leather and shades, popping LSD with cohorts Dennis Hopper and a
callow Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    His role as the maverick biker in the l969 film mimicked his
real attitude to America in that era of Vietnam. Moviegoers around
the world loved it; Hollywood gave him the cold shoulder.
 &HT;    He continued to work in low-budget movies like ``Outlaw Blues''
(1977) and the cult film ``Love and a .45'' (1994). None of them
put him into Hollywood's actor's A-league.
 &HT;    ``I became an outsider. I moved to a ranch in Montana and did
the few films that were offered to me. I never thought I'd have a
chance to come back to the fold.''
 &HT;    Now he's an elder statesman, almost as respectable as his dad.
Last year he wrote a book about Henry Fonda called ``Don't Tell
Dad.'' Earlier this year also, he won praise and an Oscar
nomination for his role in ``Ulee's Gold.'' Jack Nicholson went
home with the best actor statuette but suddenly Hollywood was
paying attention to the former black sheep of the Fonda family.
 &HT;    Back in the early days when I interviewed him, he was troubled
young actor, caught up in the drug scene with a career as erratic
as his own behavior. But times have changed _ and so has Peter.
 &HT;    Now he's about to show up in another eye-catching serious role,
in special effects extravaganza, ``The Tempest,'' (airing on NBC
Dec. 13) an inventive retelling of Shakespeare's magical tale of
love, betrayal and freedom.
 &HT;    This time they've set the story on a mysterious isle in a
Mississippi bayou during the Civil War. Fonda plays Gideon Prosper,
who has abdicated his position as overseer of the family
plantation, choosing instead to devote his time to magic and
sorcery. The movie co-stars John Glover as Gideon's scoundrel
younger brother and Katherine Heigl Prosper's devoted daughter.
 &HT;    At 59, in blue jeans and cowboy boots with as much silver as
brown in his hair, his face handsome but leathery from long days in
the Montana Big Sky country, he sits in a suite at a ritzy hotel in
Pasadena, Calif., happily talking about his latest role and his
path in life.
 &HT;    ``I know Shakespeare's 'Tempest' and this is fairly on target
but set in a different time. It deals with deceit, brother against
brother. The special effects are really cool.''
 &HT;    It sometimes seems that Peter's acting career might have been
programmed into his DNA?. ``This is nothing genetic,'' he insists.
``The fact that my father and my sister, myself and my daughter are
all actors has nothing to do with genes. Had it something to do
with genes, I would have been manipulating them a long time ago.
But as I grew older people were saying, 'You look like your dad.'
In fact my bone structure is the same as his, but I really look
more like my mother around my eyes.''
 &HT;    Many in Hollywood said his part in ``Ulee's Gold'' _ playing a
grizzled, ex-Vietnam veteran turned beekeeper coping with his
grandkids _ was the role that has reestablished him as a leading
Hollywood star. And most also agree it was a typical Henry Fonda
role.
 &HT;    For a long time Peter might have resented that kind of talk. Not
anymore. ``I don't think of getting out from underneath the shadow
or the identity of being Henry Fonda's son. It hasn't been
something bad for me,'' he now observes.
 &HT;    ``It's an honor to be compared to his style of acting. And it's
interesting that the last thing he was seen doing was basically `On
Golden Pond' _ with a downturned mouth, grizzled and wearing wire
rimmed glasses, just like my character in `Ulee's Gold.'''
 &HT;    Growing up as a Fonda was never an easy ride for Peter. In many
ways his life was a constant struggle to win his father's approval.
The only problem was it wasn't winnable and even if it had been his
father couldn't have told him so. ``My father was a very shy man.
He didn't know how to communicate with anyone _ but particularly
with his children.''
 &HT;    Yet he was all they had. Peter and Jane were raised by their
father after their mother, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw Fonda
committed suicide in l950 in a rest home where she was recovering
from a nervous breakdown.
 &HT;    ``My father never told Jane and I that mother had taken her own
life. We had to learn that from magazine and newspaper stories. I
know now he didn't do it to be cruel. He just didn't know how to
find the words to tell us.''
 &HT;    And just hours after his wife died Henry stepped on stage to do
a Broadway performance. That so upset Peter, who was 10 at the
time, that he shot himself through the kidney and liver with a
.22-caliber pistol.
 &HT;    Their father eventually remarried three times and with each
marriage he became further estranged from his two oldest children.
 &HT;    Peter remembers his dad as a tightlipped man who could never
express his emotions and bottled them up in a mask of disapproval.
``His silence was always a factor in our relationship. At the
dinner table not a word would be spoken.''
 &HT;    Peter and Jane, he says, thought their father was, ``this madman
who wouldn't smile or anything.''
 &HT;    In l979 Fonda was preparing to direct a low-budget film called
``Wanda Nevada.'' There was a small role in it perfectly suited to
his dad.
 &HT;    ``I literally had to cajole him into taking the role and he was
miserable the whole time. But then he sent me another of his famous
letters to tell me it had been one of the best experiences of his
41 years in the business.''
 &HT;    Peter says he worked hard to mend fences with his dad. And his
book about the man who was one of Hollywood's legends was softer
than most thought: ``I didn't have to tear his memory to shreds
because we had made our peace before he died.''
 &HT;    In ``Ulee's Gold'' he found a role that told the world that
Peter Fonda has finally grown up.
 &HT;    Now Peter has only one regret: That his dad isn't alive to see
his return to the mainstream: ``I think it would have amused him
greatly, that I have _ even in some small way _ become him. The
wonderful thing about having had Henry Fonda for a father is that
he is always within reach. I have just to turn on the TV _ and he's
there. It's a great legacy he's left me and the world.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; __ NOTE: Amnesty International, the world's premier
human-rights organization and recipient of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, is sponsoring a yearlong campaign to spotlight human-rights
violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has monitored U.S. abuses since the 1960s, but the
1999 campaign is Amnesty's first effort to focus worldwide
attention on these violations. Its priorities are police brutality,
prison conditions, the death penalty and the treatment of asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants the United States to ratify without reservation
certain international treaties, including the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and to better monitor U.S. foreign weapons
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Sane, the London-based secretary-general, is primary
spokesman for the group, which has 1 million members, 300,000 of
them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sane, a native of Dakar, Senegal, has pursued doctoral studies
at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada and holds an M.S. in
public administration and public policy from the London School of
Economics. He joined Amnesty International in 1988, and became
secretary-general in 1992. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   .................................
</P>
<P>
   What Amnesty International has documented in our research, and
this is over the years _ since the first 17 reports that we have
issued _ are a number of violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States prides itself on being the land of
liberty and the land of democracy, people believe bad things may be
happening but only as isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Our concern now is that there is a deterioration of the
human-rights condition. The United States has the highest
incarceration rate in the world, 1.7 million prisoners, including
79,624 women. And those numbers have really rocketed since the
'80s. The death penalty is used more and more frequently, with less
and less mercy. Juvenile offenders are executed. Mentally ill
people are executed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the prisons are deteriorating. We find cells that
have vermin. Overcrowding is leading to violence of inmates on
inmates, and guards failing to protect inmates from violence, as
well as violence by the guards _ physical assaults, sexual assaults
on women. The use of technology such as stun guns and pepper spray
is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   And complacency, coupled with the legitimate concern of the
population for safety and the spread of drug use, is manipulated by
politicians. All of this is further eroding human-rights protection
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, the members of Amnesty International will be
engaging in an awareness-raising campaign. We want other
governments and intergovernmental bodies to fulfill their
obligations to the American people. We want other governments to
challenge the U.S. government to put its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet Mexico's secretary of foreign affairs, I'll say:
``When you visit the United States and meet with your counterpart,
you should raise your concerns regarding the deteriorating
human-rights condition in the United States.'' Our members also
will be writing letters, expressiong concerns and targeting
Congress, state governors and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, I think people would agree that the United
States uses double standards. In the Middle East, people will often
discuss the way the United States deals with Israel, on the one
hand, and Iraq, on the other, in terms of the implementation of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In western Europe, people find it shocking that the United
States is the only Western industrialized country that continues to
use the death penalty, especially against juvenile offenders and
mentally impaired people.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries of Asia, there is a resistance to human rights
because they perceive that the United States is instrumentalizing
human rights for other purposes, not necessarily out of real
concern for the well-being of the Chinese people, or the Malaysian
people.
</P>
<P>
   They say, ``Why should the United States have concerns regarding
the treatment of prisoners in China when its own prisoners in the
United States are treated in this way?'' They believe it's totally
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. image internationally is also changing through the life
experiences of asylum seekers who, fleeing persecution, come to
what they believe is the land of freedom and find themselves locked
up in jail. For many in America, the promise of equal rights for
all is still a fake promise.
</P>
<P>
   When asylum seekers came from Russia and Communist states, they
were welcome because the United States was using it to show the
superiority of the country, with people fleeing dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same people are fleeing the same dictatorships, but they
are coming from Latin America, Africa and Asia. They are seeking
asylum for exactly the same reasons that led people from eastern
Europe to seek asylum. Instead of being protected and granted the
level of protection to which they are entitled under international
law, they are treated like criminals. And this is because they are
black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics in Amnesty International's report show that you are
more likely to face the death penalty for crimes in which the
victim is white. The black population, compared to its total
percentage, is overrepresented on death row. And I have visited
death row in Texas and Pennsylvania _ there is no millionaire on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those who end up on death row, in large part, had
totally inadequate legal representation. People are fighting for
their lives but they don't have the means to have adequate legal
representation, and they end up being sentenced to death. So from
poverty and being black, you are at risk in America.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the best way to eliminate racism and poverty is
to ensure the full respect for all human rights. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights contains the set of rights that are
guaranteed to everyone, and which governments have an obligation to
meet. Human rights are a way to preserve peace and ensure justice,
and also a way to help heal nations and improve the interaction
among members of just societies.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Congress admonishes Turkey, Colombia, Cuba and
other nations, it does so on the basis of international
human-rights law. When the State Department publishes annual
reports on human rights around the world, they are based on
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   International human-rights law IS the United States of America.
It's the United States that chaired the committee that drafted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It's the United
States that took the lead in establishing the International
Tribunal at Nuremberg. So the United States has been the lead actor
in the development of international law.
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult to develop standards when the United States
opposes them and uses its influence to twist the arms of many of
its allies. As a result, these treaties are developed by consensus
and, once developed, they are used by the United States as a
yardstick against which to judge others.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot be above the law. The Convention on the
Rights of the Child prohibits explicitly the execution of juvenile
offenders, defined as young persons under 18. Those children
require special protection, and when they commit a crime, the
convention reads that they should not be executed. When the United
States does that, it is in breach of the convention. Since 1990
only six countries have executed juveniles: Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Pakistan, Nigeria and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I met a woman from Chicago who gave testimony for
Amnesty's report about being shackled in leg irons when transported
from prison to the hospital to give birth. And she was shackled
during labor for seven and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   I can't understand the logic of the system that shackles women
while they are giving birth. I can understand that some prisoners
may be dangerous and you need to protect others and protect the
prisoners from harming themselves. But a woman who is giving birth
cannot be thinking about trying to escape or harm herself. Why
should she be contained in shackles? Women give birth in prison
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Amnesty's recommendations is to increase police
accountability by ensuring that we have effective methods of
oversight. Another is to develop and enforce standards for the
treatment of prisoners. We need to ban the use of stun belts and do
serious research into the use of pepper spray. There's no reason to
jail asylum seekers; these are not criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we want to abolish the death penalty, but in the
meantime, we think that juveniles should not be executed. Mentally
impaired people should not be executed, and resources should be
provided for legal aid for the impotent. People fighting for their
lives in the courts have the worst legal conditions; that is
totally unfair.

 c.1998 Emerge  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; __ NOTE: Amnesty International, the world's premier
human-rights organization and recipient of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, is sponsoring a yearlong campaign to spotlight human-rights
violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has monitored U.S. abuses since the 1960s, but the
1999 campaign is Amnesty's first effort to focus worldwide
attention on these violations. Its priorities are police brutality,
prison conditions, the death penalty and the treatment of asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants the United States to ratify without reservation
certain international treaties, including the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and to better monitor U.S. foreign weapons
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Sane, the London-based secretary-general, is primary
spokesman for the group, which has 1 million members, 300,000 of
them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sane, a native of Dakar, Senegal, has pursued doctoral studies
at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada and holds an M.S. in
public administration and public policy from the London School of
Economics. He joined Amnesty International in 1988, and became
secretary-general in 1992. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   .................................
</P>
<P>
   What Amnesty International has documented in our research, and
this is over the years _ since the first 17 reports that we have
issued _ are a number of violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States prides itself on being the land of
liberty and the land of democracy, people believe bad things may be
happening but only as isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Our concern now is that there is a deterioration of the
human-rights condition. The United States has the highest
incarceration rate in the world, 1.7 million prisoners, including
79,624 women. And those numbers have really rocketed since the
'80s. The death penalty is used more and more frequently, with less
and less mercy. Juvenile offenders are executed. Mentally ill
people are executed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the prisons are deteriorating. We find cells that
have vermin. Overcrowding is leading to violence of inmates on
inmates, and guards failing to protect inmates from violence, as
well as violence by the guards _ physical assaults, sexual assaults
on women. The use of technology such as stun guns and pepper spray
is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   And complacency, coupled with the legitimate concern of the
population for safety and the spread of drug use, is manipulated by
politicians. All of this is further eroding human-rights protection
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, the members of Amnesty International will be
engaging in an awareness-raising campaign. We want other
governments and intergovernmental bodies to fulfill their
obligations to the American people. We want other governments to
challenge the U.S. government to put its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet Mexico's secretary of foreign affairs, I'll say:
``When you visit the United States and meet with your counterpart,
you should raise your concerns regarding the deteriorating
human-rights condition in the United States.'' Our members also
will be writing letters, expressiong concerns and targeting
Congress, state governors and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, I think people would agree that the United
States uses double standards. In the Middle East, people will often
discuss the way the United States deals with Israel, on the one
hand, and Iraq, on the other, in terms of the implementation of
U.N. resolutions.

<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ ATLANTA _ I got zapped by somebody's BMW
horn the other day for, apparently, having committed an egregious
civility. I had paused to let a marooned driver take a left in
front of me. This, to paraphrase Churchill, is an insult up with
which a BMW driver will not put. What the heck's the use buying a
luxury car if you can't drive over someone whenever you want?

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The House impeachment hearings are vacillating
between farce and slow-motion attempted coup. For farce, there was
the Judiciary Committee's vote to expand its inquiry into
fund-raising for the Clinton re-election _ on the day when Federal
Elections Commission auditors recommended record paybacks from both
the Clinton and the Dole campaigns for similar irregularities. (Tom

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ It may seem only minor that baseball
took away the 2000 All-Star game from South Florida and awarded it
to Atlanta. But beneath it lies something that should concern any
city with a major league team, or one hoping to get one. It's about
a new stadium. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ What would have happened if Augusto
Pinochet had chosen to have his back surgery done in New York

dictator to face charges of murder, torture and genocide? (Andy
Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington
bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ It's amazing how many people
work in retail sales jobs but don't know anything about the

SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ If only a time warp could take us back to the
days when the window display was the latest in animated technology.
Shopping downtown was the big outing of our family Christmas
season. But now, there's something depressing about having a
Santaland window, but no Lazarus. And no Santa. For Santa, you have
to go to the 'burbs, or to the downtown Elder-Beerman on the
weekends. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR SATURDAY

<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ Now that almost all of you have missed out on
getting Furbys (which, when you say it like that, sounds more like
a disease than a toy), you may be wondering what to get your kids
for Christmas. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the obvious effects
of global warming is that years are a lot shorter than they used to
be. When I was growing up and waiting on another visit from Santa
Claus, Christmases were at least as far apart as world wars. Now a
year is nothing but the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
Christmas all run together, not counting birthdays and all the
other days merchants set aside for special sales. (Minter, Cox News
Service) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If you spend half your life
making change so you can park downtown, you've probably got several
questions about the new City of Austin policy that exempts Texas
lawmakers from being ticketed at parking meters. Like, for example,
how do you get a cushy deal like this? Simple. Run for office.

   ARKANSAS-PIES _ DE VALLS BLUFF, Ark. _ Tasting the South visits
one of the South's legendary sweet spots, the Family Pie Shop of De

   w/NY-HOLIDAYS-CHELSEA _ NEW YORK _ West Chelsea is changing at
lightning speed. No sooner did a few major galleries, like Paula
Cooper and Matthew Marks, transform a couple of garages into
elegant white boxes two years ago than a Gold Rush-like migration
began. Already, some 80 galleries occupy storefronts and low-rise
buildings in the area running from 14th to 26th streets between
10th Avenue and the Hudson River. Can Dolce &AMP; Gabana be far behind?
(Fox, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED WEDNESDAY FOR SUNDAY.

<P>
   NY-HOLIDAYS-CHELSEAHOTEL _ NEW YORK _ A few blocks from the
burgeoning gallery district of West Chelsea, in Chelsea proper, are
two hotels that are about as similar as Sister Wendy and Madonna.
The Leo House is not really even a hotel, but a nonprofit Catholic
guest house. For an experience in contrast, check out (or into) the

which exudes a shabby, bohemian air. (Fox, Atlanta

   NY-HOLIDAYS-SOHO _ NEW YORK _ The SoHo Grand Hotel is the kind
of place where those often surreal encounters one has in New York

we did one recent afternoon, Icelandic rock queen Bjork and famed

<P>
   MOSES _ He's the man of the season, that Hebrew Bible character
who floated through the bullrushes as a baby and parted the Red Sea
as an adult. With the opening of the Dreamworks movie ``The Prince
of Egypt,'' nicknamed Zion King, Moses is drawing attention. We

Along the way she's popped up in some un-jazzy places, like
``Melrose Place'' and the Lilith Fair, while cutting the figure of
a sophisticated blonde out of a '40s movie. As it happens, the diva
in Donna Karan is just a regular gal, one who likes her steaks rare

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ ATLANTA _ I got zapped by somebody's BMW
horn the other day for, apparently, having committed an egregious
civility. I had paused to let a marooned driver take a left in
front of me. This, to paraphrase Churchill, is an insult up with
which a BMW driver will not put. What the heck's the use buying a
luxury car if you can't drive over someone whenever you want?

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The House impeachment hearings are vacillating
between farce and slow-motion attempted coup. For farce, there was
the Judiciary Committee's vote to expand its inquiry into
fund-raising for the Clinton re-election _ on the day when Federal
Elections Commission auditors recommended record paybacks from both
the Clinton and the Dole campaigns for similar irregularities. (Tom
Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ It may seem only minor that baseball
took away the 2000 All-Star game from South Florida and awarded it
to Atlanta. But beneath it lies something that should concern any
city with a major league team, or one hoping to get one. It's about
a new stadium. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox

Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ If only a time warp could take us back to the
days when the window display was the latest in animated technology.
Shopping downtown was the big outing of our family Christmas
season. But now, there's something depressing about having a
Santaland window, but no Lazarus. And no Santa. For Santa, you have

<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the obvious effects
of global warming is that years are a lot shorter than they used to
be. When I was growing up and waiting on another visit from Santa
Claus, Christmases were at least as far apart as world wars. Now a
year is nothing but the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
Christmas all run together, not counting birthdays and all the
other days merchants set aside for special sales. (Minter, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If you spend half your life
making change so you can park downtown, you've probably got several
questions about the new City of Austin policy that exempts Texas
lawmakers from being ticketed at parking meters. Like, for example,
how do you get a cushy deal like this? Simple. Run for office.

elegant white boxes two years ago than a Gold Rush-like migration
began. Already, some 80 galleries occupy storefronts and low-rise

The Leo House is not really even a hotel, but a nonprofit Catholic
guest house. For an experience in contrast, check out (or into) the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Those who wish to assure Social Security's
financial soundness for decades to come have suggested a variety of
ways to do so. But each of the solutions involve trade offs which
may make them unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   The four main components of reform plans being discussed are:
allowing individuals to privately invest their payroll taxes;
raising the retirement age beyond 67 or accelerating the schedule
for reaching 67; raising payroll taxes or cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the drawbacks to each proposal:

 &HT;    HOW BAD IS THE SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS?
 &HT;    With SOCIAL-SECURITY. For release Sunday, Dec. 6.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are doom-and-gloomers who say Social Security
will go bust in 15 years. But there are also optimists who say the
system has no problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   The way people view Social Security's financial future says much
about how, or whether, they think the federal retirement and
disability system should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely accepted view is that of the Social Security
trustees _ three Cabinet secretaries, two members of the public and
the Social Security administrator. Every year they take the
system's pulse and make three predictions about its future for the
next 75 years: a pessimistic view, an optimistic view and something
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The middle one, used as the official prediction, is that the
Social Security trust fund financed by years of excess payroll
taxes won't be depleted for 34 years. At that time, they estimate,
the 12.4 percent payroll tax from workers and employers would pay
only 75 percent of current benefits, and the tax would have to
increase 2.2 percentage points to pay all the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think the system needs major reform _ generally
conservative research groups, Republicans and some moderate
Democrats _ note payroll taxes alone won't pay all benefits by
2013. The program then will have to start redeeming the trust
fund's special Treasury bonds that represent the Social Security
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, these folks say, the money to redeem the bonds
is being spent to run the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, Social Security will have to redeem $750 billion worth
of bonds, said Michael Tanner, director of the Cato Institute's
Project on Social Security Privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that's a crisis for Social Security, it certainly is a
crisis for whomever is around trying to come up with $750
billion,'' Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   If no other funding reforms take place and the trustees' middle
estimate is correct, Tanner said, the payroll tax rate would have
to increase from 12.4 percent to 18 percent. If the trustees'
pessimistic scenario occurs, which Tanner suggests is more likely,
taxes would need to more than double to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even that might be too optimistic because the trustees' estimate
of how long people will live may be two years too low, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a cure for cancer in the next 10 years, the whole
thing definitely falls apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimists, with strong Wall Street backing, want to reform
the system by letting everyone invest some of their payroll taxes
in individually controlled accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are those _ primarily progressive economists _
who argue that even the trustees' rosiest prediction is too
pessimistic. They say nothing should be done to Social Security now
because the economic growth will solve the problem on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Baker, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute,
said the trustees' prediction of 1.4 percent annual economic growth
was ``very conservative.'' He predicted it would grow at a faster
pace, allowing the program to pay full benefits until at least
2050.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Mark Weisbrot, research director of the Preamble
Center, another economic research group, argue that even if taxes
have to be raised 2.2 percentage points as the trustees envision,
that can be easily absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase would be less than the payroll tax increases of
the 1960s, '70s and '80s, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they said, the average person's wealth should
increase by 35 to 40 percent by about 2030, so the tax increase
would not be too difficult to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Radical reforms are ``not something people need to be talking
about for 10, 15, 20 years,'' Weisbrot said, calling economic
predictions three decades in the future ``fortune telling.''

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE COULD START SHAPING SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 6. With SOCIAL-PROBLEM and SOCIAL-DATA.
In addition, SOCIAL-RADIO, a spot report on the Clinton and GOP
radio addresses, will move Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as President Clinton and Congress prepare for
the national trauma of an impeachment vote, they begin a task this
week that could prove even longer and more painful for many
Americans _ reforming Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead is a contentious debate over who will provide the
trillions of dollars in savings needed to keep the federal
retirement and disability system running through the next century.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a White House-sponsored conference Tuesday and
Wednesday that the administration expects to produce not a
solution, but a chance to get all the major players talking about
the problem and whether there might be common ground for a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But there are loads of obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The conference _ one day of public talks at a Washington hotel,
and a second behind closed doors at the White House _ comes after a
year of bitter partisanship overshadowed by the Clinton sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the scandal, the politics of Social Security is
filled with partisanship and distrust. Long called the ``third rail
of politics'' _ touch it and you die _ politicians are wary of
being seen as harming the system that benefits nearly 45 million
elderly or disabled Americans and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Republican congressional leaders want to
show their hand prematurely, particularly since any proposal is
likely to be unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was badly burned when his detailed plan to reform health
care was shredded by special interest groups four years ago. Many
blamed the Democrats' loss of their congressional majority on the
health care debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Republicans were accused of trying to wreck Medicare
in 1996 after suggesting market-based reforms, and charges that
they were trying to raid the surplus from Social Security for tax
relief was a factor in their November election losses.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Republicans are demanding Clinton put a
Social security plan on the table first. The administration is
declining to do so, claiming that would polarize positions and
discourage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's public session will likely highlight the widely
differing approaches to shrinking the funds gap. The audience of
about 250 people has been selected by the White House to include a
broad spectrum of views on reform.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three public panels, including one moderated by
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on how various reforms would
affect different segments of the population. Another will look at
the financial picture, while a third explores options for reform
espoused by leading economic and policy research groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the adminstration hopes Wednesday's private sessions will
give lawmakers a chance to explore ways to save Social Security as
well as how to proceed politically, said Gene Sperling, the
president's chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the administration plans to start negotiations
with Congress in hopes of adopting a plan before the 2000
presidential election stifles action. Basically, Social Security's
problem is demographic. There are more people, they're living
longer, and having smaller families to support them in their old
age.
</P>
<P>
   The 77 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 will
begin reaching their normal retirement ages in 2011. Meanwhile, the
number of workers supporting each one of those retirees will fall
from 3.3 to two by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   The first question for the conference is how real, and how
severe, the Social Security problem is.
</P>
<P>
   The government predicts the Social Security trust fund, built up
over the years with excess payroll taxes, will be depleted by 2032.
After that, taxes would pay only 75 percent of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the crisis will arrive as soon as 2013, while
others say there won't be a crisis at all.
</P>
<P>
   The question likely to get the most attention is whether the
system should be reformed by investing in the private securities
markets. That would be a break from Social Security's 63-year
history of paying benefits out of payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Three investment options are being considered:
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual accounts financed by a portion of payroll taxes.
This has the potential to provide higher rates of return on
investments. But it's riskier than the current system and would
result in wide differences in retirement security. Supported by the
financial services industry and most congressional Republicans, it
is opposed by organized labor and Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government investment of the surplus in private markets. This
could improve the system's overall rate of return while minimizing
the risk to individuals. Critics warn that it would result in
government control of business through stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   _ Personal accounts in addition to the payroll tax. Mixed
poltical support as a way of giving people more money at
retirement, but also opposed as an added tax which would hit the
poor hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ruled out ``radical privatization'' _ diverting all
or most payroll taxes to personal investment accounts, but has left
the door open to using a small portion of payroll taxes for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed reform would raise the eligibility age for full
benefits. It's already scheduled to increase gradually from 65 to
67 by 2027. Some plans suggest boosting the age to 70. Others
suggest reaching the 67 age limit sooner.
</P>
<P>
   But a poll by Princeton Survey Research Associates found that
three-fourths of Americans oppose raising the age limit to 70.
</P>
<P>
   Two other potential reforms would be to increase the payroll tax
or cut benefits. Neither has much support, although both are being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has virtually ruled out hiking the 12.4 percent payroll
tax rate shared by workers and employees, but has indicated a
willingness to consider raising the cap on wages subject to the
tax. The cap is $72,600 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans propose reducing guaranteed benefits and replacing
them with expected income from personal investments. Critics of
those plans warn they could be particularly harmful to elderly
women, 20 percent of whom live in poverty.

HOW CHURCHES CAN ATTRACT THE THOROUGHLY MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago I wrote a simply brilliant column suggesting
that if churches hope to appeal to modern media-savvy folk, they
need to create better advertising slogans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because my job is to be helpful _ well, that and occasionally to
knock some heads together in an annoying sort of way _ I suggested
such outstanding ideas as: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``So Forgiven We Feel Guilty.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Where You, Too, Can Get a Life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Church: It's Not Just for Sundays Anymore.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Steeple People.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``After 2,000 Years, Still Under the Same Management.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Great Death Benefits.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My notion was that slogans like these would appear in church
bulletins, newsletters and advertising and immediately attract
folks who hadn't been to a worship service since Jimmy Carter was
the nation's chief priest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, as often happens, my ideas were far ahead of their time
and, as far as I know, have pretty much been ignored by nearly
everyone _ even by my own church, which settled for a considerably
more serious slogan. (Something about how hell probably isn't all
it's cracked up to be.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of a decade later, there is evidence that my plea
for church-slogan whimsicality has been resurrected, though in a
slightly different guise _ catchy signs outside churches bearing
clever and appealing (if slightly off-plumb) messages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a clergyman I know has written a new book about how to
create church signs that work. It's called ``Signs for These
Times'' (Concordia Publishing House) by the Rev. Ronald T.
Glusenkamp, once a Kansas City pastor, now minister at Gethsemane
Lutheran Church in St. Louis. His church sits near a south side
intersection there with lots of passing traffic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glusenkamp, whose enthusiasms include bicycling and reading lots
of different newspapers every day (one reason I like him), is onto
something. He's been telling me about his slick, pop-cultury signs
for years, occasionally even sending me photos of his hottest new
signs outside his church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I remember one that said: ``BETTER THAN KARAOKE,/COME SING WITH
US.'' Well, it wouldn't win the Nobel prize in literature, but it
might convey the idea that not everyone inside Glusenkamp's church
wanders around with long, sad faces all day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when Jerry Seinfeld quit making new TV shows Glusenkamp came
up with this one: ``SO LONG, JERRY/FANS DON'T WORRY/THE BIBLE IS
SIGN-FILLED!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So now Glusenkamp has collected a batch of these changing signs
in his new book. It also includes a lot of do's and don'ts for
novice church sign makers, based on mistakes he's made or at least
thought about making. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he confesses that this church sign occurred to him
in the last year: ``THE SERMONS HERE ARE/MORE UPLIFTING/THAN
VIAGARA!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he thought better of it, proving to me that members of my
Presbyterian denomination don't have a corner on fun-squashing
discernment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glusenkamp seems to be at his best at Easter, based on these
signs: JOANNA, MARY &AMP;/MARY MAGDALENE/THE ORIGINAL SPICE GIRLS! and
EASTER:/MORE THAN SOMETHING/TO DYE FOR! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not all provocative church sign ideas are in his book. For
instance, here's one I'd like to see this shopping-crazy time of
year: IF JESUS HADN'T BEEN BORN/THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE/WOULD HAVE
TO INVENT HIM. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ There's growing support for a bias
law that would increase the penalty for any crime committed because
of the race, religion or sexual orientation of the victim. But any

That's the way to handle this stuff _ not a new law. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ As long as I can remember, I

child-like and omnipotent. You know, cozy and tucked in but
invincible to all the wind and water swirling around me. Since I
bought a house, all of that has changed. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET (San Francisco) _ Before he got on the plane to London,
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet should have checked who
was running the new British administration. He would have found
that the three top senior cabinet posts _ the finance, foreign and
defense ministers _ all cut their ideological teeth in the Scottish
Labor Party of the '70s. Back then, these young activists, now
government ministers, were radical. By ALAN BLACK.

story of how in 1851 Richard H. Pease, an Albany, N.Y., shopkeeper
and skilled lithographer, decided to promote his shop with an

   Until the latter half of the 19th century, Christmas was no big

   ``There's nothing like Christmas to make a Jew feel like a
minority,'' observes Glicksman. Although she is not religious, she
bridles when she sees ``Hanukkah bushes'' or Jewish friends
exchange Christmas gifts. And even people who know she is Jewish
send her Christmas cards with religious images. ``Sure, it's the
thought that counts, but a little more thinking could have gone a
long way,'' she writes.

Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the

IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.

SCRAPBOOKS: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL BE FAMILY TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For purchase information and to obtain photos, call New York Times
Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or
(212) 499-3333.) &HT;    
 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No doubt there's a shoebox or two up in your closet just
overflowing with snapshots dating back to your child's first
birthday, your wedding ... maybe your own childhood. How do I know
all this? Just take a look in my closets!
 &HT;    You can turn those treasured photos into albums that will become
great holiday gifts _ and family heirlooms.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking, the popular craft of creating ``memory books,''
has been sweeping the western and southern parts of the United
States for the past few years. It is quickly becoming the '90s
version of the quilting bee. Its popularity has even spread to
England, Australia and Japan.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is simple. But the list of products _ and the
terminology _ can sound intimidating to the beginner. Acid-free?
Polyurethane? Archival quality?
 &HT;    Not to worry. Just follow these simple instructions and you'll
finish your first scrapbook page in no time. And trust me _ you'll
be hooked.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that photos preserved in this fashion should
still be in good shape at least 200 years from now. I can't say the
same for my high school photo album, a magnetic album that has
turned my photos gummy and brown around the edges _ and I'm not
that old! What better treasure to pass on to your children _ and
your great-great-grandchildren.
 WHAT IS SCRAPBOOKING?  
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is a way to preserve photographs and other
memorabilia in a safe, acid-free environment. Acid can weaken and
discolor paper. As long as you choose acid-free, archival-quality
(meaning material that can be safely used for preservation
purposes) paper, pens, adhesive and sheet-protectors, you really
can't go wrong. The only thing you add is photos, love and a little
imagination.
 &HT;    Here's how to get started:
 &HT;    1. Get organized. Group your photos by year or by subject. Most
experts recommend starting with your most recent photographs and
working back in time. Because magnetic-page photo albums are quite
harmful to photos, consider removing photos from old albums and
storing them by date in a heavy-duty, acid-free photo-storage box
(which can be purchased inexpensively at most camera stores and
photo shops) until you have time to add them to your scrapbook.
 &HT;    2. Buy supplies. There is an overwhelming array of scrapbooking
products available at craft stores, stationery stores and rubber
stamp stores and by mail order. There are even stores devoted just
to scrapbooking. But all you really need to get started is the
following:
 &HT;    + Photos. Order double prints.
 &HT;    + Acid-free mounting paper, polyurethane archival-quality page
protectors and a three-ring binder. Some people prefer to use 8 1/2
x 11-inch sheets stored in sheet protectors in binders. Others use
albums of different sizes that are pre-filled with acid-free paper.
 &HT;    + Regular household scissors.
 &HT;    + Acid-free adhesive _ glue stick, photo corners or
peel-and-stick squares.
 &HT;    + Acid-free pen for ``journaling'' _ adding names, dates and
comments to the page.
 &HT;    Starter kits containing most of the above can be purchased at
many craft stores for about $25. To further enhance your pages, you
may wish to buy such items as paper punches, stickers, circle
cutters, colored paper and pens, templates for cutting shapes,
fancy-edged scissors.
 &HT;    3. Pick a theme. Christmas? Your child's birthday party? The
school picnic? Whatever your theme, play with groupings of photos.
Be choosy. Use only your best photos, whether it's one special
photo alone on a page or a grouping of four or five.
 &HT;    4. Crop and mat. You may want to crop your photos to sharpen
their focus. Trim around the most important part of the photo,
removing excess background or unnecessary elements. If you are
using old family photos or other irreplaceable photos, make color
copies and work from those.
 &HT;    You can use plain or patterned paper to create a mat. Just glue
your photo to the paper and trim around the edges, leaving a border
showing. Double- or triple-matted photos look great, too.
 &HT;    5. Add the finishing touches. After you've chosen a layout, it's
time to glue down your photos and to add stickers, stamps and _
most important _ journaling.
 &HT;    Add dates and names, of course. But don't stop there. Add
details that will make the photos come alive for future
generations. Tell a funny story about how your dog ate the
Thanksgiving turkey. List your child's five favorite songs next to
a photo showing her singing. Describe where and how far your son
hiked on the Boy Scout camping trip. It's those details that make
your scrapbook a real family treasure.
 &HT;    6. Pass it around. One of the most rewarding parts of
scrapbooking is sharing the finished book with your family. Kids
can learn a lot from looking at scrapbooks. Older kids enjoy
looking back on family activities and sharing the book with
friends. Toddlers and preschoolers learn names of family members,
pick up lots of new words and enjoy looking at themselves when they
were ``just babies.''
 &HT;    And all kids feel like VIPs as they turn the pages. After all,
they're the stars of their very own book.

AMERICA'S FIRST CHRISTMAS CARD 
</HEADLINE>

Times Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550
or (212) 499-3333.
 &HT;    
 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Once a year, Christmas cards flood America's mailboxes. Once a
year, countless fingers go numb from signing and addressing stacks
of them.
 &HT;    How did this tradition come to be?
 &HT;    The first Christmas card can be traced to a long-forgotten
businessman named Richard H. Pease. History records little of Pease
except that he was a skilled lithographer and printer who set up
shop in Albany in 1850. In 1851, whether in a fit of Yuletide
whimsy or in a savvy burst of self-promotion, he put bold black ink
to stiff, pristine white paper and crafted an intricate design.
 &HT;    On 4 1/2-by-6-inch cards, the holiday entrepreneur fashioned
images that later generations might have deemed too ``busy'' in
such a limited space, but that Americans of the 1850s found
perfectly fitting, given the mid-19th century affinity for
Victorian vistas and Currier &AMP; Ives prints.
 &HT;    A gracefully curved line of holly adorned the bottom of the
card, and prominently above the inked leaves ran the creator's
advertisement _ ``Pease's Great Variety Store in the Temple of
Fancy.''
 &HT;    ``Temple of Fancy'' perfectly described the images crowding the
card, Pease having turned his imagination and his drawing hand
loose in a burst of Christmas creativity. Featured in his holiday
motifs was, of course, Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Pease's Santa, however, bore only a passing resemblance to the
rotund St. Nick that famed 19th-century caricaturist Thomas Nast
later stamped upon the nation's collective imagination. The
businessman's Santa appeared on the card as a small, rather elflike
Santa Claus with a fur-trimmed cap.
 &HT;    Pease's card also featured scenes of how middle- and upper-class
Americans of the day celebrated Christmas. Arrayed around the
card's four corners were Christmas presents, Christmas dishes and
Christmas drinks, all hinting of mouthwatering holiday repasts and
heartfelt toasts.
 &HT;    In the card's center, a young, handsome couple, faces redolent
of holiday cheer and financial comfort, enjoyed the Yuletide
exuberance of their three children. Behind the beaming family, a
servant was setting an elaborate holiday dinner, a familiar scene
in affluent and middle-class households throughout the United
States. Reflecting an equally familiar but more disturbing reality
of 1850s American life was the black servant bustling about the
table.
 &HT;    Whether they knew it or not, friends and customers peering at
Pease's landmark cards, with their vivid black and white tones and
their boldly inked message, ``A Merry Christmas and A Happy New
Year,'' literally held the future theme of the Christmas card in
their hands.
 &HT;    Pease's card also contained the stuff of printers' nightmares.
To his friends' and customers' probable amusement and to his
certain chagrin, the engraver's cards included a misspelled word:
``Pease's Great Varety Store.''
 &HT;    In 1874, 24 years after Pease's flight of holiday fancy
materialized, Massachusetts lithographer Louis Prang unveiled a
line of beautiful commercial Christmas cards that spawned a
lucrative industry and earned him the sobriquet ``Father of the
American Christmas Card.''
 &HT;    For generations to come, Prang, whose pleasant, white-whiskered
features resembled those of the Santas in his popular cards, was
hailed as the first American to craft Christmas cards. Pease's
milestone card slipped into historical obscurity, eclipsed by the
commercial and artistic feat of Prang, who would long receive
mistaken acclaim as the creator of the very first American
Christmas card.
 &HT;    In 1954, greeting card authority Gyorgy Buday completed his
detailed book ``The History of the Christmas Card,'' which credited
Prang as the creator of the Christmas card. His publisher was at
the page-proof stage, when the author had a surprise for his
editors.
 &HT;    Buday had just received a letter from E.D. Chase, who had
enclosed a copy of ``the first American Christmas card'' -- Richard
Pease's card.
 &HT;    Buday went on to anoint Pease's card as the first: ``No date
appears on the lithograph itself, but as a result of some
considerable research, Mr. Chase satisfactorily established that it
must be either 1850, 1 or 2, since it was only these three years
that Mr. Pease occupied the building which is pictured prominently
on the card.''
 &HT;    Other scholars of Americana followed Buday's attempt to assign
Pease's card its proper place in the greeting card firmament. That
Prang had created the first commercially successful cards remains
clear. But Pease's creation stands as the nation's first bonafide
Christmas card.
 &HT;    We will never know if Pease's marriage of Christmas and commerce
bloomed ahead of its time, or if he, unlike Prang in the 1870s,
simply failed to parlay his idea into a holiday fortune.

 Hanukkah Bushes? Bah, Humbug!

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I come from humbug beginnings. Raised as a Jew, I sat on Santa's
lap once at a department store, but it wasn't encouraged. My mother
likely gave in because I was too young to understand the cosmic
implications.
 &HT;    Today, I consider it treason when Jews create ``Hanukkah
bushes'' or exchange gifts on Christmas. I, who don't belong to a
synagogue or light sabbath candles, still feel my roots erupt when
assaulted by Christmas.
 &HT;    The unbidden feelings come from years of singing Yuletide carols
in elementary school and being asked too many times what I did for
``The Holiday.'' When I answer indifferently that I worked, went to
a movie or grabbed a bite in Chinatown, people are suddenly quiet.
 &HT;    There's nothing like Christmas to make a Jew feel like a
minority. I know someone in Harleysville, Pa., who looked high and
low for Hanukkah candles. After painfully trying to describe to
clueless salespeople what menorah candles looked like, a clerk
suggested he use birthday candles _ a ludicrous concept to anyone
who knows the difference. The same person complained to a local
Wal-Mart manager when he couldn't find a Jewish New Year's card in
stock at Rosh Hashanah.
 &HT;    Most of the holiday cards I receive are bald-faced Christmas
cards, usually from people who 1) know I am Jewish, and 2) do not
know that Hanukkah began two weeks before Christmas.
 &HT;    While some feature neutral winter landscapes, others are
foil-embossed nativity scenes or living rooms steeped in candy
canes and boughs of holly. Sure, it's the thought that counts, but
a little more thinking could have gone a long way.
 &HT;    One year I happened upon a great series of cards called ``Mixed
Blessings.'' These cards use playful interdenominational pictures,
such as Santa skating a Star of David on ice or a reindeer with
antlers shaped like a menorah. Perfect to send anyone in the spirit
of unity.
 &HT;    Still, if you want to get technical, Hanukkah does not draw top
billing in the rank of Jewish holidays. When you care enough to
send the very best, send a card for the Jewish New Year, usually in
September.
 &HT;    Really, I'm not a grinch. I think the holiday season is a great
nudge for keeping tabs on faraway friends. Bragging family form
letters aside, I enjoy receiving their cards with news of a new
baby or a career switch. Likewise, I too have been known to think
about the people in my life each December who deserve a note from
the heart, seasonal or otherwise.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For kids with computers, there's no better gift this holiday
season than new software. The children's software market has
exploded this year, with more exciting and innovative programs than
ever before. Kids can raise their own virtual dragon, play a
scavenger hunt game with the cast of Blue's Clues and even learn
about physics as they build their own pinball machines.
 &HT;    There's a new crop of gizmos and gadgets, too, that extend
computer technology beyond the PC. Lego Mindstorms, for instance,
lets your children construct and program real, moving robots out of
Legos. This is a great time to be a kid!
 &HT;    Here's the scoop on the hottest children's software of the year,
along with some shopping and installation tips.
 TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS  
 &HT;    Reader Rabbit's Toddler 2.0
 &HT;    A perfect introduction to the computer, this program offers nine
playful activities that even the youngest techies can master. The
program's thoughtful design insures success _ any movement of the
mouse or press of a key causes something exciting to happen on the
screen. Runs on: Win/Mac. The Learning Company, 800-716-8506, ages
1 1/2-3, $29.95.
 &HT;    JumpStart Preschool '99
 &HT;    One of our all-time favorite programs has been completely
revised and now offers 20 play areas that teach 30 early learning
skills. From counting to colors and shapes to sequencing, the
activities both teach and entertain. Runs on: Win/Mac. Knowledge
Adventure, 800-542-4240, ages 2-4, $30.
 &HT;    Tonka Workshop CD-ROM Playset
 &HT;    One of those new-fangled gadgets mentioned above, this is a
plastic tool bench that easily straps onto the keyboard of your PC.
Once the accompanying software is installed, children can
manipulate the tools to build all kinds of onscreen projects. Kids
loved sawing and hammering to make houses, robots and more. Runs
on: Windows. Hasbro Interactive, 800-683-5847, ages 3 and up,
$39.95.
 &HT;    Blue's Birthday Adventure

bash. Kids help out by exploring and playing games. Runs on
Win/Mac. Humongous Entertainment, 800-499-8386, ages 3-6, $29.99.
 &HT;    Dr. Seuss Kindergarten
 &HT;    There's a new zoo in Seussville. Of course, you won't see the
usual zoo fare. Instead you'll find exotic creatures like
Barbaloots and Birthday Pets, just to name a few. Children help
find the zoo's animals by playing eight reading and math games. In
addition to providing skills practice, this CD offers a rich
Seussian language experience, complete with original songs. Runs on
Win/Mac. Broderbund Software, 800-521-6263, ages 4-6, $19.95.
 ELEMENTARY-AGE CHILDREN  
 &HT;    Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening
 &HT;    We first met Pajama Sam in a CD-ROM adventure in which he
valiantly overcame his fear of darkness. Now he's conquering his
nervousness about stormy weather. Children help out by exploring
the World Wide Weather headquarters, finding helpful items and
solving problems by using their logic and memory skills. A favorite
of our child-testers. Runs on: Win/Mac. Humongous Entertainment,
800-499-8386, ages 3-8, $39.95.
 &HT;    Quest for Camelot
 &HT;    Although there are a total of seven engaging activities in this
movie-based program, the best is a great ``dragon-rearing'' game in
which kids must raise a cute little dragon from birth through
adolescence. They must feed the critter, entertain him, teach him
to walk and keep him from developing bad habits. Kids just loved
it. Runs on: Win/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, 800-542-4240, ages 5-10,
$20.
 &HT;    Backyard Soccer
 &HT;    Ideal for young soccer players, this simulation stars 30
adorable neighborhood kids, each of whom has a different
personality and athletic ability. Your child first picks the team
members, and then uses the mouse to control the action. The
play-by-play is called by two kid commentators and stats are kept.
Runs on: Win/Mac. Humongous Entertainment, 800-499-8386, ages 5-10,
$19.99.
 &HT;    Make a Masterpiece
 &HT;    If you're looking for a program that children will return to
time and time again, invest in a high-quality draw and paint
program like this one. Using dozens of art tools and hundreds of
stamps, kids can create to their hearts' content. Wild special
effects let them paint with foaming shaving cream, or turn their
artwork into impressionist style masterpieces. Runs on Win/Mac. IBM
Corp., 800-426-7235, ages 5-12, $19.95.
 &HT;    Barbie Riding Club
 &HT;    Girls who love horses are sure to enjoy this fun set of

realistic-looking horse to care for _ they name him, groom him and
feed him snacks. Then they ``ride'' their horse on missions in 3D
landscapes. Runs on: Windows. Mattel, 800-628-8359, $34.99.
 &HT;    My First Amazing History Explorer
 &HT;    Time travel awaits a youngster when he or she plays this

solve a mystery, exploring amazing places and eras like Ancient
Egypt, The Industrial Age and the Roman Empire. Runs on: Win/Mac.
DK Multimedia, 888-342-5357, ages 6-10, $29.95.
 &HT;     'TWEENS AND TEENS  
 &HT;    The Way Things Work: Pinball Science
 &HT;    A perfect balance of learning and fun, this program teaches
children physics concepts as they construct their own pinball
machines. Using an inventor's journal, they research and answer
questions about energy and motion, and then earn components like
levers, rockets and ramps for their pinball games. The completed
pinball simulations are very realistic and create a powerful
incentive to keep working. Runs on: Windows. DK Multimedia, 888-342
5357, ages 9-14, $29.95.
 &HT;    Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Deluxe Edition

robotic parts. Next, they test their invention in 3D maze missions.
Runs on: Win/Mac. Lucas Learning, 888-532-4263, ages 10 and up,

 SIDEBAR: SHOPPING AND INSTALLATION HINTS  
 &HT;    + Avoid impulse buys. Don't be fooled by fancy packaging. Do
your homework first by reading reviews and talking to friends.
 &HT;    + Check system requirements. Make sure you are buying something
your computer can handle. Minimum system requirements are always
listed on the boxes.
 &HT;    + Try before you buy. Many companies will let you play limited
versions of their programs on their websites or will send you a
demo CD. Call the company's 800 number for details.
 &HT;    + Install the software prior to the gift-giving. If at all
possible, install the software on your computer beforehand, make
sure it runs then rewrap the gift. Potential Christmas morning
disaster averted!

 &HT;    
 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As almost everyone knows, a century ago in Manhattan 8-year-old
Virginia O'Hanlon wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Sun
to ask if there really was a Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Had that youngster lived 50 years earlier in certain parts of
the United States, she might well have asked if there was even a
Christmas.
 &HT;    Until the middle of the 1800s, throughout much of America
Christmas was much like any other day of the just-begun winter.
Most families then were farm folk, and the darkening days before
the winter solstice were simply times to rest up, fix up and save
up for the hard work of the coming agricultural season. Perhaps the
butchering of a hog enlivened the cold-weather chores, or a
quilting bee quickened the social scene.
 &HT;    This widespread indifference to the holiday can be explained by
the fact that most of our ancestors had no knowledge of the
traditions that were beginning to arrive here from Europe, and many
harbored strong religious objections to an event that sprang from
ancient pagan festivities.
 &HT;    In truth, beginning with the Puritans in early New England, and
continuing two centuries through the Great Awakening, many
sobersided naysayers deeply disliked the celebrations that came
from the Old World. ``Blasphemy'' and ``mockery,'' such persons
grumped. One prominent Protestant preacher of that era stoutly
announced, ``To me Christmas is a foreign day, and I shall die
so.''
 &HT;    Most rural people thus spent Christmas ignoring the celebrating,
with doors and minds shut to the pockets of seasonal merrymaking.
Indeed, by 1850 America had so little regard for Christmas that
only a few of our 31 states had declared it a legal holiday.
 &HT;    In the latter half of the 19th century, however, religious
opposition declined. Christmas then became a more secular season,
as Old World customs evolved into an American Yuletide culture.
 &HT;    For instance, from England came the exchange of greeting cards,
a tradition traced back to one Henry Cole. In 1843 he impulsively
dashed off picture cards in place of his long-overdue seasonal
letters that were required by strict British etiquette.
 &HT;    In 1851 the card-exchange idea arrived in this country, when
Richard H. Pease decorated his business cards with holiday
messages. More than 20 years later Louis Prang commercialized the
idea with the release of a line of Christmas cards, spawning a
profitable business for Hallmark and a harrowing job for the postal
system.
 &HT;    The Germans contributed the Christmas tree, though people who
migrated to areas devoid of evergreens had to settle for other
native species.
 &HT;    In 1848 the tree-as-centerpiece notion was given a boost in
America when Godey's Lady's Book published an engraving of Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert admiring the tree they had decorated for
their royal young. However, the tree then was just a tabletop
ornament. Only later did it evolve into its floor-to-ceiling
splendor.
 &HT;    In 1850 Charles Dickens, already famous for his ``Christmas
Carol,'' described an upper-class evergreen: ``It was brilliantly
lighted by a multitude of little tapers, everywhere sparkling with
bright objects, rosy-cheeked dolls, domestic furniture wonderfully
made of tin, jolly broad-faced men, fiddles, drums, paint boxes,
guns, banners, humming tops, and imitation fruit made dazzling with
gold leaf.''
 &HT;    That was all well and good for the wealthy set, of course. But
since the mass manufacture and marketing of toys was only in its
infancy in America, ordinary children lucky enough to observe
Christmas at all likely got homemade ``playpretties'' _ products of
a mother's sewing basket or a father's workbench.
 &HT;    Our modern image of Santa similarly came from overseas _
Holland, Scandinavia, Germany and France. But the picture that
eventually became fixed in our minds _ a jolly bewhiskered,
red-garbed fellow with more than an ample waistline _ was largely
the gift of Clement C. Moore, whose 1822 poem ``A Visit From St.
Nicholas'' not only defined the man himself but also set forever
the belief that Santa flies through the air on a reindeer-drawn
sleigh.
 &HT;    Today, of course, Christmas is big business, with its sales
pitch beginning weeks earlier. Children snuggle fitfully in their
bed with fond hopes that Ninja and Nintendo will not-so-magically
appear in their stockings come morning.
 &HT;    When Francis Church, editorial writer for the New York Sun,
replied to Virginia O'Hanlon in 1897, he little realized quite how
commercialized Santa and Christmas were to become. But he did
assure his young correspondent that Santa was and is more a matter
of heart and hope than of things in hand.
 &HT;    ``He lives in terms of love and generosity and devotion,''
Church wrote. ``No one can imagine all the wonders that are quite
unseen.''

U.S. SUPREME COURT TRASHES PRIVACY IN ONE'S HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, this piece, written by Levendosky, appeared as an unsigned 
editorial in the Casper Star-Tribune.) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   On
Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court once again chopped a hunk out of
what remains of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against
unreasonable searches and seizures. A 6-3 majority ruled that a
short-term visitor to a home or apartment doesn't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy _ meaning, of course, that neither does the
homeowner or renter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A police officer was told by an informant that two men were
measuring out drugs in a garden apartment. The officer managed to
get a peek in the window through a gap in the blinds, saw what he
believed to be two men bagging cocaine, left and came back with a
warrant to search the premises.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Minnesota Supreme Court which had the case
first, the officer climbed over bushes, crouched down by the
window, and peered into the apartment through a small gap in the
blinds. The state supreme court determined that the officer's
actions violated the Fourth Amendment and threw out the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court disagreed. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the majority. Because the two men
engaged in measuring out cocaine were not overnight guests of the
woman who leased the apartment, they cannot have an expectation of
privacy, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While we understand the government's concern about illegal
drugs, this logic slices the law pretty thin. Transparently thin.
This is clearly jurisprudence aimed at a conclusion. The high court
was not going to let these men free, no matter how the Fourth
Amendment's protections had to be twisted.
</P>
<P>
   If the renter had invited a lover over for an afternoon delight,
would there be no reasonable expectation of privacy? Does that mean
that unless the renter asked the lover to stay overnight, the
renter would not be secure from unreasonable searches? What if you
invite your friends into your home in order to plan a political
campaign to beat an incumbent city councilman, could the police
peek in your windows to spy on what the group was planning?
</P>
<P>
   In trashing a visitor's rightful expectation of privacy from the
outside world, the court trashed the homeowner's right too. This
decision creates bad law, law that puts all of us in jeopardy.

IN WEST BELFAST, DISARMAMENT IS NOT KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Here on the streets of West Belfast, where all the
trouble started 30 years ago, the people who urged the Irish
Republican Army and their loyalist counterparts to stop fighting
are noticeably less enthusiastic about asking them to turn in their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way the IRA should decommission as long as the
Brits don't,'' said Brian Kennedy, a 24-year-old Catholic voicing a
common refrain in the nationalist Turf Lodge neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of West Belfast, Protestants on the loyalist
Shankill Road are equally adamant that the paramilitary groups
which spring from their community should keep their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decommissioned, the British government would walk away
and the republicans would slaughter us,'' said one heavily tattooed
man who acknowledged being an ex-loyalist prisoner but nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of paramilitary weapons has become such an obstacle in
the peace process that it threatens the progress made by April's
political settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which was
overwhelmingly endorsed by voters on both sides of the border in
May.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, British Prime Minister Tony Blair made his
second trip in as many weeks to Belfast, seeking compromise on the
weapons impasse with Catholic nationalists who aspire to unity with
Ireland and Protestant unionists who want to remain British,
underscoring how seriously the British and Irish governments take
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, who has also
engaged in shuttle diplomacy in Belfast, may be rewarded for their
perseverance with an agreement on cross-border authorities and the
composition of the cabinet for the new power-sharing local
government.
</P>
<P>
   But unionists seem as determined as ever to bar Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political representatives, from sitting in that cabinet until
the IRA begins turning in its arsenal. And the IRA appears equally
determined to hold on to its weapons. Loyalists, meanwhile, say
they will keep their guns even if the IRA decommissions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ordinary people, who supply the republican and
loyalist groups with recruits and, more crucially, the logistical
and moral support, who convinced them to end their violence and
give politics a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of interviews in Catholic and Protestant sections
of West Belfast suggest that it is the ordinary people who seem
unconvinced of the need for mutual disarmament. They also find it
absurd to suggest that the peace process will collapse unless the
paramilitary groups disarm. They echo Blair, who last week when he
became the first British prime minister to address the Irish
parliament said, ``We have come too far to go back now.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the middle class demands disarmament for relative
safety, the poor of both sides who have borne the brunt of
suffering these past 30 years oppose it out of fear for their
safety. Nationalists mention Brian Service, a Catholic who was shot
dead at random in North Belfast by a loyalist gang last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have been me,'' said one man, who believes the IRA
should keep its guns to deter widespread loyalist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many loyalists say they trust neither the republicans nor the
British government. While they insist that they are committed to
the peace process, they still consider their guns to be the
ultimate guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Police suggest that the paramilitaries are wary of giving up
their weapons because without them they could no longer control
their neighborhoods or their money-making racketeering activities.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary people scoff at such talk, saying the
paramilitaries can beat you with a bat or smash your legs with
cement blocks just as easily, and more cheaply, than shooting you.
And many regular folk seem to accept the claims from both sides
that they are committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you leave the guns alone, they won't be taken out,'' said
Agnes Moore, wheeling her young daughter through Andersonstown, an
IRA stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream, middle-class Protestant unionists disagree. They say
they cannot accept the word of the IRA, which has brutally killed
members of its community for three decades. David Trimble, the
Northern Ireland Assembly's first ministerand the leader of the
Ulster Unionist Party, says Sinn Fein cannot participate in the
government until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams stressed
there is nothing in the agreement that links Sinn Fein's
participation in government with IRA disarmament. Most objective
observers agree with him. Under the agreement, Irish republican and
British loyalist paramilitary groups are to begin turning in their
weapons within two years. Adams suggested the IRA, in particular,
and republicans, in general, are growing disillusioned because
``the unionists are trying to rewrite the agreement, to create
preconditions that aren't in the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time that the IRA concluded it had been given an
arbitrary precondition, it broke its cease-fire in 1996, setting
the peace process back two years. The IRA had called a cease-fire
in 1994 after the British government said Sinn Fein could join
negotiations after a truce. But then the British demanded the IRA
begin disarming as a precondition to talks. The IRA responded with
a bomb that devastated the Docklands section of London.
</P>
<P>
   As with anything in Ireland, history weighs heavily in this
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   To the IRA, weapons are sacred. Thirty years ago, Catholic
neighborhoods were overrun by Protestant loyalist mobs, unhindered
by the police. At that time, the IRA was largely a spent force and
had few guns. Locals began derisively suggesting that IRA stood for
``I Ran Away.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed response by police and the British army against
nationalists, however, breathed life back into the IRA, which vowed
never to be caught unarmed again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the IRA and its supporters complain they are being
singled out and expected to compromise unlike any other similar
group. Over the past century, none of the IRA's incarnations has
been forced to turn in weapons before entering the political
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the IRA should not give up its arms until the
British army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern
Ireland police force that is 93 percent Protestant, disarm.
Unionists counter that it is preposterous to compare the legitimate
forces of the state to an illegal insurgency group.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRA and its supporters do not accept Northern Ireland as
a legitimate state, saying it was created by fiat against the
express wishes of the Irish people in a 1918 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a kitchen in West Belfast, a leading IRA figure shook
his head when asked if he saw a day when his organization would
turn in its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said. ``That's surrender.''

BRUINS GOALIE DAFOE ASSUMES PLACE WITH HOCKEY ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ Byron Dafoe's numbers keep falling, which is
the kind of thing that sends Wall Street into a dither, but daily
dropping averages play just right on FleetStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was once a No. 2 goalie, but now he's clearly the No. 1
man in the Bruins' net. And these days, he has an ever-diminishing
goals-against average, a stingy 1.76, ranking him ahead of such
star NHL backstops as Dominik Hasek and Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel last year was my breakthrough season,'' said Dafoe
after Thursday's workout here in preparation for Saturday's visit
to the FleetCenter in Boston by the Penguins. ``My goal was to get
in the top 20, and I was happy to establish that. This year my goal
is to be in with the elite goalies of the game _ to have my name
mentioned with them _ and I think that's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a game now with Joseph or Hasek in the other net,
I feel I'm on a par with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers certainly support that case. Dafoe's 1.76 is only
0.01 higher than Phoenix's Nikolai Khabibulin. The only better
backstop is Jim Waite, Khabibulin's backup, who has fashioned a
1.15 in only six games _ less than one-third of Dafoe's workload.
Dafoe ranks second overall in save percentage with a .938 and is
tied with the Islanders' Tommy Salo for the league lead with four
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers speak for themselves,'' said Dafoe when asked to
provide his definition of an elite goalie. ``You've got to be among
the best in wins, goals-against average, shutouts, and save
percentage. But to stay in that group, it's also what kind of wins
you have _ in other words, you've got to establish yourself as a
winning goalie in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins haven't had a netminder finish with the league's best
goals-against average since Pete Peeters turned in a 2.36 in
1982-83, when he won the Vezina Trophy. They haven't had as sure a
hand in net since discharging Andy Moog in the spring of '93 and
bringing in Jon Casey and the Amazing Technicolor Five-Hole. For a
season-plus, Dafoe has been the answer to what had been the club's
No. 1 problem for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in this year as the No. 1, that gave me a lot of
confidence right off the bat,'' said Dafoe, who has yielded the net
only five times this year to Rob Tallas (owner of a not-so-shabby
1.85 GAA). ``I take a lot of pride in that goals-against average
and like seeing it under 2.00. Trying to keep it under 2.00 really
helps me, too. Say it's late and we've got a game won _ well, I'll
bear down more than maybe I have to because a late goal that
doesn't mean anything to the game will mean something to your
average. It can take only one bad game to send it up over 2.00.
Then it seems like you need three or four great games to get it
back under 2.00.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe undoubtedly will be back in net against the Penguins, who
are led by Jaromir Jagr and the recently acquired Alexei Kovalev,
the former Ranger swapped to Steeltown in the Petr Nedved exchange.
</P>
<P>
   What's brought Dafoe's game to such rarefied heights that he now
can be mentioned with the likes of Hasek and Joseph? The added game
experience is part of it, he says, along with mental preparation.
Working with Fred Neff, the team psychologist, he's become a
practitioner of mental visualization, taking time before each game
to imagine himself in net, facing shot after shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt my skill level has changed much in years,'' said
Dafoe. ``But my mental game, I'd say, has grown in leaps and
bounds. Working with Fred's been very helpful. I got to a point a
couple of years ago, I'd be so nervous before . . . I was just a
basket case. If I played great, then after the game, I was OK. But
if we lost, look out. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The blending of relaxation and visualization has helped Dafoe
craft his mental game. Between periods, he keeps up the cerebral
gymnastics, imagining shooters racing down the slot, firing off the
wing. He sees them shoot. He sees himself turning each puck away
with blocker, glove, and stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do next is get into yoga,'' said Dafoe, who
took a couple of yoga classes this past summer in California. ``You
know, it's a big thing in LA, and I found it pretty interesting. I
just dabbled in it a little, but you know, it could help. Who
knows, I might be here in the room doing my yoga exercises between
periods.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went through their customary workout without coach
Pat Burns, who took the day off in hopes of sleeping off a nagging
case of the flu. Assistants Jacques Laperriere and Bobby Francis
directed the workout. ``We wanted to get in some scrimmage time,''
said Francis. ``We haven't had a heavy load of games, so it was
important to get in some of that time.'' . . . Jason Allison
(charley horse) and Dmitri Khristich (pulled neck muscle)
participated in the full workout and will be in uniform Saturday
night.

COWHER HANDING IT TO BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Bill Cowher has told the Pittsburgh media that he
is ``not sure how broken is (Drew Bledsoe's) broken finger,'' but
the Steelers coach was high in his praise of the New England
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching that Monday night game a few weeks ago
(against Miami),'' said Cowher. ``It almost looked like he wasn't
sure he could throw the ball. Yet the throw he made on the
(winning) touchdown was pretty accurate and a pretty good football
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   What the last two weeks have shown, Cowher went on, is that
Bledsoe ``is a tough guy. He's proven that through the years. His
degree of toughness, the hits that he's taken, the way he's been
able to come back from it, I have tremendous respect for the guy, I
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe ``had his growing pains early,'' said the coach, but he
``has become a leader for that football team.'' The two last-minute
drives against the Dolphins and Bills were ``very impressive. He's
always been a top football player in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flip flop
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers, of course, were involved in an even hotter
officiating controversy than the Patriots in their last game, and
the coin flip for overtime possession in the Thanksgiving game at
Detroit is still a fiery topic here. NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue was in Pittsburgh Tuesday night for a United Way event,
and it so happened that the Steelers' Jerome ``Heads-Tails'' Bettis
was also there. Tagliabue and Bettis staged a mock coin flip for
the TV cameras. Cowher, though, is still holding (and biting) his
tongue in the wake of the official ruling that mistakenly awarded
the ball to the Lions, who promptly marched for the winning field
goal. ``I better not say anything,'' said Cowher. The coach said he
is in favor of adopting the NCAA's format in overtime, letting both
teams have at least one possession . . . Fullback Tim Lester
(ankle) is very doubtful for Sunday's game against the Patriots,
while running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (hamstring) is
questionable. But wide receiver Courtney Hawkins (knee) promises he
will play. Jon Witman likely will start for Lester at fullback . .
. Wide receiver Charles Johnson downplayed the Patriots' pass
coverage problems: ``All that stuff is just statistics. They still
have three-fourths of the secondary that went to the Super Bowl,
don't they?'' . . . Safety Darren Perry is of the same mind as
virtually all defensive backs in the NFL after the pass
interference call against the Bills on New England's Hail Mary pass
last Sunday. ``I don't think you're going to see the officials call
that one again,'' said Perry . . . The Steelers are 12-4 against
the Patriots and have won seven of the last eight meetings, even
though many of the games have been close.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cable and sneakers and day-care providers; flex
time and soft drinks and cohabitation; movies and Web sites and
cell phones that ring, these are a few of our favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not already obvious, the federal government
confirmed it Dec. 4 with the delivery of its massive, annual
Statistical Abstract of the United States, the official national
snapshot, circa 1998, of who we are, what we like, how we live and
work, and where we spend money.
</P>
<P>
   The tome, compiled by the Census Bureau from dozens of sources
using the latest statistics available, features all of the old
standards (``Death Rates, by leading causes'') as well as about 100
new charts of turn-of-the-century territory, from the number of
telecommuters to one with the provocative title ``Number of Male
Sex Partners in Lifetime, by Selected Characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of America that emerges is of a population that by
and large is living well (it cannot get big enough homes or
vehicles) _ if not living a bit beyond its means (1.2 million
personal bankruptcies filed last year). It is enjoying every fruit
of the technological revolution, from answering machines (58
million own them) to ATM cards (11 billion transactions in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   According to the abstract, Americans say they are observing
traditional and community values by attending religious services
(60 percent say they belong to organized religions) and
volunteering, which 49 percent of adults profess to do every week.
</P>
<P>
   The data also tend to confirm some of the most important trends
of the decade. In 1997, 63.6 percent of married women with children
under age 6 worked full time or part time, compared with 18.6
percent in 1960. Some 60 percent of the nation's children under 6
get out-of-home child care, with nearly one-third of them in
day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-quarter of all American workers, men and women
alike, now take advantage of some flexible working arrangements,
according to 1997 data. Another big trend is the growth of
home-based businesses. In 1997 more than 4.1 million people were
self-employed at home, more than half of them men. In 1991, 19.9
million Americans were able to do job-related work at home,
primarily by telecommuting. In 1997 the number was 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest occupations are computer specialists and computer
engineers. The data book projects both fields will grow by more
than 100 percent by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Internet is by far the biggest national craze. More
than 62 million Americans now have access to the Internet at home
or at work, and 43 million say they have used it in the last 30
days. Some 35 million Americans own personal computers, and the
percentage of schools with Internet access is at 78 percent,
projected to grow to 95 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gadgets are big. According to the abstract, the number of
cellular phone subscribers has jumped to 55 million today from 5
million in 1990. Some 63 million Americans pay for cable TV, and 79
million have VCRs. People in this country spent $10.5 billion on
computer software in 1996 and $9.9 billion on compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love their leisure. In 1997, 66 percent of adults
attended movies, 41 percent watched a sporting event, and 57
percent went to an amusement park. Travel and tennis and bowling
are up; boating and playing golf were off slightly in 1996, but
going to professional baseball games and watching college women's
basketball are attracting bigger crowds than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Facts little known about Americans, outside of the federal
abstract, are that:
</P>
<P>
   --Herb gardening is more popular than lawn care.
</P>
<P>
   --10 percent of all adults sing in groups, 5 percent go to the
opera, and 1 percent play classical music.
</P>
<P>
   --31 percent of all households own a dog, 27 percent have a cat,
and 4.6 percent have pet birds.
</P>
<P>
   --Americans made 734 million visits to doctors in 1996, an
average of 2.8 visits per person.
</P>
<P>
   Health, appearance, and personal care are near obsessions with
many Americans, the data show. Last year they spent $65 billion on
prescription drugs, $57 billion on personal care products, and $262
billion on clothes and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the same year only 14 percent of people said they engaged
in regular and vigorous physical exercise, and 50 percent said they
drank alcohol regularly. Americans spent $50 billion on tobacco
products, and consumed, per capita, 51 gallons of soft drinks. In
1994, 34 percent of all men and 36 percent of women were rated
overweight, according to the data, and another 25 percent of the
men and 44 percent of the women believed they were overweight, even
when they were not.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also somewhat accident-prone. In 1995
emergency-room treatment was required for 87,000 injuries related
to hand and power saws; 66,000 trampoline accidents; and 978,000
mishaps on stairs, according to the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's concern with sexually transmitted diseases and the
focus on fertility treatments this year opened another area of data
analysis by the Census Bureau, which decides what goes into the
abstract, said Lars Johanson, the bureau statistician in charge of
the data book.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the abstract includes data on the number of
unmarried women who have had intercourse in the last 12 months
(12.7 million, or 60 percent of all unmarried women.) Among that
group, 31 percent reported that a partner used a condom every time
during intercourse, while 32 percent said condoms were never used.
</P>
<P>
   Among all women 15 to 44 years old, 41.1 percent have cohabited
with a man outside of marriage, and 7 percent said they were
currently cohabitating, the data show. As for male sexual partners,
23.5 percent of women in that age bracket said they had had one;
12.3 percent said they had had two; 8.1 percent said five partners;
and 15.5 percent said 10 or more partners.

BAFFERT HITS JACKPOT _ AND ISN'T FINISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was all Bob Baffert all weekend as Churchill Downs concluded
its lucrative meeting over Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who has guided his stable to purse earnings of more
than $14 million this year to easily lead the national trainer
standings, took the $444,800 Clark Handicap with Silver Charm
Friday, then won the $216,600 Goldenrod Stakes with Silverbulletday
and the $227,000 Brown &AMP; Williamson Stakes with Exploit Saturday.
The Baffert outfit is so powerful that all three horses were
odds-on favorites, with Silver Charm at 3-10 ($2.60 to win),
Silverbulletday at 1-10 ($2.20), and Exploit at 2-5 ($2.80).
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm had to work hard to win by a head under 124 pounds,
but he got the job done by coming back with Gary Stevens to haul in
38-1 shot Littlebitlively, who had passed Silver Charm in the
stretch with Calvin Borel but couldn't hold on under 111 pounds.
Wild Rush, who had dead-heated with Silver Charm in the Kentucky
Cup at Turfway in September and was off at 3-1 under 117 pounds and
Pat Day, was third after battling Silver Charm early. The time for
the 1 1/8 miles was 1:49.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert almost accomplished the impossible by stealing the Horse
of the Year Award from Skip Away with Silver Charm. The top Eclipse
Award was all but conceded to Skip Away after he won his first
seven races of the year. But had Awesome Again not passed Silver
Charm coming to the wire in the $5.12 million Breeders' Cup
Classic, in which Skip Away ran poorly, Silver Charm would have won
the award.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert knows he came close. After all, Silver Charm did earn
far more money than Skip Away this year, $4,696,506 to $2,740,000,
and had a similar record, 9-6-2-0 to 9-7-0-1. However, Silver Charm
did not run between winning the $4 million Dubai World Cup March 28
and losing to Awesome Again in the Stephen Foster at Churchill June
13, and he did not do quite enough as Skip Away took every race he
entered from February through September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things,'' said Bafffert. ``He's going to
kill (owner) Bob Lewis with a heart attack with those close
finishes. We'll take him back to California after this. We may race
in the Big Cap (the Santa Anita Handicap March 6) or maybe the Donn
Handicap (at Gulfstream Jan. 30), but I just can't think that far
ahead. I'd like to get Horse of the Year with him, but because of
the Eastern media, you have to win in New York for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing is that Lewis, who loves the game, is bringing
Silver Charm back to race as a 5-year-old. The gray colt has a
career record of 19-11-7-0 and has won $6,613,006. Skip Away, who
has been retired, earned $9,616,360, just missing Cigar's all-time
record of $9,999,815. Assuming good health, it could well be that
Silver Charm becomes the first thoroughbred to earn $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is a nose short of having won three straight Kentucky
Derbies (Cavonnier lost by a nostril to Grindstone in '96, then
Silver Charm and Real Quiet won), but he may go on to be a nose
short of winning four in a row if 2-year-old filly Silverbulletday
and 2-year-old colt Expolit are as good as they look.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, a daughter of Silver Deputy, out of a Tom Rolfe
mare, is scary. She won the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies in impressive fashion and took the Goldenrod by 10 lengths.
She has won six of seven starts, and the only time she lost, her
stablemate, Excellent Meeting, who ran second in the Breeders' Cup,
won the race. Silverbulletday is owned by Mike Pegram, who also
owns Real Quiet, and already Baffert is deflecting questions about
putting her in the Kentucky Derby, which has been won by a filly
only three times in 124 runnings (Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in
'80, and Winning Colors in '88). The Goldenrod and the Brown &AMP;
Williamson are both run at 1 1/16th miles. Silverbulletday ran the
distance in 1:43 4/5 under triple wraps, while Exploit was in a
drive under Chris McCarrron to win by less than 2 lengths in 1:44.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is just a professional,'' said Stevens. ``She set a stakes
record and I just asked her to run the final eighth. She's further
advanced than the best fillies I've been on in my career. She'll be
something to deal with in next year's Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert knows Silverbulletday clinched an Eclispe Award with her
Breeders' Cup victory; the Goldenrod was just icing on the cake.
``Mike and I never really worried about the Eclipse,'' said
Baffert. ``I told Mike only some drastic bad luck would keep her
from winning. It doesn't matter now. We are definitely looking at
the Kentucky Oaks (run the day before the Derby). The only way I
would look at the Derby is for her to be doing great and the colts
to be sucking wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploit may well keep Baffert from putting Sillverbulletday in
the Run for the Roses. Owned by Lewis, the son of Storm Cat, out of
a My Dad George mare, opened eyes when he won the $100,000 Iriquois
Stakes on the Breeders' Cup undercard and he is 4 for 4 after going
wire to wire in the Brown &AMP; Williamson. Answer Lively, who won the
$1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile, will probably get the Eclipse
Award, but Exploit will receive some votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of colt who gawks if he is by himself,'' said
McCarron. ``He was a bit green running down the backstretch and
drifted out a little. After he straightened out and turned for
home, he was fine. He has all the ingredients of a colt with the
Triple Crown in his sights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay at Santa Anita and run him there,'' said
Baffert. ``He is not the kind of horse you want to haul around a
lot. He's like a keg of dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A losing `Quest'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Real Quiet will win an Eclipse Award as the top
3-year-old colt, giving Baffert and Pegram two statues. That was
pretty much settled Saturday when Coronado's Quest, who had won the
Haskell and Travers and set the pace in the Breeders' Cup Classic
before fading, finished fourth in the $300,000 Cigar Mile at
Aqueduct. Coronado's Quest, who was ridden by Kent Desormeaux, was
the 4-5 choice in the last start of his career, but he had a wide
trip and tired late as 8-1 shot ($19 to win) Sir Bear caught the
speed under Jerry Bailey in the time of 1:34. Trainer Shug
McGaughey still hopes that Coronado's Quest can win the Eclipse
Award, but the chances are remote as Real Quiet fell only a nose
short of capturing the Triple Crown when beaten by Victory Gallop
in the Belmont Stakes. ``The speed wasn't holding, so he laid back
a little,'' said McGaughey. ``He went wide so as to not run head to
head with another horse. The turn took something out of him. I
still think he's a prime contender for the 3-year-old
championship.''. . . In another race featuring combatants from the
Breeders' Cup, Military turned the tables on Hawksley Hill and took
Saturday's $300,000 Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park. Military
had run 12th in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile, while Hawksley
Hill had been narrowly beaten by Da Hoss. However, Military was
better at the 1 1/8-mile distance of the Citation, winning by 2 1/2
lengths at 9-1 ($20.60) under G.K. Gomez, while Hawksley Hill
finished seventh at 9-10 with Alex Solis. The turf course was wet,
which didn't help Hawksley Hill.

CLEMENS RETURNING TO SOX? IN THEIR DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Imagine what Mo Vaughn would say, upon hearing that
Roger Clemens is demanding a trade, if he were still a member of
the Red Sox. He'd be practically guaranteeing a pennant if general
manager Dan Duquette could somehow find a way to bring the Rocket
back into the Red Sox' orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn lives in Disneyland now, and anyone who thinks that
the Sox have a shot at Clemens is inhabiting Fantasyland, judging
by the initial reports of what the Blue Jays want from the teams
clamoring for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   From Houston, All-Star second baseman Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   From Texas, All-Star catcher Pudge Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   From Cleveland, 95-mile-an-hour pitcher Bartolo Colon.
</P>
<P>
   From the Yankees, maybe Cuban pitcher Orlando Hernandez or Andy
Pettitte or Ramiro Mendoza, plus a fistful of top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   True, Toronto probably will have to settle for less, but where
would the Red Sox even begin to fashion a proposal to Blue Jays GM
Gord Ash? They don't have the marquee talent, on either the big
league or minor league level, to compete with the major bidders for
Clemens's services.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Clemens has demanded a trade to a contender. As they
are presently constituted, is there anyone this side of Duquette
who envisions the Mo-less Sox as a better team than the one Clemens
is demanding to leave? And can anyone imagine Clemens approving a
return to the Red Sox without Vaughn?
</P>
<P>
   Ash has been quoted as saying he'd like to move Clemens in 7-10
days. A likelier scenario is that the Jays will push to do a deal
when baseball's winter meetings begin next Friday in Nashville and
have something wrapped up no later than Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox inquired about Clemens before the trading deadline
in July, and they almost certainly have conveyed their interest to
Ash this go-round, too. No harm in imagining a top three with eight
Cy Young Awards among them: Clemens (5), Bret Saberhagen (2), and
Pedro Martinez (1). But a far likelier scenario is that Clemens
will wind up with the Yankees, who could spare a starting pitcher
as well as kids like Homer Bush and Mike Lowell in return.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has expressed a desire to work closer to his home in
Texas, and both the Rangers, who could have had him in July for
Rusty Greer, and the Astros, who just lost Randy Johnson, can be
expected to make big plays for him.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, in a conference call Thursday with
reporters, stated the obvious Sox position regarding Clemens. ``You
guys know what I think about pitching,'' Williams said. ``He
certainly hasn't slowed down. He's way up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine there are a lot of teams that would like to have
him. He certainly knows how to get to Fenway.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Red Sox news Thursday was that third base coach Wendell
Kim has not lost his job after all, even though departed Pawtucket
manager Ken Macha said he was offered the position before taking a
coaching job with the Oakland A's. Williams's staff returns intact,
with one recycled addition: With Dick Pole leaving to become Angels
pitching coach, John Cumberland will become bullpen coach.
Cumberland was the Sox' pitching coach for much of 1995 and was the
PawSox' pitching coach the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Kim had come under fire for two controversial decisions, one
that took place in March, the other in October. During an
exhibition in Bradenton, Fla., Kim waved home pitcher Butch Henry,
who subsequently stopped short, pulled his left hamstring, and
weeks later tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
In the division playoffs, Kim waved home John Valentin, who was
easily cut down at the plate by Indians left fielder David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news on the Will Clark front Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a day-in, day-out competitor,'' Williams said of the free
agent first baseman who is being considered as Vaughn's
replacement. ``He played a lot of years and still has skills.''

LETTERS FROM IMPEACH-LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is our 222-year-old system of government really so fragile that
it can come unhinged by one president's priapic propensity? I don't
think so. But many do. I've previously proposed my Iodine Theory of
Impeachment, to wit: The further you live from saltwater, the more
likely you are to favor having President Clinton impeached, if not
castrated.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence? Election results, poll numbers, and the bile level
on talk radio in the Bible Belt and the Rugged West. The further
south or west, it seems, the more likely you are to dislike
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Folks south or out that-away seem genuinely convinced that
Clinton's fall from grace will have a terrible impact on the
country _ a belief I do not share, because this nation does not
fall if the president pantaloons are caught down around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Since remarks in this space are typically too sulfurous to bear
repeating in papers below the Mason-Dixon Line, I can't give you
much of a mail sample from Down Below, as we Northerners think of
the Old Confederacy. But I have a swatch from Out There, the Far
West, courtesy of some papers that give this bird-cage-liner an
occasional airing. A sample:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The UnGodly Liberal Left spent another 12 hours viciously
attacking DON QUIXOTE de la Starr. Anything other than impeachment
and conviction is a joke. We all know it. You, Sir, are one of the
UGLL _ sounds like ``ruggle'': The UnGodly Liberal Left. When we
need a Moses to lead us through this tragic desert, we get a
literate blind man who tinkers with words . . . Happy Thanksgiving.
Cordially, Max Huber, North Hills, CA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Max: May I gurgle, on behalf of the UGLL: Thanks and Merry
Christmas?
</P>

   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   ``You lost me as soon as I read (of Starr): ``. . . his doughy
countenance, his unappealing voice.'' Assuming you have movie star
looks, Greek-God physique and a melifluous voice, your personal
attacks stopped only when you ran out of adjectives . . . You have
a pervasive penchant for the alliterative `P'. Since when is
`pedantically professorial demeanor' a bad thing? Your style is too
bombastic . . . sophomoric. _ Rosa Arunas, Camarilo, CA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Rosa: You have me cold: the looks, physique, voice, and
bombast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   ``Your stupid comments on the Republican Party in today's Tucson
Star are beyond belief. You Democrats are all alike, retarted (sic)
&AMP; no good like old Slick Willie. If that (----) Clinton don't get
off his skirt chasing, we will lose our Social Security. Of course
all of you men are quilty of what Clinton has done, he has degraded
our country beyond repair . . . by the way, I am a descendent of
Gen. Robert E. Lee, also of Pokohones (sic). Do me a favor along
with thousands of other folks here in Arizona, don't write any
more. Non respectfully, Lorraine Tompkins, Sierra Vista, AZ.'' &QL;

   ``A gloomy un-American spirit has descended over the most
pro-American city in the US: Boston, Mass. Your Boston Globe
columnist, David Nyhan, would make a good reporter for arousing
feelings of unrest in Cuba or Iran. His bashing of Newt Gingrich in
the Fresno Bee was totally un-American and un-called for. There is
no political administration that could equal the dishonesty and
chaos of the Clinton regime!'' _Jim Moore, Fresno, CA.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Jim: I have no doubt that what I do for a living would cost
me my head in Iran or my freedom in Cuba. One more reason why this
is a great country.

</P>
<P>
   ``Earth to Mr. Nyhan: The White House is not a whore house
either. Wake up. All Americans can lie to grand juries, commit
perjury, lie to the American people, break the law. If the media
condone it for Pres. Clinton, they condone it for all Americans. If
President Clinton does not have to obey the law, then no American
does either. _ Mary Myers, Santa Ana, CA.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mary: So he lied about the monkey business. He got in big
trouble for that. There's not a 10-year-old in the land who doesn't
now know that even the most powerful people get in terrible hot
water for lying over trivial but embarrassing things. I cannot
believe the country has to come apart over this tawdry Lewinsky
matter. And it won't.

<P>
   It's all just political ``Fizzics'' to Charles Skelley Jr. of
Bellflower, CA. ``Since the Divine Right of Kings seems on the
upswing, perhaps someone could get the voters a candidate they can
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Charles: People will begin voting on just that question in
13 months. I was pleased to see your card bore an old three-cent
postage stamp of a pensive Abe Lincoln and his prayer ``that
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.'' It won't.

   Not all my correspondents out west were beefing. My farewell to
Newt ran in the Tri-City Herald, prompting John J. Wick Jr. of
Kennewick, Wash., to take word-processor in hand. ``Thank you for
making my day. I particularly liked the bit about Newt being shoved
out the fuselage without a parachute.''

   Dear John: We aim to please. Even from 30,000 feet.

ACADEMIC'S CLOUD HAS SILBER LINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine at Boston University posed the question: Who is
the most disgraced individual in American academe? I had no idea.
Harvard Business School's Robert Merton, whose whiz-bang trading
theories helped sink Long-Term Capital Management? Harold Bloom?
(Wait a minute, I like Harold Bloom.) Then he reminded me _ Dr.
Peter Diamandopoulos, the recently cashiered president of Adelphi
University on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Not a household name in these parts, Dr. D assumed the helm at
Adelphi in 1985 with a mission to revitalize the school. Alas, the
former Brandeis dean made a hash of the job. The New York State
Board of Regents removed 18 of Adelphi's trustees last year, ruling
that they had neglected to properly review Diamond Pete's
performance and compensation. The regents then installed a new
board, which fired Diamandopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   Always at issue was the D-man's ``lavish lifestyle,'' as The New
York Times called it. Adelphi bought him a $1.3 million Manhattan
apartment, and his half-million-dollar salary rivaled only that of
. . . John Silber at BU. (It is surely no accident, as the Marxists
liked to say, that Silber, one of the 18 displaced Adelphi
trustees, sat on Diamandopoulos's compensation committee.)
</P>
<P>
   So where is Dr. D now? BU, of course! A spokesman for the
university confirms that ``Dr. Diamandopoulos has indeed accepted a
position with us, as special assistant to the president (Jon
Westling). Westling has known him for nearly 20 years, and respects
him as a brilliant teacher as well as a thoughtful observer of
history and current trends in higher education. He will be working
on special projects in the president's office in the areas of
development, international education, and educational policy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The toast
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One should always expect the unexpected at SilberWorld, but even
jaded BU profs were taken aback two weeks ago when Chilean native
Claudio Veliz, who organizes the pompous ``Conversazione''
seminars, proposed a rather unorthodox toast.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a colloquium on democracy, of all things, Veliz
announced to the assembled notables that ``we have good news from
England'' _ a British court had rejected an extradition request
that would have sent former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
abroad to face trial for human rights abuses. Veliz then proposed a
toast to Pinochet. The assembled dignitaries, including Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Breyer, sat in stunned, stony silence.
</P>
<P>
   Veliz is a bit cheesed that participants in the off-the-record
seminar blabbed about his toast, and allows that, yes, the liberal
professorate was nonplused by his action. Like millions of his
countrymen, he's pro-Pinochet and proud of it. ``I'm made of
stainless steel when it comes to this kind of stuff,'' he told me.
``Pinochet is not Mother Teresa with trousers on,'' Veliz
explained, an apparent allusion to the thousands of left-wing
Chileans who were ``disappeared'' under the former dictator. ``But
the idea that this man is a monster is ridiculous. He restored
democracy to Chile and he should be toasted frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leftovers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want to sit out the tiresome Y2K ``crisis,'' when your bank
account mysteriously craters and your credit dries up? A friend
calls my attention to the Y2K Sanctuary (www.y2krefuge.com), a
haven in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. A Mr. C. R.
Brown is leasing out 20 recreational vehicle sites, far from the
maddening cyber-crisis. ``The cost of the lease is $5,000 paid up
front. For this sum you will have one fine vacation spot until June
2001, or a sanctum until the Y2K chaos is over, whatever date that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another friend (yes, there are two) passes along the ne plus
ultra of Christmas catalogs from a company called U.S. Cavalry
(1-800-333-5102.). Much of the merchandise is your run-of-the-mill,
gutting-and-garroting paraphernalia, but U.S. Cav does have a few
original twists, like the ladies' SEAL dive watches. Better not
order the $15 Subversion Slingshot, though. As you probably know,
slingshots cannot be sold to individuals in Malta, Australia, and .
. . the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

`SHATTERED' NEVER REALLY COMES TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chilean-born, French-based filmmaker Raul Ruiz has been moving
from long, impenetrable surrealist meditations to films that are
shorter and more playful, yet just as filled with fairy-tale
delicacy and reality shifts. But ``Shattered Image,'' Ruiz's first
collision with Hollywood, isn't among these frothy latter-day
entertainments. It's understandable that Ruiz should have been
hired to direct this two-track film about a woman who is either a
hired killer living in Seattle or a honeymooner in Jamaica. Few
directors have liberated themselves more completely from linear
narrative pushing off a defining event.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the woman's got William Baldwin's enigmatic smiler
hanging around. He's clearly a schemer in each of the parallel
lives. But Anne Parillaud's character doesn't know which of the
dual worlds between which she shuttles is the real thing and which
is the unreal one. Understandably, she looks exhausted in both
locales, and sleeps a lot. We vote for the hit woman alternative,
if only because it gives Parillaud a chance to reprise her ``Femme
Nikita'' thing by sauntering into a restaurant and shooting a male
quarry dead in the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   As the honeymooner, she's too much the helpless victim to be
appealing, too much at the mercy of Baldwin's snaky manipulator. He
scarcely bothers to conceal his interest in a blond acquaintance as
he positions Parillaud's dread-filled bride for something bad that
only she fails to see, although she is overwhelmed by a feeling
that a brooding painting hanging on the wall of her suite is an
ominous portent. The painting is too obviously a stand-in for the
film, which is filled with teasing tendrils of imagery that hint at
revelations to come. Not that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Parillaud is in such great shape as the assassin,
either, possibly because she's stuck with the worst-looking raggedy
black wig in movies this year. After a while, it's hard to care
which plot strand is real, or whether they can be made to converge
in a dramatic payoff. Ruiz's surrealistic playfulness deserts him,
possibly having been frightened off by Duane Poole's hackneyed
script, which harks back to antique Hollywood gothica. The attempt
to trade on Parillaud's ``Femme Nikita'' mode wears thin. The
unstable honeymooner's unraveling under the influence of her sleazy
spouse is old hat, too. ``Shattered Image'' doesn't so much fall
apart as fail to ever come together.

GOLDEN SMOG: THE ROCKER'S ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though it is a part-time project, a sideline gig for those
involved, many fans consider Golden Smog to be the standard-bearer
of the so-called ``no depression,'' or alt-country, movement.
Golden Smog comprises a lot of folks from a whole lot of other
bands. It has singer-songwriters Dan Murphy from Soul Asylum, Jeff
Tweedy from Wilco, Gary Louris and Marc Perlman from the Jayhawks,
and Kraig Johnson from Run Westy Run. Its new drummer _ the Smog
runs through drummers like Spinal Tap did _ is Jody Stephens of Big
Star. But you may not want to call Golden Smog an Al Kooper-esque
supergroup. Better, suggests Murphy on the phone from Minneapolis,
to call it a ``stuporgroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy explains his preferred term. ``With our group,'' he says,
``the only real standard is you gotta be a music fan. And we all
dig each other's bands, grew up listening to each other. We don't
have high aspirations. Look at our careers: None (of our main
bands) have been all that super. We just want to play music with
our friends and not embarrass ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The zephyrs of what became Golden Smog started swirling around
the late-'80s. It began as a bit of a joke. The band covered songs
by bands from the Rolling Stones to Three Dog Night. Murphy took
the name from the Flintstones _ the Mel ``Velvet Fog'' Torme of
Bedrock was called the Golden Smog.
</P>
<P>
   This Golden Smog was, and remains, a side project for the
various people involved. When they made a semiformal debut in 1995
with a five-days-in-the-making recording session-cum-frat party
disc called ``Down By the Old Mainstream,'' the musicians used fake
names, created a fake bio, and took blowhard credit for nonexistent
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's expectations were so low,'' says Murphy, about the
subsequent tour. ``They thought they'd come and see a goofy band
like They Might Be Giants.'' They got, he says, a pretty raucous
band playing covers (Bowie, Velvet Underground) and originals. ``It
went smashingly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Smog has a lot of sad songs in its repertoire because
_ as Elton John once sang, sad songs say so much _ the musicians
tend to rip it up in concert. ``There's quite a lot of
introspective stuff,'' Murphy says of the compositions, especially
those on the latest disc, ``Weird Tales.'' The album ``wasn't as
much fun to make, but it's a better album and therefore worth it.
The songs are more serious, darker. Sometimes (artists) are
clearest when they're going through (hard) things, asking those
questions. On this album, there's a more collective identity.''
Graybeard rock fans might hear echoes of Buffalo Springfield and
the Byrds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Golden Smog work, suggests Murphy,
is the relative lack of pressure. The members talked to some major
labeIs, but if they were signed to a bigger label than the
Salem-based Rykodisc, Murphy says, ``I don't think we could live up
to (sales) expectations. . . . The mentality of the Smog is this:
Songs that are fairly simple, in a good way. Not tuneless, but easy
to pick up and play. What you do is try and capture the spark of
what you were thinking when you wrote the song.''

   Ben Carr, tell us about your job: ``I think there's very few
like it,'' says the (mostly) nonsinging/nonmusician member of the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones. ``It started when I went to high school
with Nate (Adderley) and Joe (Gittelman) and they were putting
together a band, and I didn't play anything. I was just there
hanging out. As they started developing the Bosstones with Dicky
(Barrett) and Tim (Burton), I still didn't play anything. I was the
eighth man, the roadie. I was never onstage during the early days,
but I was the best-dressed roadie in Boston. In the mid-'80s, at
one show, Dicky said to me, `You know all the lyrics, why don't you
come up and help me sing the song?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Such began Carr's career as the Mighty Mighty Bosstones dancer
and (very) minimal backup singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It developed,'' Carr continues, of his career arc, ``so that I
didn't leave the stage. . . . It's not us _ a band _ vs. an
audience. We're (about) audience participation. I kinda show that.
I could be any of them and they could be me.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the Throwdown, Carr says, ``I've run into fans that say,
`Are you gonna do it?' and I say, `Of course, we're doing it.'
There's a special reason we're doing it: No matter how big the band
ever gets we'll still be here at the Middle East. It's the central
point of music in Boston. (Owners) Joseph and Nabile (Sater) go out
of their way to make people feel at home.''

   The Rhode Island-based Combustible Edison was at the forefront
of the neo-lounge movement in the early '90s. It intends to range
beyond the form as the nebulous post-lounge future beckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I come from a jazz background,'' says vibraphonist Mike
Connors, ``and was never into the rock scene too much. I approach
this in more of a jazz way.''
</P>
<P>
   The suave Edison formed from the ashes of the Boston-based
punk-psychedelic band Christmas by guitarist-singer Michael Cudahy
and drummer (now singer/percussionist) Liz Cox. Cudahy calls
himself ``the Millionaire,'' Cox calls herself ``Miss Lily
Banquette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to play music when I was 18 and did a lot of growing
up onstage,'' says Cox. ``With the Combustible Edison original, it
was like I was playing a character, but lo and behold, I am much
less of a rock chick than ever, and that's more comfortable for me
now. I've started studying music after all these years of just
going up there. It's the challenge of learning more about what I do
and putting it to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Combustible Edison's music has been featured in about 10 movies,
the latest being Terry Gilliam's ``Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas.'' As to the band's soft-core exotica and lovers' rock vibe,
Cox coos, ``There's nothing to be mad about anymore. Even Alanis
has figured it out: Get naked and love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see we're all getting older,'' adds Connors, ``except
for Liz _ she looks beautiful all the time. But I was thinking it's
cool we're playing this and I don't feel like `Oh my God, I'm doing
the job of an 18-year-old.' '' It has sophistication and life
experience behind it.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Once again, Xu Jin is watching as her father is taken
from her.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, she was eight years old, standing in her
nightgown as Chinese soldiers dragged him off in the middle of the
night. What's wrong, she asked him. He smiled, trying to comfort
her. Nothing's wrong, he said, go back to sleep. The next day, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 years, she lived without him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Xu, 26, watched on the news as her father, Xu Wenli,
one of China's leading dissidents, was dragged to prison in Beijing
this week. Xu is in Boston, where she is a graduate student at
Boston University, studying fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's crime: Creating a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised,'' Xu said in an interview Thursday, her
eyes brimming with tears. ``He kept a bag filled with things like
his toothbrush behind the door. He expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Carr, chairman of the advisory board for Harvard's Human
Rights Initiative, compares Xu Wenli to Nelson Mandela. Xu Jin said
Mandela is a friend of her father's, and said the two men agree
with the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she spent much of her childhood without her father's
direct presence, Xu said his letters to her, and his example,
taught her about standing up for your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his footsteps, she wrote a letter to the Chinese
government this week, condemning them for her father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has ideas about democracy and freedom but he has no
soldiers and no secret police,'' she wrote. ``He cannot hurt you.
Let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu can't go home to be with her mother, He Xintong, because she
fears she will not be allowed to leave China again. Xintong can't
come to Boston to be with her daughter because she fears she won't
be allowed to return to China. Xu is an only child, and her mother
is very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Xu attends school in Boston because she is forbidden from
attending universities in China. ``It's not a written law,'' she
said. ``But it's understood that because of who my father is, I'm
not to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Xu recalled a very happy early
childhood. She remembered marching with her father in protests, and
dancing and entertaining adults who had gathered at her family's
house to hand-write and hand-publish a pro-democracy magazine
called April 5th Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always lots of people in the house,'' Xu said,
smiling with the memory. ``It was quite wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's father was born and raised in Southern China, one of five
children. His father died when he was nine years old. Raised
alternately by his mother, an older sister, and his grandmother, Xu
Wenli became very interested in politics and history while he was
in high school, according to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Xu Wenli made the decision
not to attend college, which broke his mother's heart. But he
believed ``he would learn more by studying the government and
talking to people,'' his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He served five years in the Chinese army, and then took a job as
an electrician at a factory in Beijing, where he met He Xintong, an
accountant, fell in love, and married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Xu Wenli became involved with a fledgling democracy
movement, his daughter said. He began producing the magazine in his
house, and his daughter remembers how happy he seemed when he would
go with his wife and daughter to the central wall in Beijing to
sell the magazine on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Xu Wenli's friend Wei Ginsheng put
up a poster asking for democracy. He was arrested. Xu Wenli
organized a group of people to sneak a tape recorder into the
trial, and then published a transcript of the trial to show it was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's father was charged with stealing state secrets, and
taken away. It was a full year before Xu Jin or her mother even
knew if he was alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother took me to every prison, everywhere she could think
of where he might be, asking for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want
her to know how scared I was, so when I started to feel afraid, I'd
say I was going to go outside to look at the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first arrest, Xu Jin said, her elementary school
teacher harassed her, humiliated her in class and made sure ``I
didn't laugh so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's middle and high school teachers were more
understanding, she said. Nonetheless, she grew up very alone. Her
mother worked three jobs. After school, Xu came home to an empty
house. She had no close friends, because she could not let anyone
know about the truth of her father's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them he was on a business trip,'' she said. ``It
seemed safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu and her mother were allowed to visit her father in prison
every two months, for 40 minutes, with the exception of three years
in which he was allowed no visitors. It was the only human contact
he had for 12 years, as his captors were not allowed to speak to
him. For much of his sentence he was kept in a room ``not much
wider or longer than a coffin''.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Xu saw her father after his arrest, she said he
was huddled on the floor of a large room where 20 or so prison
officials sat at a large table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to talk about politics, or the trial,'' she
said. ``And my mother wasn't allowed to touch him. When I was
little I could sit on his lap, but after a while that stopped
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Xu Wenli was released to house arrest after the United
States government demanded his release in exchange for economic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   When her father emerged from the prison, he was a changed man,
physically. ``His hair was white, his teeth were rotted out,'' said
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit, however, remained intact. ``He just started talking
and wouldn't stop,'' his daughter said. ``I had cooked a whole
table of his favorite foods, but he wouldn't stop talking to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu had only a few months with her father after his release from
prison before she was to head to the United States, to attend Bard
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he's against college,'' she said. ``But he understood.
He wants me to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu hopes to finish school, take a job in graphic design
somewhere in the United States, and continue to support her mother.
But her father's activism has also worn off on her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Chinese government, Xu said that computers
confiscated from her father's house were bought with money she
earned ``by washing dishes and waiting tables. Why are you afraid
of me and my father?''

PLAYOFF THE ONLY REMEDY FOR BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the bottom line on the Bowl Championship Series bashing
that is growing each day. True, it's not the best system in the
world. But it is better than what was in place a year ago, because
it allows teams from every conference to be included in the mix
without regard to bowl tie-ins and it has created tremendous
interest in the sport for the past month.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem cannot be solved by any system short of a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. Three unbeaten teams _ Kansas State, UCLA,
Tennessee. Two slots for the national title game, the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a human panel or a computer printout sheet that can
solve the problem. Three won't go into two.
</P>
<P>
   So even if there were no BCS or computerized numbers and
quartile rankings and strength-of-schedule factors that have many
people upset, the fact is that when you have three unbeaten teams
(and we're not even counting Tulane, which was not invited to the
BCS party) and only room for two of them, someone is going to be
left out.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if Kansas State beats Texas A&AMP;M, UCLA beats Miami,
and Tennessee beats Mississippi State in Saturday's showdown games?
The computers and the pollsters will decide.
</P>
<P>
   If this were basketball, where the tournament selection
committee considers every facet of each team's season, the call
would undoubtedly come down to a number of tie-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it would be UCLA and Tennessee hands down,'' said
one source familiar with the workings of the NCAA basketball
selection committee. ``It would come down to strength of schedule,
who teams played in nonconference games. Kansas State didn't (play
tough nonconference foes). The others did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tough late-season schedule against Nebraska, Missouri,
and Texas A&AMP;M, Kansas State cannot escape the perception that it
has ducked people by scheduling lowly regarded teams such as
Northern Illinois, Indiana State, and Northeast Louisiana;
meanwhile, UCLA was playing more high-profile teams such as Texas,
Houston, and Miami, and Tennessee was facing Syracuse and Houston
(as well as Alabama-Birmingham, which could hurt the Volunteers in
the end).
</P>
<P>
   What it all comes down to, it seems, is that unless someone
loses, somebody will be unhappy Sunday, and that would have
happened with or without a BCS.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No snow jobs
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the spate of openings at big-time programs around the
country _ Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Iowa, Oklahoma _ there
could have been a feeding frenzy over the job openings. But this
time the athletic directors proved they had done their homework.
The ADs simply went to the short list of candidates they keep in
their desks and made quick and, it would seem at first blush,
reasonable hires. Clemson made a good move in hiring Tulane's Tommy
Bowden. Oklahoma hired the rising star among assistants, Florida
State defensive coordinator Bobby Stoops, and Auburn went across
state lines and hired Mississippi's Tommy Tuberville . . . The most
intriguing moves could be at Nevada-Las Vegas, which has hired
former Southern Cal and Los Angeles Rams coach John Robinson, and
South Carolina, where former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz may resume
his coaching career. Holtz's decision is reportedly contingent on
the condition of his wife, Beth, who has been battling throat
cancer for two years. If Holtz decides to take the offer, which is
reportedly in the $1 million annual range, he must decide whether
to bring in his son Skip as offensive coordinator. Skip, who has
done a marvelous job in taking Connecticut to new heights at the
Division 1-AA level (the Huskies play Georgia Southern in the
national quarterfinals Saturday), could have a tough decision.
Should he stay at UConn and continue to build his reputation as the
program moves toward the 1-A level, then take the first decent 1-A
head post that comes along? Or should he go to South Carolina,
where he could be in line to succeed his father in a few years? . .
. The hiring of Tommy Bowden was refreshing in that everyone had
something nice to say, even Bowden's players at Tulane, who could
have expressed resentment at being abandoned by the coach who
recruited them. ``If the Clemson team does what he asks, they'll
get better in a hurry,'' said quarterback Shawn King . . . The
other interesting aspect of Clemson's hiring of Bowden is that it
sets up an annual family feud in the Atlantic Coast Conference
between the Tigers and Florida State, where Tommy's father, Bobby,
is a fixture. ``We're thrilled to have Tommy in our conference,''
said Bobby . . . Far removed from all the hoopla surrounding the
unbeaten teams in 1-A, the most powerful dynasty in college
football rolls on. Division 3 Mount Union has won 40 consecutive
games, the last two national championships, and three of the last
five. It's within two wins of another.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some three-for-alls
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having three undefeated teams from different major conferences
at the end of a season is rare but not unprecedented. The last time
it happened was in 1993, when Auburn, which was on probation and
could not participate in a bowl, Nebraska, and West Virginia were
all unbeaten. West Virginia lost to Florida in the Sugar Bowl and
Nebraska lost to Florida State in the Orange Bowl, so the
once-beaten Seminoles won the national title. It also happened in
1992, when unbeaten Miami and Alabama met in the Sugar Bowl, which
turned out to be the national championship game, while unbeaten
Texas A&AMP;M lost to Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl . . . The biggest
UCLA rooters in Florida could be the Central Florida Golden
Knights. Here's why: If UCLA beats Miami and earns a Fiesta Bowl
bid, Central Florida will play Air Force in the Oahu Bowl at
Honolulu. If UCLA does not make the Fiesta Bowl, UCF stays home
because UCLA would then go to the Rose Bowl, Arizona would drop
down to the Holiday Bowl, and Oregon would be bumped from the
Holiday to the Oahu . . . Arkansas fans had been all set to head to
Dallas for a Cotton Bowl meeting against onetime Southwest
Conference rival Texas. But Florida's apparent inclusion in the BCS
mix (the Orange Bowl against Syracuse) opened a slot in the Citrus
Bowl, which wanted a matchup between Ohio State and Arkansas . . .
As it looks now, Mississippi State will go to the Cotton if the
Bulldogs lose the Southeastern Conference title game against
Tennessee Saturday night . . . Ohio State is upset because it is
ranked fifth in the country with a 10-1 record and probably won't
go to a BCS game, while twice-beaten Florida and three-time loser
Syracuse will. Why? Contracts and fan support. Syracuse, as the Big
East champion, has a guaranteed BCS slot and Thursday accepted an
invitation to be the Orange Bowl host team. Florida figures to
bring more fans to the Orange Bowl than OSU, which disappointed
some bowl officials with its poor fan turnout at last year's Sugar
Bowl. The same thing happened to 10-1 North Carolina and unbeaten
Brigham Young last season. Those are the breaks of the game. When
it comes to bowls other than the national championship game, it's
not how many games you win or lose but how many television sets you
can turn on and how many fans you can bring with you.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They've been at the head of Eastern college hockey in
this decade, the envy of many programs, coaches, and players. Just
look at the record compiled by Boston University under feisty coach
Jack Parker: NCAA tournament berths every year, an amazing seven
appearances in the NCAA Final Four, a national championship in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the seniors who departed last spring became the
first class to win four consecutive Beanpots, and the Terriers have
won seven of nine in the '90s. They've won or shared the Hockey
East regular-season championship each of the past five years,
captured five tournament titles, and appeared in the tournament
final six times.
</P>
<P>
   Only Michigan (286-75-24) had more wins than the Terriers
(253-83-24) since the 1989-90 season. Thirteen BU alumni have
played in the National Hockey League this year, and Chris Drury won
the Hobey Baker Award as the best player in the college game last
year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this season is such a startling aberration. The
Terriers are off to their worst start in Parker's 26 seasons as
head coach _ 3-8-1 overall, 1-4-1 in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience, injuries, and disappointing production from some
veterans are at the root of the struggles, but the season is young
and there have been some bright spots: a 4-2 win over Boston
College, a win over St. Lawrence last Saturday night in Canton,
N.Y., and a tie at New Hampshire. Those are indications that BU can
turn it around. To an extent.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a realist, feels more effort is required from the older
players, led by captain Albie O'Connell, a forward from Watertown,
and his assistants, defenseman Dan Ronan of Woburn and goaltender
Michel Larocque of Dieppe, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this is the youngest team I've had since
the first team I coached,'' says Parker. ``That, combined with some
of the upperclassmen not playing up to their capabilities, we've
really struggled. We've had some games where we thought we've
played most of it, but that's the rub. We can't figure out how to
be more consistent in (our) play and to give a more consistent
effort. We're certainly young, but we certainly have enough talent
to win hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough concerted effort. We played well at UNH
and against BC. In between those games, we just go through the
motions, like we did against Harvard (a 4-3 loss) last Tuesday.
It's baffling to see why they won't go hard all the time. We have
so many freshmen and sophomores, I'm sure we're going to see a much
better team in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be until Feburary or March. It might not be until
next year. I think the most difficult thing to accept is the lack
of effort, the lack of intensity that has always been a BU
trademark. We're not getting the leadership that's a BU legacy.
It's probably a combination of all those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't seem to get them to play with the intensity that
teams who have worn this uniform in the past have played with, and
that has nothing to do with talent or how old you are. It has to do
with the competitive spirit. That's the toughest thing to accept.
If we're getting great effort and losing, that would be one
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronan, who has played in 130 of a possible 131 games with the
Terriers, is pragmatic about this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations were definitely higher when the season
started,'' he says. ``It wasn't that we were going to be one of the
best teams in the country, but higher than starting out 3-8-1. We
knew were going to struggle early, but we didn't think we were
going to struggle as much as we have. It's been disappointing, and
on the same token, it's been frustraing having played for teams the
last three years that have been in the Final Four two of those
years and an overtime away from a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big adjustment. We've tried to help the younger
guys adjust and understand it's like growing pains. I think a tough
thing is having only seven upperclassmen. We have 15 or 16 guys who
are only freshmen or sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem now is getting consistency out of the
younger guys, and the older guys haven't played consistently.
Michel had a tough start. I haven't played well at all, and Albie's
had injuries. We haven't had the consistency out of the older guys
as well. It's different for me. I'd be the fourth, fifth, or sixth
defenseman, and I've had to change that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cover up the mistake a forward makes, but when a young
defenseman screws up, you can't cover it up. It's been part of our
problem. We have four defensemen who had to jump into Division 1
college hockey right away. It's not like we were playing the Little
Sisters of the Poor. We had UNH and BC right away. You had to test
their colors early.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocque, who owned a 43-10-6 record entering the season and led
the Terriers to the NCAA final as a sophomore, started off 0-4 with
a .792 save percentage and a 5.60 goals-against average. In his
last seven starts, his numbers are 3-3-1, .913, and a 2.83. ``We've
been inconsistent,'' he says. ``We've made some strides forward,
but then we've gone backward a couple of steps, and that's why
we're in the mess we are right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a slow start. I think part of it was adjusting to a new
team, a new style, a younger defense. It had to do with my trusting
my `D' and getting used to them. But now I feel great and I feel
great about who I have in front of me. I think everything's looking
pretty positive.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell believes the Terriers' struggles have been the result
of a perfect balance. A perfectly awful balance. ``We were letting
up a lot of goals,'' he says. ``We were getting some good offense,
but we weren't scoring much on the power play. Our special teams
have been a problem from the start of the season. We weren't
scoring power-play goals and we gave up a couple. We shot ourselves
in the foot in the first five games or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the older guys to play well every game, and the
younger guys can feed off of us. We're trying to keep the morale of
the team up.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the record will follow suit.

PREGAME SHOWS WILL THROW A FLAG ON THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought referee bashing was over, Sunday's NFL
pregame shows will put the officials under even more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Cris Collinsworth will interview George Young, the
league's vice president for football operations, about the impact
that several embarrassing recent calls have had on ressurecting
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will have Chris Mortensen talking about the problems and
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS's Armen Keteyian will make an interesting argument: that
well-intentioned pressure from the NFL to strive for perfection has
made the refs nervous _ and, as a result, worse.
</P>
<P>
   Game officials don't have the benefit of long-term, guaranteed
contracts. In fact, Keteyian reports, the turnover among refs
during the last eight years has surpassed 50 percent. Since 1990,
when the league had 112 officials, there have been 64 personnel
changes. Some of the turnover has been because of retirement and
attrition, but some has been directly related to on-field
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's standards are high. Officials are expected to get at
least 90 percent of their calls rights. With the excpetion of
placekickers, no one else on the field is held to a higher
standard. If a quarterback completes 55 percent of his passes, he
is Hall of Fame material.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the men in stripes. After each weekend, league officials
spend as many as six hours reviewing the games, analyzing every
call and grading every game official.
</P>
<P>
   Keteyian points out that the grading process is flawed, largely
because it is based on a two-dimensional, frame-by-frame review
while the call actually was made at warp speed in three dimensions.
Given the sneakiness of, say, offensive holding, it's difficult to
see every infraction, and it would be even more painful to call
every penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that referees don't make mistakes. For his
upcoming report, Keteyian said that he interviewed Jerry Seaman,
the senior director of officiating in the NFL. According to
Keteyian, Seeman told him that the two calls against the Buffalo
Bills that helped the Patriots win on the last play of last
Sunday's game were both ``mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keteyian's point is still well taken _ and not unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers president Dan Rooney told USA Today that the
league is to blame for causing officials to be more concerned with
receiving good grades than making the right calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so gun-shy right now, if they make some little mistake
and they don't call something, they're going to be graded down, ''
Rooney said. ``You're considered a good official or a bad official
based on the grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Making officials full time employees won't help. CBS analyst
Marcus Allen said that is the most ridiclous suggestion he has ever
heard. ``I was a full-time player and I made plenty of mistakes,''
Allen said. ``As long as the referees are human, there will always
be errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a bad call shouldn't determine which team wins and
which loses. ESPN's Chris Berman said as much during halftime of
``Monday Night Football.'' As Berman said, giving the Patriots the
ball on the 1-yard line ``all but guaranteed a Patriots victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman added: ``Hey, it's the last second of the game. Call the
penalty, but don't give the team the ball at the 1. Make them still
win it. Assess a 5- or 10-yard penalty from the line of scrimmage,
and make them score.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACC-Big Ten on ESPN
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has reached a multiyear agreement with the Atlantic Coast
and Big Ten conferences to air the ACC/Big Ten Challenge, a men's
basketball event that will begin next season.
</P>
<P>
   The series will match nine teams from each conference on the
first Tuesday and Wednesday following Thanksgiving. The games, to
be played at campus sites, will air on ESPN and ESPN2. ESPN will
manage and market the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great to eliminate the Cupcake City games, and to
get two of the nation's marquee conferences together like this will
really whet the appetites of college hoop fans early in the
season,'' said ESPN's Dick Vitale. ``Take it to the bank: These
games will be Maalox Specials; they'll be nail-biters.''

PATRIOTS NOT WELL-GROUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Larry Kennan, then the offenive coordinator,
came to the same conclusion late last year that this Patriots
regime is likely reaching but isn't acknowledging publicly: The
team can't run and therefore will have to win on the strength of
Drew Bledsoe's right arm and the four healthy fingers on his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do what we have to do to win,'' said Bledsoe,
looking ahead to Sunday's game in Pittsburgh. ``And if it means
we're going to focus on the passing game, then that's what we're
going to do. There's no doubt that we have to run the ball more
effectively. That's an entire team thing that we have to work on.
It falls obviously on the guys up front. It falls on the receivers
blocking downfield. It falls on the backs hitting the holes
correctly. It falls on me to make the proper decision if I'm
checking off at the line of scrimmage. There are a lot of things
going there. And it's an entire team effort if we want to get that
thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Dave Wohlabaugh concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go with what works,'' he said. ``Lately, that's
been Drew getting the ball out to the receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll is still not willing to concede that the running
game is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go with what's working in the game, we always feel
that way, but we want to be continuing toward the goal of a
balanced attack and trying to even it out so we can't get locked in
on one aspect,'' said the coach. ``We're certainly going to lean
toward what's working, but we have to get the ball moving on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   As Game 13 approaches, the Patriots have no idea where their
running game is. For a four-game stretch between Sept. 20 and
Oct.19, rookie running back Robert Edwards had 90 or more yards.
His best output since has been 70 yards on 23 carries at
Indianapolis Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the running game has regressed and Carroll is
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no consistency,'' he said. ``We have trouble getting
the line of scrimmage moving like we want to, and Robert has fallen
prey to it. He's trying to pick his way too much and not hitting
the line of scrimmage with more power and slashing like he can. We
continue to work at it. We emphasized it today in practice and
we'll continue to try and get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the fault of Edwards, who hasn't gotten
more than 14 carries in the past four weeks. It's probably more
attributable to the offensive line, which has undergone some
revamping with Damon Denson now starting at left guard and left
tackle Zefross Moss missing the last two games with an ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Paul Boudreau thinks his troops could do
the job if there was more of a commitment to the run. His preseason
challenge _ that fingers would be pointed at his linemen if Edwards
didn't get rolling _ hasn't stirred them up.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new problem; the Patriots weren't a running team
even with Curtis Martin gaining 1,000 yards annually. That's why
Bledsoe threw more passes than any other quarterback in history his
first five years.
</P>
<P>
   Any time Bledsoe is asked about the running game, he shrugs. He
knows deep in his heart that he's not going to have one because
he's never had one.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Patriots win and not run? Traditionalists say no.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are sort of an aberration in that they are 7-5 and
would be in the the playoffs if they began today.
</P>
<P>
   They've done it with virtually no balance and despite injuries
to 15 regulars.
</P>
<P>
   They run the ball only 38.9 percent of the time, far short of
league leaders Denver (52.4 percent), Dallas (51.8), Buffalo
(50.5), and Pittsburgh (50.3).
</P>
<P>
   The only team that's worse running the ball is Carolina, which
is 2-10. The closest team to the Patriots with a winning record is
Miami, which ranks 15th in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who are averaging 78.8 rushing yards per game (the
NFL average is 112), are next to last in average yards per carry
(3.3).
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it's not surprising that the Patriots rank so low in
time of posesstion _ 26th in ther league with an average of 28
minutes 22 seconds per game. And that doesn't help a defense that
has been banged up among its front seven, putting inordinate
pressure on the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards wants to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the great running backs and they can't get going
until they have a few carries,'' he said. ``We've just been in
situations where I haven't got those carries. All running backs
want to get into a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots deny that Edwards has hit a rookie wall in terms of
wearing down. After all, he hasn't had a lot of carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started trying to make things happen,'' he said. ``They were
putting a lot more people in the box and a lot of guys we couldn't
block. I was just trying to make them miss and make a big pay.''
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that when fullback Tony Carter returned to the
lineup following knee surgery, things would change. But Carter has
been back for two games, and the Patriots have trailed in both,
forcing them to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes everything harder when you can't run the ball,'' said
Carter. ``There are certain games you can win without it, but all
of the great teams control the ball on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Patriots didn't have a 100-yard rusher in the
final seven games and went 5-2. They won a playoff game against
Miami without a 100-yard rusher and lost to the Steelers with one.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to stay in the running without a running game,
and barring something unforeseen, that's what the Patriots will
have to do.

CAN THE NBA LOCK OUT BOREDOM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, goody. They've decided to meet once again.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA owners and the NBA Players Association must realize that
they now occupy the danger zone. While commissioner David Stern has
never said aloud just what might be the ``drop-dead date,'' beyond
which it would be impossible to start the season, we must conclude
that we are creeping dangerously close to it. There is an apparent
sense of urgency now _ major, major, intense, frightening, scary
urgency _ that did not exist even a week ago. And so the warring
parties are once again negotiating in the hopes of saving the
(1998-)1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   There are absolutely no good guys here. This is a sordid tale
involving the desire of multimillionaires and billionaires to
squeeze every last dollar out of the public's interest in what can
be a very nice sport on the one hand and the desire of spoiled,
pampered, coddled, overhyped, self-absorbed, and delusionary
players to earn essentially undeserved millions on the other hand.
They can't agree on how to divide a $2 billion pie. And we are
supposed to care?
</P>
<P>
   As a writer who has covered the league for 30 years and a
20-year season ticket-holder who has seen his cost rise from $8 a
pop for a first-row balcony seat overlooking the foul line at the
Garden to $66 a whack for a fine seat several rows up looking at
the foul line in the FleetCenter, I come to this fracas with very
intense feelings. The NBA has meant a great deal to me personally
in both a professional and personal sense. Certain things involving
the Celtics have represented my happiest professional moments, and
by having the seats, I have had the enormous satisfaction of family
involvement as well. One of my dearest personal possessions is a
photo of my wife and daughter seated in Section 62, Row A, Seats 1
and 2, at the Garden for a Celtics game. Every time I look at it,
warm feelings of countless happy afternoons and evenings we all
spent in that building watching memorable NBA games spring to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean I miss the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do, sure, but not the way I would have thought had
someone told me five years ago we'd all be sitting here on Dec. 4,
1998, waiting to see the first game of the season. What I really
miss is the NBA that was, not the NBA that is. I know I am not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they solve this thing, the real job will begin. The NBA
will then be confronted with an angry constituency. The league will
be in need of a massive selling job in order to restore the game's
image to the American sporting public. It will be a much more
difficult task than any of the principals know.
</P>
<P>
   For if there is one clear message being delivered by pro
basketball's vox populi as this lockout insanity drags on, it is
that most people simply don't care. I cannot be more explicit.
Wherever I go in the country, people don't care. When someone I
work with comes back from a trip, he or she reports that people
don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Attention, David Stern and Billy Hunter: PEOPLE DON'T CARE!
</P>
<P>
   Wow.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, season ticket-holders are secretly ecstatic. They
are being forcibly prevented from paying money to see games they
didn't want to see in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What this tells me is that the public is much smarter than it
was ever given credit for by the powers that be. If a work stoppage
of this type had taken place 10 years ago, when the league was at
its artistic zenith, people would have cared. The fact that so few
care now should tell the NBA something, and that something is that
people are hip to the fact that the average game is dreadfully
boring compared to what it once was. A 79-75 game is not going to
be as interesting as a 110-105 game, and it won't even be in the
same discussion as a 125-120 game.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell the NBA people something else they don't want to
hear. All the bells, whistles, noise, and distractions that are an
inherent part of what is now officially referred to as ``game
presentation'' are counterproductive. They have done nothing to
create legitimate interest in the sport among the younger audience
to whom they are pitched, and they have totally alienated the
serious fan base which had taken the NBA to its mid- and late '80s
height.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest. Have you heard anyone say, ``Boy, do I miss the
Parquet Patrol''?
</P>
<P>
   In a better sports world, the scenario would be as follows:
Before we allow them to come back, the NBA, the NBA players, and
the NBA coaches (the silent villains in this melodrama) would be
forced to deal with us, the constituency (I'm wearing my consumer
hat now). We would demand that they stop the circus acts and turn
down the volume. We would demand the opportunity to attend the
games in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Then we would demand that coaches cease thinking they are the
show. The biggest myth in all of American sport is the idea that
the NBA is a players' league. It may be in some ways, but once that
ball is thrown up, the game belongs to the coaches, and they are
strangling the life out of it.
</P>
<P>
   We would demand basketball games with flow, basketball games
with fast breaks _ at present, not a single team in the league even
semiregularly attempts fast breaks out of defensive rebounds _ and
basketball games with just plain pizzazz. We had that once. We most
definitely do not have that now.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the players they are coaching are increasingly
incomplete products of a sickening system that starts creating
star-complex monsters as young as 13. I'm not going to deny that.
The players don't know what they should know. But there has to be a
way to put a more entertaining product on the floor. Perhaps the
wrong people are coaching in this league.
</P>
<P>
   People in NBA management think their only problem once play
resumes will be to persuade the public that the owners aren't all
greedy and the players aren't all jerks. Those are just starting
points. The biggest problem will be to persuade people that the
actual product is worth both an emotional and financial investment,
based on the basketball being played.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to Classic Sports on the telly, take this
challenge. Watch any available 1980s game featuring the Celtics,
Lakers, Sixers, and Pistons, and then ask yourself, ``Whatever
happened to that game?'' There is no comparison in entertainment
value between those games and the average NBA games, playoff or
otherwise, of the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real problem, Mr. Stern. People know the difference
between what was and what is. Your nightmare is still in the
opening credits.

UCONN A DOUBLE-BARRELED NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget this mania about Connecticut and its future as a football
state with the Patriots headed to Hartford and UConn talking about
moving up to the Division 1-A college level.
</P>
<P>
   That's years away and not a mortal lock.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about here and now. Play word association for a
minute. Connecticut. College basketball. No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. You've got it. As of Friday, the No. 1 team in men's
college basketball is UConn. The No. 1 team in women's college
basketball is . . . UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that for a minute. We're not talking about the Big
East, where the Huskies of both genders have been dominant for
years. We're talking about the country, which includes Kentucky,
Duke, UCLA, North Carolina, Tennessee, Stanford, Louisiana Tech,
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a campus in Storrs, a town so small that
former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz once joked it should
have been named Storr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's great,'' said UConn athletic director Lew Perkins,
who was in Chicago the other night watching the Huskies men take
care of business in their Great Eight tournament game by beating up
Washington. ``I'd rather have us No. 1 in March, but we'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins could also point with pride to a nationally ranked
football team that is in the Division 1-AA quarterfinals and a
nationally ranked soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   But basketball is the engine that drives UConn athletics, and
the Huskies are no longer considered a curiosity when it comes to
talking about the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' said Perkins. ``We're No. 1 and nobody is
making a big deal like it's something unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they. The Huskies pulled off the rare double play
three years ago when the men and women also reached No. 1 status in
the same week.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of staying on top for an extended period are long. As
UConn coach Jim Calhoun and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose team
started the preseason No. 1, will tell you, being No. 1 in December
is a cosmetic award at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe on March 29 and 30, it will be important,'' said
Calhoun, who hopes this team will take him to his first Final Four,
in St. Petersburg, Fla., next March. ``But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows, UConn may lose to tough Michigan State Saturday
in Storrs and its ranking will drop.
</P>
<P>
   But its stature won't. UConn is one of the big boys in college
basketball now, thanks to Calhoun's skills as a coach and
recruiter, which measure up to anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue that, and that's quite an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Challenging format
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big Ten have set up a
two-year, nine-game challenge starting next year. That would seem
to be a problem if you do the math, since the Big Ten has 11 teams
and the ACC has nine. Not to worry. A scheduling conflict has taken
Ohio State temporarily out of the rotation, and Indiana coach Bob
Knight has told Big Ten officials he won't participate in the
series, which will be played the week after Thanksgiving for the
next two seasons . . . Don't underestimate Kentucky's chances of
winning its third national championship in four seasons. The
Wildcats took apart a decent Kansas team in the Great Eight.
Despite the fact that nine of this year's Wildcats are either
freshmen or sophomores, they have great senior leadership in guard
Wayne Turner and are capable of beating anyone . . . Kansas's point
total in its 63-45 loss to Kentucky was its lowest during the Roy
Williams era . . . Forgive next season's preseason No. 1 team if it
wants to pass on any games in November. When Duke lost to
Cincinnati in the Great Alaska tournament last week, it marked the
seventh consecutive season that the polls' preseason No. 1 had not
gotten into December without a loss . . . Temple may be one of the
best teams in the country, but the Owls will have a hard time
convincing people they are the best team in Pennsylvania. In the
span of eight days, coach John Chaney's team lost to Penn and Penn
State . . . It's early, but Florida Atlantic's 83-81 upset of No.
11 Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Okla., Tuesday may rank up there
with Temple beating Virginia Tech in football. Florida Atlantic
came into the game with a 1-3 record and was playing a team that
hadn't lost a nonconference home game since 1987 (80 games) . . .
Has anyone seen University of Massachusetts center Lari Ketner?
Just wondering. The Minutemen's slow start makes next week's game
against UConn at the Mullins Center even more important if UMass is
to have any confidence going into the Atlantic 10 season . . .
Anyone noticed what the Boston College ``alumni'' have been doing
lately? Maine's Andy Bedard is on a scoring binge. Ohio State's
Scoonie Penn has been named Big Ten Player of the Week and is a big
reason coach Jim O'Brien's Buckeyes have already won six games
after totaling eight victories last season. Kentucky's Mike Bradley
is starting and contributing for the Wildcats. Providence's Sean
Connolly has been a factor in the Friars' quick start. We could go
on and on. But that would only be more depressing for BC fans who
saw a Top 20 program dismantled before their eyes because of
arrogance, stupidity, stubbornness, or any other term you choose to
describe what happened to O'Brien and his recruits two years ago .
. . Speaking of Providence, Tim Welsh has shown that coaching does
count for something. The Friars aren't that good, but they're
winning games, a tribute to Welsh . . . Maryland gave coach Gary
Williams a contract extension through the 2005 season. Hmm. Some
schools do take care of coaches who come back to work at their alma
mater . . . Xavier's win over Miami of Ohio and Rhode Island's
victory over Utah stopped a bad Atlantic 10 skid after UMass
(College of Charleston), Temple (Penn), URI (Wisconsin), and Xavier
(Pittsburgh) lost in the past week.

   The lockout has kept NBA coaches, scouts, and general managers
scrambling to keep busy. One NBA coach took a recent visit to a
college campus where the coach invited him to not only watch
practice but speak to the team. The NBA coach gave an inspirational
talk about how desire and hard work can overcome everything, which
naturally picked up the spirits of the team. But after he left the
building, the coach told a friend, ``They won't win five games.'' .
. . In Wednesday's win over Utah, URI's Lamar Odom didn't approach
the dazzling performance he put on in his collegiate debut against
Texas Christian, when he scored 19 points, pulled down 15 rebounds,
and dished out 9 assists, hitting the winning basket in the final
seconds for good measure. But the 6-foot-10-inch phenom again
proved that there aren't many better players in the country. With
15 points, 6 assists, and 6 rebounds overall, Odom took control in
the second half of URI's 70-63 win. ``I thought we guarded him,''
said Utah coach Rick Majerus, shaking his head in dismay. ``He hit
tough shots. I applaud him.''

MUTUAL FUND FIRMS WORK TO PROTECT DIRECTOR SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the time-honored system of mutual fund directors served
shareholders well, providing an important independent watchdog for
investors' money? Or is there a connection between the six-figure
salaries the directors are paid and the fees that mutual fund
shareholders are charged?
</P>
<P>
   In the arcane world of mutual fund governance and fees, those
are questions more easily asked than answered. But this much is
clear: The mutual fund industry believes the current system works
and is moving to protect it, whether in the courts or the
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Massachusetts' mutual fund companies last month
quietly secured final approval for state legislation that would
make it more difficult for unhappy shareholders and their lawyers
to challenge the independence of directors. The change, tacked on
as a two-sentence amendment to another bill, needed Governor
Cellucci's signature by Dec. 4 to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation and a similar bill passed in Maryland, like
Massachusetts the legal home of a number of mutual fund complexes,
come as a handful of companies have been targeted in shareholder
suits challenging the independence of directors and the effect the
system has had on fund fees. So far suits have been filed against
Fidelity Investments, Prudential, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, and BEA
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are considered a longshot, but they could add to the
drumbeat on fund fees. The Securities and Exchange Commission is
reviewing the role of independent directors in setting fees and
pressing for fuller disclosure requirements. SEC chairman Arthur
Levitt had this to say at an industry conference in May: ``Funds
whose directors forget for whom they represent won't be long for
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Fees are always a contentious topic, and there is not even
agreement on whether they are rising or falling. Mutual fund assets
have quadrupled to $5 trillion this decade, offering chances for
economies of scale that critics say have not materialized.
Morningstar says the average expense ratio for an equity fund has
risen to 1.53 percent, or $1.53 per $100, from 1.25 percent, or
$1.25 per $100, in 1985. On the other hand, Kanon Bloch Carre, a
Boston consulting firm, says fees for all growth funds have
declined 5 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is right, it is the fund directors who must sign off on
these fees. While most investors know next to nothing about the
people who oversee their funds, the directors play a key role in
setting policies and, most important, negotiating the management
contract between shareholders and money management firms. As with
corporate boards, fund boards include company insiders, but by law
at least 40 percent of the fund boards must be independent
directors recruited from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Directors often sit on dozens or even hundreds of individual
fund boards within one fund company, a practice that has raised
questions about how independent directors _ who can easily make
$100,000 or more a year as part-timers _ really are. The industry
believes allowing directors to sit on multiple boards increases
their expertise and holds down costs; they say that directors set
their own salaries and cannot be fired by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of suits try to make a direct link between
``fee gouging and multiple directorships.'' In the Fidelity suit,
filed in October in US District Court in Boston, a New York
shareholder charges that directors serve on more than 200 boards
and receive ``significant compensation,'' frequently in excess of
$200,000 a year. The suit paints of picture of ``assembly-line''
board meetings that ``merely rubber-stamp'' Fidelity's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says fee gouging by Fidelity has been ``especially
dramatic.'' To quantify the claim, the suit says that Fidelity's
assets under management grew to $373 billion from $36 billion from
1985 to 1995; revenue grew to $4.3 billion from $388 million. Using
those numbers, the suit figures that revenues as a percentage of
assets under management grew to 1.146 percent from 1.085 percent in
that time. That kind of increase would have yielded Fidelity an
extra $228 million in compensation in 1995 alone, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has yet to file a response to the suit, but a
spokeswoman previously said the company would defend the suit
vigorously. Fidelity declined to comment Thursday on the suit or
its fees. A recent survey by Kanon Bloch Carre found Fidelity's
expenses were the sixth-lowest among 42 fund complexes.
</P>
<P>
   While the suits are all in federal court, the fund industry
appears to be trying to strike potential threats to the director
system on the state level. Both Massachusetts and Maryland acted
after a federal judge in May 1997 unexpectedly allowed a suit to
proceed after he found that the ``substantial remuneration''
directors received by sitting on multiple boards could call their
independence into question. The suit has since been dismissed on
different grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts legislation was designed to spell out that
outside directors continue to be considered ``independent'' even if
they serve on multiple boards. To challenge that independence,
shareholders must make ``an affirmative showing'' that the
directors' independence has been impaired by more than serving on
the boards, according to an analysis provided to legislators by the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Representative John H. Rogers (D-Norwood),
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, declined to say who requested
the proposed amendment. A Fidelity spokeswoman earlier told Mutual
Fund Market News, a trade publication, that the firm supported the
bill. Fidelity declined to comment to Boston Capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the Massachusetts bill attracted no attention, the similar
Maryland legislation was opposed by both plantiffs' attorneys and
organized labor, who complained the measure reduced shareholder
protections. T. Rowe Price cited the new provision, passed as an
amendment to a largely unrelated bill on the final day of the
Legislature's session in April, in its efforts to have the federal
suit against it dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Judiciary Committee synopsis supporting
the bill ends with a line that has been trotted out, in one form or
another, every time mutual fund legislation is considered: ``This
change would ensure that Massachusetts is not prejudiced when
investment companies are searching for a state to call their `legal
home.' ''

FANTASY CAUSING BIG NIGHTMARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I dozed on the couch Monday night, watching the
wretched Giants flounder against the 49ers. My thoughts were filled
with fluttering passes and stumbling running backs, missed field
goals and blown coverages.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   As I drifted off, I thought about how all those bad teams had
turned my fantasy league into a disaster. How the Thursday night
game didn't include a single offensive player that anybody cared to
start on a fantasy team.
</P>
<P>
   Ick. Ptooey.
</P>
<P>
   And then I was dreaming. I sped down the field wide open, only
to have New York's Kent Graham throw the ball into triple coverage.
It bounced into the air, and was grabbed by Philadelphia
quarterback Koy Detmer, who broke into a premature celebration
dance before fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swann scooped it up and started to run, only to pull up
lame and hop into a passing ambulance, driven by New Orleans
quarterback Kerry ``Tom'' Collins, who was immediately stopped by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a drinking problem,'' I could hear Collins
yelling as the ball rolled to Kansas City Coach Marty
Schottenheimer, who immediately subbed out Collins for Bam Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Morris grabbed the ball and stuffed it into his car trunk,
prompting St. Louis Coach Dick Vermeil to burst into tears.
Lawrence Phillips jogged by, his World League uniform glittering in
the fading twilight.
</P>
<P>
   In the gloaming, Derrick Thomas sprinted past, a face mask in
each hand. An angry mob of Chiefs fans chased him, brandishing
steaming brats and real tomahawks.
</P>
<P>
   I landed back on the field, only to see the New England Patriots
playing a game against nobody, scoring touchdown after touchdown,
as the distracted Buffalo Bills used grass and mud to build a
monument to Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   A gaggle of officials wandered by, their white canes tapping out
a rhythm. They all carried two-headed quarters, and chanted, ``The
call was tails. The call was tails.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason grabbed the ball and sprinted away, as Dan
Dierdorf called after him, ``You played some quarterback, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer stopped, humbly scuffing the ground with his toe, ``Well,
shoot, I guess I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Chuck Bednarik blindsided him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had to hurt,'' I heard Frank Gifford say, barely audible
in his plastic booth.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Berman grabbed me by the collar. ``You had the power to go
all the way home all the time. Just tap your heels, and say,
`There's no team like Denver. There's no team like Denver.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I jarred awake. Graham was throwing the ball out of the end
zone. All was right with the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL still stinks on ice. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   A few playoff hints: Avoid quarterbacks who are playing in cold
weather. Though we in Arizona think of winter as a perpetual
70-degree day, it does get cold in other places, and that can gum
up a passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Also, stick with your dependable starters. If those players were
good enough to get you to the playoffs, stay with them. Now is not
the time for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, pay attention to overall records. Teams that
have everything clinched early may not play their starters for the
whole game. Keep that in mind. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   I'd grab Packers wide receiver Bill Schroeder really quick.
Green Bay starters Antonio Freeman (broken jaw) and Robert Brooks
(hamstring) are ailing. With Indianapolis receiver Marvin Harrison
out for the year, Torrance Small's numbers should rise. Minnesota
running back Leroy Hoard should have some good numbers while Robert
Smith heals up from his sprained knee. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's Philadelphia receiver Jeff Graham, who scored
two touchdowns against Green Bay. Graham last crossed the goal line
during the Eisenhower Administration. &QL;

TURNING SOW'S EAR INTO A SILK PURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. All my doors are flush and pretty plain. Where can I get
paneled doors?
</P>
<P>
   WALT ABRAMS, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Home Depot has a fair selection of all styles; so do most
lumber dealers, and so does Brockway-Smith of Andover, Mass., a
distributor of lots of wood items. For the latter provider, you
have to order the doors through a lumber dealer. The lumber store
will have a Brockway-Smith (Brosco) catalog that will list dozens
of styles.
</P>
<P>
   Paneled doors not only come in different styles but different
construction. The popular and least-expensive paneled door is a
formed hardboard that looks paneled. The real paneled door is a
solid frame with solid panels, and is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something you might try without buying a new door,
and it will cost very little. It's a little like making a silk
purse from a sow's ear. Buy wood or plastic molding and nail or
glue it on the face of the flush door in the shape of a panel.
Molding comes in many shapes and sizes; just make a choice. Such
``panels'' will be raised from the face of the door rather than
indented as in a regular paneled door, but they will add to the
style of the door and give the feeling of panels. You can make the
panels any shape, size, or form. You are limited only by your
imagination and the shape of the molding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think I'd better clean out my dryer duct because it is a
10-foot run from dryer to the outdoors, and it certainly can get
plugged with lint, especially since it is an accordian type duct.
But how can I get that far in to clean it?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGINA MORENEY, Florence, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I mentioned using the biggest bottle brush you can
find with a long handle, and do the cleaning from both ends of the
duct. When I mentioned ``bottle brush,'' I did not mean that you
could find a real bottle brush that big, but a round brush shaped
like a bottle brush. Such a brush might be hard to find. At any
rate, I was browsing through a new Improvements catalog, and
wouldn't you know, a new item in the catalog is a dryer vent brush.
It is 4 inches in diameter with a flexible handle 10 feet long. It
is item No. 131839, and it's $10.97; call 800-642-2112.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have had about a quarter cord of firewood in the house for
a year. I noticed there is a little dusting of the wood under the
bark, and the bark comes off easily. Do I have bugs? If so, what
can I do about them?
</P>
<P>
   DAN, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You probably don't have bugs, but I say ``probably'' because
there is always a possiblity of bugs; that is why it is recommended
that you store only enough firewood in house or basement that you
will burn in a day. Keep the rest outdoors, at least 10 feet from
the house.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see any bugs or ants, you don't have any,
generally. Termites are unlikely to survive in that situation
because they have to go to their nests in the ground twice a day,
and getting from that free-standing wood to the ground is difficult
if not impossible. If there are any bugs, it could be the old house
borer or powder post beetles (there are many kinds of each), which
leave tell-tale holes in the wood. If there any there, chances are
that burning the wood will dispose of them. The powdering and the
ease of removing bark are due to aging of the wood and its drying
out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said I could put vinyl tiles over linoleum. Can I put
vinyl tiles over ceramic tiles?
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA O'BRIEN, Scituate, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure you can, but you will regret it because the vinyl will
settle on the ceramic tiles, which will ghost through the vinyl and
show. Besides, why cover ceramic tiles: OK if it because of color,
not OK if the old ceramic is dirty, or rather the grout is dirty.
You can clean the grout and seal it with a tile sealer so the tiles
will resist future dirt. To clean the grout, bleach and a detergent
may help. There are a gazillion cleaners on the market for this
purpose, and I am not convinced that any will work. So, instead of
trying to clean the grout, scrape off the top layer, revealing new
grout. Then seal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace or cover the fascia board under my roof
edge after some of the fascia decayed a bird got into the attic.
The bird has been released. One man said to cover the decaying
fascia with aluminum; another said to replace all fascia boards.
Who is right or, at least, which way is the best way to go?
</P>
<P>
   A.C., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The best way to go is to take down the decayed fascia; in
fact, take down the entire fascia and replace it with new, intact
wood. Even if some of the fascia has not decayed yet, it will. Kept
painted or stained and kept from staying wet, it can last
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Covering it with aluminum or any other material is covering up
the problem (the decaying fascia), and since it decayed because of
water, covering it will trap more moisture and make it all worse.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, ventilate the soffits (the under part of the
roof overhang). This will not ony ventilate the attic but will let
the fascia dry off more quickly if it gets wet.

1999 ACURA TL3.2: SMART CAR WITH A STUPID NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology brings us wondrous things, not all of which are worth
the effort it takes to deal with them. For example, let us consider
the automobile navigation system, at once a wonder, a distraction,
a frustration, a convenience, and a hazard. The most sophisticated
among them rely on satellites aloft and computer hardware with a
prodigious bank of computer memory on the ground to pinpoint your
car's location on the planet within a couple of feet and guide you
unerringly to your destination. Yeah, right!
</P>
<P>
   Some systems are tied in to cellular telephone networks, can
detect trouble such as a crash or hijack and summon aid. Some are
just navigation tools. Today's case study is the Acura Navigation
System, this time installed on Acura's newest, the 1999 TL 2.5, a
very smart car with a very stupid name.
</P>
<P>
   It is Thanksgiving morn and I am heading north to a dinner
appointment. Way north. I know the main route, the alternate
routes, the shortest of shortcuts as well as I know the way to my
refrigerator. So, what better test for a guidance system than to
match its electronic expertise against hard knowledge (and besides,
I carry a bulging map case that would make AAA envious). The
weather is . . . dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the ignition and the VCR in center dash wakes up,
displays Mother Earth aglow amid the twinkling firmament. Select
the menu and commence the exercise; punch in the destination a
letter at a time by touching the appropriate members of the
alphabet displayed on the screen. The computer Imp refuses to
recognize anything but York, Maine, which is not where I want to
go.
</P>
<P>
   I drive a bit, park, resume negotiation. Nada. I'll try later; I
do not have time to waste and I've already spent more time than it
would take to copy a Delorme map by hand. I select ``map'' and let
the illumined array track my progress _ my way.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a handsome four-door equipped to the nines _ the
navigation system is the only option offered. The car derives half
of its idiotic moniker from the 3.2-liter, 24-valve VTEC engine
under the hood, a quiet 225-horsepower mill that has one drawback;
if you try running on an interstate without using cruise control,
you are asking for a ticket _ the TL's a creeper, as in creep up
the speedometer dial. The 4-speed automatic transmission with its
fuzzy logic is already adapting to my driving style and the
handling is quick, precise. I like this car.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray, Maine, I have gained a little time in the light
traffic, stop to program a route _ success! The Imp admits to
knowing the whereabouts of Kingfield and the little animated arrow
points me north on Interstate 95. In Auburn, I pull onto Route 4 _
OK so far _ and then left onto East Hardscrabble heading for Hotel
Road. This is not exactly wilderness; it runs along the edge of an
airfield. But, I am off the ``digitized road,'' thank you _ as far
as the Imp is concerned, I am in Terra Incognita. Shades of Henry
the Navigator!
</P>
<P>
   The things this instrument knows _ in view of what I'm learning
it doesn't know _ are surprising. It recognizes Crash Road, not
where I really want to drive in the rain and it's raining. The
windows suddenly begin fogging up and I need to jack up the air
conditioning to clear them _ which means hitting the AC button next
to the screen, thus turning off the Navigator Imp and bringing up
the work order for the Comfort Elf. One must tap the appropriate
boxes on the illuminated screen to effect ``climate changes''
within and I might as well be trying to change the weather without.
Visibility clouds to urgency and I pull over while madly rubbing
the windshield with a sleeve. After a while, the climate control
begins to cooperate. I prefer knobs to this high-tech tactile
switching nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   At New Vineyard I notice a change in weather character _ snow is
falling and there is an accumulation of something viscous
underfoot, demanding a reduction in speed. But the Imp does guide
me into Kingfield. End of Test I.
</P>
<P>
   Test II is finding Rochester, N.H. You may recall that on a
previous encounter, it didn't seem to be listed. Today, it exists,
if you have time and patience enough to wade through all the
options offered before the Imp will recognize it. But the
Navigation Imp and I disagree mightily on how to travel there and
the Imp finally gets annoyed with the number of recalculations
asked and quits in a huff. Just as well; no matter how low I adjust
the screen illumination, it's still an annoying distraction glowing
at me.
</P>
<P>
   Test III is finding a route from the Globe to the Museum of
Transportation, a veritable urban maze that challenges the stoutest
of tourists. The Imp is on top of the game; he points me south to
Gallivan Boulevard, along Morton, the Arborway, directly to target
_ except the Imp miscounts the exits at a traffic circle. The
reverse is a flop. On exiting the museum, I am directed to go to
the ``designated route,'' which is undecipherable on the maze
presented _ you can zoom these little things into big things but
I'm in traffic now. And although I'm retracing the route in, I am
now ``off the route.''
</P>
<P>
   I reprogram for Rochester, N.H., and, am directed to make a
``slight left turn'' where there is no turn, then another ``slight
left turn,'' which is a Y intersection, and then I'm off the route.
Recalculate. This pattern continues until finally the Imp goes to
lunch and the map freezes. Somewhere on I-95, the system shuts down
and I am able to coax the Imp out of his snit and find South Main
in Rochester. The Imp succeeds but selects the wrong exit off the
turnpike from a traffic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, folks, are wonderful for negoiating
well-known dense urban areas _ boy, does the Imp know Portsmouth,
N.H., well! But, if it's to the boonies you are trekking, buy a
map, Bunkie. The Imp does not do boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   The TL3.2 is roomy enough, has a decent trunk, some interior
storage and, with the exception of climate controls with the
navigation option, is fairly convenient to operate. At $27,950 plus
$455 delivery, without the Imp, it's the equal of some much
higher-priced iron. Add $2,000 for the navigation system if you
like expensive, aggravatiing toys _ but two grand would buy a heap
of maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura TL3.2 scores on performance, luxury, handling, and
fuel economy; it delivered 26.44 miles per gallon over 928 measured
miles. Thus, it would seem to score fairly well on value, too.
</P>
<P>
   Final insults. It is overcast; I turn on the headlights and the
navigation screen goes dark, showing nothing but accumulated finger
smudges. No amount of fine-tuning the light levels and screen
brightness results in sufficient illumination. Good thing I know
how to get where I'm going. Coming home, the Imp plots the course,
guides me faithfully to within six miles, then falls asleep. I jar
him with the recalculation prod. Great car, lousy pathfinder.

DOES IT SEEM FAMILIAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It happened before, 19 years ago. A popular first
baseman finished a productive albeit short season for the Red Sox.
His contract was up. He was seeking a multiple-year deal. His agent
was a young attorney named Tom Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watson didn't especially want to bicker over terms. Yet, he
knew from experience that Boston general manager Haywood Sullivan
would do so.
</P>
<P>
   These were the Red Sox of the late Tom Yawkey. Who wouldn't want
to be in the same clubhouse with Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski,
Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Butch Hobson, and Carlton Fisk? The 1979
Red Sox had posted a 91-69 record in the American League East but
finished a distant third behind Baltimore and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had been acquired in midseason from Houston, and
everything pointed to him re-signing with Boston. He had batted
.337 with 13 home runs and 53 RBIs in 84 games with the Sox. Fans
had voted him the Tenth Player Award. He was a gentleman, and his
teammates admired his professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my time in Boston,'' Watson would say in later
years. ``The fans, the team, and the way I was accepted. But when
that season ended, I couldn't get the Red Sox to understand where I
was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I wanted just one offer. No bickering back and
forth. I told them to put their best offer on the table, and if it
was what I felt was fair, I would accept. They didn't believe me
and gave my agent a preliminary negotiating figure covering just
one year. I turned it down and signed a two-year deal with the
Yankees. I didn't have to bicker.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice if someone had relayed that story to Dan
Duquette. Watson turned down the Red Sox in an era when Fenway Park
was known as a country club. The Sox had been one of the dominant
franchises in baseball in the '70s, but by 1981, they had lost
Fisk, Lynn, Burleson (and Watson) and were in a tailspin that would
not end until 1986. Only Rice and Evans survived the team's
self-destruction, which lasted until Sullivan passed the torch to
the ever-cheerful Lou Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 years from 1986-95 produced four division championships
and a future Hall of Famer in Roger Clemens. But you knew sooner or
later some player or agent would aggressively challenge the Red
Sox, no matter who represented management, to prove once again that
they belonged among baseball's elite clubs _ with the haves rather
than the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox could have retained the services of Mo Vaughn _ as
they could have kept Watson _ had they decided as far back as 1995
to act with total commitment based on admittedly changing market
values. But they ignored the obvious and pretended that if
something was wrong, Gentle Tom Yawkey would come from his rooftop
office and somehow make things right.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington is not Tom Yawkey, but Dan Duquette seems more
like Haywood Sullivan every day. He's stubborn but not dumb. He's
also fair, but nowadays it is the agents and players who dictate
the terms. If Duquette can't adjust, then he's no better than any
general manager of the past 30 years _ from Dick O'Connell to
Sullivan to Gorman. None of them achieved the ultimate goal of a
World Series title. All made mistakes along the way that were bad
enough to get them fired or forced into resignation. Duquette
should be next if he can't rebound from this mess.
</P>
<P>
   The mess didn't start with Duquette, although it's clear that
the day he agreed to pay pitcher Pedro Martinez $75 million with
Vaughn's future still in doubt ranks up there with Sullivan's bluff
being called.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, O'Connell and Sullivan did develop one of the
best farm systems around, one that produced Fisk, Lynn, Rice,
Burleson, Evans, and Bill Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But after the death of Yawkey in 1976, the sale of the club a
year later to a group headed by Jean Yawkey, with Sullivan and
former trainer Buddy LeRoux as general partners, brought not only a
change in the operating chemistry, but also the realization that
the club had to win to remain out of debt. For a few years, the Sox
competed dollar for dollar. Suddenly, they fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan had played in the '50 and '60s and was used to dealing
with people from his own era. Dealing with agents was not his
favorite thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the players one bit,'' Sullivan said in October
1979. ``They're seeking the best possible contracts. But I do know
you can't pay 25 players a half-million dollars apiece. No club
could survive that way. There is a limit to any deal, and we
reached it. It wasn't a matter of money. We are just one of four
clubs in all of baseball that is financially stable and that has no
debt service. We will fulfill the promises we made.''
</P>
<P>
   Those promises were to keep Fisk, Hobson, Lynn, and Burleson for
the 1980 season. But to retain profit margins and avoid huge
payrolls thereafter, Sullivan cleaned house. Hobson and Burleson
were traded to California in December 1980. Lynn was dealt there in
January. Fisk walked as a free agent in March, joining the White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox went 59-49 in the strike-shortened 1981 season. They
didn't make it back to the playoff until 1986. By that time, Gorman
had replaced Sullivan as GM.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his success with the team, however, Gorman had
trouble maintaining the status quo. For the first 7-8 years of his
tenure, he was asked to avoid free agents, and he did. But a long
period of profit-making was about to end. Sox management didn't
fully realize it until it was almost too late.
</P>
<P>
   The farm system that had produced so magnificently ran dry.
Youngsters such as Phil Plantier and Carlos Quintana underachieved
or got hurt. In the winter of 1991, the Sox ended their
longstanding free agent boycott by signing Matt Young to a
three-year, $10 million contract despite his career record of
54-85. It was one of the worst signings in team history.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, Sullivan, and Gorman all had something in common.
They were old-school GMs who operated with the philosophy that it
was a honor to wear a Red Sox uniform, and that, if nothing else,
was the reason for lower salaries. The strike of 1994 ended that
kind of thinking forever. When the amount of revenue available to
owners from sources other than attendance was revealed during
negotiations with the Players Association, players and their agents
set new goals _ and reached them easier than anyone dare imagined.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Clemens found out in 1996 when he heard Boston's
best offer, then went right out and found a better one, in Toronto.
In 1997, nobody thought any player was worth more than the $11.5
million the Braves paid Greg Maddux. Less than six months later,
the Sox topped that for Martinez. Funny how the marketplace
chances. Once, the Sox could have had Vaughn for $8 million-$9
million, easy. Now he will make $13.3 million in Anaheim, and there
won't be one word spoken about how it affects the future of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame this all on Duquette. He played the game carefully,
trying to avoid a bidding contest that you knew was going to happen
anyway after Mike Piazza signed with the Mets for $13 million.
Duquette works for Harrington, who is just as stubborn as Sullivan
and O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   In the moment of truth, the Sox were used and abused by Reich &AMP;
Co., just as Sullivan was 19 years ago. Duquette's negotiating
style is to hang by the telephone, flipping out details and waiting
for an answer. Reich throws daggers at your heart. If one doesn't
draw blood, he throws another one.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox will find somebody. He won't be another Vaughn. The farm
system is there, and Duquette is supposed to know more about it
than any of his predecessors. But don't expect miracles.
</P>
<P>
   It has to hurt when a club admits it can't please a Mo Vaughn.
If you can appreciate what it means when a father cuts loose his
son, then you know all there is to know about what it is to see
Vaughn grow sour in the knowledge that everybody loves him but the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Some things you have to live with. Mo should do just fine.

ANGELA DAVIS'S NEW CRUSADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- In the 1960s when she thrust her fist
skyward against oppression with the firmness of steel and issued
critiques of America as volcanic as her Afro, Angela Davis had a
tremendous optimism that prisons would become rusted hulks in an
America that educated its children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there were only 200,000 people in prison in the country,
California had the best public educational system in the country
from kindergarden all the way up through post-graduate,'' Davis
said in a recent interview with the Trotter Group, a national group
of African-American columnists.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in a lot of ways, you could say people who wanted to get
an education could. In 1968, we had the strike at San Francisco
State, University of California-Berkeley. You had the beginning of
open admissions. We had an amazing amount of hope for the
educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hope has been shattered. The national prison population has
zoomed from 200,000 toward 2 million. African-American and Latino
men now find admission to jail far easier than college. A
Rockefeller-funded study released this fall by the Justice Policy
Institute found that there are now five times more African-American
men in California prisons than in state universities, 44,617 to
8,767. There are 53,881 Latino prisoners, compared with 30,454 in
four-year state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf is now so wide that Davis is on a new crusade. She is
calling for the abolishment of prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes people think I'm really a provocateur when I talk
about prison abolition,'' Davis said. ``But there were those who
felt the same way about the abolition of slavery. There were those
who assumed that slavery was here to stay, that it was eternal. If
you don't have those who are willing to try to imagine a world
where the prison doesn't loom so large as it does today, then we'll
never get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us can't imagine that. Most of us can't imagine living
in a society without prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis's ability to imagine such a thing during this
punishment-mad, prison-happy era comes from her own perseverance.
She was once labled so radical in California that former Governor
Ronald Reagan vowed that Davis would never again teach again in a
state university after UCLA dropped her from the philosophy
department in 1969. A member of the Communist Party, she was put on
the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted List on false charges and jailed for
16 months before being acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   She now is a tenured professor at University of California-Santa
Cruz. She has published six books. When she helped organize a
national conference on prisons in the Bay Area in September, she
thought that perhaps 500 people would attend. More than 3,000 came.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance, Davis said, was a sign that people are
recognizing that prison has become less an institution for truly
hardended criminals and more of an instrument of social control of
low-income people whom society has decided not to educate.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, spending on corrections in California has
grown 60 percent, while spending on kindergarten through 12th grade
went up only 26 percent and higher education declined 3 percent.
Though it costs five times more to incarcerate someone in
California than to educate them in college ($22,000 to $4,000),
California has built 21 new prisons since 1980, and only one new
college campus. The top pay for correctional officers, $50,820 a
year, easily surpasses the average salary range of $32,000 to
$37,000 for university instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Underfunded state colleges in turn unload their burdens on the
backs of students, raising tuitions by as much as 485 percent since
1980. For African-American men, the tuitions are a modern poll tax.
Between 1990 and 1997, African-American male enrollment in state
public universities declined by 217 students while the number of
black male prisoners increased by 12,147.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for every black male eliminated from its state
universities in the 1990s, California has added 57 to its prisons.
Many of the new inmates are nonviolent offenders whom could be more
effectively rehabilitated with drug treatment and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that the war on drugs is really a war on
the communities that so often are victimized by the drug trade.''
Davis said. ``Which isn't to say that people don't have
responsibility or shouldn't be accountable. But if we don't change
things, we'll say perhaps 10 years from now that a black man in
California is 10 times more likely to go to prison than to go to
college or university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that with all this discussion about slavery, we
ought to bring up the discussions about the vestiges of slavery
within the prison system and the fact that it is becoming a system
that is increasingly designed to hold black people _ black men,
black women behind bars, sometimes for the rest of their lives.''

LAW UPBEAT ON 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRIESTHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As he prepares to celebrate 25 years as a bishop
Saturday, it would be hard to say say that Cardinal Bernard Law has
slowed down much.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he hosted the bishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras to help
make sure that the devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch wasn't
forgotten here. Then he dashed off to spend 24 hours with hundreds
of priests of the archdiocese of Boston talking about the future of
the local church.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he was making plans to mark the anniversary of his
episcopacy this weekend. On Monday, he will fly to Cuba to preach
at the Havana Cathedral and give a speech to church activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of person who likes to get a lot of things done _
and not today, but Thursday,'' says Law, 67, sitting at a large
wooden conference table inside the sprawling cardinal's residence
atop a small hill in Boton's Brighton section.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Law, who was born in Mexico and lived in
several Latin American countries before coming to the United States
to attend Harvard, was made bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, a
sprawling diocese of under 50,000 Catholics in a southern corner of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Law is the leader of more than 2 million Catholics across
greater Boston and one of the most influential voices in the Roman
Catholic Church in this country.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fiercely loyal ally of Pope John Paul II whose
unwavering and vocal defense of church teachings has brought
criticism from more liberal church voices.
</P>
<P>
   But through it, say supporters and foes, one trait has served
Law well _ an ability to disagree without being disagreeable. It
has proved especially valuable in one area that Law has made a a
top priority _ improving relations in the city among people of
diverse racial, ethnic, religious and economic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to do that is not to be a bishop,'' said Law in a
wide-ranging interview. ``I didn't dream any of this up. Christ
did. I am very grateful for the great personal relationships that I
have with people who don't always agree with me and with whom I
don't always agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's edition of the Pilot, the official archdiocesan
newspaper, is entirely dedicated to Law and includes tributes from
churchmen and churchwomen from across the world.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes complimentary commentaries from the Reverend
Diane Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of
Churches, an organization of Protestant denominations, and from
Leonard Zakim, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   When he was first diagnosed with cancer, writes Zakim, one of
the first persons who called with words of solace and encouragement
was Law.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 years after he was named to head the archdiocese,
Law says he still has the same enthusiasm for the job that he did
when first stepped inside the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on a
winter's day in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Even through the hard times _ having to close parishes,
confronting the explosive issue of clergy sexual abuse and
accusations that the church failed to properly deal with the issue,
and struggling with a dwindling number of priests _ Law says he
remains optimistic about the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows I've had a lot of life experiences,'' says Law, 68.
``I've dealt with a lot of issues and there certainly wasn't a `how
to' book for bisihops that told you how to go through those things.
You do it on basis of experience, you consult with others, and then
you pray.''

MOVING MONEY INTO IRA WOULD BROADEN OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'm 41 and I changed jobs about seven years ago. I currently
have two 401(k) accounts, each worth about $85,000. I'm looking to
retire at age 65. Up until recently, both of the 401(k)s were doing
pretty well, but with current market conditions, I'm wondering how
I should be allocating my funds. In the 401(k) with my current
employer, I have $60,000 in T. Rowe Price Equity Index 500 fund and
the balance in the T. Rowe Price Value fund. The 401(k) from the
previous employer is with Fidelity and has $45,000 in Fidelity
Equity Income II and the rest in Spartan U.S. Equity Index fund. I
contribute about $6,000 a year to the current 401(k). I no longer
contribute to the Fidelity account. Should I retain it or roll it
over into the Price account? Do I have the right mix of funds? What
do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   P.O., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the state of the current market is a good cause
for a change in portfolio allocations, but I do think that you
should be more broadly diversified, whatever the market condition.
Of the four funds you're holding, three are large-cap stock funds,
the exception being T. Rowe Price Value, which holds a mid-cap
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In your letter, you list the various options available in the
two 401(k) plans. My suggestion would be to provide yourself with
an unlimited menu of options by moving the money that's now in the
old 401(k) at Fidelity to a rollover IRA account. You could stay
with Fidelity through this move, and then avail yourself of all
Fidelity's investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, I suggest you retain half of your total
savings in the large-cap market sector, dividing the balance among
international, mid-cap, small-cap and health care positions. You
would need to make no change in the holdings of the current 401(k)
with Price. If you chose Fidelity for the rollover IRA, you could
then put $25,000 in Fidelity Equity Income II and create three
positions of $20,000 each -- in Fidelity Select Health Care,
Fidelity Overseas, and Fidelity Low-Priced Stock.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to maintain the portfolio balance, you should alter the
allocation of your ongoing contributions to the current 401(k) with
T. Rowe Price. I suggest that you direct that 50 percent of the
contributions go to the Price Equity Index 500 fund and the balance
be evenly divided among Price's Value, International Stock, and
Small-Cap Value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you maintain savings at the current rate and if
you achieve average annual returns of 10 percent from your
retirement portfolio, the accounts would have a value of $2,426,789
by the time you are 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 49 and self-employed. I have nothing in place for
retirement and no savings other than $18,000 invested in Vanguard
Windsor II fund and $180,000 in Janus fund. In my mind, this is my
retirement pool. I will also be eligible for Social Security
benefits. I have been adding about $2,000 a month to these funds,
and I can continue this until September of next year, when the
first of my four children goes to college. I then will have a child
in college for each of the next 12 years, so I will stop the $2,000
contributions during that time. Assuming I will not be able to add
much to my present savings, do you recommend any change? I expect
to retire in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   K.N., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, you'll want to read the letter above, because
your situation is much like P.O.'s -- only moreso. You have 100
percent of your holdings in large-cap stocks, and the fact that the
Windsor II portfolio is value-oriented doesn't give me much
comfort. I suggest you reduce your reliance on the large caps to a
maximum of 60 percent of the portfolio, and I would be happier if
it were 50 percent. That's particularly so since you're a few years
P.O's senior, and should want to moderate risk. If you follow that
line of thinking, you might go further still, putting 50 percent in
large caps, 10 percent in each of the smaller market sectors
outlined to P.O., and finishing with a final 10 percent in a solid
balanced fund, of which Janus Balanced and Vanguard Balanced Index
funds are good examples.
</P>
<P>
   Second, unless you left something out, it appears all of this
money is in taxable accounts. If that's the case, I suggest you
begin the process of moving money into tax- deferred accounts. As a
self-employed person, you could establish a SEP-IRA or a Keogh
retirement savings plan that would defer taxes on the portfolio
accumulation until after the funds are withdrawn in retirement.
Another alternative, if you qualify, would be to move the
maximum.$2,000 a year into Roth IRA accounts. If you took the
SEP-IRA or Keogh alternatives, it would reduce your current tax
liability; if you went with the Roth, it would have no effect on
current taxes, but all the money would be tax-free when withdrawn
in retirement. The point is that as long as you have the earnings
to qualify for such plans, you can make the contributions -- the
funds can be withdrawn from these taxable accounts and then
reinvested in the same holdings, but now having a tax-deferred
status.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this important? Well, if you follow the plan you outline,
adding $2,000 a month for nine months and then leaving the pool to
grow with no contributions for another 171 months, assuming average
10 percent annual growth the accumulation would be $900,665.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of this accumulation, the internal growth
would have grown to about $80,000, and such growth is likely to
cause some fairly hefty tax bills -- perhaps hefty enough that at
some point you'd find you had to invade the principal to satisfy
our mutual Uncle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 39 years old and my wife is 42 and we have children aged
three years and six years. We recently sold our house and cash, and
we have the $150,000 proceeds of that transaction. Because of plans
to relocate to Israel in a year or two, we are not sure what type
of investment is best for us now and for the future. What do you
suggest? M.I., Hillsborough, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest extreme caution. Certainly with such a short
investment time frame, you don't even want to think about stocks or
high-yield bonds or anything that provides the prospect of
substantial returns. I'll suggest four options, although I think
the risks associated with one of them probably outweigh the
potential for gains. The slowest track would be a money market
fund. I called Vanguard to get representative yields from various
fixed-income funds, but you can find similar funds and similar
yields at most major mutual fund families.
</P>
<P>
   As this is written, Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund provides
a yield of 4.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping from the very slow track to the slow track, Vanguard's
Short-Term Corporate Bond fund offered a 5.84 percent yield. And
the fastest mover in this slow race is Vanguard GNMA, with a 6.52
percent yield. But to pick up those 68 basis points of interest (a
basis point is one one-hundredth of one percent), you are moving
from short- term investments into the intermediate term, and
assuming the attendant risk. For my money, the 5.84 percent of the
short-term bond fund looks like the best choice of these three.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you wanted to make things simpler still and get
federal insurance on your investment to boot, you could shop around
for the best CD rate available. As this is written, the nation's
best rate on a one-year CD was 5.5 percent. You can check in the
business pages of the New York Times to get the highest rate
currently offered among the nation's banks and the name of the
institution offering it. The advantage of a CD over the short-term
bond fund is not, in my mind, a question of risk but the fact that
with the CD you will have your rate locked in. You could then asses
your situation after the year's up, deciding whether to reinvest
for another year, for six months, or whatever seems best at that
time. But remember, if you go for a one-year CD and then suddenly
decide that you want to make your move to Israel in nine months,
you'll face a premature withdrawal penalty which will probably more
than wipe out any advantage you may have achieved over the money
market or short-term bond fund.

TENSE, EDGY `LOGO' HAS UNSCRIPTED FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no avoiding the fact that ``Hard Core Logo'' will invite
comparisons to ``This Is Spinal Tap.'' Like that classic 1984
mockumentary, this film follows the on-the-road exploits of a
fictional rock band well past its prime, but just too stubborn and
stupid to know it. Like the boys of Spinal Tap, the members of Hard
Core Logo love the rock 'n' roll life even if it no longer loves
them back.
</P>
<P>
   But any resemblances between the films pretty much ends there.
Whereas ``Spinal Tap'' was a satire, a jokey send-up of heavy metal
and its aging practitioners, ``Hard Core Logo'' is a far edgier
film, tense and tragic in its depiction of a regrouped punk band
spiraling dangerously out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes its title from the name of the band, a hardcore
punk quartet featuring singer-ringmaster Joe Dick (Hugh Dillon),
lead guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie), bassist John
Oxenberger (John Pyper-Ferguson), and drummer Pipefitter (Bernie
Coulson). They formed in Canada in 1978, played 1,000 shows,
released seven albums, and attracted a small but devoted following
before finally burning out in 1991. After years in small clubs, the
band was once on the brink of breaking through and signing a major
label deal. But Joe scotched the whole shebang when during a show
he jumped on a table and relieved himself in a record executive's
gin and tonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hey, see if you can sell that, you corporate
weasel,' '' recalls the bearish, drug-pumped Pipefitter. ``Talk
about game over!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' deadpans Joe, ``you had to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But that missed opportunity was a bitter pill for the other
members, especially the most ambitious, Billy, the band's pretty
boy. Joe, who won't surrender his ``down the republic'' punk poses,
condemns Billy's craving for mainstream success and magazine
covers. Says Joe, ``Billy just wants the models and the limousines,
and I'm happy with the hookers and taxicabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The lingering enmity between Joe and Billy should be reason
enough to keep the band permanently split. But the band reunites
for an ill-fated final tour, fueled by the success of a benefit
concert for their mentor, Bucky Haight (Julian Richings), who lost
a leg (or maybe two) after he was shot, by a possible stalker. Joe,
who hasn't done much since the band imploded, is the most eager for
the reunion. Billy isn't too keen on it, since he has his eyes on a
bigger prize _ becoming a member of a slick Los Angeles band,
Jenifur. John and Pipefitter hitch up for the tour, but John is
probably the most ambivalent. The last place John, a sweet-natured
former mental patient, needs to be is on the road living the life
that drove him into an asylum in the first place. Pipefitter is the
archetypal let-the-good-times-roll drummer _ he's a party waiting
to happen, and as dumb as a box of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, the band is all spit, cuss words, and cigarettes,
packing as much snarl and macho stupidity as they can into their
slash-and-burn anthems. Offstage, they're a mess. Joe is so tweaked
on cocaine he can barely sleep, and he fights endlessly with Billy.
By the time, John loses his much-needed antipsychotic medication,
the tour is already speeding toward a violent end.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bruce McDonald has a keen eye for life on the road _
the lousy diners, the crappy tour bus with rotted floorboards, the
petty jealousies between members that often erupt. This is the kind
of film where one can forget the story is fiction; at times the
dialogue is so harshly real, it seems unscripted. What laughs there
are come mixed with chunks of ground glass. Uncompromising, this is
an arresting look at rock's unchecked excesses, and the sad
futility in trying to maintain the stance of angry young men as one
moves reluctantly toward middle age.

IMITATION MAKES THE ORIGINAL `PSYCHO' ALL THE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With PSCYHO-CHART)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we did with ``Titanic,'' we know for certain what happens in
``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat sinks. The blonde gets it in the shower because Norman
Bates has a problem with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   No mystery there.
</P>
<P>
   What is genuinely puzzling is the reaction of film fans _
ranging from up-arched eyebrows to shock, genuine shock! _ to the
news that the new version of ``Psycho'' is a scrupulous recreation
of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 original.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Van Sant, director of ``Good Will Hunting'' and ``Drugstore
Cowboy,'' has said that when making the new ``Psycho'' he tried to
replicate Hitchcock's film, shot by shot, line by line, adding only
different actors, color film and more gore to the shower slaughter.
Otherwise, according to Van Sant, his movie is a homage to
Hitchcock, a literal reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they, crazy?'' wondered Entertainment Weekly
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meddling,'' huffed a Los Angeles critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrogance,'' snorted another.
</P>
<P>
   Temper, temper. It's a movie, people. If Van Sant's ``Psycho''
is only half as good as Hitchcock's, it will still be worth seeing
_ superior entertainment to ``Psycho'' spawn ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer'' and ``Urban Legend.'' And if the new movie is
truly dreadful, for whatever reason, that won't diminish the
greatness of Hitchcock's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a flop of a remake, especially one that uses the exact
elements of the first picture, will only reinforce the genius of
Hitchcock and his movie's ability to scare the heck out of us even
after four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Good movies last a lifetime in memory; bad movies last a couple
of hours, and then you forget about them. Ten years from now, it's
possible that ``Who played the lead roles in the 1998 remake of
`Psycho'?'' will be an obscure trivia question (answer: Anne Heche
and Vince Vaughn), while many people will know Janet Leigh was on
the receiving end of Anthony Perkins' knife in the Hitchcock film.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pre-release ruckus about Van Sant's movie unspools
from the fact that critics weren't allowed to see it in advance.
The director chose to follow Hitchcock's example there, too: Like
the master 38 years ago, Van Sant refused to give reviewers an
early peek at his movie.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to compare, contrast, congratulate or crucify the new
film, the entertainment press instead attacked Van Sant for his
method. Some have suggested that remaking a movie shot by shot _
filming scenes on Hitchcock's original six-week schedule, requiring
actors to deliver their speeches at the same speed as their
predecessors _ is no different than retyping a great novel.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. Art is forever being remade. Copying successful past
performances is standard practice in music and dance. Great
symphonies by Mozart and Beethoven have been performed millions of
times, with many interpretations, for example.
</P>
<P>
   There are orchestras that perform Baroque music on period
instruments, the goal being to recreate the composition exactly as
it sounded when it was written. And the New York City Ballet
regularly remounts productions by having dancers precisely
reproduce choreography created decades ago by George Balanchine and
Jerome Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   What Van Sant is attempting is new for cinema, however, and
that's what makes it an audacious choice. The director's most
frequent explanation for filming his new ``Psycho'' as he did is,
``Because it's never been done before,'' which makes him sound like
a mountain climber looking at Everest and saying, ``Because it's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant is being disingenuous. He's too intelligent, and
varied, a director to settle for a showoff stunt like merely
copying Hitchcock. He presumably was drawn to the material by a
reverence for Hitchcock, of course, but also by his affection for
oddballs and outcasts. From his first picture, the grimily
beautiful, emotionally deep ``Mala Noche,'' a black-and-white gay
love story he made for $25,000 in 1986, right up to the big-budget,
heterosexual wholesomeness of ``Good Will Hunting,'' Van Sant
identifies with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get less mainstream than Norman Bates, a creepy,
Oedipal wacko in a junky motel.
</P>
<P>
   What's new for Van Sant in ``Psycho'' is a movie that requires
audience-manipulating horror. (His ``Even Cowgirls Get the Blues''
was horrible, but in another sense of the word.) Hitchcock, a far
superior technician than Van Sant, used his timing and talents to
torture audiences, sicken them with suspense. Van Sant is too
sympathetic, to audiences and characters, to apply the thumbscrews
of dread as nastily as Hitchcock did; the closest he gets is the
wicked black comedy of ``To Die For.''
</P>
<P>
   Copying Hitchcock exactly may be the best way to introduce a
great film to new audiences. Moviegoers have a prejudice against
black-and-white pictures, against old movies, against unfamiliar
actors. Case in point: Orson Welles' ``Touch of Evil,'' the recent
40th-anniversary rerelease, which hardly anyone went to see.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' is in color, has familiar actors and surely
will be scary. There's a crazy guy, a knife, a pretty girl. Sounds
like every other teen-shriek movie. But with the combined talents
of Hitchcock and Van Sant, it won't be. That much is for certain.

TRUTH COMES IN BLOWS 
A Memoir 
By Ted Solotaroff 
Norton, 285 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Ted Solotaroff is a verifiable success as a critic and
editor, his boyhood memories and visions of the hard life in
Elizabeth, N.J., don't simply haunt _ they inhabit. His father, in
particular, seems to sit inside him like a bitter seed, greedily
sapping resources and sprouting at the most inopportune times.
Founder of the New American Review and author of ``A Few Good
Voices in My Head,'' Solotaroff takes on his past, pathologies and
all, in a humane memoir that seems destined to be the first of a
series.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, this is no salacious tell-all. It is more Edmund
Wilson (as in ``The Fifties'') than Andrew Morton (as in ``Diana:
Her True Story''). Enriched by Solotaroff's sharp cultural
analysis, ``Truth Comes in Blows'' charts the cost of the
Depression and the rise of the postwar middle class through the
story of one family's struggle to win a psychic truce.
</P>
<P>
   Solotaroff begins at the end, with his father's noisy, miserable
last years. The two reconnect, with a momentary ``sweet rapport''
that rapidly dissolves. But the son can't abandon the father; the
writerly impulse takes over and the questions fall into place about
this ``self-made and self-unmade'' businessman. Giving the eulogy
at his father's funeral, Solotaroff wonders, ``Who was this man
who, even in death, could play my spirit like a pipe? How had the
holes been put in that he'd fingered? How had I managed to keep him
from breaking it, as he had tried to do?''
</P>
<P>
   From age 4 on, Solotaroff felt torn in two by the opposing
forces at home. If he was Little Benny, the boy who looked like his
father and hungered for attention, he was also a Weiss boy, scion
of his mother's creative, intellectual clan. Both mother and son
are subject to physical and emotional pummeling at home. Young Ted
never loses his spunk or capacity for outrage, but Rose frays badly
and descends into a state of permanent apology.
</P>
<P>
   At rare moments, a happy memory gleams through. On Sundays, Ted
tags along while his father plays paddle ball at the YMHA. He puts
away his fear and feels, finally, like a son in the intimacy of the
steam room. ``With a father who seemed proud of me and at one with
those beefy, half-naked, wisecracking Jewish men in their prime,
just like my uncles at Cream Ridge, I was grounded in what unity I
had between being my father's son and my mother's, between Little
Benny, the rough-and-tough wise guy, and the Weiss boy, who didn't
cry and always kept his head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there is The Shop. Ben Solotaroff is a glass
contractor, who works nights and weekends to pull the family out of
the industrial flats of Elizabeth to the more suburban, Gentile
end, where the sky isn't filled with smoke and where deep woods and
farmland begin. The Depression rages, but the family is able to
stay afloat. Solotaroff hates the work, however, and indeed, his
father seems to have pressed him into bondage early on. ``I knew by
now that none of this was for me _ not the glass business, not
Elizabeth, certainly not working with him. I hated this Shop that
had already kept me from my rightful life, and hated even more the
diminished, squelched sense of myself I often still had when I was
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Elmora, Ted realizes he is an outsider in part
because he is Jewish. He recounts the rawest anti-Semitism and
wrestles with his identity throughout the book, pledging a Jewish
fraternity in high school and going to shul with his mother but
resolving to get a nose job. ``The great project that virtually
every one of my friends . . . shared was to become ever more
American to ourselves as well as to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that American identity came through literature, and
Solotaroff realized early on that he could transport himself by
reading. Books carry him through a checkered academic career and a
benighted tour in the Navy. But he seems destined to be forever
split in twos: the athlete and intellectual, the whoring sailor who
reads Thomas Wolfe, the Jew proud of his Zionist grandfather but
shamed by his own swarthy skin and unruly hair.
</P>
<P>
   Solotaroff makes much of the hash of his life, however, because
he maintains an elegant distance from it in the writing. He evokes
a strong sense of place and time, and has an eye for the internal
workings of character. His parents divorce and he heads to college
in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``Though I didn't know of William James's
concept at the time, I was bent on becoming one of the
twice-born,'' he writes toward the end of the book. He is also
headed for a life of the intellect, far from The Shop. Why, then,
does he keep one of his father's glass cutters on his desk, in a
jar that holds pens, pencils, and other tools of the editor's
trade? Perhaps it is because he recognizes how inextricable the
child and the father are. Solotaroff shows that it can be
satisfying to march deeply into the labyrinth and, finally, bag the
Minotaur.

PUNISH CRIMES, NOT THOUGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Maybe the anonymous guy who called me the other
day had a license to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about Rudolph Berry and William Hines, the
20-year-old white guys from the Albany suburb of Rotterdam accused
of wounding a city woman with a rifle because she had the nerve to
be black. These rocket scientists went to Rotterdam's Schalmont
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this demonstrates,'' the caller said, ``is that Schalmont
is crummy at teaching marksmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   That was either a very bad joke or a clever legal defense _
probably a defense, actually. That same day, the lawyer for these
two, Gaspar Castillo, was saying that this was all a prank gone
tragically awry _ that these good-hearted, high-spirited young men
aren't bigots and had never meant to hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sure, this is America, and everybody is innocent until a
jury says otherwise. And, OK, I didn't see this happen with my own
eyes. I therefore have no right to an opinion on what did or did
not happen in this incident.
</P>
<P>
   But let's assume that the Albany police are right. Let's assume
that these two white knuckle-draggers from a virtually all-white
suburb decided it would be cool to gun down a black person. And
let's assume that's what they were up to in Albany's poor, largely
black Arbor Hill neighborhood at 4 a.m. Let's assume, too, that
they really were the guys who came roaring by in a 7-year-old red
Mustang and pumped a 9 mm-bullet into the neck of Sonia Thompson,
38.
</P>
<P>
   Just what do you do with people like that?
</P>
<P>
   The Albany police have charged them with a long string of
serious felonies. If convicted, they'll go to prison for a long
time. Since most prisons have a 70-plus percent minority
population, these guys undoubtedly will meet some fascinating new
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But, for some people, that's not enough for a crime like this.
For some people, creeps who do things like this should be punished
not just for what they did but for what motivated them to do it in
the first place. Ann Pope, for example, runs the Albany NAACP. She
said that New York needs a bias law that would increase the penalty
for any crime committed because of the race, religion or sexual
orientation of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki is for that. New York is one of only
11 states without such a law. The obstacle here is Joe Bruno, the
state Senate majority leader. He's nervous about punishing people
for what they think.
</P>
<P>
   And, basically, he's right. Here's the ugly truth: As an
American, you have a constitutional right to be a racist. You have
a right to be a homophobe. You have a right to be a sexist and an
anti-semite, too. You have a right to despise Catholics, Baptists,
atheists or sun-worshipers. You have a right to hate anybody you
want for whatever reason might strike your fancy. Your thoughts are
your business, not the government's.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have a right to do is commit violence. And any
judge sentencing any body for violence or any other crime has both
a right and a duty to take the defendant's mindset into account _
and give that bias-motivated criminal the maximum sentence the law
allows on the very first offense. That's the way to handle this
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says that roughly 9,500 hate crimes a year are committed
in this nation of 260 million souls. African-Americans are the
likeliest victims. But fully 40 percent of racially motivated
murders are committed by blacks, who are only 12 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Bias crime laws cut both ways, and a good many people pushing
for this in New York might not like the way they would end up
working. Bruno has the right idea. Punish the crime. Then let the
criminals explain their thinking to their fellow inmates.
</P>

CHRISTMAS RECORDINGS HAVE COME OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Christmas in July when most artists make their holiday
albums. When Mariah Carey made hers a few years ago, she set up a
Christmas tree in the studio to simulate the winter season. Many
artists do the same thing to get in the mood, though Celine Dion
said this past summer that she didn't need such trimmings for her
new holiday CD because ``the songs are in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Each singer has a different approach, but one thing is certain:
More and more are making holiday CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The payback can be huge _ witness platinum sales for seasonal
discs by Carey, Neil Diamond, and Gloria Estefan in recent years _
but the reasons go beyond sales.
</P>
<P>
   A holiday album allows an artist to bond with fans in ways not
possible with a typical studio CD. While it can be a corny path to
take, more are accepting the challenge and are transcending the
usual Christmas carols to add original compositions that make such
records must-buys for fans.
</P>
<P>
   In Dion's excellent new CD, ``These Are Special Times,'' she has
a duet with opera sensation Andrea Bocelli on an original tune,
``The Prayer,'' and another with R. Kelly on ``I'm Your Angel.''
And Brian McKnight's fine new ``Bethlehem'' CD has a soulful duet
with Boyz II Men, ``Let It Snow '98,'' with the zanily romantic
line: ``Pretend like I'm the tree and you're the star.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Christmas album has come of age, as artists often
add contemporary interpretations. They no longer just cover such
traditional holiday classics as ``O Come All Ye Faithful,'' ``O
Holy Night,'' or ``The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an
Open Fire).'' Many still do those tunes, but the emphasis is on
writing new material or hiring a song doctor to do it, as Dion did
in having Diane Warren pen the ballad ``These Are the Special
Times,'' from which her album title was derived.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop of holiday albums, while more plentiful, still
varies dramatically in quality. There are some clunkers, notably
Shawn Colvin's ``Holiday Songs and Lullabies.'' Colvin may have won
two Grammy awards last year, but her new album is far more somber
than need be. She made it during the ``scorching'' summer months in
Austin, Tex., as (as she writes in the liner notes), while she was
pregnant. But that doesn't explain the surprisingly lugubrious
results. If you're looking for a festive Christmas album, this
isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin starts with the traditional ``In the Bleak Mid-Winter,''
and that, unfortunately, sets the tone. She artfully experiments
with string and horn sections _ rather than playing her trademark
acoustic guitar _ and the music gets bogged down in a ponderous
stew. There's an unusual and unsatisfying arrangement of ``Silent
Night,'' with flugelhorn and French horn and trombone. The best
song is ``Little Road to Bethlehem,'' with some pedal steel guitar
and some much-needed pep.
</P>
<P>
   Other disappoinments are Etta James's ``12 Songs of Christmas''
(her versions of standard carols are pedestrian except for a
passionate ``O Holy Night'') and the Windham Hill compilation ``The
Colors of Christmas.'' It is an adult soul-schlock compilation
featuring Peabo Bryson, Sheena Easton, Jeffrey Osborne, Philip
Bailey, Oleta Adams, Roberta Flack, and Melissa Manchester. The
cast sounds interesting, but the music is absurdly gooey for the
most part _ and only Bailey and Flack survive the goo fest. Bailey
achieves a marvelous, high-tenor reach on ``Silent Night,'' while
Flack is her hypnotic self on ``O Come All Ye Faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the soul genre, the much better albums are McKnight's
``Bethlehem'' and the Jermaine Dupri-conceived ``12 Soulful Nights
of Christmas.'' McKnight writes many of his own songs, from the
Stevie Wonder-influenced ``Christmas Time Is Here'' to the
flamenco-influenced ``Bethlehem Tonight,'' with McKnight singing
``As sure as the stars are in the sky / The newborn king was born
in Bethlehem.'' He also colorfully embellishes the traditional
``First Noel'' and has Mrs. Nat King Cole come in for a spoken-word
message about the holidays: ``I hope you'll remember your family .
. . it's just so important.'' It's more stately than corny.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri served as executive producer on Motown's ``12 Soulful
Nights of Christmas,'' which finds multiple artists writing their
own material, along with covering some standards. Highlights
include Faith Evans's softly intoned ``A Christmas Lullabye,''
Gerald Levert's ``Christmas Without My Girlfriend'' (``I don't want
no expensive presents / I don't want no Christmas without my
girlfriend''), Chaka Khan's sultry ``Christmas Only Once a Year,''
and Jagged Edge's hip-hoppy ``This Christmas,'' with the yearning
line ``All I want this Christmas is to keep your body warm.'' It's
a long way from ``O Holy Night,'' but it works since it's genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Two offbeat records are worth noting. One is Shirley Caesar's
``Christmas with Shirley Caesar,'' in which her gospel roots make
for a sometimes disconcertingly intense journey through ``Hark the
Herald Angels Sing'' and ``We Three Kings of Orient Are,'' though
she excels on the operatic ``Ave Maria'' and a modern,
drum-programmed arrangement of ``Little Drummer Boy.''
Trans-Siberian Orchestra's ``The Christmas Attic'' has a symphonic
feel echoing Emerson, Lake &AMP; Palmer and other dinosaur-pomp acts.
Some of it is cliched, but some is quite affecting in a rock-opera
style that uses rotating singers, such as Luxx's Katrina Chester.
</P>
<P>
   For young listeners, the choice is N-Sync's ``Home for
Christmas,'' which is better than many people might expect. There
are pillowy lyrics and sugary, Beach Boys-like harmonies, but the
teen group does an inventive a cappella arrangement of ``O Holy
Night'' and holds its own elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The season's standout, though, is Celine Dion's new disc. Not
only does she perform a shimmering duet with Bocelli, but she has
another with R. Kelly on ``I'm Your Angel,'' which he wrote. Dion
has become a household name since scoring big on the ``Titanic''
soundtrack and continues to release work of high quality. She does
a dynamic version of ``O Holy Night,'' along with a songbird-level
treatment of ``Ave Maria'' and a pretty, acoustic-driven look at
Bryan Adams's poppy ``Another Year Has Gone By.''
</P>
<P>
   The red-hot Dion also regales listeners with a tasteful cover of
John Lennon and Yoko Ono's ``Happy Xmas (War Is Over).'' She wishes
people a happy new year in the song and adds, ``Let's hope it's a
good one without any fear.'' She even does the Elvis
Presley-identified ``Blue Christmas'' and invites her 13
Montreal-bred siblings to sing Jose Feliciano's ``Feliz Navidad.''
It's gushy, but the family spirit makes this a keeper.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Festive lighting adds so much to the home around
the holidays. But care should be used when buying holiday
electrical lights.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there was a major national recall of more than 1.5
million sets of curtain-style, indoor/outdoor holiday lights, more
commonly known as icicle lights.
</P>
<P>
   But Yolanda Fultz-Morris, spokeswoman for the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission, said there is no recall that the
commission is aware of so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's recall was a result of the problem with the splice
connector, where hot wires could come detached and cause a fire.
</P>
<P>
   According to Underwriters Laboratories (UL), unauthorized
holographic UL labels, located on each string near the plug, with
the following numbers identify the lights with splice connectors
that were recalled: E115759; E126258; E127357; E127522; E48723;
E64444; E65770; E97593.
</P>
<P>
   Curtain-style lights without splice connectors were not involved
in this recall.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers with questions about the lights that were recalled
should call or visit the retail store where they purchased the
lights, or contact CPSC's toll-free hot line at 800-638-2772.

musician, but what kind of musician remained unclear for a very
long time _ even after he achieved celebrity in such diverse fields
as film music, jazz piano, and orchestral conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Previn is now 69, and his ultimate reputation may rest on the
most lasting musical achievement, composition. He has composed for
most of his life, but the piece that established him as a composer,
a music-theater collaboration with playwright Tom Stoppard, ``Every
Good Boy Deserves Favor,'' wasn't written until 1977. Only this
year did Previn produce his first opera, ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' which was premiered in San Francisco in September.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Boston Symphony programs bring the local premiere of
the Piano Concerto Previn wrote for Vladimir Ashkenazy in 1984-85,
a work that followed earlier concertos for horn and guitar. Previn
was originally supposed to conduct the Boston performances with
pianist Horacio Gutierrez, but withdrew when he was summoned to
Washington, D.C., where he will receive the Kennedy Center Honors
Saturday (12/5). Washington was kind enough to surrender its own
music director, Leonard Slatkin, for a week so that he could
conduct in Previn's place.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Previn spoke by telephone from his home in
New York about his Piano Concerto before setting out to conduct a
concert by the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The work obviously has its roots in his lifelong experience of
the piano. ``I wasn't a child prodigy, but a kid who played the
piano,'' Previn says. ``I played well, I understand, but my parents
were very smart and good. They did not allow me to perform in
public, so I didn't give any performances as a child, and I am
still very grateful for that. As an absolute child, I went to the
conservatory in Berlin, where I worked with a man called Professor
Breithaupt. This is no longer a name to be reckoned with, but
George Szell was astounded when I told him who I had studied with.
`He must have been a hundred years old,' Szell exclaimed, and he
may have been. Later on in Paris I had a few lessons in theory and
improvisation with the organist Marcel Dupre. I don't know how
seriously I took it all at the time. I always knew I'd wind up
being a musician, but the question was what kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn says he worked very hard at the piano and that an
important part of his musical education came from playing duets
with his father. ``He was a solicitor and an amateur pianist who
believed in my being a musician as opposed to being a pianist. He
had a huge collection of all the great symphonic and chamber-music
works arranged for piano, four-hands. And every night one of those
books would come out, and I would have to play through something by
Mozart or Beethoven or Brahms or Schubert or Schumann or
Mendelssohn with him, up to speed, and damn the mistakes. It gave
me a very good training in sight-reading, something I've used ever
since. My father was not a good pianist, but he made up for a lack
of technique with an endless enthusiasm _ and a hell of a lot of
loud pedal.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn is famous as an interpreter of the Mozart concertos, and
Philips will release some of his Mozart performances in its ongoing
examination of the 100 most important pianists of the century. But
he says he has played many concertos in public _ three of
Beethoven's, the Tchaikovsky, the Grieg, the Rachmaninoff Second,
and the ``Paganini'' Rhapsody _ and of course he has conducted all
of the repertory concertos with some of the most celebrated
pianists of our day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the Brahms concertos,'' Previn says, ``but never
played them. I was never what I would call a Liszt pianist, and I
played dreadful Chopin. I love Chopin, but it didn't speak through
me when I played, and it still doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn says he doesn't know the extent to which his personal
experience of the piano literature influenced the creation of his
own concerto. ``I didn't model my concerto on anything, although I
may have been thinking more about the Prokofiev or the Bartok
concertos than any other pieces, although in a mild way. When the
composer Harold Shapero told me the first theme in my concerto
reminded him of the Bartok Third, I took it as a very great
compliment. I did know what I was writing for Vladimir Ashkenazy,
so I knew damn well that I could write anything. And I have to say
he played it with sickening ease. The piano part is very difficult,
and the orchestra part isn't easy either.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the premiere, the concerto has been taken up by other
pianists, including Andre Watts and Gutierrez. The composer
confesses that his memory of the piece is a bit hazy _ it's been
about six years since he's heard it. When asked about a fascinating
passage for alto saxophone, he says, ``I hear it in my own ear, but
I don't even remember what movement it's in! There's quite a lot of
stuff for the percussion, but unlike many of my colleagues, I got
over that _ and I never did write for an endless array of arcane
instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn is still basking in the glow of ``Streetcar.'' ``It was a
great experience for me and renewed my adoration for being in the
opera house pit. I love writing for voices, and all the singers
seemed to like it a good deal. Renee Fleming, who sang Blanche, and
I have a lot of plans to work together over the next three years.
The recording will come out in mid-December on three Deutsche
Grammophon CDs, and there will be a telecast on Dec. 30. So far,
I've only seen the temporary mix of the television version, but
what I saw I liked very much, and the recording sounds very good.
I'm not saying I'm uniformly pleased by everything that I wrote,
but I was pleased by enough of it to warrant writing another opera,
and I've already done some sketches for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was time to head for Avery Fisher Hall. ``It's a nice
program tonight, the Dvorak Seventh, and a beautiful piece by Jacob
Druckman called `Aureole,' and Pamela Frank is playing Mozart's
Third Violin Concerto. Everything she does is so beautiful. We
worked on it as if it were a new and wildly complicated piece.
That's the way to do it.''

O POSITIVE ISN'T NEGATIVE ABOUT ITS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are,'' says O Positive singer-guitarist Dave Herlihy,
``back from the dead, momentarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ which hasn't existed for three years _ plays its
farewell concert at Mama Kin Music Hall in Boston Saturday night
(12/5). After that, it's back to the rock graveyard for O Positive
_ Herlihy, singer-guitarist Dave Martin, guitarist-keyboardist Alan
Petitti, drummer Ken Hickey, and bassist David Ingham. But, you may
wonder, why was O Positive exhumed in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Herlihy says T.T. the Bear's co-owner, Bonney Bouley, called in
September about reuniting the band to play one of the club's
25th-anniversary/charity shows. ``We had such a good feeling about
Bonney and the cause, so we said, `Let's do this,' '' says Herlihy.
``A couple of the guys thought it'd be a good opportunity to go
over tracks from '94 to put together a live CD. The show sold out a
week in advance and a lot of people couldn't get in, so we figured
we'd do one more show.''
</P>
<P>
   With a limited edition CD, ``O Positive Live,'' just out,
Herlihy calls the Mama Kin gig ``a CD release funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   O Positive was one of Boston's most melodic, intelligent
post-punk bands of the decade 1985-95. The group scored early with
the ``Only Breathing'' EP (featuring ``With You'') and then again
with another EP called ``Cloud Factory'' (featuring ``Talk About
Love''). The two EPs were combined into a CD in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the members signed with Epic and released the CD
``Toyboat, Toyboat, Toyboat.'' O Positive didn't fly nationally for
a variety of reasons _ a lack of promotion being one of those.
``They were scaling back their commitment to baby bands,'' recalls
Herlihy. ``We walked in to do a video for the first single and they
pulled the plug. We stepped into the batter's box and we didn't
have a bat. We just watched the ball go by.''
</P>
<P>
   The band regrouped, kept moving, and solidified its local
audience. It released a final studio CD, ``Home Sweet Head,'' in
1993. By January '95, it was all over. Herlihy went full-time into
law, a profession he had trained for at Boston College. He is now
an entertainment business attorney. (Herlihy, Hickey, and Ingham
also play occasionally in a group called Toyboat, which appears at
T.T. the Bear's Dec. 11.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my midlife crisis at 24,'' says the 41-year-old Herlihy.
``I woke up as a lawyer and didn't want to see myself as a bald fat
attorney in my 50s never having gone for it. It was a pleasure to
be involved in something where everyone's going for it. I don't
have that nagging `what if . . .?' phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``O Positive gave it everything we had,'' Herlihy says. The Mama
Kin gig should ``be fun _ to do it without the pressure of the
business and do it for the joy. It's not like we're going in for
root canals. Having had some distance (from the material) gave me a
chance to approach the lyrics anew and not just sing them verbatim
or be on emotional auto-pilot. The material still stands up and it
is a joy to sing the songs and lose myself in them. It's good to
pick up on the love of it. I've almost come back to square one: Do
it for fun.'' It's a good feeling, Herlihy adds, ``not being hung
up on the holy grail of the record deal, a blessed relief not to be
subliminally fixated.''

COHOES SAVINGS HOPES TO RAISE UP TO $80.5M THROUGH IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COHOES, N.Y. _ Cohoes Savings Bank hopes to raise $59.5 million
to $80.5 million through its initial offering of stock and may use
the money to build new branches or purchase other financial service
firms.
</P>
<P>
   While that may seem a hefty amount, it indicates what a
different world it is for banks ``going public'' now than it was in
the spring, when Cohoes Savings announced its intention to convert
from a mutual institution owned by depositors to a stock
institution owned by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Then, bank President Harry L. Robinson said he hoped the stock
offering would raise more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appraisal is based on the (stock) market, and the market
has re-valued bank stocks,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the same devaluation of bank stock caused Cohoes
Savings to cancel plans in October to purchase SFS Bancorp Inc.,
parent of Schenectady Federal Savings Bank. The purchase was
originally intended to coincide with Cohoes Savings' stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks were flying high in the spring but were pummeled
when the market took a dive between August and October. Most have
rebounded some, but have not reached the peaks they held in the
spring, said Kevin Timmons, senior banking analyst for First Albany
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes perfect sense that (Cohoes Savings officials) would
expect to raise less than they would last May,'' Timmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Data the company issued in its offering prospectus suggest its
$10-a-share asking price might be a good deal. Its estimated book
value is $15.78 a share using a midpoint of 7 million shares sold.
</P>
<P>
   Depositors on record as of March 1997, trustees and officers of
the bank were mailed information on the offering last month,
Robinson said. They will be offered the stock first, through noon
on Dec. 16, with other depositors and the general public getting
dibs only if the shares aren't snatched up.
</P>
<P>
   Cohoes Savings has left open the possibility of issuing as many
as 9.3 million shares, to raise a total of $93 million, pending
regulatory approval. Whatever the total amount raised, the offering
must be approved by depositors as well as state and federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using the money for growth, the bank intends to
fund a charitable foundation with 3 percent of the proceeds from
the sale. It will also fund a ``Recognition and Retention Plan''
that grants stock to officers, with $2.5 million to $3.3 million of
the proceeds. Such plans are fairly common in initial public
offerings of bank stock, Timmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a financial or business interest in your own
business ... you are going to perform, and you are going to stay,''
Robinson said. ``The purpose is to make (officers) owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Other employees will be offered the ability to buy shares
through an employee stock ownership plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the newly
formed Cohoes Bancorp Inc. and intends eventually to trade on the
Nasdaq National Market System under the symbol COHB. Cohoes is
located north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of September, Cohoes Savings had assets of $551
million. It operates 17 full-service banking branches, and focuses
its business on residential mortgage lending.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Once again, Xu Jin is watching as her father is taken
from her.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, she was eight years old, standing in her
nightgown as Chinese soldiers dragged him off in the middle of the
night. What's wrong, she asked him. He smiled, trying to comfort
her. Nothing's wrong, he said, go back to sleep. The next day, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 years, she lived without him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Xu, 26, watched on the news as her father, Xu Wenli,
one of China's leading dissidents, was dragged to prison in Beijing
this week. Xu is in Boston, where she is a graduate student at
Boston University, studying fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's crime: Creating a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised,'' Xu said in an interview Thursday, her
eyes brimming with tears. ``He kept a bag filled with things like
his toothbrush behind the door. He expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Carr, chairman of the advisory board for Harvard's Human
Rights Initiative, compares Xu Wenli to Nelson Mandela. Xu Jin said
Mandela is a friend of her father's, and said the two men agree
with the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she spent much of her childhood without her father's
direct presence, Xu said his letters to her, and his example,
taught her about standing up for your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his footsteps, she wrote a letter to the Chinese
government this week, condemning them for her father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has ideas about democracy and freedom but he has no
soldiers and no secret police,'' she wrote. ``He cannot hurt you.
Let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu can't go home to be with her mother, He Xintong, because she
fears she will not be allowed to leave China again. Xintong can't
come to Boston to be with her daughter because she fears she won't
be allowed to return to China. Xu is an only child, and her mother
is very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Xu attends school in Boston because she is forbidden from
attending universities in China. ``It's not a written law,'' she
said. ``But it's understood that because of who my father is, I'm
not to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Xu recalled a very happy early
childhood. She remembered marching with her father in protests, and
dancing and entertaining adults who had gathered at her family's
house to hand-write and hand-publish a pro-democracy magazine
called April 5th Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always lots of people in the house,'' Xu said,
smiling with the memory. ``It was quite wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's father was born and raised in Southern China, one of five
children. His father died when he was nine years old. Raised
alternately by his mother, an older sister, and his grandmother, Xu
Wenli became very interested in politics and history while he was
in high school, according to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Xu Wenli made the decision
not to attend college, which broke his mother's heart. But he
believed ``he would learn more by studying the government and
talking to people,'' his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He served five years in the Chinese army, and then took a job as
an electrician at a factory in Beijing, where he met He Xintong, an
accountant, fell in love, and married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Xu Wenli became involved with a fledgling democracy
movement, his daughter said. He began producing the magazine in his
house, and his daughter remembers how happy he seemed when he would
go with his wife and daughter to the central wall in Beijing to
sell the magazine on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Xu Wenli's friend Wei Ginsheng put
up a poster asking for democracy. He was arrested. Xu Wenli
organized a group of people to sneak a tape recorder into the
trial, and then published a transcript of the trial to show it was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's father was charged with stealing state secrets, and
taken away. It was a full year before Xu Jin or her mother even
knew if he was alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother took me to every prison, everywhere she could think
of where he might be, asking for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want
her to know how scared I was, so when I started to feel afraid, I'd
say I was going to go outside to look at the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first arrest, Xu Jin said, her elementary school
teacher harassed her, humiliated her in class and made sure ``I
didn't laugh so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's middle and high school teachers were more
understanding, she said. Nonetheless, she grew up very alone. Her
mother worked three jobs. After school, Xu came home to an empty
house. She had no close friends, because she could not let anyone
know about the truth of her father's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them he was on a business trip,'' she said. ``It
seemed safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu and her mother were allowed to visit her father in prison
every two months, for 40 minutes, with the exception of three years
in which he was allowed no visitors. It was the only human contact
he had for 12 years, as his captors were not allowed to speak to
him. For much of his sentence he was kept in a room ``not much
wider or longer than a coffin''.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Xu saw her father after his arrest, she said he
was huddled on the floor of a large room where 20 or so prison
officials sat at a large table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to talk about politics, or the trial,'' she
said. ``And my mother wasn't allowed to touch him. When I was
little I could sit on his lap, but after a while that stopped
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Xu Wenli was released to house arrest after the United
States government demanded his release in exchange for economic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   When her father emerged from the prison, he was a changed man,
physically. ``His hair was white, his teeth were rotted out,'' said
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit, however, remained intact. ``He just started talking
and wouldn't stop,'' his daughter said. ``I had cooked a whole
table of his favorite foods, but he wouldn't stop talking to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu had only a few months with her father after his release from
prison before she was to head to the United States, to attend Bard
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he's against college,'' she said. ``But he understood.
He wants me to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu hopes to finish school, take a job in graphic design
somewhere in the United States, and continue to support her mother.
But her father's activism has also worn off on her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Chinese government, Xu said that computers
confiscated from her father's house were bought with money she
earned ``by washing dishes and waiting tables. Why are you afraid
of me and my father?''

SAN FRANCISCO SEES STRAINS IN TIES WITH BANKING PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Top city officials are discussing whether San
Francisco should sever its long relationship with BankAmerica
because of concern over the apparent corporate culture clash
resulting from the bank's recent merger with NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Louise Renne and three members of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors say that an unfamiliar management
style at the bank _ now based in Charlotte, N.C., the home of
NationsBank _ appears insensitive to San Francisco tradition,
culture and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they care a whit about San Francisco,'' Renne
said of the Charlotte-based leadership. ``They certainly do not
care a whit about the women executives who work for the bank, and I
don't think they care a whit about anything other than lining their
own pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent developments, including the purging of key San
Francisco-based executives, especially women, and concerns about
future community lending practices, have roiled officials here.
</P>
<P>
   The bank merger took effect in September.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of possibly cutting ties to a bank that has been a
venerable institution in San Francisco is not taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is like `The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,''' said
city Supervisor Michael Yaki. ``They have kept the bank's name but
the eyes looking out are not the eyes of the old Bank of America.
If we determine this is not the Bank of America that we want to be
a partner and not reflective of the diversity and spirit of San
Francisco or California, why would we want to do business with that
bank?''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran spokesman for the bank in San Francisco, Peter
Magnani, said the concern stemmed from nervousness about change and
``fearing the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are up against perceptions. We are doing what we can to
allay fears and convince people we are going to do the right
thing,'' Magnani said.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal ordinances hold that only the city's two major
full-service banks, BankAmerica and Wells Fargo, can be its banker,
said Treasurer Susan Leal. BankAmerica has handled almost all the
city's business for some 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a relationship that is almost like Siamese twins, over
80 years,'' she said. ``But I have some concerns about having such
a close relationship with a bank that is no longer headquartered in
San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Leal, responsible for depositing and investing municipal funds,
added: ``I would like to bring in some competitors and spread the
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the frayed relationship with BankAmerica could
benefit Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, San Francisco has favored Bank of America with a
majority of its business, but it has not been our decision. It has
been the city's decision,'' said Daphne Larkin, vice president for
public relations at Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica is also facing scrutiny from state officials. Two
Democratic members of the Assembly Banking Committee, Louis Papan,
the chairman, and Kerry Mazzoni, said Thursday that if the new bank
did not demonstrate a commitment to California, they might argue
for moving state banking business, worth billions of dollars, away
from BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a last resort,'' Papan said, ``but it's up to them to
have us understand the direction this bank is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about women executives leaving the bank. I
don't know how they do things in North Carolina, but we have made
tremendous strides in reducing the gender gap here.''
</P>
<P>
   Six top women executives at BankAmerica resigned recently after
their jobs were given to male NationsBank executives. Magnani said
most of those women were offered ``very important positions in the
new company and they made decisions to leave for personal
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the women, and many men, too, in the aftermath of the
merger debated whether to accept jobs or ``choose really lucrative
severance packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mazzoni said, there is a perception that the new
bank is demonstrating a culture in which men and women are not
treated equally, ``and that is very problematic for the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is particularly serious when you consider the
demographics and the political awareness of the Bay Area _ a highly
educated population, (with) educated women (and) great
understanding about the glass ceiling,'' Mazzoni said. ``Losing
that many women leaves a very bad impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Unease about the merger has lingered through the year and became
acute in October when BankAmerica President David Coulter resigned.
He had been on a track to eventually replace NationsBank chief
executive Hugh McColl Jr.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's relationship with the bank already was strained
by a lawsuit with BankAmerica, settled last month, that accused the
bank of defrauding taxpayers while it was trustee of 14,000 bond
issues worth $15 billion from 1978 to 1992 _ well before the merger
with NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that was settled, many of us were hoping for a fresh
start between the city and the bank,'' Renne said. ``But when I see
a whole generation of women executives being lopped off by the
bank, I can tell you my good will goes down the drain. I think it
is outrageous.''

MOVING MONEY INTO IRA WOULD BROADEN OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 6, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'm 41 and I changed jobs about seven years ago. I currently
have two 401(k) accounts, each worth about $85,000. I'm looking to
retire at age 65. Up until recently, both of the 401(k)s were doing
pretty well, but with current market conditions, I'm wondering how
I should be allocating my funds. In the 401(k) with my current
employer, I have $60,000 in T. Rowe Price Equity Index 500 fund and
the balance in the T. Rowe Price Value fund. The 401(k) from the
previous employer is with Fidelity and has $45,000 in Fidelity
Equity Income II and the rest in Spartan U.S. Equity Index fund. I
contribute about $6,000 a year to the current 401(k). I no longer
contribute to the Fidelity account. Should I retain it or roll it
over into the Price account? Do I have the right mix of funds? What
do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   P.O., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the state of the current market is a good cause
for a change in portfolio allocations, but I do think that you
should be more broadly diversified, whatever the market condition.
Of the four funds you're holding, three are large-cap stock funds,
the exception being T. Rowe Price Value, which holds a mid-cap
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In your letter, you list the various options available in the
two 401(k) plans. My suggestion would be to provide yourself with
an unlimited menu of options by moving the money that's now in the
old 401(k) at Fidelity to a rollover IRA account. You could stay
with Fidelity through this move, and then avail yourself of all
Fidelity's investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, I suggest you retain half of your total
savings in the large-cap market sector, dividing the balance among
international, mid-cap, small-cap and health care positions. You
would need to make no change in the holdings of the current 401(k)
with Price. If you chose Fidelity for the rollover IRA, you could
then put $25,000 in Fidelity Equity Income II and create three
positions of $20,000 each -- in Fidelity Select Health Care,
Fidelity Overseas, and Fidelity Low-Priced Stock.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to maintain the portfolio balance, you should alter the
allocation of your ongoing contributions to the current 401(k) with
T. Rowe Price. I suggest that you direct that 50 percent of the
contributions go to the Price Equity Index 500 fund and the balance
be evenly divided among Price's Value, International Stock, and
Small-Cap Value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you maintain savings at the current rate and if
you achieve average annual returns of 10 percent from your
retirement portfolio, the accounts would have a value of $2,426,789
by the time you are 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 49 and self-employed. I have nothing in place for
retirement and no savings other than $18,000 invested in Vanguard
Windsor II fund and $180,000 in Janus fund. In my mind, this is my
retirement pool. I will also be eligible for Social Security
benefits. I have been adding about $2,000 a month to these funds,
and I can continue this until September of next year, when the
first of my four children goes to college. I then will have a child
in college for each of the next 12 years, so I will stop the $2,000
contributions during that time. Assuming I will not be able to add
much to my present savings, do you recommend any change? I expect
to retire in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   K.N., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, you'll want to read the letter above, because
your situation is much like P.O.'s -- only moreso. You have 100
percent of your holdings in large-cap stocks, and the fact that the
Windsor II portfolio is value-oriented doesn't give me much
comfort. I suggest you reduce your reliance on the large caps to a
maximum of 60 percent of the portfolio, and I would be happier if
it were 50 percent. That's particularly so since you're a few years
P.O's senior, and should want to moderate risk. If you follow that
line of thinking, you might go further still, putting 50 percent in
large caps, 10 percent in each of the smaller market sectors
outlined to P.O., and finishing with a final 10 percent in a solid
balanced fund, of which Janus Balanced and Vanguard Balanced Index
funds are good examples.
</P>
<P>
   Second, unless you left something out, it appears all of this
money is in taxable accounts. If that's the case, I suggest you
begin the process of moving money into tax- deferred accounts. As a
self-employed person, you could establish a SEP-IRA or a Keogh
retirement savings plan that would defer taxes on the portfolio
accumulation until after the funds are withdrawn in retirement.
Another alternative, if you qualify, would be to move the
maximum.$2,000 a year into Roth IRA accounts. If you took the
SEP-IRA or Keogh alternatives, it would reduce your current tax
liability; if you went with the Roth, it would have no effect on
current taxes, but all the money would be tax-free when withdrawn
in retirement. The point is that as long as you have the earnings
to qualify for such plans, you can make the contributions -- the
funds can be withdrawn from these taxable accounts and then
reinvested in the same holdings, but now having a tax-deferred
status.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this important? Well, if you follow the plan you outline,
adding $2,000 a month for nine months and then leaving the pool to
grow with no contributions for another 171 months, assuming average
10 percent annual growth the accumulation would be $900,665.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of this accumulation, the internal growth
would have grown to about $80,000, and such growth is likely to
cause some fairly hefty tax bills -- perhaps hefty enough that at
some point you'd find you had to invade the principal to satisfy
our mutual Uncle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 39 years old and my wife is 42 and we have children aged
three years and six years. We recently sold our house and cash, and
we have the $150,000 proceeds of that transaction. Because of plans
to relocate to Israel in a year or two, we are not sure what type
of investment is best for us now and for the future. What do you
suggest? M.I., Hillsborough, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest extreme caution. Certainly with such a short
investment time frame, you don't even want to think about stocks or
high-yield bonds or anything that provides the prospect of
substantial returns. I'll suggest four options, although I think
the risks associated with one of them probably outweigh the
potential for gains. The slowest track would be a money market
fund. I called Vanguard to get representative yields from various
fixed-income funds, but you can find similar funds and similar
yields at most major mutual fund families.
</P>
<P>
   As this is written, Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund provides
a yield of 4.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping from the very slow track to the slow track, Vanguard's
Short-Term Corporate Bond fund offered a 5.84 percent yield. And
the fastest mover in this slow race is Vanguard GNMA, with a 6.52
percent yield. But to pick up those 68 basis points of interest (a
basis point is one one-hundredth of one percent), you are moving
from short- term investments into the intermediate term, and
assuming the attendant risk. For my money, the 5.84 percent of the
short-term bond fund looks like the best choice of these three.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you wanted to make things simpler still and get
federal insurance on your investment to boot, you could shop around
for the best CD rate available. As this is written, the nation's
best rate on a one-year CD was 5.5 percent. You can check in the
business pages of the New York Times to get the highest rate
currently offered among the nation's banks and the name of the
institution offering it. The advantage of a CD over the short-term
bond fund is not, in my mind, a question of risk but the fact that
with the CD you will have your rate locked in. You could then asses
your situation after the year's up, deciding whether to reinvest
for another year, for six months, or whatever seems best at that
time. But remember, if you go for a one-year CD and then suddenly
decide that you want to make your move to Israel in nine months,
you'll face a premature withdrawal penalty which will probably more
than wipe out any advantage you may have achieved over the money
market or short-term bond fund.

GIRL WITH HIV ADMITTED TO BROWNIE TROOP AFTER SEVERAL REJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. _ Eight-year-old Quashawn Donovan has been
placed with a Queensbury Brownie troop after being denied admission
to several troops last month because she is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   For James Caligiuri, a nurse who leads the Brownie troop that
includes his daughter, Quashawn's medical condition is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the education to deal with it, and I feel comfortable
dealing with it,'' Caligiuri said Wednesday. ``The HIV routes of
transmission do not occur at a Brownie meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Quashawn Donovan, the adopted daughter of Dianne and Timothy
Donovan of Queensbury, was invited to join troops in several
upstate New York towns, but they were too far from home, according
to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Quashawn was aware that she was denied admission to some troops
because of her HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was her first lesson in HIV fear and discrimination,''
said Dianne Donovan, who estimated her daughter received 11
rejections for various reasons and that several were because of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Adirondack Girl Scout Council held an HIV
training program for troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train literally hundreds of people a year, whether in first
aid or programming or anything of interest to leaders and their
girls,'' said Kit Huggard, executive director of the Adirondack
Council, which has 3,500 girls in 375 troops led by 1,100 adults.
``You can be assured that this (HIV training) will be incorporated
into all of our training for our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV _ the human immunodeficiency virus _ can lead to AIDS, an
affliction in which the virus weakens the immune system, subjecting
the body to serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through
sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood
products, but also can be passed to children from infected mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Huggard said that like other girls, Quashawn had been on a
waiting list to be placed with a troop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid needs their schedules catered to,'' Huggard said.
``Every year there are kids we can't place. HIV was probably in the
mix of her being denied a troop, but there are other things
involved, like finding adults to run the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Quashawn was adopted by the Donovan's when she was 2 1/2 after
joining the family when she was eight months old; she has a brother
Danny, now 10, adopted when he was 4 who is also HIV-positive.
Donovan credited a family environment and drug cocktails with
keeping the children alive.
</P>
<P>
   Danny was admitted to a Cub Scout troop this fall, even though
his parents included his HIV status in the registration paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more stressful living with a secret, but when
something like this happens you can understand why parents don't
let their kids go public,'' Donovan said.

STUDY SAYS GENE MAY BE KEY TO SPEED OF AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As many as 13 percent of people may carry a
genetic variation that helps HIV along its deadly path, speeding
its progression to full-blown AIDS by as much as five years,
researchers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their study, published the journal Science, is the latest in a
recent string of discoveries of genetic variations in patients with
the human immunodeficiency virus that help explain, at least in
part, why some people rapidly develop AIDS while others can carry
the virus for more than 20 years and not develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Several drug companies are reportedly looking into developing
therapies for HIV based on the insights gained from figuring out
why some people are able to resist the infection and others aren't.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery focuses on a gene's so-called ``promoter
region,'' which supplies the code to manufacture a receptor that
sits on the outside of certain immune cells. The receptor acts as a
gateway for a newly acquired virus to enter those cells, where it
sets up shop, copying itself as many as a billion times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the virus breaks out and begins killing immune cells,
leading to the destruction of the immune system and thus to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter region of the gene helps control how often and when
it is turned on and begins manufacturing the protein for the
receptor. The gene is called CCR5.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think is that it makes a little bit more CCR5,'' said
Stephen J. O'Brien, of the National Cancer Institute, one of the
authors of the new study. ``It simply says, `Hey, Mr. Virus, take
over. Here's more doorways to get in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Using genetic profiles of more than 2,600 infected people,
O'Brien and his colleagues found that 10 to 17 percent of those who
develop AIDS within 3 1/2 years after infection had a variation in
that region of the gene. The average time between infection and
AIDS is about 10 years, based on data collected before
anti-retroviral drugs were in widespread use, according to Susan P.
Buchbinder of the San Francisco Department of Public Health,
another of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found the genetic variation appeared in 12.7
percent of Caucasians studied and in 6.7 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier work by O'Brien and his colleagues found that another
genetic variation in the CCR5 gene had an opposite effect _ it
conferred a great deal of resistance to HIV, probably because it
leads the body to make less of the receptor, called a chemokine
receptor.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent work by O'Brien and others on a separate gene that
also codes for a chemokine receptor has been linked to retarded HIV
infection. And chemokines, which are immune-system molecules, have
been shown to block HIV infection, presumably because they sit in
the receptor sites that the virus needs as gateways to infect
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we tease out the genetic variables that determine whether
someone progresses rapidly or whether someone is resistant to
progression, the answer keeps coming back to chemokine or chemokine
receptors,'' said Warner Greene, a University of California at San
Francisco professor and director of the Gladstone Institute of
Immunology and Virology. ``It's clearly telling us that chemokine
receptors are an excellent drug target. If we could block them,
we'd be in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS _ the acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is an
affliction in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the
body to serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cable and sneakers and day-care providers; flex
time and soft drinks and cohabitation; movies and Web sites and
cell phones that ring, these are a few of our favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not already obvious, the federal government
confirmed it Dec. 4 with the delivery of its massive, annual
Statistical Abstract of the United States, the official national
snapshot, circa 1998, of who we are, what we like, how we live and
work, and where we spend money.
</P>
<P>
   The tome, compiled by the Census Bureau from dozens of sources
using the latest statistics available, features all of the old
standards (``Death Rates, by leading causes'') as well as about 100
new charts of turn-of-the-century territory, from the number of
telecommuters to one with the provocative title ``Number of Male
Sex Partners in Lifetime, by Selected Characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of America that emerges is of a population that by
and large is living well (it cannot get big enough homes or
vehicles) _ if not living a bit beyond its means (1.2 million
personal bankruptcies filed last year). It is enjoying every fruit
of the technological revolution, from answering machines (58
million own them) to ATM cards (11 billion transactions in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   According to the abstract, Americans say they are observing
traditional and community values by attending religious services
(60 percent say they belong to organized religions) and
volunteering, which 49 percent of adults profess to do every week.
</P>
<P>
   The data also tend to confirm some of the most important trends
of the decade. In 1997, 63.6 percent of married women with children
under age 6 worked full time or part time, compared with 18.6
percent in 1960. Some 60 percent of the nation's children under 6
get out-of-home child care, with nearly one-third of them in
day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-quarter of all American workers, men and women
alike, now take advantage of some flexible working arrangements,
according to 1997 data. Another big trend is the growth of
home-based businesses. In 1997 more than 4.1 million people were
self-employed at home, more than half of them men. In 1991, 19.9
million Americans were able to do job-related work at home,
primarily by telecommuting. In 1997 the number was 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest occupations are computer specialists and computer
engineers. The data book projects both fields will grow by more
than 100 percent by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Internet is by far the biggest national craze. More
than 62 million Americans now have access to the Internet at home
or at work, and 43 million say they have used it in the last 30
days. Some 35 million Americans own personal computers, and the
percentage of schools with Internet access is at 78 percent,
projected to grow to 95 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gadgets are big. According to the abstract, the number of
cellular phone subscribers has jumped to 55 million today from 5
million in 1990. Some 63 million Americans pay for cable TV, and 79
million have VCRs. People in this country spent $10.5 billion on
computer software in 1996 and $9.9 billion on compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love their leisure. In 1997, 66 percent of adults
attended movies, 41 percent watched a sporting event, and 57
percent went to an amusement park. Travel and tennis and bowling
are up; boating and playing golf were off slightly in 1996, but
going to professional baseball games and watching college women's
basketball are attracting bigger crowds than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Facts little known about Americans, outside of the federal
abstract, are that:
</P>
<P>
   --Herb gardening is more popular than lawn care.
</P>
<P>
   --10 percent of all adults sing in groups, 5 percent go to the
opera, and 1 percent play classical music.
</P>
<P>
   --31 percent of all households own a dog, 27 percent have a cat,
and 4.6 percent have pet birds.
</P>
<P>
   --Americans made 734 million visits to doctors in 1996, an
average of 2.8 visits per person.
</P>
<P>
   Health, appearance, and personal care are near obsessions with
many Americans, the data show. Last year they spent $65 billion on
prescription drugs, $57 billion on personal care products, and $262
billion on clothes and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the same year only 14 percent of people said they engaged
in regular and vigorous physical exercise, and 50 percent said they
drank alcohol regularly. Americans spent $50 billion on tobacco
products, and consumed, per capita, 51 gallons of soft drinks. In
1994, 34 percent of all men and 36 percent of women were rated
overweight, according to the data, and another 25 percent of the
men and 44 percent of the women believed they were overweight, even
when they were not.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also somewhat accident-prone. In 1995
emergency-room treatment was required for 87,000 injuries related
to hand and power saws; 66,000 trampoline accidents; and 978,000
mishaps on stairs, according to the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's concern with sexually transmitted diseases and the
focus on fertility treatments this year opened another area of data
analysis by the Census Bureau, which decides what goes into the
abstract, said Lars Johanson, the bureau statistician in charge of
the data book.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the abstract includes data on the number of
unmarried women who have had intercourse in the last 12 months
(12.7 million, or 60 percent of all unmarried women.) Among that
group, 31 percent reported that a partner used a condom every time
during intercourse, while 32 percent said condoms were never used.
</P>
<P>
   Among all women 15 to 44 years old, 41.1 percent have cohabited
with a man outside of marriage, and 7 percent said they were
currently cohabitating, the data show. As for male sexual partners,
23.5 percent of women in that age bracket said they had had one;
12.3 percent said they had had two; 8.1 percent said five partners;
and 15.5 percent said 10 or more partners.

GATEWAY, DELL RAISE BAR FOR NOTEBOOKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to build a notebook computer _ make it
smaller and cut out features, or make it bigger and sacrifice
portability.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is a compromise between these two extremes. In
my endless quest for the perfect notebook, there are candidates at
both ends of the spectrum, but the trade-offs inherent in each
design usually mean no model wins the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway and Dell Computer Corp., the two top direct PC
companies, have taken opposite approaches. Each works in its own
way, but each also offers evidence of the built-in drawbacks to the
two approaches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Solo 3100 _ $3,000, Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the rather boring Solo name that Gateway gives to its
notebook computers. The code name for this portable while it was
under development was FireAnt, and that label was trotted out for a
launch-week blitz of advertising. The moniker FireAnt was meant to
invoke something small but powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer-makers in South Dakota have never had to
deal with fire ants. For us here in Texas, the nasty critters are
not something to take lightly. Any parent who's heard the screams
of his or her child after stepping barefooted in a fire ant mound
isn't going to have warm, fuzzy thoughts when they hear this name.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this is indeed a small but powerful portable
computer. The Solo 3100 is about an inch thick and has a slightly
smaller footprint than most other full-featured notebook machines.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a mobile version of the
300-megahertz Intel Pentium II chip, 64 megabytes of memory, a
four-gigabyte hard drive, 56K voice and fax modem, a 12.1-inch
active matrix screen, USB and infrared ports and a Trackpoint-style
pointing device. It comes with an external floppy that attaches via
the parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its small size, the 3100 has a full-sized keyboard that
is comfortable to use. Unlike some of the competitive, ultra-thin
portable models, such as the Sony Vaio 505, the keys haven't been
reduced in size, even by a millimeter. Touch-typists will love it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the small screen size, which is necessary
because of the smaller size of the case. The screen has a native
resolution of 800-by-600 pixels, which is fine for the most common
uses _ word processing, e-mail, Web surfing, spreadsheets. It's
also extremely bright, even in low-power mode.
</P>
<P>
   The 3100 I used came with a DVD-ROM drive. The DVD decoding was
handled by a PC card that fits into the computer's lone PC-card
slot. You can connect an adapter to the card, then connect it to a
TV set, turning the 3100 into a DVD movie player.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life was very good for a Pentium II-based notebook; I
routinely got three hours of power out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the FireAnt isn't the perfect notebook, though it
comes very close. It has only one PC-card slot, which means with
the DVD-decoder card in place, you can't add a network adapter
card, and you can't insert a Type III PC card, which takes up two
full Type II slots.
</P>
<P>
   It's also surprisingly heavy for a machine of its size _ 5.2
pounds. That's because of its oversized battery, which provides the
previously mentioned long battery life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inspiron 7000 _ $3,500, Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   If the Solo 3100 is a fine example of how to do a small computer
right, the Inspiron 7000 shows how to do a small computer ... big _
and still get it right.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first notebook computer to come with a 15-inch
active matrix display. That's about the viewable area of many
17-inch desktop monitors. For those who rely on their portable
computers for multimedia presentations, it's a dream machine.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's also a very big and heavy one. This is not a
notebook computer that you'll enjoy lugging through airports on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 300-megahertz Pentium II chip, 64
megabytes of memory, an eight-gigabyte hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive
and a 56K voice and fax modem. It uses a flat touchpad for a
pointing device, which took some tweaking before I was able to get
its sensitivity settings right.
</P>
<P>
   The star of this system, though, is the screen. It's a gorgeous
display, bright and crisp, and playing DVD-based movies on it is
nothing short of spectacular. If you've got kids, a minivan, a
penchant for long trips and a dashboard-lighter power adapter, this
could be the answer to a parent's prayer! Crank up the Disney and
let 'er rip!
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you'll have to be a muscular parent. The 7000
weighs nearly 9 pounds with the 15-inch screen. Smaller 13.3- and
14.1-inch displays only take it down to the 8-pound range.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the 7000 has a massive footprint _ I had
difficulty fitting it into my notebook carrying case. That's
compounded by the fact that the screen, when closed, extends about
a quarter inch beyond the confines of the case. It's like having a
cap on it that's slightly oversized.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is not great as you'd expect in a system with as
big a display as this. I got two hours at best, and if I used the
DVD drive at all, that dropped quickly to below 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the kind of machine you'd buy if you need long
battery life, anyway. It's a computer for people who need a
quality, full-sized display and no-compromise power in a portable
system.
</P>
<P>
   Being in good physical condition wouldn't hurt, either.

LAW UPBEAT ON 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRIESTHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As he prepares to celebrate 25 years as a bishop
Saturday, it would be hard to say say that Cardinal Bernard Law has
slowed down much.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he hosted the bishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras to help
make sure that the devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch wasn't
forgotten here. Then he dashed off to spend 24 hours with hundreds
of priests of the archdiocese of Boston talking about the future of
the local church.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he was making plans to mark the anniversary of his
episcopacy this weekend. On Monday, he will fly to Cuba to preach
at the Havana Cathedral and give a speech to church activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of person who likes to get a lot of things done _
and not today, but Thursday,'' says Law, 67, sitting at a large
wooden conference table inside the sprawling cardinal's residence
atop a small hill in Boton's Brighton section.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Law, who was born in Mexico and lived in
several Latin American countries before coming to the United States
to attend Harvard, was made bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, a
sprawling diocese of under 50,000 Catholics in a southern corner of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Law is the leader of more than 2 million Catholics across
greater Boston and one of the most influential voices in the Roman
Catholic Church in this country.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fiercely loyal ally of Pope John Paul II whose
unwavering and vocal defense of church teachings has brought
criticism from more liberal church voices.
</P>
<P>
   But through it, say supporters and foes, one trait has served
Law well _ an ability to disagree without being disagreeable. It
has proved especially valuable in one area that Law has made a a
top priority _ improving relations in the city among people of
diverse racial, ethnic, religious and economic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to do that is not to be a bishop,'' said Law in a
wide-ranging interview. ``I didn't dream any of this up. Christ
did. I am very grateful for the great personal relationships that I
have with people who don't always agree with me and with whom I
don't always agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's edition of the Pilot, the official archdiocesan
newspaper, is entirely dedicated to Law and includes tributes from
churchmen and churchwomen from across the world.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes complimentary commentaries from the Reverend
Diane Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of
Churches, an organization of Protestant denominations, and from
Leonard Zakim, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   When he was first diagnosed with cancer, writes Zakim, one of
the first persons who called with words of solace and encouragement
was Law.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 years after he was named to head the archdiocese,
Law says he still has the same enthusiasm for the job that he did
when first stepped inside the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on a
winter's day in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Even through the hard times _ having to close parishes,
confronting the explosive issue of clergy sexual abuse and
accusations that the church failed to properly deal with the issue,
and struggling with a dwindling number of priests _ Law says he
remains optimistic about the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows I've had a lot of life experiences,'' says Law, 68.
``I've dealt with a lot of issues and there certainly wasn't a `how
to' book for bisihops that told you how to go through those things.
You do it on basis of experience, you consult with others, and then
you pray.''

EASY WAY TO SORT TEXT IN HTML DOCUMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do you know of any way to alphabetize links by title within
an HTML document? I have a listing of around 275 links on a U2 site
that I run, and I've simply added the newest ones to the top of the
page since starting the site back in 1994. Now I'd like the links
to be sorted alphabetically for easier browsing. However, I've been
unable to find any program at all for this purpose, and doing it by
hand would take hours upon hours of dragging and dropping.
</P>
<P>
   A. While I usually don't recommend using an everyday word
processor for creating and editing HTML documents, here's where one
comes in quite handy.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent versions of both Corel's WordPerfect and
Microsoft Word will read and write in HTML. And both include very
powerful routines for sorting lines of text.
</P>
<P>
   Open your U2 page in either one of these programs and find the
sort routine (look in the Help file for either program) and tell it
to run an alphabetical sort.
</P>
<P>
   When it is completed, be sure to do a Save As and tell the
program to save in HTML format.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of cleanup you may need to do _ both Word and
WordPerfect will add HTML tags to your document, presuming to be
``cleaning up'' your code. You may need to go into the document
with an HTML editor and remove these if they cause formatting
problems for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently my Microsoft Outlook Express in-box started sorting
in subject order. How do I get it back to date/time sequence?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is one of these interesting little features of
Windows-style operating systems that many people don't use and
don't notice until their settings come undone.
</P>
<P>
   To get back to your favorite sorting scheme, go to the in-box in
Outlook Express and look at the header categories that run across
the top of your message list _ they are actually buttons you can
click.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Received. Click on that, and it will sort your
message by date and time. Click once, and it is sorted in
descending order; click again, and it changes to ascending order.
</P>
<P>
   You can use these buttons to sort by subject, sender and other
categories. In fact, there are similar buttons that show up in many
lists in both the Macintosh and Windows platforms. For example,
open My Computer in Windows 95/98/NT, then open your hard drive's
icon. Click on View, then choose Details. Those fat file icons will
turn into tiny ones, each with details about its size, properties,
file type, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Click the Size button, and you can instantly see which are the
largest files in that folder. Want to know which are possibly
expendable text or temporary files? Click on any file with a TXT or
TMP extension, then click on the Type button, and all those files
will be brought together.
</P>
<P>
   You can even set up sortable, detailed lists in File Open and
Save dialog boxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where on your computer would you find the speed of the
microprocessor?
</P>
<P>
   A. The best place to find it is in your BIOS settings, which you
can access during the bootup procedure. Check your PC's manual to
see how to get into the BIOS setup screen, and be careful when you
do. Messing with these settings, if you don't know what you're
doing, can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   Another resource is a shareware utility called SiSoft Sandra,
which can give you all kinds of info about your system. Get it at
www.sisoftware.de-mon.co.uk/sandra/. &QL;

A TALE OF HIDDEN EMOTIONS SLOWLY EMERGES IN `THE EEL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Eel,'' the middle-aged Yamashita (Koji Yakusho) is what
the Japanese call a salaryman. He does white-collar work in an
anonymous skyscraper, takes a long train commute home to a pretty,
much-younger wife. He is quiet, placid.
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita has received a series of anonymous letters accusing
his wife of taking a man to her bed while Yamashita is out on
apparently his only recreation, night fishing.
</P>
<P>
   One night he returns early and finds the accusations are true.
Yamashita stabs his wife to death. Salaryman to the end, he gets on
his bike, pedals to the police station and with his wife's blood
dripping from his fishing slicker, turns himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, taking from prison little beyond an eel he
has made into a pet, Yamashita is paroled to a small coastal
village. His parole officer is also a Shinto priest, who helps
Yamashita rehab an abandoned barbershop so he can follow the trade
he was taught in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced by his experience that emotions are profoundly
dangerous, Yamashita resolves to experience emotion as little as
possible. Anything he needs to say, he says to his eel. ``He
listens to what I say,'' Yamashita says. ``And he doesn't say what
I don't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   While fishing, Yamashita discovers a young woman who has
overdosed on sleeping pills in a suicide attempt. His first
instinct is flight _ he is, after all, a parolee under caution not
to get into any trouble. But he calls for aid.
</P>
<P>
   In gratitude, Keiko (Misa Shimuzu), who has sought shelter with
the priest and his wife from a difficult situation in Tokyo, asks
if she can be his assistant in the barbershop. He accepts, in
deference to the priest, but Keiko frightens him, especially when
she tries to become friends with him. She greatly resembles the
wife he killed (Shimuzu apparently plays both roles).
</P>
<P>
   Best keep his feelings to himself, and to his eel.
</P>
<P>
   Shohei Imamura, director and co-writer of ``The Eel,''
apprenticed to Yasijiro Ozu. Imamura's work is suffused in the
Japanese classicist tradition of painterly composition,
contemplative pacing, reference to nature and literary complexity
beneath still water.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko reaches out to Yamashita in a lovely, classic bit of
symbolism. As he goes down a canal leading into a bay for night
fishing, his boat passes under a small, arched bridge. Keiko says
she will prepare something for him to eat and wait with it on the
bridge. But Yamashita passes under the bridge without acknowledging
her.
</P>
<P>
   The film is beautifully acted in the Japanese style, which is
more intense than Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although it provides much of what we want in a film _ tension,
humor, empathy with the characters _ ``The Eel'' has the clock
speed of classic Eastern filmmaking. If you can make the
adjustment, you will likely find the film engrossing. &QL;

HOLLYWOOD HISTORIAN TELLS OF GHOST SIGHTINGS, STRANGE ENCOUNTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the new version of ``Psycho,'' director Gus Van
Sant has resurrected Norman Bates, the amiable murderer with mother
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the life-draining Norman, the knife-wielding Jason
or a stiff-legged Frankenstein's monster, Hollywood has always
liked a scary story.
</P>
<P>
   So from where springs all these horrific high jinks?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe central casting.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the City of Angels is congested with ghosts and scary
stories. Lovelorn suicides, ``accidental'' deaths and drug-induced
downfalls are a copious part of Tinseltown's history. In some
cases, traces of the past linger like the sulfuric perfume of an
extinguished match.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Hollywood historian Laurie Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson came to Hollywood in the 1970s as a twentysomething.
``I was trying to be an actress and was mostly being a waitress,''
explains the petite brunette.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was star-struck, but not by her celebrity pals at the
comedy club where she was honing her stand-up skills. No, she was
in awe of the city and the glamorous industry that gave it life.
The stories she collected were the basis of her first book
``Hollywood Heartbreak,'' which was published in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to old-timers, and there were always ghost
stories attached to these tales,'' Jacobson says.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction of her latest book ``Hollywood Haunted,''
she describes her first encounter with a ghost. It was in 1992 at
the famous Mann's Chinese Theater. A ghost, perhaps displeased with
her presence behind stage, began wildly shaking a velvet curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson has been shaking out ghost stories ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirits stick around for very human reasons,'' Jacobson says.
She believes that a person may be so attached to a loved one or
place that he sticks around after death. Other ghosts may be the
victims of crimes or a great injustice; they remain seeking
retribution or closure.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory relates to people who don't believe in an
afterlife. ``They become confused and just don't know where to
go,'' Jacobson explains.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas are shared by many, including Dr. Barry Taft, a
parapsychologist and self-described ``expert on things that go bump
in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal curiosity'' pushes Taft, who during his 30 years of
paranormal research has investigated more than 3,500 cases of
ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists. ``I do believe physical death
is just another change in life,'' says Taft, who is best known for
his work on the case on which the film ``The Entity'' is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantoms fill the skies around you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Hollywood is a hotbed of hauntings.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson recently led a group of jumpy journalists on a ghoul
tour sponsored by Infiniti. They rambled down Sunset Boulevard and
over Hollywood's hills in customized SUVs, chillingly labeled Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Although they saw no phantoms, they did hear some spirited
tales.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the ghosts in Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   You can start with the theaters. Celebrity or would-be celebrity
ghosts love to relive the best times of their mortal lives, and
they are just not interested in taking that final bow.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the Palace Theater, which opened as the Hollywood
Playhouse in 1927 and was the stage for ``Your Show of Shows,''
share many stories of apparitions, haunting music and numeric
messages left overnight on adding machines and cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard who had several strange after-hours encounters
once set a ghost trap at the theater. He put a plate on the floor
of the kitchen and then placed a wine glass on top of it. Later he
returned to the room only to find the plate resting atop the wine
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks away, Howard Hughes is believed to haunt the
Pantages Theater. Hughes moved his office into the art deco theater
in 1949 when he purchased RKO Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   People working in the theater today tell of seeing Hughes' ghost
in the hallways around his former office. Now a conference room, it
is oddly cold, and sometimes a faint breeze tinted with cigarette
smoke will emanate from the empty room.
</P>
<P>
   At Universal Studios, Lon Chaney Sr. is thought to haunt Stage
28, where ``Phantom of the Opera'' was shot. Universal, where the
films ``Dracula,'' ``Frankenstein'' and ``Psycho'' were filmed, is
a theme park as well as a studio. Its back-lot tram tour takes
visitors past the house from ``Psycho'' and the Bates Motel, where
visitors can get a glimpse of Norman Bates' famous ``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Jacobson says, a renovation project will awaken a
``sleeping'' ghost. Many a new owner has found his actions booed by
longtime spirits.
</P>
<P>
   After her death, Lucille Ball was spotted walking outside her
longtime home as it underwent renovations, Jacobson reports. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Argyle, a tony boutique hotel on Sunset Boulevard, made its
debut in 1929 as the Sunset Tower whose residents included Billie
Burke, Paulette Goddard and Howard Hughes. John Wayne even kept a
cow on his penthouse patio.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which has been featured in many films including
``Get Shorty'' and ``The Player,'' was renovated in the 1980s.
Spirits hate change, and they don't respect movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Argyle's Lara McGrath, martial artist
Jean-Claude Van Damme had a close encounter during a stay at the
hotel. The spirit so spooked the well-chiseled film star that Van
Damme ran through the lobby wearing just his boxer shorts and a
half-shaved face.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hollywood Roosevelt is the place to be for ghosts,
particularly the glamorous ones. The hotel is said to be haunted by
many spirits, including Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift.
</P>
<P>
   Built it 1927, it was the city's first prestige hotel. Its
Blossom Room hosted the first Academy Awards banquet in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Clift lived in the hotel for three months in 1952 during the
filming of ``From Here to Eternity.'' During his stay, Clift often
paced the short, narrow hallway near his room. He walked as he
rehearsed his lines and often paced as he practiced playing the
bugle _ a skill he needed for his role in the war drama.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowing guests today still call down to the front desk to fret
about someone playing a bugle in the hallway. Management is
reluctant to offer an explanation until the guest complains a
second time. (The hotel also has a couple of phantom children who
play noisily in the hallways, as well as a tuxedo-clad ghost who
enjoys playing the piano.) Clift's room, 928, has a couple of cold
spots, which often are associated with the presence of spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe's reflection or spirit has been seen appropriately in a
mirror at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When Monroe was trying to break into show business, she would
hang around the celebrity-filled hotel. She frequently could be
found perched on a lounge chair, sipping 5-cent sodas, around the
hotel's pool. When she became a star, she often stayed at the
hotel, occupying her favorite suite, 1200. She stayed so often that
she bought an antique full-length mirror for the room.
</P>
<P>
   It hung there until her death in 1962. In 1984 when the hotel
underwent a massive $12 million renovation, the mirror was found in
the basement. Its pedigree earned it a place in the ``new'' hotel,
and it was hung in the manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   But about two weeks before the hotel's grand reopening, an
employee who knew nothing of the mirror's history reported seeing
the reflection of a blonde in the mirror. The employee was startled
because when she turned to address the woman she was not there. Yet
the blonde's reflection was still very much in the mirror. Since
then several others have reported seeing Marilyn's image in the
mirror. They report that it is a sad-looking reflection.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Taft says, ``phantoms fill the skies,'' they also hang
around one particular corner of Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood and Sierra Bonita Avenue, three traffic accidents
in recent years have prompted some unusual claims by the drivers.
One man said a tomahawk was flying toward his windshield; another
swerved to miss a covered wagon; and yet another was shocked to see
Indians in war paint charging his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to the Californians to cope.
</P>
<P>
   At the Comedy Store, ghost stories are exchanged like badges of
honor. The well-known comedy club owned by Mitzi Shore (mother of
Paulie) originally was Ciro's, a hangout for mobsters, celebrities
and their hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I should be cordial and say hi to the ghosts,'' says
comic Cory Comeaux, sharing a story of being in the club after
hours when ``the place becomes Ciro's again.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Comeaux, he saw a headless man with top hat, who
tipped it and bowed. Also he saw dancers whirling around the dance
floor, and he heard glasses tinkling.
</P>
<P>
   Others do more than cope, explains Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   David North proudly boasts of living with Mae West, who died in
1980. North acquired her penthouse home at the Ravenswood
Apartments, and she apparently is still living there.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, according to Jacobson, North tossed a 105th birthday
party for the Brooklyn-born vaudeville and film star. He invited
both his friends and hers. In a photo taken at the party, a bosomy
apparition appears to be standing next to North and resting its
hand on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe West's famous quip should be ``It's not the ghost in your
life that counts. It's the life in your ghost.'' &QL;

`SHATTERED IMAGE' IS REAL _ REAL BAD, THAT IS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When casting about for something snide to say about a terrible
movie, you don't expect to find it in the film's publicity packet.
</P>
<P>
   With remarkable candor, the packet for ``Shattered Image''
characterizes it a ``thriller evoking every doppelganger film from
`Vertigo' to `The Double Life of Veronique.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I can't put it any better than that.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of these films that seeks to entertain us by asking,
``Ah, but what is real?''
</P>
<P>
   We're introduced to Jessie (Anne Parillaud) in Seattle as she
performs a murder-for-hire. She's a professional assassin,
specializing in men.
</P>
<P>
   Then we're introduced to Parillaud as another Jessie _ let's
call her Jessie Two _ waking up from a dream in which she was
Jessie One, the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Two, who has longer hair and doesn't wear as much makeup,
is the recent bride of Brian (William Baldwin), who, the film
suggests, might be a little too handsome for Jessie Two's good.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Two and Brian are just arriving in lush Jamaica for their
honeymoon. Jessie Two is an heiress, and Brian keeps noodling
Jessie Two for a bit of cash so he can make some can't-miss real
estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jessie One wakes up from a dream in which she was Jessie
Two, just arriving in Jamaica for her honeymoon. Jessie One has a
new gig, in which she's been hired to kill a Seattle antiques store
owner _ another William Baldwin named Brian! And the client is a
woman who has the same face as a woman Jessie Two met at the
Jamaican hotel!
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Duane Poole's tatty screenplay, this enterprise
evokes the cliches of every doppelganger film from ``Vertigo'' to
``The Double Life of ...'' is there an echo in here?
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ruiz's flaccid and mercilessly Eurostyle direction is
enough to consider raising cultural tariffs. The film is
cheaped-out and careless, from the inexpensive ham actors in small
roles to the firehose rainstorms that don't even make it to the
edges of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Parillaud does both Jessie One and Jessie Two in a monotone that
_ giving her first the doubt she's earned by being very good in the
original ``La Femme Nikita'' _ might have been a bad creative
decision. Or it could be sheer laziness.
</P>
<P>
   When Ruiz asked ``Ah, but what is real?'' I answered with
another question: ``What's playing in the next auditorium?''
</P>
<P>
   Not another word on this. Avoid. &QL;

MODERATE QUAKE HITS BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A moderate earthquake thumped the San Francisco
Bay Area early Friday, halting commuter trains and setting off
dozens of burglar alarms.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries and only minor household damage were reported from
the quake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured 4.1 on
the Richter scale and was centered 3 to 3 1/2 miles southeast of
Richmond on the Hayward Fault.
</P>
<P>
   The jolt was felt throughout the region at 4:16 a.m. It was
described variously as a thump, sounding like a train or rocks
thrown on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to radio and police stations said the shaking lasted for
only a few seconds but, depending on where they were, the
evaluations of the intensity ranged from violent to mild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major, major jolt,'' said Marie Griffith, an aide at
the Ellens Memorial Hospital, a small retirement home in Richmond.
``It shook up everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Toll takers at the Golden Gate Bridge said they did not feel it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, Sgt. Mary Ellen Tieger said
the span suffered no apparent damage, but bridge workers were
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hard jolt,'' she said. ``It wasn't even a shake. It
felt like someone dropped the floor under your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said the quake awakened her in
her Menlo Park apartment, but was not alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The quake interrupted power to commuter trains on the Richmond
line for more than 30 minutes. All Bay Area Rapid Transit trains
were stopped for a track and facilities inspection after the quake,
but BART spokesman Mike Healy said no damage was found.
</P>
<P>
   BART trains were traveling at reduced speeds, as is customary
after an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   At the Emeryville Police Department, a few miles from Richmond,
dispatcher Maria Bell said she did get a few calls, but only for
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me,'' she said. ``It shook pretty good.''

   VENEZUELA-ELECTION-$ADV05 _ MIAMI _ Supported by millions of
peasants and shantytown dwellers, a failed coup leader is poised to
win the Dec. 6 presidential election in Venezuela, an important
South American country that provides most of the oil imported to
the United States. The prospect of a win by Hugo Chavez is
reopening old woulds in the armed forces and stirring worries that
the military may try to block his rise to power. The election is
being watched closely by the business community since Chavez has
run on a controversial platform that includes a pledge to stop

   CROATIA-TORAH-$ADV05 _ DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ For almost five
hundred years, through earthquakes and war, the tiny Jewish
community here protected and cherished a precious deerskin torah
from the 13th Century. During World War II, they wrapped it like a
baby and hid it beneath roof tiles, along with 17th and 18th
century Venetian wraps, a pair of gold Torahs and even a candelabra
taken down from the ceiling of the synagogue. In 1991, the
synagogue even took a direct hit from a Serbian shell. But in 1995,
the treasures of Dubrovnik were lost _ not to foreign armies or
Croatian Nazis _ but to a Croatian-American Jew living in
Manhattan. Dr. Michael Papo arranged for their restoration and
display at Yeshiva University in New York City, and then fought
their return to Dubrovnik. Now, after three years spent in court
battles in New York and the Croatian capital Zagreb, the Jewish
community here is quietly celebrating the return of the treasures.

   WHITE-HOUSE-HOLIDAY _ WASHINGTON _ In a cramped hallway, about
eight tiny reindeer lengths from the Diplomatic Room fireplace,
White House cooks were merrily stamping out gingerbread men on an
autumn afternoon. ``Every slow day is a day we use for Christmas
preparation,'' explained pastry chef Roland Mesnier, guiding a
visitor past this culinary assembly line. ``If there is an empty
corner in the White House, you will find somebody rolling cookies
there.'' Like Santa's elves, some White House staffers regard
Christmas preparation as a never-ending job. On Monday, First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton will unveil the 1998 Christmas theme and
decorations at the White House -- beginning a traditional round of
seasonal tours and parties at the presidential home. (Dart, Cox

Its top executives are thirtysomethings already thinking about

little about health care, and their business model is young and
unproven. But make no mistake, the top hospitals in town are
worried about losing their most lucrative source of revenue _ heart
surgery _ to this upstart start- up from out of town. They will use
their dominance over health care in Central Texas to raise the
stakes with health plans and managed care companies. A look at

HOMEOWNER ANXIETY REACHES THE SATURATION POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As long as I can remember, I have loved waking
to the sound of rain. In my warm bed, usually with plenty of time
before I must get up, I've felt at once child-like and omnipotent.
You know, cozy and tucked in but invincible to all the wind and
water swirling around me.
</P>
<P>
   Since I bought a house, all of that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sound of rain _ pulling me from the fleece-lined depths
of sleep _ provokes major anxiety. My bed no longer feels secure
and wombish but like a foxhole just before an aerial bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Probably you are thinking: Oh, she has a leaky roof. But the
sick thing is, I don't. Not yet anyway. That I know of.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since I bought my house, I say ``Not yet anyway'' and
``That I know of'' all the time. It's like hanging garlic around my
neck to ward off vampires. I chant those phrases as a preventive
measure against everything from a busted hot water heater to a
shorted-out front porch light.
</P>
<P>
   I do this because other homeowners have made me paranoid and
superstitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you bought a house? Just wait,'' they all say. ``It's a
money pit. One thing after another. It never stops. Has your hot
water heater broken down? They're always the first to go.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not yet. That I know of.
</P>
<P>
   Last year during the storms of El Nino (when my roof was my
landlord's problem), I saw most of my homeowner friends spend the
winter gripped by fear. They roamed their houses with flashlights,
searching corners and seams for signs of seepage. They monitored
their basements. When leaks did spring, the drip, drip, drip of
rainwater into plastic buckets and dishpans was like Poe's telltale
heart, a sound that grew louder by the moment and drove them all
toward madness.
</P>
<P>
   When the skies cleared for a bit, those who could climb their
roofs slopped five-gallon cans of goop on the patches they thought
were suspect. Those who could not climb got in the long queue for
an audience with the most powerful person on Earth _ a professional
roofer.
</P>
<P>
   So, since Nov. 30, when 60 mph winds and heavy rains hammered
the San Francisco Bay area, I awoke at 6 a.m. in a mild panic.
</P>
<P>
   Where was that ``ping, ping, ping'' coming from? Inside the
bedroom or underneath the deck? Was that a car moving along the
street or torrents of water rushing down the basement steps? What
would I find upstairs under the skylight where a single drop of
water had fallen on my head?
</P>
<P>
   I turned on the lights and climbed out of my warm bed. I ran my
hands along the walls and followed the ping, ping, ping; it led
outside, underneath the deck. Prepared for the Ganges, I opened the
basement door and walked in; it was desert dry.
</P>
<P>
   I climbed the stairs and, cringing, turned on the kitchen light;
no mountain of shattered plexiglass lay on the hardwood floor. I
shuffled my bare feet all over and around the rag rug that lies
beneath the skylight. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet anyway. That I know of.

PINOCHET RULING PUTS HUMAN RIGHTS ABOVE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN BLACK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet made a big mistake. His
previous secret visits to Britain for tea with former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, a fellow anti-socialist zealot, were
bound to be looked upon with great disgust by Tony Blair's new
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got on the plane, the general should have checked who
was running the new British government. He would have been wise to
count the number of Scots who currently occupy the highest Cabinet
offices in the Blair government. The three top senior cabinet posts
_ the finance, foreign and defense ministers _ all cut their
ideological teeth in the Scottish Labor Party of the 1970s.
Socialist ideology was the bread and butter of the Labor Party at
that time and these young activists, now government ministers, were
radical.
</P>
<P>
   Chile was a cause celebre for Scottish leftists. The 1973
CIA-backed overthrow of the democratically elected leftist
government of Salvador Allende affirmed to Scottish socialists that
the United States was only interested in supporting democratic
winners if they were willing to toe the Washington line. Many who
were then in the Scottish Labor Party, including those now in the
Blair government, have not forgotten this travesty of democracy. In
Scotland, memories are long. Many see Pinochet's arrest as sweet
revenge and a satisfying boot in the face for the aging and
decaying Thatcher, the nemesis of the Scots.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's reign in Britain in the 1980s was characterized by
her ``English'' nationalism and her burning desire to ``turn back
the frontiers of socialism.'' Pinochet went a genocidal step
further. He eliminated it. Thatcher, as she has admitted, admires
the general and his policies. The British press has been filled
with speculation that Pinochet was lured to Britain by the new
Labor Foreign Ministry, in order that the police could arrest him
on a Spanish extradition warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his appointment, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook promised that
British foreign policy would be motivated by a new standard in the
post-Cold War era. Respect for human rights would be the
cornerstone. Strategic interest would play a secondary role. Those
who thrived on the scraps from the post-war ideological battle
between communism and capitalism would no longer be allowed to
continue with their protected tyrannies. Those who hold power
through aggression and repression would be denied British
assistance and aid.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has blown the cover off those dictators
who tortured, murdered and destroyed in the name of their
ideological creeds. The blame for the human rights catastrophe that
occurred during Pinochet's regime must be shouldered, to some
extent, by the U.S. government and its agencies. It is small wonder
that Washington has been nervous about Pinochet's case. The British
press has reported that the U.S. State Department has been applying
diplomatic pressure to gain the general's release. Should he ever
be brought to justice, old crusty pages from the CIA's files may be
reopened. ``Let sleeping dogs lie'' seems to be Washington's
preferred proverb.
</P>
<P>
   The British Law Lords' recent landmark ruling, denying Pinochet
immunity from prosecution as a former head of state, has elevated
international law to new heights. Tyrants can never feel safe
again. It is a positive step for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child in Scotland, I remember bewildered Chilean
children coming as refugees to my elementary school in the early
1970s. Their parents had been killed or had fled the genocide in
their homeland. They sat in the classroom, unable to speak the
language. But they were safe and they were made welcome. Now,
finally, the victims and their families may get justice.

ROBOTS TO SEARCH, PROBE LANDSCAPE OF MARS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intrigued by evidence that water once flowed abundantly over the
now frigid, desert-like Martian landscape, the United States is
launching new and rather oddball robots in search of frozen
remnants on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   While the last such robot to thrill observers back on Earth
bounced onto the Mars surface and proceeded to send back images,
two spacecraft launched over the next few weeks will carry a soil
sniffer, a mechanical arm and a tiny oven and the instruments will
circle, dig and punch at the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   The launches represent the latest in a parade of small unmanned
probes that NASA and a budding international alliance plan to send
to Mars well into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander are to launch
Dec. 10 and Jan. 3, respectively, from NASA's Kennedy Space Center
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is building toward missions after the turn of the
century that will attempt to return Martian rock and soil samples
to Earth, a project in which the French plan to collaborate with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably foremost among the goals are understanding the
biological potential of Mars _ really understanding the question:
Did life ever arise on Mars,'' said Carl Pilcher, who directs
NASA's solar systems exploration office from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since a team of scientists from
NASA's Johnson Space Center and Stanford University said they found
fossil evidence of ancient microbial life in a Martian meteorite
recovered from the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   Roundly disputed by other scientists, their claim nonetheless
renewed interest in the larger issue of whether Mars once harbored
life. That prospect increases if water flowed and ponded in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists expect to gradually piece together an explanation for
what prompted the Martian climate to change so drastically from one
that experts believe was once so wet that massive floods exceeding
anything witnessed on Earth swept across some regions. Under
contemporary conditions, water on Mars could exist only as vapor or
ice. The atmosphere is thin and almost exclusively carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to look for life, to look for water, we need to
understand the whole context of Mars as a planet, what controls the
behavior of the atmosphere over the course of a year, what controls
the behavior of water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the
polar caps,'' said Bruce Jakosky, a planetary scientist from the
University of Colorado and a member of the mission research team.
</P>
<P>
   Jakosky is among those who believe that Mars harbors a complex
water cycle in which moisture is both pulled from and released into
the atmosphere by the permanent polar caps at different times of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   With its arrival at Mars in September, the Climate Orbiter will
function as a weather satellite charting the global migration of
water vapor, carbon dioxide and dust in the planet's lower
atmosphere as well as recording temperatures and pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander and a pair of small independent probes called
Deep Space 2 that share the same spacecraft will descend to the
South Pole in December 1999, inserting probes into the soil in
search of subterranean ice.
</P>
<P>
   At a combined $356.8 million, Climate Orbiter, Polar Lander and
Deep Space 2 will cost less than a single space shuttle launch.
</P>
<P>
   The latest expeditions come on the heels of the 1997 Mars
Pathfinder mission that landed in what appeared to be an ancient
equatorial flood basin amid rounded pebbles and other signs of past
water erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Global Surveyor, Pathfinder's orbital companion,
transmitted images of an apparent large, dry lake bed in the
northern hemisphere and detected the chemical signature of
soil-born mineral deposits commonly found in standing water on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   What moisture there is on Mars may be found in the curiously
layered terrain of what appears to be dust and ice that surrounds
both polar caps.
</P>
<P>
   When it reaches Mars nine months after liftoff, the Climate
Orbiter will fire a braking rocket, slowing enough for the weaker
Martian gravity to pull the probe into a looping elliptical orbit
over the areas. Using a technique called aerobraking that was
employed by the Mars Global Surveyor mission, the Climate Orbiter
will dip into the planet's atmosphere periodically to lower its
altitude into a circular, 262-mile orbit.
</P>
<P>
   To augment the work of the Climate Orbiter, NASA will send the
Polar Lander and the two Deep Space 2 probes toward the layered
terrain at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``By digging in we hope to find a record of geologic change. By
digging half a meter or a meter into the surface we might be able
to examine 100,000 years of the Mars geologic record,'' said
Richard Zurek, a chief project scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Mars nearly two months after the Climate Orbiter,
the Polar Lander has been designed to make a high speed entry into
the atmosphere, using a heat shield to slow its initial descent, a
parachute and finally braking rockets to make a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the surface, a 6 {-foot long mechanical arm on the probe
will attempt excavations. The material it scoops up will be
inserted into an instrument on the lander designed to analyze its
water and carbon dioxide content.
</P>
<P>
   If the analysis also produces chemical signatures of minerals
typically formed in liquid water, then scientists will gain even
more evidence that Mars once was much more hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   More experimental in their concept, the Deep Space 2 probes that
will accompany the lander will attempt similar findings.
</P>
<P>
   About the size of basketballs while encased in their protective
aeroshells, the Deep Space 2 probes were designed to crash into the
surface of Mars like Lawn Darts about 60 miles from the Polar
Lander. The 400 mph impact will shatter the protective aeroshells
exposing the grapefruit-sized top section of the two-part probe.
The bullet-shaped lower section is designed to respond to the force
of the impact by plunging from one to three feet into the subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   A small drill has been built into the side of the penetrators to
gather a small sample of the subsoil and channel it to a small oven
and analyzer within the penetrator. As the sample is warmed, the
sensor will look for signs of vaporized ice.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Polar Lander and the Deep Space 2 probes will rely on
the Climate Orbiter to function as a communications satellite,
relaying their findings back to Earth. &QL;

   A small privately-funded microphone installed aboard the Mars
Polar Lander will offer Earthlings their first opportunity to
sample extraterrestrial sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 device was fashioned to record the sounds of the
Martian winds _ especially the acoustics of the sandstorms and the
twirling dust devils that dance across the bleak terrain of the Red
Planet. With any luck, the Mars Microphone may also pick up the
noises of the probe's robot arm as it crunches into the soil in
search of subterranean ice.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment is successful, researchers plan to offer the
recordings to listeners over the World Wide Web. It was developed
by the Planetary Society, a California-based space advocacy group
whose founders include the late Carl Sagan, and the University of
California at Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone is the brainchild of researchers Janet Luhmann at

</P>
<P>
   They pitched the proposal to the Planetary Society, which raised
the funds for the project and orchestrated the arrangements to
fasten the palm-sized microphone and recording device to a
Russian-furnished scientific instrument called a lidar.
</P>
<P>
   The device was assembled from a hearing aid sensor, the sound
processor used in popular talking toys and a computer chip. The
equipment will record the noises it hears and transmit them back to
Earth with the probe's other data. &QL;

ISRAELI PRISONER DETENTION, RELEASE OF COMMON CRIMINALS ARE OPEN
SORES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   AIDA CAMP, West Bank _ For most of the last 17 years, Daoud
Azrak has journeyed twice a month from his home in this West Bank
refugee camp to one prison or another in Israel to visit his son
Khaled.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palestine Liberation Organization made peace with
Israel in 1993, Azrak figured his bimonthly treks would end. His
son had been imprisoned as a young cadre of Fatah, the mainstream
movement headed by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Palestinian leader had signed peace accords, Azrak
thought, the foot soldiers of Fatah would be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Azrak's monthly schedule has not changed. Like
hundreds of other relatives of prisoners, he awakes every two weeks
at dawn to pay a morning visit to his son, who is locked up in a
prison in Ashkelon, a city on Israel's Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   When the latest peace agreement was signed in October,
Palestinians had renewed hope that some of those who had led the
intifada, the seven-year uprising against Israeli rule in the West
Bank and Gaza, would be freed.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, the two sides agreed verbally that
Israel would free 750 Palestinian prisoners by the end of January.
Last month, when Israel released the first batch of 250 prisoners
and included 150 common criminals, Palestinians fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a peace agreement, the first thing that happens
is that the political prisoners are freed,'' said Azrak, who has
seen four of his eight children imprisoned in Israel over the
years. Only Khaled remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is normal all over the world,'' he said. ``Why not
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Few things rile Palestinians like the issue of prisoners because
it hits home: Most families have had at least one member jailed
since the uprising began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the prisoners' continued detention _ years after
peacemaking began _ and the insult they felt had been hurled at
them with the release of common criminals, are open sores.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they festered into violent demonstrations outside the
West Bank town of Ramallah, during which an Israeli soldier was
beaten by an angry mob. After the incident, Israel said it would
refuse to cede more West Bank territory until Palestinians accept
Israel's criteria for prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say the criteria exclude prisoners with
``blood on their hands'' _ that is, those whose activities harmed
or killed _ and those who belong to Hamas or other Palestinian
militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Israel insists that Arafat agreed to these standards. And,
Israeli officials say, after freeing 7,000 prisoners since the
first peace accord was signed, not many of the mere hundreds they
say they are still holding can pass these tests and qualify for
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are less than 200 who meet these criteria,'' said David
Bar-Illan, political adviser for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. ``And 100 of them have already been released.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians deny that releasing common criminals was part of
the bargain. And they say that there are many more than 200
prisoners eligible for release, even using Israel's criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, one of Arafat's advisors, says Israel is holding
2,150 prisoners and estimates that 1,200 of them belong to factions
of the PLO, particularly Fatah. Bassam Eid, a Palestinian human
rights activist, estimates that 300 prisoners were involved in acts
that harmed or killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the real figure, the war of words that has
characterized relations since the Wye agreement was signed on Oct.
23 seems likely to continue, particularly regarding this issue
since the deal was not in writing.
</P>
<P>
   To settle differences, Palestinians say they hope to appeal to
the Americans for help. ``We would like very much for the U.S. to
interfere in the issue of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Tibi.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Israel's threat this week to halt land-transfers,
Palestinians seem to have no plans to calm the frenzy over
prisoners. On Saturday, prisoners and their families began an open
hunger strike that they say will last until the last political
prisoner is freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This peace process didn't bring us a just solution to the
prisoners,'' said Issa Karaka, head of the Palestinian Prisoners'
Club in Bethlehem and one of the organizers of the hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement should have dealt with political prisoners,
especially those who have long sentences or who are sick or old,''
Karaka said. ``Those imprisoned before the agreement was signed (in
1993) should be released.''
</P>
<P>
   Karaka says that includes the release of prisoners such as
Khaled Azrak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Azrak led a Fatah cell that threw a bomb at a car full
of Israelis, causing the car to overturn, killing one passenger and
injuring the others, according to the elder Azrak.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prisoners are the soldiers of Arafat_ he is the high
commander of the Palestinian revolution,'' said Tibi, adding that
he believes even Hamas prisoners should be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are part of the struggle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daoud Azrak said earlier this week that he planned to be one of
the hunger strikers, along with thousands of other parents of
prisoners who were expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're letting out drug dealers and car thieves,'' he said,
raising his hands in the air in frustration. ``But they don't let
out those who fought for their country. It's something
unbelievable.''

 &HT;    SoHo Grand coddles the hip and well-heeled
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The SoHo Grand Hotel is the kind of place where those
often surreal encounters one has in the Big Apple are an inevitable
experience, part of the script. Take this scene, in the hotel's
chi-chi Canal House restaurant, for example.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny afternoon, diners are nibbling on grilled tiger
shrimp and crab cakes flecked with Jerusalem artichokes. One is a
childlike young woman who looks like she lay down on a bolt of
drapery fabric, rolled over like a cannoli, and had someone cut it
off _ raw edges intact _ just under her armpits. Why . . . it's the
Icelandic rock queen, Bjork.
</P>
<P>
   At the table next to her, a very large black man with a shiny
shaved head is sipping a hot cup of tea. Whoa . . . it's Geoffrey
Holder, the actor probably best known for playing the voodoo witch
doctor in the 1976 James Bond film ``Live and Let Die.'' Sixties
survivors will also recall him as the deep-voiced man who hawked
7-Up as the ``Un-cola'' in all those television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork and the Un-cola guy.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting of hip, hype, money and fame is the essence of this
ultra-chic hotel at 310 West Broadway in the heart of the city's
booming SoHo art district. Since opening in 1996 _ the first major
hotel built in the area since the 1800s _ the 15-story brick
structure has been embraced as a cutting edge alternative to the
mainstream lodgings of Midtown Manhattan. That's no doubt because
the place caters to their tastes for luxury, service and the
never-ending search for the next new thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the SoHo Grand is more than a here-today, gone-tomorrow pop
hangout. Designer David Helpern has created a stunning setting,
from the brick columns dominating the open lobby to the thick, Coke
glass-and-iron staircase flanked by two carved dogs. This place
drips luxury, from leather chairs laced up like tight bodices to
gallery-quality photographs on the walls to the tiny bowls of
cashews that dot glass tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   The airy main floor is like a scene out of a 1920s Paris bistro.
To the right, an eclectic crowd, mostly in black, chats over
martinis and cigarette smoke. To the left, there's the Canal House,
specializing in American cuisine such as roasted Muscovy duck,
grilled veal and Yankee pot roast. Running through all this is a
wait staff that could have been trained to serve Leona Helmsley,
taking care of your every need like good and faithful servants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this all translates into $$$. Rooms start at a hefty
$359 a night, and are smaller than comparable accommodations
uptown. However, from Dec. 20-27, the SoHo Grand is shaving the
prices of its rooms for the holidays, to $279 a night. There will
also be a special holiday dinner menu in the restaurant, and
seasonal entertainment in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated in muted tones of beige, taupe and gray, the rooms are
built around the cool lines of metal _ copper lighting, iron racks,
porcelain pedestal sinks and stark black and white photographs
framed in silver.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the SoHo Grand's real drawing card, however, is out the
window. If you request a room on the hotel's north side (which you
should), you gaze out upon the imposing Manhattan skyline _ not the
glass obelisks so common on the Upper East Side, but the underbelly
deco buildings that ring the south side of Manhattan like something
out of a 1930s crime novel. It looks a lot like the Naked City, or
the old opening shots on ``The Edge of Night.''
</P>
<P>
   It puts you in the mood to explore the streets, which are lined
with art galleries and tiny restaurants tucked inside iron-fronted
warehouses. Spend an evening just wandering from gallery to
designer shop to bar, nibbling on cheese and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the slick shopping/dining experiences of the Upper
East Side or Fifth Avenue. The entire SoHo district is much more
like the city's nonfiltered, Bohemian cousin _ block after block of
steamy espresso bars, independent bookstores, designer shopping
(Dolce to Todd Oldham), and galleries filled with provocative
pieces. The area is still undergoing the transformation from
warehouse zone to tourist destination, and your stroll through the
neighborhood will take you by as many gritty loading docks and
boarded-up doors as avant-garde window displays. But with the SoHo
Grand as a welcome anchor, this rejuvenated part of the city is
ripe for exploring and offers a fresh, alternative perspective on
New York's skyline, food and art.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The SoHo Grand is at 310 West Broadway at Canal
Street. Reservations: 212-965-3000. Online, you may view the the
hotel and make your reservations at http://www.sohogrand.com.

<P>
   Three million cars on Britain's roads can be unlocked easily by
hackers using a handheld computer. And if they steal the valuables
from inside your car, the stealth with which they break in means
you may never know that they have been there.
</P>
<P>
   Using the right software, it only takes about 10 seconds to copy
the codes from the remote controls used to operate a modern car's
central-locking system. A thief using this technique would be
almost undetectable. And your insurance company may refuse to pay
up for theft which occurs in this way.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was recently discovered by Lars S+rensen, a
computer journalist on PC World, when he was trying out a new
software package on his Palm Pilot, a ``palmtop'' computer. The
computer has a built-in infrared port, with software designed to
record the infrared signals from TV and video remote controls,
enabling owners to use the Palm Pilot to control all their gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   However, S+rensen also tried to record the signal from a
friend's infrared control for locking a car. To his surprise, he
was able to use the code to unlock the car and disable the alarm.
``This is definitely a threat to car owners, because someone could
take belongings from their car without leaving any sign of a
break-in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre in Thatcham,
Berkshire, England, which approves locking systems for cars,
believes that as many as 3 million out of the 22 million cars on
the road have infrared remote controls that are vulnerable to
palmtop-wielding hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Shallcross, a security expert with Britain's Automobile
Association, says ``there have been code grabbers available for a
few years,'' but these were specialist devices. However, he adds
that modern systems should not be vulnerable to this sort of attack
since they use sophisticated rolling codes, which change each time
the key is used, making it virtually impossible to predict the next
one. Some systems have as many as 1,064 different code sequences,
which would take even a powerful computer months to break.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, one of the cars S+rensen hacked into, in Denmark,
was a 1998 model. This alarmed Mark Inman, a security researcher at
Thatcham. ``The problem is, there are different specifications for
different countries,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And if phantom thieves do steal valuables from your car, your
insurance company may not believe you. ``If there's no obvious sign
of forced entry then the first thing insurance companies will be
concerned with is whether the claim is genuine,'' says Malcolm
Tarling of the Association of British Insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grabbing a code is like lock-picking,'' says Inman, ``though
it isn't as easy as it sounds.'' Capturing a signal as it bounces
off a car would make it difficult to get a complete code, he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, a new infrared amplifier for the Palm Pilot is due to
go on sale soon, making it easier for thieves to grab the signal
from a distance. 3Com, the company that makes Palm Pilots, says it
is taking this problem ``very seriously'' and is investigating. &QL;

 &HT;    Holiday movie season: Stars name of the game
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's beginning to look a lot like a ``Psycho'' Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   No, no one's saying the remake of the Hitchcock classic will
necessarily overwhelm the competition at the box office this
holiday season. Indeed, director Gus Van Sant's updated version of
the 1960 black-and-white chiller just opened two days ago, so the
jury's still out on whether ``Psycho'' is anything more than a
really big name capable of pulling folks into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   That's this month o' movies in a nutshell: From Robin Williams
to John Travolta (twice), from Julia Roberts to Meg Ryan (twice),
the names attached to many of the season's movies are big. And so
are the questions about what, exactly, we'll see up there onscreen.
Like a pile of gaudily wrapped gifts during the December holidays,
this film season surely will contain a few surprises _ both good
and bad. What follows is a sneak peek.
</P>
<P>

   ``You've Got Mail''
</P>
<P>
   No longer sleepless in Seattle, this time Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
are feuding bookstore owners in this remake of the 1940 movie ``The
Shop Around the Corner.'' Will their shared animosity make for as
cute an eventual

<P>
   coupling as the cross-country, radio-spawned romance of
``Sleepless''? On the plus side: We already love them together. On
the minus side: That could make the sense of disappointment worse.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 18
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection''
</P>
<P>
   Boldly going where no man used to go until they started churning
out umpteen ``Star Trek'' TV franchises and movie sequels to

   Just in time for Christmas, the ultimate ``I brought someone

of a kindly gorilla guardian (Charlize Theron) whose hairy charge
gets loose in L.A. is a remake of the 1949 film. Plus: Getting to
watch the ape Joe outsmart the human scientist (Bill Paxton) who's
on his trail. Minus: With Disney behind the special effects this
time, it can't possibly be as cheesily campy as the original.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   Look who's talking . . . er, singing
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'' _ by a cartoonist.
DreamWorks hopes the combination of hot voices (everyone from
actors Val Kilmer and Michelle
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer to singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston) and
resurgent interest in spirituality will make for a hit animated
tale of Moses. Plus: The Carey-Houston duet alone is making for
plenty of advance buzz. Minus: DreamWorks' animated ``Antz'' was
pretty much an ain't.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 18
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice''
</P>
<P>
   A shy young woman builds a show business career by replicating
the singing of Judy Garland and other revered voices of years past.
Plus: Stars Ewan McGregor for the Gen X'ers and Michael Caine and
Brenda Blethyn for the older cineastes. Minus: There was only one
Judy Garland. Maybe that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   You think your family's mixed up . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon plays a divorced mother of two whose ex becomes
engaged to the younger, sexier Julia Roberts. But wait, that's not
even the really bad news. When Sarandon's character gets a
life-threatening illness, she has to learn to get along with
Roberts for the kids' sake. Plus: The promise of fabulous acting,
tinged with just a hint of a catfight. Minus: If Meryl Streep
couldn't make us get into this whole dying mom reconciling with a
younger, successful woman thing in ``One True Thing,'' what hope is
there for ``Stepmom''?
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that a successful musician would really yearn to
spend more time at home, then you'll probably also believe he could
come back as a snowman after perishing in a car accident. Plus: Jim
Henson creatures and a welcome return to films of the too-long-gone
Michael Keaton. Minus: First we had to see Keaton largely obscured
by his ``Batman'' suit; now he's largely obscured by snow and
(presumably) a carrot nose.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Friday
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa''
</P>
<P>
   It's the ultimate Chick-Mick flick as Streep heads a stellar
cast in this tale of five Irish sisters sharing a house and a
socially and morally restricted life. Culminates in an Irish dance
scene that, if done right, will make entire theaters feel like
Riverdancin'. Plus: the cast, the clogging! Minus: A house full of
dour Irish sisters? Sounds about as exciting as a convent.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta''
</P>
<P>
   A family riven by crime and drugs in big-city Chicago moves back
to small-town Mississippi to try to repair their lives. Plus:
Fabulous cast includes Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes. Minus: Maya
Angelou's an incredible writer, but that doesn't guarantee she can
direct as well.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   Money changes everything
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine''
</P>
<P>
   First the holder of a winning lottery ticket in a small Irish
town doesn't step forward. Then, he turns out to be dead. But that
doesn't stop anyone from trying to get the money anyway. Plus:
David Kelly and Ian Bannen reportedly score as a couple of
septuagenarian schemers who'll even go buck naked to try and score
big bucks. Minus: ``The Full Monty'' was one thing, but do we
really want to see naked 70-year-olds?
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Friday
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan''
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of no-good brothers discover a downed airplane,
they valiantly save . . . a duffel bag containing some $4 million.
Which simply turns them no-good-er and upon each other. Plus: Funny
premise stars Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton. Minus: Can
one-note actor Paxton and the somewhat outrageous Thornton remain
amusing without wearing on us?
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Friday
</P>
<P>
   Well, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty''
</P>
<P>
   In which we learn that we weren't crazy as teenagers . . . high
school really was a scary, dangerous place to be. A group of
super-smart teenage students do battle with an evil pod of alien
(and we're not talking about the type with green cards) teachers.
Plus: script by Kevin ``Scream'' Williamson. Minus: Young, hip cast
(Elijah Wood, Salma Hayek, Usher) raises concerns about occasional
misfires from Williamson (``I Know What You Did Last Summer'').
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Dr. Frankenstein had a strange relationship with
his creations. Wait'll you see this story about ``Frankenstein''
director James Whale's relationship with his young gardener. Plus:
Director Bill Condon has already picked up some film festival
awards for ``Gods,'' and the Oscar buzz is big for star Ian
McKellen. Minus: Its status as an art house film could keep
audiences away.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 18
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a onetime mental patient who becomes a
doctor and takes on the HMOs. We wish. No, seriously, Williams'
patient-turned-doctor has an unconventional approach to healing.
Plus: Williams has ably walked this comedy-drama fine line in
``Good Will Hunting,'' ``Dead Poets Society,'' etc. Minus: Williams
has stumbled over that same line in ``Being Human,'' ``Fathers'
Day,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow stars as the bewitching young actress with whom
the playwright falls in love as he's struggling to finish ``Romeo
and Juliet.'' Plus: Paltrow was surprisingly good in ``Emma,''
another English costume drama. Minus: Audiences may be tired of the
overexposed Paltrow. Not to mention Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25
</P>
<P>
   When are we gonna see this, already?!
</P>
<P>
   They're two of the year's most hotly anticipated movies, but you
won't be able to see either of them before 1999 _ unless you live
in New York or Los Angeles. Getting Oscar consideration is the
thinking behind these limited Christmas Day releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line''
</P>
<P>
   Pity poor Terrence Malick. The renowned (``Badlands''),
semi-reclusive director finally decides to work again, and he has
the misfortune of making a World War II movie in the same year as
Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Plus: a James Jones
novel for inspiration and an all-star cast, including John
Travolta, Sean Penn and Nick Nolte. Minus: Unless the Allies lose,
nothing can top
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan's'' drama and poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25 in New York and Los Angeles, January in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action''
</P>
<P>
   Taken from the best seller, the true, gut-wrenching story of
eight Boston-area families whose children die of leukemia _ most
likely linked to toxic chemicals in the water. It's a case of the
little guys up against two powerful corporations accused of doing
the leaking, until lawyer Jan Schlittman (John Travolta) takes the
case at great personal and professional risk to himself. Plus: Cast
includes Robert Duvall and Travolta, who hasn't done a
down-and-dirty lawyer before. Minus: Science, suffering kids and
legal jargon could make for a squirm-inducing experience.
</P>
<P>
   Starts: Dec. 25 in New York and Los Angeles,
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 8 in Atlanta.

KING OF CHRISTMAS KITSCH KEEPS ON SINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody knows better than Dr. Elmo how much
listening to ``Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' is like hearing
cats yowl on the back fence, yodeling their moon love to the whole
neighborhood. That's why his new album, ``Dr. Elmo's Twisted
Christmas,'' includes the song, ``Don't Make Me Play That Grandma
Song Again.''
</P>
<P>
   But as sales for ``Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' reach 5
million _ the single passed the quadruple platinum mark a dozen
years ago _ Dr. Elmo is laughing all the way to the savings and
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Every year Elmo finds himself looking at new pretenders to the
throne of Christmas Hoot, and every year he outlasts them all.
</P>
<P>
   RuPaul's ``Ho Ho Ho'' album, featuring ``I Saw Daddy Kissing
Santa Claus,'' is in the race, along with ``Jingle Cats,'' ``Jingle
Babies,'' ``Bachelor Pad Christmas,'' ``Punk Rock Christmas,''
``Kazoo Christmas'' _ which comes with its own plastic kazoo _ and
``Tales from the Crypt, Christmas,'' including the catchy, ``Deck
the Hall With Parts of Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elmo, aka Elmo Shropshire, is ready for the challenge. A
veterinarian who once owned the Arguello Pet Hospital in San
Francisco, Elmo has settled in Larkspur, Calif., where he still
works at making animals feel better while, some would say, making
human beings feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   When he first recorded ``Grandma'' in 1979, said Elmo, the owner
of the studio thought he was crazy. So did a whole bunch of people
who listened to the song the first time it was played on the air,
by disc jockey Gene Nelson on San Francisco station KSFO. Nelson,
told to stop playing the tune, kept at it, picking it up again the
year after, and the year after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five years, we never did have a record label on it,''
Elmo, 62, said in a telephone interview during a Christmas tour
through Illinois. ``But people kept calling in to request it, just
like people kept calling in to say they hated it. It took about
four or five years for it to break through.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it did, the royalties started rolling in, and Elmo became a
regular at Christmas concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma'' seems to increase in sales every year, Elmo said.
``When it first caught on and sold four hundred to five hundred
thousand copies, I thought that would be it. But it's been selling
progressively more each year.'' and it's on almost every Greatest
Christmas Hits album.''
</P>
<P>
   It was touch and go at the start, though, said Elmo, who
remembered that when he played the old Boarding House in San
Francisco, ``I was picketed by the Gray Panthers. They were
carrying signs that said, `What's so funny about a dead grandma?'''
</P>
<P>
   The dead-grandma theme, Elmo said, came from a friend, Randy
Brooks. ``His grandmother used to overindulge a lot at Christmas,
so I think the reindeer was probably a metaphor for overindulgence.
Grandma just got run over by overindulgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when the song first came out, Elmo said, ``I
was primarily interested in playing the banjo in a bluegrass band.
I really didn't want to sing, especially after I heard myself sing,
but this thing kind of fell in my lap. Everyone laughed at me
anytime I tried to do a serious song, so I decided to go with the
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Going with the flow led to a monster hit and an album with
Elmo's ex-wife, Patsy, that included ``Senor Santa Claus,''
``Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' and ``Percy, the Puny
Poinsettia,'' the flip side of the ``Grandma'' single. Once he hit
the charts, Elmo never stopped producing songs, including
``Grandma's Killer Fruitcake'' and ``Granpa's Going to Sue the
Pants off Santa,'' from ``Dr. Elmo's Twisted Christmas,'' as well
as his latest tune, ``Kenneth Starr Is Coming to Town,'' with
lyrics that include, ``He's making a list of every affair,
especially those involving big hair,'' and ``You'll see him on the
TV, and waving from his car, you'll know more than you'll want to
know about what to do with a cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be hard to identify Elmo's voice on any of those songs.
It's not hard to identify Elmo's voice, period _ that strange,
grating gargle with a Kentucky twinge is the way Elmo sounds, all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' he said. ``I always think I sound like everyone
else, but when people hear me talk, they can tell that I'm the guy
who did `Grandma.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again Elmo's ``Grandma'' is being challenged in the stores,
but this year's crop of oddness is pretty bland. ``Bachelor Pad
Christmas'' has no life to it; RuPaul is good for maybe one
playing; and Swingin' Barnyard Christmas, with 12 animal versions
of ``Jingle Bells,'' is a sad attempt to cash in on cat and dog
Christmas ditties.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbin's Equestrian Orchestra is nothing but noises set to a
``Jingle Bells'' background, ditto for the Monkey House Yuletide
Choir and Porkchops and Applesauce. The only unaccompanied animals
on the album are the Moo-Tones, and it's hard to tell whether
they're cows or very clever humans. Other novelty albums, such as
``Kazoo Christmas,'' are too sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bummed Out Christmas,'' on the other hand, may give Elmo a run
for his money. In addition to the Everly Brothers' ``Christmas Eve
Can Kill You,'' ``Christmas in Viet Nam'' and the Staple Singers'
``Who Took the Merry Out of Christmas?'' the album offers the
singular ``Christmas in Prison'' by Doug Legacy and the Legends,
which includes immortal lines like, ``Her heart is as big as this
whole goddamned jail, she's as sweet as saccharin at a drugstore,
wholesale'' and ``She reminds me of a chess game with someone I
admire, or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Elmo can take his hat off to that kind of inspired singing, but
he feels secure in the knowledge that ``Grandma Got Run Over by a
Reindeer'' will stay at the top of the novelties list. Each year
there seems to be more call for Elmo.
</P>
<P>
   It's the live shows, though, that are closest to Elmo's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful, to be up on stage, to feel the energy of the
audience,'' he said. ``It brings a lot of old codgers to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Bill Monroe at the Grand Ole Opry once. He was old, 84
or so, and could just barely move. But the minute he stood in the
spotlight he completely came to life, dancing and everything. And
once he stepped off the stage, he reverted back to being old
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmo is hoping stage shows keep him young, and he expects to be
performing under the lights as long as there's a demand for it.
Which, in Monroe years, would mean at least two more decades of
listening to ``Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,'' the
blackboard-scraping, cat-yodeling classic of Christmas that has
made Elmo one happy man.

   BOOKS -- When you cozy up with one of Jan Brett's exquisitely
detailed childrens books, it's almost like you're being let in on a
secret: that you're really still a kid who yearns to believe in the
magic,in the fairy tale. Which is precisely what the New England
author-illustrator, whose books have sold more than 12 million
copies, intends. WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS --The strange relationship
between the late Raymond Carver and Gordon Lish, as D.T. Max wrote
recently in The New York Times Sunday Magazine, raises issues that
could almost be calledtruth-in-labeling. WITH: REVIEWS -- The
seventh and latest novel in Albert's China Bayles mystery series,
``Chile Death,'' shows maturation through strength of dialogue.
Also, Summer vacation turns into a time of healing in ``Summer at
Little Lava.'' WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST

   FOCUS -- (Available by 2 p.m. Friday, Dec. 4) -- Like Santas
elves, some White House staffers regard Christmas preparation as a
never-ending job. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will unveil the
1998 Christmas theme and decorations at the White House, beginning
a traditional round of seasonal tours and parties at the
presidential home. During the following three weeks, about 15,000
guests will marvel at Christmas trees laden with 50,000 lights and
handmade ornaments from across America, hear seasonal songs of
musicians from every state, and consume 50,000 cookies, half a ton
of fruitcake and 250 gallons of eggnog. Such festivities take a tad
of forethought. The fruitcake, for instance, was baked in June and
stacked in refrigerators in two-pound blocks to await the holiday
parties.

   ENTERTAINMENT -- (Available by 2 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 3) -- Few
things are less telegenic in a made-for-TV world than the opening
each business day of the New York Stock Exchange. But CNBC, the
gimlet-eyed cable network, is shattering TVs business news

   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY -- Just 20 years ago the choices for a
telephone for your house were simple: Console or wall; Black or
white. But today, consumers can go to the electronics store and
find a selection of about 50 cordless phones, 30 corded phones, at
least a dozen cellular phone models and a separate display rack
full of telephone/answering machine combinations. WITH: DIGITAL
DIVIDE: The once lofty goal to open up the high-tech glories of the
Internet to all of Americas schoolchildren has degenerated into an
increasingly nasty partisan squabble. WITH: TECH BRIEFS So far,
most computer games have been devoted to digitizing what we do:
paying taxes, playing football, flying planes and hunting deer.
Now, companies are coming out with games for your PC that make fun
of what we do. WITH: TECHNOBUDDY -- If the bright kids are any
indicator, mechanical kits are out these days. Instead, childrens

gadget from pieces of bell wire, pencil leads and razor blades.

<P>
   SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH -- When Jean Dible dies, shes going to college.
Specifically, to the Medical College of Georgia. Dible has decided
to donate her body to medical science. Not only does she see it as
practical, but also a way to leave a legacy. Whole body donation is
a vital and age-old practice for medical schools and other
programs, such as those for physical therapists, nurses,
chiropractors, researchers and surgeons. However, the need for
whole bodies isn't as well publicized as the need for organs for
transplants, and many people don't know about this end-of-life
option. WITH: Raising children with positive mental health is ``not
wishful thinking,'' but can be accomplished through concrete
measures and actions, according to a mental health expert. WITH:
What looks like a lollipop, tastes like a cough drop and has some
doctors concerned? Answer: A new product called Cough Pops. This
cough drop on a stick is aimed at children and adults who need
temporary relief from minor cold and sore throat discomfort. WITH:
The southern United States accounts for more than half of all AIDS
cases among people in rural areas, according to a recently released
report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

   TRAVEL -- This time of year, the magnificent sounds of the
Mormon Tabernacle wrap listeners in their warmth. Highlights of the
world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir are the annual performances of
traditional Christmas carols and choral works. WITH: VERONA, ITALY
-- Theres no shortage of romance in this town where reminders of
the star-crossed love between Romeo and Juliet are everywhere. Its
warming to stroll the streets and piazzas that the two of them
prowled, looking for alcoves and passageways where they could
snuggle and kiss. WITH: TRAVEL NOTES -- Boston has Monet,
Washington has Van Gogh. While these are the hottest tickets in the
museum world now, they are not the only great art shows available.

   WHEELS -- While other sport and sporty coupes in a variety of
performance and price levels have come and gone (remember the Dodge
Stealth, Ford Probe and the recently axed Acura NSX?), Mitsubishi's
tidy little Eclipse rolls on with a popularity anchored by its
versatility. Want a looks-good, feels-good sporty car with an
entry-level price? Check out the Eclipse. WITH: SHARP DRIVING -- As
if just plain old everyday traffic wasn't bad enough for most
folks, how are you to deal with the additional pressures of holiday
travel? Plan ahead.

   BOOKS -- When you cozy up with one of Jan Brett's exquisitely
detailed childrens books, it's almost like you're being let in on a
secret: that you're really still a kid who yearns to believe in the
magic,in the fairy tale. Which is precisely what the New England
author-illustrator, whose books have sold more than 12 million
copies, intends. WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS --The strange relationship
between the late Raymond Carver and Gordon Lish, as D.T. Max wrote
recently in The New York Times Sunday Magazine, raises issues that
could almost be calledtruth-in-labeling. WITH: REVIEWS -- The
seventh and latest novel in Albert's China Bayles mystery series,
``Chile Death,'' shows maturation through strength of dialogue.
Also, Summer vacation turns into a time of healing in ``Summer at
Little Lava.'' WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST

a traditional round of seasonal tours and parties at the
presidential home. During the following three weeks, about 15,000
guests will marvel at Christmas trees laden with 50,000 lights and
handmade ornaments from across America, hear seasonal songs of

 &HT;    Did you hear the one about the 3 guys ...
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are a few jokes I've been saving up for a slow holiday week
just like
</P>
<P>
   this:
</P>
<P>
   _Three men show up at St. Peter's gate at the same time. St.
Peter figures heaven is getting a bit crowded, and he tells the
trio to describe to him how they died. The one who died the most
horrible death would be admitted to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The first man starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long long suspected that my wife was being unfaithful
to me, but I'd never been able to catch her. So today I left work
early and went home. Sure enough, my wife was lying naked in the
bed. I looked around and found this man, wearing only gym shorts,
hanging from our balcony. We live on the 25th floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rage, I began stomping on his hands until he had to let
go. He fell 25 floors and landed in some bushes. It didn't even
hurt him!
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rage, I picked up a refrigerator and chunked it over the
balcony. It landed on the man and killed him. But that's when I had
the heart attack from all the exertion and died.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter agreed that was a pretty horrible story.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next man's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing my exercises on the balcony of my 26-floor
apartment, as I do every afternoon. I somehow slipped and tumbled
over the railing but luckily grabbed hold of the railing on the
balcony below. That's when this maniac comes charging out there and
begins stomping on my hands and cursing. Finally, I had to let go.
Miraculously, I landed in some bushes and wasn't even hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then that maniac heaved a refrigerator over the side of the
balcony, and it landed on me and killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew,'' St. Peter said. ``What a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The third man spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture this. I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   _Two guys come across a big hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reckon how deep that hole is?'' one asks the other. One man
tosses a rock into the hole and waits to hear the sound of it
landing. He hears nothing.
</P>
<P>
   His partner tosses a bigger rock into the hole. Again, both
listen but hear nothing.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad tie is nearby. The two men walk over, pick it up and
toss it in the hole. A few seconds later a goat comes flying by and
leaps into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' one man says. ``Reckon why that goat
jumped into that hole?''
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, while they're still pondering all this, a
farmer walks up and asks if they've seen a goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we saw one come running by and jump into this here
hole,'' one man replies.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer shakes his head. ``That can't be my goat. Mine was
tied to a railroad tie.''
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the game between Texas and Texas A&AMP;M, here are a
trio of Aggie
</P>
<P>
   jokes.
</P>
<P>
   _A University of Texas grad, a Baylor alumnus, and an Aggie had
all committed horrendous crimes and were going to be shot. The
Teasip was brought up and blindfolded. The general shouted,
``Ready, aim ...'' and the Teasip guy yelled, ``Hurricane!,''
everybody ducked, and he ran away free.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed at losing their first prisoner, the guards brought up
the Baylor student with renewed vigor. They blindfolded him and the
general commanded,
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready, aim...'' and the Baylor guy shouted, ``Tornado!''
Fearing for their lives, everybody ducked, and he ran away free.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Aggie has been watching all this and starts thinking,
``They all yelled natural disasters and they got away, so I will
too.''
</P>
<P>
   So they brought him up and blinded folded him, the general
shouted, ``Ready, aim...'' and the Aggie screamed, ``Fire!!''
</P>
<P>
   _An Aggie and a Longhorn are in hell. The Longhorn is chained to
an ugly old woman, and the Aggie is chained to Pamela Anderson. The
devil comes in and tells the two unfortunate souls that they will
be in this situation for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn asks the devil why he is chained to the ugly old
woman. The devil replies, ``This is your punishment for being so
mean to all those Aggies over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn then asks, ``If this is hell, why does the Aggie
get to be chained to Pamela Anderson''?
</P>
<P>
   To which the devil replies, ``That's Pamela Anderson's
punishment''!
</P>
<P>
   _An Aggie and a Longhorn are watching the news on TV. There's a
film story about a girl on the ledge of a building threatening to
commit suicide. The police were trying to talk her down when the
Longhorn says to the Aggie, ``I'll bet you five dollars that she
jumps.'' The Aggie took the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the girl jumps. The Aggie takes five dollars from
his pocket and hands it to the Longhorn. The Longhorn says, ``I
can't take your money. I saw the same film clip on the 6 p.m. news
today and knew she was going to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie says, ``I watched it, too, but I didn't think she
would do it a second time.''

 &HT;    Austin woos Legislature with parking
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you spend half your life making change so you
can park downtown, you've probably got several questions about the
new City of Austin policy that exempts Texas lawmakers from being
ticketed at parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for example, how do you get a cushy deal like this?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Run for office.
</P>
<P>
   The parking perk was just one of several announced Monday by
Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and other city officials. The city also is
giving each state representative and senator a fancy $35 snow globe
from Saks Fifth Avenue and free golf at city courses.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these gifts, Mayor Watson says, is to make it
easier for Austin to work with the Legislature, not because the
city is afraid the Legislature will clobber Austin during the
coming session for annexing 27,700 mainly ticked off suburbanites
against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure. And I'm a Hungarian ballerina. This is a snow job
with snow globes, OK? But let's forget the souvenirs and answer
your questions about this new free parking program.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1: Do state lawmakers everywhere get to skate like
this?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Jeff Tolbert, a parking meter reader with the City of
Albany, N.Y., the New York state capital, said New York state
representatives' cars parked at expired meters in Albany get
ticketed just like anybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it expires, you have to give it a ticket no matter what car
is there,'' Tolbert said. ``Except for a police car. I don't want
to mess up my paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 2: Will this program help Austin's needy?
</P>
<P>
   It should. Since the lawmakers don't have to feed the meters,
they'll have plenty of quarters in their pockets to hand out to the
panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 3: Should a lawmaker parking at a City of Austin
meter mark his car for immunity from ticketing by leaving his new
$35 Saks Fifth Avenue snow globe on the dashboard?
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not the way the state lawmakers' cars will be
identified as being exempt from $15 parking tickets, said John
Hrncir, government relations officer for the City of Austin. The
license number of the lawmaker's car _ one car per lawmaker _ will
be fed into the city's parking systems computer, Hrncir explained.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 4: Will this parking perk tick people off?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it will. This is Austin, international center of the
chronically riled.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 5: Does this mean state lawmakers will also get
their names on the guest list of Austin clubs such as Liberty
Lunch?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, because when I asked that question, Hrncir just
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 6: If a lawmaker wanted to, could he park his car
at a meter downtown in front of his favorite restaurant and leave
it there until, say, March?
</P>
<P>
   Hrncir wasn't sure. So maybe somebody should try it and see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 7: Now let's just say, for argument purposes, that
a state legislator was driving down, uh, South Congress Avenue, and
that the, uh, hookers returned to South Congress for the coming
session, and the legislator decided to pull over. Under the new
rule, could he park for free at a South Congress parking meter?
</P>
<P>
   No. But only because there are no parking meters on South
Congress Avenue.

 &HT;    Reminiscing on the downtown of holidays past
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's a time warp, a bittersweet one, strolling
past the Santaland animated display in the abandoned Lazarus
building. As I stand before the charmingly dated figures, with
their Twiggy eyelashes and herky-jerky movements, I can close my
eyes and almost take myself back to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. That bustling mechanical universe reminds me of all the
fun I had downtown as a kid _ but it also reminds me there was once
a bustling universe inside the store as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sign hanging above the display window trumpets, ``This
Space for Lease.'' Event posters from 1996 are taped to dusty
doors. A graffiti artist proclaims, cryptically, ``Downtown exposed
for can of corn it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   If only a time warp could take us back to the days when the
window display was the latest in animated technology. Shopping
downtown was the big outing of our family Christmas season. That
holiday department store smell _ a hybrid of perfume, candy and
evergreen _ hit you like intoxication the minute you walked into
Rike's. We waited in long lines to sit on Santa's lap; we
thoughtfully budgeted our purchases. How to buy gifts for everyone
with our fistful of money? A certain enterprising sister came up
with the solution: a package of combs, a practical gift for the
entire family.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to be ungrateful _ the display windows are nice and
nostalgic, and the city is trying _ but there's something
depressing about having a Santaland window, but no Lazarus. And no
Santa. For Santa, you have to go to the 'burbs, or to the downtown
Elder-Beerman on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we're lucky to have a downtown department store left.
The specter of Elder-Beerman's closing its Courthouse Plaza store
looms over us like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is America and we have the right to shop where we
please. But it's tough to make the argument that we're a big league
city and we deserve a minor league baseball team and a flourishing
Riverscape if we can't sustain even one downtown department store.
</P>
<P>
   Fight those mall crowds all you want. I'm heading downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 1: It's pleasant. You don't have to park several
football fields away from the store. You don't lose your Christmas
spirit elbowing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 2: You can make shopping an outing, an adventure,
with your kids. You can bribe them into good behavior with a visit
to the model train display in the lobby of the Kettering Tower, or
a visit to Elder-Beerman's Tike's Shop (yes, another relic from the
old Rike's).
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it an event with our kids,'' says Maureen Pero,
director of the Downtown Dayton Partnership. ``We go for a horse
and buggy ride and buy tickets for The Nutcracker. My kids hate
shopping, but if we say, `Lets go downtown,' for them it's a
Christmas event. It's more of a celebration of the holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 3: There are cool shops that aren't standard-issue
mall offerings, like the artists' gallery at DVAC or arty home
furnishings at Go Home. ``Downtown isn't the mall, and it's not
going to be the mall,'' Pero says. That's not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 4: Downtown needs us, and we need downtown.
</P>
<P>
   We can gripe all we want that city leaders aren't doing enough
to revitalize downtown, but they can't do it without us. The
throngs of families who enjoy the Grande Illumination on Courthouse
Square every year are a reminder of what the holidays downtown once
were.
</P>
<P>
   And could be again.

 &HT;    Annual Book Fair was like old times for Mad Dog, Inc.
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Third Annual Book Fair in Austin, Texas, recently it was
like old home week for me and a rabble of my old running buddies.
In case you haven't heard, I've got a new book just out and in
discerning book stores across the state;
</P>
<P>
   so, I was invited to this year's Book Fair as a ``featured
author.''
</P>
<P>
   Title of my new book is ``Confessions of a Maddog,'' (U. of
North Texas Press) referring to a group of Texas writers (writers
of song and story) who in our younger and friskier years in the
1960s and '70s formed a sort of social and literary club called Mad
Dog, Inc., Motto: ``Doing indefinable services to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Our slogan was: ``Anything that's not a mystery is guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   Members included such stalwart ``famous authors'' as Bud Shrake,
Gary Cartwright, Dan Jenkins, Jerry Jeff Walker and his wife,
Susan, Willie Nelson, and...well, you get the idea, I suppose. As
someone has written somewhere lately we were, ``a group of
hard-working and harder living writers of story and song.''
</P>
<P>
   We did enjoy ourselves much of the time back then and, due to
the rather eccentric character of most, if not all, the Mad Dog
membership, a close observer could recall, if he chose to do so, a
whole bunch of, shall we say, amusing tall tales that were mostly
true.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to do so, and my new book is the result.
</P>
<P>
   So, anyway, I was invited to participate in the Third Annual
Texas Book Fair thing in Austin, an event chaired by Laura Bush to
raise money for state libraries from book sales and a high priced
dinner the opening evening. The dinner this year starred Larry King
as master of ceremonies and famous authors David Halberstam and
Frank McCourt reading from their books.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam is a Pulitzer Prize winner who has written several
best sellers and McCourt's latest book, ``Angela's Ashes,'' has
been on most best seller lists for months.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't attend the dinner. Even us famous authors had to pay
$200 per for that deal so I chose to pass it up. But my sources
told me it was a success. Bud Shrake, who's nobody's patsy as far
as expressing his opinions, what ever they are, told me Halberstam
was ``very interesting'' and McCourt was ``a real performer.'' This
equaled a rave review because Shrake bores pretty easy.
</P>
<P>
   My appearance was on Saturday in a room in the capital
building's new extension, which was described by the same Bud
Shrake as looking like it was designed by Albert Speer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Albert Speer?'' I asked simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who was Hitler's architect,'' Shrake explained kindly.
``Not the one who lives over in Woodville.''
</P>
<P>
   We were at the time searching for the conference room in the
capital extension where we would help form a panel to discuss the
``Mad Dogs'' discussed in my book, ``Confessions of a Maddog.'' We
were to be accompanied on the stage for the panel discussion by
other Mad Dogs: Gary Cartwright, Larry L. King and Jan Reid, all
fairly well known writers of one sort or another.
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed by the enthusiastic response we got. I remembered
that after
</P>
<P>
   my first book came out some time ago, granted and in different
circumstances, my autographing sessions at bookstores were less
than crowded. In Waco at one bookstore there, the manager had free
Cokes set out beside the table where my books and I sat, ready with
pen in hand to smile and autograph, and the only person who paid
any attention was a small boy who wanted a Coke and was jerked away
by his father who frowned as if I might be a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   But in Austin at the Book Fair, the room where we told our Mad
Dog tales held a standing-room-only crowd, and in the signing tent
afterward all my books available were sold, and during our panel
discussion the crowd actually laughed out loud time and again and
broke into applause once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   My wife said she had more fun that day than she's had since our
wedding, which was attended by the same people who were on the Mad
Dog panel.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know for sure what that means, but it's probably
significant in some fashion.

 &HT;    Sandwiched by tradition
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNY, Ga. _ One of the obvious effects of global
warming is that years are a lot shorter than they used to be. When
I was growing up and waiting on another visit from Santa Claus,
Christmases were at least as far apart as world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Now a year is nothing but the Fourth of July, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving and Christmas all run together, not counting birthdays
and all the other days merchants set aside for special sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to start planning for Christmas,'' my wife said as
soon as she picked up the pre-Thanksgiving Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't be,'' I replied, thinking that the carcass of last
year's Christmas tree is still hidden behind the shop where she
can't see it. I've been meaning to take it to the dump first chance
I get.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you like for Christmas dinner?'' she asked.
``Pimento or tuna?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the world are you talking about?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a modern Christmas meal for a change,'' she
answered. ``Turkey and dressing is old-fashioned. Sandwiches are
in, turkey is out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas without turkey and dressing wouldn't be Christmas,''
I said. ``Who ever heard of sandwiches for Christmas dinner! Where
do you get those crazy ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the newspaper,'' she replied. ``It says here that a
fourth of the people who have Christmas dinner at home eat
sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She handed me the newspaper. There it was, on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``... According to a study in American Demographics, 25 percent
of Christmas home diners eat sandwiches, 11 percent eat pasta, and
10 percent beef.'' Probably hamburgers from McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe it now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be what somebody found out in a survey,'' I answered,
``but I can't believe they put stuff like that in the newspaper,
much less on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,`` she said. ``I think it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is true, the newspaper shouldn't print it,'' I
said. ``When I worked for the newspaper we had responsible,
patriotic editors. We'd never put something detrimental to the
country on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is printing a change in holiday eating habits detrimental
to the country?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because families are the fabric of the nation, and it's
destroying the fabric of families,'' I explained. ``Christmas
dinners with turkey and dressing, mashed potatoes, giblet gravy,
English peas, fruitcake and ambrosia with plenty of coconut and
cherries are one of the fundamental traditions that have made this
country great.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think this is a real threat to society as we know
it,'' I continued, ``just look at the ideas that story put in your
head. What you are talking about is doing away with Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   I reminded her of Christmas at Aunt May's house in Fayetteville,
Ga., where the extended family gathered for all-day togetherness.
We started early with Uncle Harry's eggnog, followed by three
shifts at the dining room table and then cigars in the living room
for the men while the ladies washed dishes and napped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine Aunt May serving pimento cheese and tuna
sandwiches?'' I asked. ``She'd have died a slow and painful death
before she'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be, but I think the new menu will appeal to a lot of
grandmothers,'' she replied. ``I spend at least three days cooking
and baking for our Christmas dinner. Then it's gobbled up in a half
hour so you and the boys can get back to either watching a football
game on television or working on an old tractor. I don't get
through washing dishes and putting things up until after
suppertime. I wonder if it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's worth it!'' I exclaimed. ``It's so festive.
It's spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just imagine,'' I sneered, ``all us sitting around the
dining room table, holding hands and saying the blessing over
pimento and tuna sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want sandwiches. we could call Domino's and have
pizza delivered,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to talk this way,'' I said, ``but I think there is a
good possibility God will punish us if we have sandwiches or pizza
for Christmas dinner. Christmas is supposed to be a religious
holiday, and I don't see how we can be religious or respectful if
we don't have turkey and dressing like God intended. I think it
says somewhere in the Bible that it's illegal to serve sandwiches
for Christmas dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you feel so strongly,'' she said, ``we'll stick with the
traditional turkey and all the trimmings for another year, provided
you make a few Christmas resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like peeling the potatoes, helping set the table, peeling the
oranges and grating the coconut for the ambrosia and helping wash
the dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   I agreed. I didn't have a choice. I wasn't going to surrender to
sandwich makers who stole Christmas.

DRINKING PROPOSAL IS NO PICNIC IN THE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All this time I've been hiding my bottles of
Ridge Zinfandel in the picnic basket and drinking out of paper
cups. I didn't know it was legal to drink in the park.
</P>
<P>
   You mean I could have been drinking out of real wine glasses and
not drinking my beer like a bum from brown paper bags?
</P>
<P>
   That was my first reaction when San Francisco Supervisor Amos
Brown introduced an ordinance banning alcohol in certain San
Francisco parks with a history of alcohol and drug abuse problems.
He said it's aimed at chronic drunks, those who ``don't have
getting up on their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Playground, Garfield Park, all the parks in the
Mission have a problem with drunks sitting down all day,'' said
Ethel Newlin of the St. John's Educational Center in the Mission
District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being drunks, they urinate, defecate and do all the things you
have to do if you sit in one place all day, and in a real small
area where these little children play.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a no-brainer to ban drinking in such parks,
right? Wrong. This is San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's going to be a fight,'' said Brown, whose
proposed drinking ban in parks goes before the board on Monday.
``It's interesting that people are asking for an increase in the
quality of life, and yet you have groups that don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this ban is adopted, will it be uniformly applied?'' said
John Crew of the American Civil Liberties Union, sounding like a
guy who'd love to go to court if some yuppies were allowed to sip
Chardonnay in the Panhandle while a guy on Thunderbird got rousted
and sent on his way with a $76 citation.
</P>
<P>
   Crew demolished a previous ordinance against sitting on
sidewalks by arguing that it would have to apply to yuppies
drinking caffe lattes on sidewalks on Chestnut Street.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that the poor will be unfairly targeted by banning
drinking in homeless haunts like Boeddeker Park but allowing it in
tourist spots like Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said there are already laws against urinating in public and
public inebriation. ``People need to think very long and hard
before we pass new laws.''
</P>
<P>
   I've got a feeling we will. Or at least we'll talk very long and
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, publicity about the proposed ban on drinking in
parks will let people know it's legal to drink in parks _ certain
ones, at least until the ACLU goes into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew drinking was allowed in parks until recently,''
said Lou Maunupau, the energetic director of the Mission
Playground. ``The people who were drinking didn't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of them did. Police Officer Steve Thoma, who works
with Maunupau to make the once-troubled little park a haven for
kids, said, ``Guys drinking on the sidewalk would suddenly jump
into the park and say, `Hello, officer.'''
</P>
<P>
   He made a gesture of a drunk raising a bottle in toast.
</P>
<P>
   As the law stands, people can't drink on sidewalks, but they can
in parks. They just can't be inebriated in parks, or drink in park
buildings, playgrounds, restrooms or pools.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Raider of the Coalition on Homelessness said they
discovered this a few years ago when the police were citing
homeless for drinking in parks. ``The police were p----d,'' she
said. ``They began saying `How can we let tourists drink wine in
the park, and cite homeless for drinking 40-ouncers?'''
</P>
<P>
   The solution was simple, she said. ``Drinking would be banned in
the Panhandle and Stanyan Meadow at the end of Haight Street, where
historically the homeless drink. It wouldn't be banned in Sharon
Meadow where picnickers drink.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the ban is political. This is a town, after all, where
two mayors have lost elections because of the homeless and the
homeless still haven't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (Mayor Willie) Brown's third year in office, and it makes
it look like he's doing something so he can get re-elected,''
Raider said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Brown denies that the proposed ban on alcohol in
parks is aimed at the homeless. He says it's the result of careful
study and much input from a public concerned about its parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aimed at those who are a clear and present danger,'' he
said. ``We want safe and clean parks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol is a trigger to more problems,'' said Maunupau,
director of the Mission Playground. He wants to coach and teach
kids in safety, and his bottom line is: ``No booze, no guns, no
knives. I don't care what you do, but don't do it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maunupau runs a great little park. I just wonder what happens
when masses of al fresco drinkers are told to move along. I mean
before the ACLU takes the city to court.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legislative analyst says the ordinance may increase
``the safety and enjoyment of certain parks for responsible park
users.''
</P>
<P>
   But the analyst also says, ``This ordinance may have the
unintended effect of increasing the number of persons drinking in
adjacent streets and public places due to displacement from park
areas covered in the ban.''
</P>
<P>
   The homeless and the drunk are always with us, and now they may
be moving to our doorways, or joining our picnics in Sharon Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that pate de fois gras? I believe it goes with my Night
Train red.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, this ordinance is doomed.
</P>

<P>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ For almost five hundred years, through
earthquakes and war, the tiny Jewish community here protected a
cherished and precious deerskin torah from the 13th Century.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, they wrapped it like a baby and safely hid
it beneath roof tiles, along with 17th- and 18th-Century Venetian
wraps, a pair of gold-crowned Torahs and even a candelabra taken
down from the ceiling of the synagogue. In 1991, when the synagogue
took a direct hit from a Serbian shell, the religious treasures
were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the treasures of Dubrovnik were lost, not to
foreign armies or Croatian Nazis, but to a Croatian-American Jew
living in Manhattan. Dr. Michael Papo, now living on Singer Island
in South Florida, arranged for their restoration and display at
Yeshiva University in New York City, and then fought their return
to here to Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three years spent in court battles in New York and
the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the Jewish community here is quietly
celebrating the successful return of the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Members are also celebrating the support they got from the
Croatian government at a time when its leaders, both officially and
unofficially, are reviving symbols reminiscent of its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the same time a priest widely regarded as a Nazi
collaborator was being beatified, the Croatian government was
paying the legal fees of a New York law firm fighting Papo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a large debt of gratitude to the Croatian government
for helping,'' said Sabrina Horovic, daughter of the president of
the Jewish community here. ``We could not have succeeded without
that help.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo wonders at this success -- it might be a victory for
Horovic, but not for the Jewish community, he said. The treasures
are hidden away in Dubrovnik, where visitors aren't allowed a
glimpse of the famous Sephardic characters. There is no public
display, which is what Papo wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always planned to return them, providing the war ended and
they would be safe,'' Papo said. ``It's sad that people perceive
this as a fight between the Jews. It's a fight between a
congregation and an opportunist. Those people saw an opportunity to
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo traces his lineage to a courtesan in Queen Isabella's
court, who left Spain with the torah when Isabella expelled the
Spanish Jews -- the Sephardic Jews -- in 1492. (One theory has
Christopher Columbus as an expelled Jew.) Along the spine of this
torah is the word Tolentino, Papo's family name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those Jews came to Dubrovnik, after stopping in Italy, and found
an established synagogue, built on top of a narrow stone house.
It's one of the two oldest in Europe, built in 1408, and about the
size of the vestibule of the nearby Catholic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a host of anti-Semitic rules -- Jews could only hire
older women for housework -- Jewish merchants came from all over
Europe to settle in Dubrovnik, a thriving city-state on the
Adriatic Sea. For three centuries, they thrived and kept homes
decorated with European tapestries and embroidery from the finest
textile houses of Venice, Paris and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II began, and Croatia joined forces with
Nazi Germany, there were less than a dozen Jews left in Dubrovnik
-- including Papo's aunt and uncles. Papo and his father survived
an Italian concentration camp, his mother did not, and Papo vowed
to care for the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been the guardians for 500 years, now it was up to me
to keep it safe,'' Papo said. He was elected in 1987 as president
of the Dubrovnik Jewish community -- although he never moved back
to Dubrovnik after World War II -- for a two-year term. No
president was elected after him, until the mid-1990's.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Papo managed to get the religious treasures
out of Croatia. What is clear, however, is that in late 1994 and
early 1995 he somehow had them removed from the synagogue and sent
to Yeshiva University to be placed on display in its museum.
</P>
<P>
   Papo, who apparently removed the treasures without the
community's blessing, dismisses most of the Jews living in
Dubrovnik now as non-religious. He calls Sabrina Horovic ``an
ethnic rabble-rouser, and a thief,'' whose eye is only on the money
that can be raised using the Jewish treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented himself as the president of our community when he
went to the museum,'' she said. ``That wasn't true. But he said
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the exhibition was scheduled to close, Horovic's
father, Dr. Bruno Horovic, began writing the director of the museum
to arrange a way to bring the treasures back to Dubrovnik. Dr.
Horovic had been elected the community's president in late 1994,
and was re-elected both in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an answer in January 1995 and it gave us concern,''
Sabrina Horovic said. ``The director's question was, 'With all
respect, I don't know who is in charge of the Jewish community of
Dubrovnik, Dr. Horovic or Dr. Papo?'''
</P>
<P>
   She ended her letter with the message, ``let peace come to your
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, the museum agreed to return the treasure and Dr.
Horovic went to New York to accompany it home. But when he got
there, museum officials said they couldn't turn it over to him.
Papo had threatened to sue the museum if the treasure was returned
to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Papo did sue in New York State court.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming he was the sole living descendant of the Sephardic Jews
who acquired most of the treasures, he said neither the Croatian
government, nor Dubrovnik's tiny Jewish community could properly
protect the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, the Jewish community of Dubrovnik, the
Croatian government and Papo fought in court, both in New York and
in Zagreb, which is where a New York judge ruled the case should be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was moved, the case was lost, Papo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my fault that I couldn't get more public outcry. But I
tried. I spent three years of my life trying to protect it and I
failed,'' Papo said. ``The only good thing -- maybe people are
aware now of the Dubrovnik treasures and maybe nobody will be able
to steal them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Papo is sad that the treasures are hidden far from the
public's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claimed my father wasn't really very religious, that he
wasn't Jewish enough,'' Sabrina Horovic said, showing the pictures
of Dr. Horovic's 1937 bar mitzvah that were filed with the
</P>
<P>
   courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Papo) claimed the synagogue was completely destroyed and
wasn't a suitable place for the treasures,'' she said, showing
pictures of the fully intact roof which were filed with the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was repaired immediately after the war here by the Croatian
government because it was an important historical and cultural
monument,'' she said. ``In 1996 (when Papo filed suit), there was
nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The war between Serbs, Croats and Muslims in the former
Yugoslavia ended in December 1995 though there was no fighting in
Dubrovnik after 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community hired the lawyers to argue the case in
Zagreb while the Croatian government paid a law firm in New York to
handle the case there. It was the same Croatian
</P>
<P>
   government that had revived the use of the checkerboard shield
on flags and official documents. The shield had been the symbol of
the Nazi puppet regime during World War II when Croatian fascists
had killed thousands of Serbs and many of the Jews who lived in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the ethnic wars after the break-up of Yugoslavia,
nationalistic feelings are
</P>
<P>
   on the rise here and they have often turned discriminatory
towards minorities. Recently, Miss Croatia was dethroned after it
was discovered that she is Muslim. And one of the political parties
here used a picture of a Croatian Nazi leader on its posters during
recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Most in this fiercely Catholic country celebrated in October
when Pope John Paul II beatified a World War II priest often
accused of standing idly by while thousands were massacred.
Cardinal Alozije Stepinac converted hundreds of Jews and Orthodox
Christian Serbs to Catholicism during the war, leading some to say
he did what he could to save their lives and others to argue he
collaborated with the regime which had as its slogan, ``Kill a
third, expel a third, convert a third.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jews have not been the target of any recent discrimination
here and the government fought hard to recover the Jewish
treasures. The Horovics don't want to talk about the official and
unofficial nationalism in Croatia right now. Instead, they repeat
that they would not have recovered the treasures without the help
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   As each court in Zagreb agreed with the Horovics, Papo appealed
to the next higher court, until finally, in mid-1998, he had
exhausted all the courts in Croatia. A New York judge the decided
that the ruling from the Croatia Supreme Court would stand and the
treasures had to be returned to Dubrovnik. In mid-October, they
came home.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Horovic won't show them to visitors. As he climbs the narrow
staircase up to the
</P>
<P>
   synagogue, he talks about how carefully they must be protected.
He points out the cabinet where the most important torah will be
kept, once it is unpacked. He shows a visitor the bare hook hanging
from the ceiling where the candelabra will return. High on the
walls, grates hide small chambers where the community used to
insist women sit, hidden from the men of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the women sit in the back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, when they have services. There is only one rabbi in all
of Croatia, a country where there are only about 5,000 Jews --
living among 4.5 million predominantly Roman Catholic Croats.
Occasionally the synagogue in Dubrovnik holds lay services, without
a rabbi. But usually only for special holidays. With so few
members, many of them intermarried, there isn't much demand for
regular services.
</P>
<P>
   But Horovic and his daughter aren't concerned that the community
will die out. It's been
</P>
<P>
   smaller before. There were only about 10 Jews in Dubrovnik in
the 1980s. And no matter
</P>
<P>
   what, the tiny community will protect its treasures, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community of Dubrovnik has protected these
treasures for hundreds of
</P>
<P>
   years,'' Sabrina Horovic said. ``And we will protect them for
hundreds of years more.''

<P>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ For almost five hundred years, through
earthquakes and war, the tiny Jewish community here protected a
cherished and precious deerskin torah from the 13th Century.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, they wrapped it like a baby and safely hid
it beneath roof tiles, along with 17th- and 18th-Century Venetian
wraps, a pair of gold-crowned Torahs and even a candelabra taken
down from the ceiling of the synagogue. In 1991, when the synagogue
took a direct hit from a Serbian shell, the religious treasures
were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the treasures of Dubrovnik were lost, not to
foreign armies or Croatian Nazis, but to a Croatian-American Jew
living in Manhattan. Dr. Michael Papo, now living on Singer Island
in South Florida, arranged for their restoration and display at
Yeshiva University in New York City, and then fought their return
to here to Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three years spent in court battles in New York and
the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the Jewish community here is quietly
celebrating the successful return of the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Members are also celebrating the support they got from the
Croatian government at a time when its leaders, both officially and
unofficially, are reviving symbols reminiscent of its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the same time a priest widely regarded as a Nazi
collaborator was being beatified, the Croatian government was
paying the legal fees of a New York law firm fighting Papo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a large debt of gratitude to the Croatian government
for helping,'' said Sabrina Horovic, daughter of the president of
the Jewish community here. ``We could not have succeeded without
that help.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo wonders at this success -- it might be a victory for
Horovic, but not for the Jewish community, he said. The treasures
are hidden away in Dubrovnik, where visitors aren't allowed a
glimpse of the famous Sephardic characters. There is no public
display, which is what Papo wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always planned to return them, providing the war ended and
they would be safe,'' Papo said. ``It's sad that people perceive
this as a fight between the Jews. It's a fight between a
congregation and an opportunist. Those people saw an opportunity to
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo traces his lineage to a courtesan in Queen Isabella's
court, who left Spain with the torah when Isabella expelled the
Spanish Jews -- the Sephardic Jews -- in 1492. (One theory has
Christopher Columbus as an expelled Jew.) Along the spine of this
torah is the word Tolentino, Papo's family name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those Jews came to Dubrovnik, after stopping in Italy, and found
an established synagogue, built on top of a narrow stone house.
It's one of the two oldest in Europe, built in 1408, and about the
size of the vestibule of the nearby Catholic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a host of anti-Semitic rules -- Jews could only hire
older women for housework -- Jewish merchants came from all over
Europe to settle in Dubrovnik, a thriving city-state on the
Adriatic Sea. For three centuries, they thrived and kept homes
decorated with European tapestries and embroidery from the finest
textile houses of Venice, Paris and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II began, and Croatia joined forces with
Nazi Germany, there were less than a dozen Jews left in Dubrovnik
-- including Papo's aunt and uncles. Papo and his father survived
an Italian concentration camp, his mother did not, and Papo vowed
to care for the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been the guardians for 500 years, now it was up to me
to keep it safe,'' Papo said. He was elected in 1987 as president
of the Dubrovnik Jewish community -- although he never moved back
to Dubrovnik after World War II -- for a two-year term. No
president was elected after him, until the mid-1990's.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Papo managed to get the religious treasures
out of Croatia. What is clear, however, is that in late 1994 and
early 1995 he somehow had them removed from the synagogue and sent
to Yeshiva University to be placed on display in its museum.
</P>
<P>
   Papo, who apparently removed the treasures without the
community's blessing, dismisses most of the Jews living in
Dubrovnik now as non-religious. He calls Sabrina Horovic ``an
ethnic rabble-rouser, and a thief,'' whose eye is only on the money
that can be raised using the Jewish treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented himself as the president of our community when he
went to the museum,'' she said. ``That wasn't true. But he said
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the exhibition was scheduled to close, Horovic's
father, Dr. Bruno Horovic, began writing the director of the museum
to arrange a way to bring the treasures back to Dubrovnik. Dr.
Horovic had been elected the community's president in late 1994,
and was re-elected both in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an answer in January 1995 and it gave us concern,''
Sabrina Horovic said. ``The director's question was, 'With all
respect, I don't know who is in charge of the Jewish community of
Dubrovnik, Dr. Horovic or Dr. Papo?'''
</P>
<P>
   She ended her letter with the message, ``let peace come to your
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, the museum agreed to return the treasure and Dr.
Horovic went to New York to accompany it home. But when he got
there, museum officials said they couldn't turn it over to him.
Papo had threatened to sue the museum if the treasure was returned
to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Papo did sue in New York State court.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming he was the sole living descendant of the Sephardic Jews
who acquired most of the treasures, he said neither the Croatian
government, nor Dubrovnik's tiny Jewish community could properly
protect the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, the Jewish community of Dubrovnik, the
Croatian government and Papo fought in court, both in New York and
in Zagreb, which is where a New York judge ruled the case should be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was moved, the case was lost, Papo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my fault that I couldn't get more public outcry. But I
tried. I spent three years of my life trying to protect it and I
failed,'' Papo said. ``The only good thing -- maybe people are
aware now of the Dubrovnik treasures and maybe nobody will be able
to steal them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Papo is sad that the treasures are hidden far from the
public's eye.

wasn't Jewish enough,'' Sabrina Horovic said, showing the pictures

</P>

HERE ARE MORE WRONG PREDICTIONS FOR 2000 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the next millennium (which apparently still will have two
l's, two n's and two separated m's and i's) approaches, we are
likely to get all kinds of bad advice and unreliable predictions
from all kinds of folks _ as well as from the usual suspects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's more than likely. It's as much of a certainty as
Bill Clinton's next fib, as Saddam Hussein's next outrage, as
commercial television's next bad network sitcom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at least David Kristof and Todd W. Nickerson have saved us
some time by collecting a lot of wonky (and engaging) predictions
in a new book from Andrews McMeel Publishing, ``Predictions for the
Next Millennium.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They sent out some 6,000 postcards to world famous people asking
for their forecast of what would happen between 2001 and 3000 (the
latter, as you know, being the year that the statute of limitations
runs out on Don King's hair as well as the year Ken Starr's
investigation of the Clintons is scheduled to be wrapped up). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kristof and Nickerson got some 650 of these cards back, of which
some 250 made the book. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So on page 164 you've got the late author James Michener (who
was still alive when he answered the postcard) saying he has ``not
much hope'' that humanity will avoid war or crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And on page 187 you find novelist Peter Straub predicting
``devastating new viruses and diseases.'' To say nothing of author
Joseph Wambaugh's prediction on page 169 that the printed word will
vanish and ``with it the act of sober reflection.'' (Maybe, but if
you ask me there are plenty of printed words around today _
including some in this very newspaper _ that reveal a complete lack
of sober reflection or even much inebriated reflection.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there's former baseball manager Earl Weaver on page
249, full of wild pessimism, predicting a pennant for my team, the
Chicago Cubs, some time before 2500. Earl is way off. The Cubs will
win a pennant before 2000. You heard it here first _ or second, if
Harry Caray's ghost beat me to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But maybe best of all is comedienne (which is French for
comedian) Joan Rivers on page 9 predicting that ``in the new
millennium interest rates will be higher and my breasts will be
lower.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for my money Rivers is one of the few in this book who
really understands the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that's clearest about the future is that no
one can predict it worth a hoot. Why, professional meteorologists,
using equipment that sucks up the electrical juices of whole dams,
can't even tell us with much accuracy whether it's going to rain
tomorrow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it's easy for me to predict with a high degree of accuracy
that most of the predictions in ``Predictions for the Next
Millennium'' will be proved wrong _ unless I mean proven wrong, in
which case you'll have to send me a note about the difference
because I can't remember and barely even care any more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that leads me almost directly (nothing is entirely direct in
this column) to my new millennium predictions. You can take these
to the bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ People will write books full of predictions for each new
century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Other people will find employment writing semi-interesting
newspaper columns about these books of predictions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost no one will ever check to see which predictions came
true. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Absolutely no one will remember what the columns about this
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW: A GOOD IDEA, BUT ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for devotees of the independent counsel law to throw
in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, way back there in the aftershock of Watergate,
the idea seemed to make sense. We have a government official who is
suspected of official wrongdoing; we set up an investigation by an
individual who owes no allegiance to the official being
investigated; and we give the investigator free rein and unlimited
resources to gather evidence and pursue appropriate prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   We call the investigator an ``independent counsel'' to formalize
his status as someone who is beholden to no one except the public
that pays his salary.
</P>
<P>
   It made sense.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one drawback to this seemingly sensible idea: It
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   As we saw just the other day when a Washington jury found former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy not guilty of all 30 corruption
charges against him, independent counsels too often turn out to be
nothing more than runaway freight trains fueled by political
agendas and outrageous sums of taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Donald Smaltz spent four years and $17
million prosecuting Espy on charges of freeloading off the
bankrolls of businesses he regulated, and what was the result?
Well, the result was exactly the same as it is with so many of
these out-of-control witch hunts conducted by independent counsels:
Oops!
</P>
<P>
   Or as Gilda Radner used to say: ``Never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Espy violated appropriate standards of
conduct by accepting gifts such as Super Bowl tickets and trips
from people he should have kept at arm's length. Espy has admitted
as much.
</P>
<P>
   Even Washington's resident Mr. Ethics, President Clinton, could
see that Espy had messed up when reports surfaced about his
penchant for grabbing all the freebies he could get his hands on.
Less than two years into the Clinton presidency, Espy was shown the
door.
</P>
<P>
   As some voters might recall, Clinton had promised during the
1992 campaign that he would assemble the most ethical
administration of all time. Students of Clinton's performance as
governor of Arkansas were still guffawing over that one when Espy's
ethical lapses cost him his place among Clinton's ethical
all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Espy may have demonstrated the ethics of a
cockroach, he apparently was smart enough to conduct his risky
business within the limits of the law. Prosecutors took two months
to present their case against Espy; jurors took just two days to
determine that the prosecution's case didn't cut the mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a good investment of 17 million public dollars?
</P>
<P>
   Why, if we'd given that money to Ken Starr, he might have turned
up another Clinton sex partner or two.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is another story, needless to say, but he is also a
spectacular example of the rampant lunacy that has been unleashed
by the independent counsel law. Starr was supposed to investigate
Clinton's involvement in a long-forgotten Arkansas real estate deal
and ended up rooting through the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   The tab for Starr's independent counselship is frequently
estimated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million _ and
growing larger by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fascinating to watch Starr prosecute Clinton in a
real American courtroom before a jury of real American citizens.
Would Starr's seemingly endless investigation justify itself _ or
at least rationalize itself _ by producing a conviction for perjury
or some such crime?
</P>
<P>
   Or would the defendant walk, just as Espy did the other day?
</P>
<P>
   But even if the allegations against Clinton were to be validated
by a jury, would the conviction be worth the cost of obtaining it?
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran-contra investigation wasn't worth what it cost. The
Espy investigation wasn't worth what it cost. Starr's investigation
can never justify its cost, no matter what happens from here on in.
</P>
<P>
   This law that once seemed like a good idea has turned into a
national disaster. There has to be a better way to keep our public
officials honest.

REDGRAVE SISTER GETS THE ATTENTION SHE DESERVES IN `GODS AND

<P>
   DALLAS _ The woman looks, well, severe: scowling face, hunched
shoulders, quick-shuffling walk, Hungarian accent that seems
designed to make the horses whinny.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't match the other woman: tall, refined, casually
elegant in a beige pantsuit, speaking with a British accent as
soothing as a kitten's purr.
</P>
<P>
   They're the same woman: Lynn Redgrave as Hanna the housekeeper
in ``Gods and Monsters,'' the acclaimed new film; and Lynn Redgrave
the actress, gently complaining about the lack of heat in Dallas'
Inwood pub.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave has been trying on different characters for more than
30 years, from her pudgy-girl-looking-for-love breakthrough in
1966's ``Georgy Girl'' to the badinage of the early '80s sitcom
``House Calls'' to her role as a patient companion in 1996's
``Shine.'' ``Gods and Monsters'' stands among her best movies, a
delicately witty story about the last days of James Whale, the
director of the first two Frankenstein movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McKellan, in one of the year's best performances, plays
Whale, who is openly gay in 1957 Hollywood _ a time when most
show-biz homosexuals were staying safely in the closet. Redgrave
plays his devoutly Catholic housekeeper, who is fervently loyal to
Whale even though she believes that his lifestyle is condemning him
to hell. Brendan Fraser rounds out the leading cast as a straight
gardener who strikes up an unlikely friendship with Whale.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave drew on her own childhood nannies for inspiration, one
from her early years in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nanny _ she wasn't Catholic, but she said her prayers every
night.'' Redgrave says.''She was often quite irreverent about what
God was up to, but she very devoutly believed in God and the
speakings of the church, though not a Catholic. And she had that
kind of salt-of-the-earth wisdom that Hanna certainly has. She may
not have had a formal education, but she knows things. And she may
not understand them, and she may not like them, but she's loyal in
spite of it all. My nanny was like that; my nanny had that kind of
loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's best scene, Hanna and Whale are watching a TV
airing of Whale's ``The Bride of Frankenstein'' while Fraser and
his buddies watch the movie at their favorite bar. Director Bill
Condon examines the characters' reactions, including Hanna's moral
disapproval of the 1935 monster movie. Condon imbues this and other
scenes with a bemused affection for Hollywood history and for
moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave's participation in the project seems appropriate, with
her family's own potent Hollywood connections. Father Michael
Redgrave made his first film in 1938 and came to Hollywood in 1947;
sister Vanessa was most recently seen in ``Deep Impact''; brother
Corin and nieces Jemma Redgrave and Natasha and Joely Richardson
are also busy actors. While making ``Gods and Monsters,'' Redgrave
thought most about her father, especially with the movie's
references to closeted gay director George Cukor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was in Hollywood first in the '40s, doing `Mourning
Becomes Electra,' and I knew George Cukor,'' she says. ``And my
father was very much part of the George Cukor circle and the
parties and the whole thing. And so it was, suddenly reading all of
that, and realizing that my father must've known James Whale, he
just must've. But my father's gone; my mother's 88, and she doesn't
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the family remains cordial, but not that close. Much
has been made of the differences between the relatively sedate Lynn
and the fiery Vanessa, who rose in movies almost simultaneously.
But Redgrave says that she and her sister are getting on fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of us knows how the other one ticks, but
that's not unusual,'' she says. ``I think that most families find
out that it's actually rare for brothers and sisters to be close,
close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Redgrave has remained busy, she has kept a
relatively low profile, acting on stage and appearing in
commercials for Weight Watchers, a program that she says she firmly
believes in and that she credits with helping her through a rough
patch after getting fired from ``House Calls.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, Redgrave enjoys the quiet times; she even
built a cabin on her land where she can get away from family when
she needs time to think or write or just listen to music, her
favorites being British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (her
cousin), opera diva Cecilia Bartoli, pop-rocker Sting and
Renaissance music. Although she is a child (and a sister and an
aunt) of show business, Redgrave's favorite activity doesn't seem
very Hollywood at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love to spend time with my husband. I really just
love the times when we do nothing, I love the early mornings, I
love having cups of tea and talking. We've been married 31 years,
and he's still the most interesting person I could ever talk to.''

ABORTIONS INCREASE SLIGHTLY AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (From Thursday night's file: in last graf, CORRECTS percentage
among women who had abortions to 59 percent white from 9
percent.)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of substantial declines, the number of abortions
performed in the United States increased very slightly in 1996,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,221,585 abortions reported to the CDC in 1996, a
0.9 percent increase from the 1,210,883 reported in 1995 _ but
still 15 percent below the 1,429,577 peak reported in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion ratio also rose slightly, to 314 from 311 for every
1,000 live births, in part because the number of live births was a
little lower. The rate of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44
remained at 20, the lowest rate since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, half the states reported fewer abortions
in 1996 than in 1995, and half reported the same or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to predict the pattern of abortions in the
future,'' said Lisa Koonin, the CDC's chief of surveillance for
reproductive health. ``The movement was less than one percent, and
that kind of variation in health statistics can be differences in
reporting, or a leveling off after years of declines. And it's
important to put it in context by remembering that the rate of 20
abortions per 1,000 is unchanged and the lowest since 1975. But we
still have a major public health problem of unintended
pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Population experts said it would be several years before it
became clear whether the number of abortions would continue to
decline, or whether that trend had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that the 1997 abortion data will show a
significant rise, said Stanley Henshaw, deputy director of research
at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research group that
collects parallel abortion statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at the preliminary 1997 data from 26 states and
New York City, and what they show collectively is a leveling off,
maybe a small decline from 1997, and that there's not going to be
any big increase,'' Henshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate on what the numbers mean. ``It's not
easy to explain no change, which is basically what this is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The slight rise in abortions was particularly puzzling given
that there has been a sharp decline in the number of abortion
providers over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and others have said that the factors contributing to
the overall decline in abortions since 1990 may have included
reduced access to abortion, changes in attitudes about abortion, a
decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies, and changes in
contraceptive practices like the increased use of condoms by young
women and the use of long-lasting methods like Norplant and
Depo-Provera.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, 55 percent of all abortions were performed
during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, and about 88 percent
were in the first 12 weeks, the same as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And as in previous years, 59 percent of women who had abortions
were white, 80 percent were unmarried and about 20 percent were
under 20.

HOW TO MANAGE WHEN STRESS WON'T TAKE A HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holiday bliss or the same old annual anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   What with church pageants, school plays, visits from
cheek-pinching relatives and the pressures of dividing time between
different members of families that have split, what should be a
time of great cheer often becomes extremely stressful for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think particularly during this time, a lot of core issues
... the difficulties we have with families tend to come up,'' said
Phillip Mountrose, author of ``Getting Thru to Kids: Problem
Solving with Children Ages 6 to 18.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the issues we haven't resolved come to the foreground, and
the unfortunate part is, we usually don't have the additional tools
needed to get through those,'' he said. ``We know we're unprepared,
and so we get anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountrose and others say it becomes all the more important for
parents to pay attention to signs of stress so that they can better
manage their anxiety and that of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the holidays simply happen around them, children
undoubtedly will be stressed,'' said Diane Arnold, vice president
of education at Children's World Learning Centers. ``If children
have an opportunity to participate in all the facets of making your
holidays special, then holidays will be a joyful time and will
impart precious memories that will be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease the holiday stress, Mountrose and Arnold offer parents
these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn how to listen better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid lecturing. Share your thoughts and feelings in a way
that will help your child, in a way that is not domineering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find ways to appreciate your child, regardless of any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage children to make gifts for special friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use gentle humor at every possible turn to help children
reframe their stressful thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about a problem situation and acknowledge the child's
feelings.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SINGLE-VOLUNTEERS (Washington) _ The 3,500 members of Single
Volunteers of D.C., which was founded in March 1997 by Dana
Kressierer and Catharine Robertson has a different take on the
dating game: if you're going to spend time and effort to meet
someone but come away empty-handed, your energies won't have been
wasted if you've done good works while looking. And that means
doing all kinds of work, everything from delivering meals to
homebound people with AIDS to building houses to pulling ivy off
the monkey house at the National Zoo. By Alex Witchel. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DATE-BAIT (New York) _ Date Bait is a brutally efficient,
high-tech mixer that tries to ease the sting of face-to-face
rejection by using a computer to make matches. Created two years
ago by Rafael Risemberg, a dateless psychology professor who was
weary of the bar scene, Date Bait has become a huge draw among gay
men in their 30s and 40s, and the Saturday night events, held at A
Different Light bookstore on West 19th Street, are often so crowded
that dozens are turned away at the door. By Andrew Jacobs. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-JAZZ-KAFE (Moscow) _ Regulars from Moscow's nighttime
demimonde call it ``Kafe.'' Mick Jagger, who popped in four nights
in a row while here on a concert tour this summer, referred to it
simply as ``Jazz.'' By whatever name, the Jazz Kafe, which is
Russia's trendiest nightclub, seems to be one of the country's few
crisis-proof businesses. By Vijai Maheshwari &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAY-FASHION (Undated) _ My color has come into its season: gray
is the new black, as you've no doubt heard, decreed by the
panjandrums of fashion. This fall, the least attention-seeking, in
many ways the saddest, color has become the toast of Seventh
Avenue. It's everywhere, from the pages of fashion magazines to the
clothing racks at Saks or the Gap. By Stephan Talty. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MATCHMAKING-SERVICE (New York) _ What's an aging, still-single
former deb to do? The traditional route to marriage for many social
types brought up in the world of debutante balls and Southhampton
summer houses is to meet a mate through introductions by friends or
family or at country-club parties and black-tie charity affairs.
But what happens when a woman has spent a decade or more in this
insular world and still come up empty-handed? For many, the answer
is a last resort so outside their social ken that it is barely
mentionable: a matchmaking service. And the matchmaking service of
choice for the post-deb in New York is It's Just Lunch, who have a
reputation for attracting preppy men with good manners, no facial
hair and substantial incomes. By Monique P. Yazigi. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the 1970s, composting was all the
rage, an earth-friendly way to get rid of ``garbage'' and to create
a material in which plants would revel. Lots of people took up the
cause, and lots of them stopped doing it. True, composting is a
natural, self-regulating process, bound to succeed. Even so,
problems sometimes arise along the way. By Lee Reich.  &QL;

1999 ACURA TL3.2: SMART CAR WITH A STUPID NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology brings us wondrous things, not all of which are worth
the effort it takes to deal with them. For example, let us consider
the automobile navigation system, at once a wonder, a distraction,
a frustration, a convenience, and a hazard. The most sophisticated
among them rely on satellites aloft and computer hardware with a
prodigious bank of computer memory on the ground to pinpoint your
car's location on the planet within a couple of feet and guide you
unerringly to your destination. Yeah, right!
</P>
<P>
   Some systems are tied in to cellular telephone networks, can
detect trouble such as a crash or hijack and summon aid. Some are
just navigation tools. Today's case study is the Acura Navigation
System, this time installed on Acura's newest, the 1999 TL 2.5, a
very smart car with a very stupid name.
</P>
<P>
   It is Thanksgiving morn and I am heading north to a dinner
appointment. Way north. I know the main route, the alternate
routes, the shortest of shortcuts as well as I know the way to my
refrigerator. So, what better test for a guidance system than to
match its electronic expertise against hard knowledge (and besides,
I carry a bulging map case that would make AAA envious). The
weather is . . . dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the ignition and the VCR in center dash wakes up,
displays Mother Earth aglow amid the twinkling firmament. Select
the menu and commence the exercise; punch in the destination a
letter at a time by touching the appropriate members of the
alphabet displayed on the screen. The computer Imp refuses to
recognize anything but York, Maine, which is not where I want to
go.
</P>
<P>
   I drive a bit, park, resume negotiation. Nada. I'll try later; I
do not have time to waste and I've already spent more time than it
would take to copy a Delorme map by hand. I select ``map'' and let
the illumined array track my progress _ my way.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a handsome four-door equipped to the nines _ the
navigation system is the only option offered. The car derives half
of its idiotic moniker from the 3.2-liter, 24-valve VTEC engine
under the hood, a quiet 225-horsepower mill that has one drawback;
if you try running on an interstate without using cruise control,
you are asking for a ticket _ the TL's a creeper, as in creep up
the speedometer dial. The 4-speed automatic transmission with its
fuzzy logic is already adapting to my driving style and the
handling is quick, precise. I like this car.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray, Maine, I have gained a little time in the light
traffic, stop to program a route _ success! The Imp admits to
knowing the whereabouts of Kingfield and the little animated arrow
points me north on Interstate 95. In Auburn, I pull onto Route 4 _
OK so far _ and then left onto East Hardscrabble heading for Hotel
Road. This is not exactly wilderness; it runs along the edge of an
airfield. But, I am off the ``digitized road,'' thank you _ as far
as the Imp is concerned, I am in Terra Incognita. Shades of Henry
the Navigator!
</P>
<P>
   The things this instrument knows _ in view of what I'm learning
it doesn't know _ are surprising. It recognizes Crash Road, not
where I really want to drive in the rain and it's raining. The
windows suddenly begin fogging up and I need to jack up the air
conditioning to clear them _ which means hitting the AC button next
to the screen, thus turning off the Navigator Imp and bringing up
the work order for the Comfort Elf. One must tap the appropriate
boxes on the illuminated screen to effect ``climate changes''
within and I might as well be trying to change the weather without.
Visibility clouds to urgency and I pull over while madly rubbing
the windshield with a sleeve. After a while, the climate control
begins to cooperate. I prefer knobs to this high-tech tactile
switching nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   At New Vineyard I notice a change in weather character _ snow is
falling and there is an accumulation of something viscous
underfoot, demanding a reduction in speed. But the Imp does guide
me into Kingfield. End of Test I.
</P>
<P>
   Test II is finding Rochester, N.H. You may recall that on a
previous encounter, it didn't seem to be listed. Today, it exists,
if you have time and patience enough to wade through all the
options offered before the Imp will recognize it. But the
Navigation Imp and I disagree mightily on how to travel there and
the Imp finally gets annoyed with the number of recalculations
asked and quits in a huff. Just as well; no matter how low I adjust
the screen illumination, it's still an annoying distraction glowing
at me.
</P>
<P>
   Test III is finding a route from the Globe to the Museum of
Transportation, a veritable urban maze that challenges the stoutest
of tourists. The Imp is on top of the game; he points me south to
Gallivan Boulevard, along Morton, the Arborway, directly to target
_ except the Imp miscounts the exits at a traffic circle. The
reverse is a flop. On exiting the museum, I am directed to go to
the ``designated route,'' which is undecipherable on the maze
presented _ you can zoom these little things into big things but
I'm in traffic now. And although I'm retracing the route in, I am
now ``off the route.''
</P>
<P>
   I reprogram for Rochester, N.H., and, am directed to make a
``slight left turn'' where there is no turn, then another ``slight
left turn,'' which is a Y intersection, and then I'm off the route.
Recalculate. This pattern continues until finally the Imp goes to
lunch and the map freezes. Somewhere on I-95, the system shuts down
and I am able to coax the Imp out of his snit and find South Main
in Rochester. The Imp succeeds but selects the wrong exit off the
turnpike from a traffic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, folks, are wonderful for negoiating
well-known dense urban areas _ boy, does the Imp know Portsmouth,
N.H., well! But, if it's to the boonies you are trekking, buy a
map, Bunkie. The Imp does not do boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   The TL3.2 is roomy enough, has a decent trunk, some interior
storage and, with the exception of climate controls with the
navigation option, is fairly convenient to operate. At $27,950 plus
$455 delivery, without the Imp, it's the equal of some much
higher-priced iron. Add $2,000 for the navigation system if you
like expensive, aggravatiing toys _ but two grand would buy a heap
of maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura TL3.2 scores on performance, luxury, handling, and
fuel economy; it delivered 26.44 miles per gallon over 928 measured
miles. Thus, it would seem to score fairly well on value, too.
</P>
<P>
   Final insults. It is overcast; I turn on the headlights and the
navigation screen goes dark, showing nothing but accumulated finger
smudges. No amount of fine-tuning the light levels and screen
brightness results in sufficient illumination. Good thing I know
how to get where I'm going. Coming home, the Imp plots the course,
guides me faithfully to within six miles, then falls asleep. I jar
him with the recalculation prod. Great car, lousy pathfinder.

SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate over saving Social Security shifts into
high gear this week at a two-day White House conference, but
already groups are hardening their positions on the most
controversial remedy _ adding individual retirement savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, a new alliance of 39 business and conservative
groups urged Congress to allow Social Security payroll taxes to be
diverted into such accounts, which could then be invested in the
stock market and government securities. Private accounts would
``give every single working American a piece of the American pie,''
said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, an opposing alliance of some 170 leaders of
organized labor and groups representing minorities, women and the
disabled condemned ``those who would turn Social Security over to
Wall Street,'' as AFL-CIO President John Sweeney put it. ``This
isn't a debate over how to reform Social Security,'' he charged.
``It is a faceoff over whether Social Security should exist or not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-worn doomsday projections undergird the debate: By 2013 if
nothing is done, the Social Security payroll tax alone will not be
sufficient to cover benefits, and the government will have to dip
into the interest on the system's trust fund. By 2021, it will have
to dip into the fund's principal, and by 2032, the fund itself _
now valued at about $756.9 billion _ will be depleted, and the
payroll taxes will provide only enough to pay 75 percent of the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is demographic. More people are retiring early and
they're living longer. And the payroll taxes of the 40 million
members of Generation X _ born between 1965 and 1980 _ will not be
sufficient to finance the 76-million strong Baby Boom generation _
born between 1946 and 1964 _ when it begins retiring in large
numbers around 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the fence in the middle is the conference's
host-in-chief, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from several Democratic constituencies, the
president has said he will keep an open mind on private accounts.
And he has argued that projected budget surpluses should be
preserved until the nation decides what it wants to do on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise Clinton has kept silent, much to the consternation
of key Capitol Hill Republicans such as House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. Fearful of getting
blindsided on a touchy social issue, Republicans such as Archer
want to see the White House play its hand first.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the climax of Clinton's year-long cautious
strategy of taking part in nationwide town meetings about Social
Security, hearing the debate but making no commitments.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for reporters last week, White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling called the conference a ``pivot point''
designed to ``bring people together'' and avoid ``polarization.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Clinton wants to forge a consensus on Social
Security and avoid the 1994 health-care debacle. That year the
White House in secret created a complicated plan to extend coverage
to the uninsured, only to see it plummet to a spectacular death in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and congressional
leaders will open the conference. Some 50 senators and House
members will attend along with some 250 experts and advocates from
universities, organized labor, business and senior-citizen and
youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration will beam the proceedings via
satellite into some 60 mini-conferences being held in all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   In touting the idea of private accounts, business and
conservative groups and organizations such as Third Millennium
(representing Gen-Xers) call them as a logical panacea for what
ails Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too many Americans there is no `three-legged stool,'''
said Richard Thau, head of Third Millennium, referring to the
traditional triad of retirement income: personal savings, pension
benefits and Social Security. ``It's just a pogo stick called
Social Security. Personal accounts will give tomorrow's retirees
the ability to draw from Social Security plus savings. All their
retirement eggs will not be in one basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Third Millennium is co-sponsoring a ``Billion Byte March,'' an
online march on Washington in which pro-private-account messages
from ``demonstrators'' will be released en masse to congressional
offices next month.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement account advocates have strong allies on Capitol Hill.
In addition to most Republicans, Democrats such as Rep. Charles
Stenholm of Texas and Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska are outspoken supporters of such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Backers deny that they want to abolish Social Security. They say
that even with private accounts, a government-run safety net of
traditional Social Security benefits would remain in place.
Retirees would continue to receive some income from the government,
and Social Security benefits for the disabled and elderly surviving
widows and widowers would remain untouched, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Employers fear that without the private accounts, the government
might hike the Social Security payroll tax, which is now 12.4
percent, split evenly between employer and employee.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, Social Security Commissioner Kenneth
Apfel said Clinton has ``strong reservations about a major
payroll-tax increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the private accounts dispute assurances that
society's most vulnerable citizens _ elderly widows and widowers,
the disabled and orphans _ would not be harmed by them.
</P>
<P>
   Under several privatization plans now before Congress, they
note, retirement ages would rise to 70, cost-of-living allowances
would drop and middle-class Americans would be subject to a 35
percent or more cut in guaranteed benefits, leaving them little
margin for error if the stock market nosedives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatizers are basically saying `trust us,''' said Roger
Hickey, co-director of the liberal Institute for America's Future.
``They have not specified how their plans would work, and the poor
or middle-class (people) unlucky with investments would be
subjected to a welfare-level `safety net' benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey added: ``That's not what Social Security is about. Social
Security is about having enough to retire on with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson borrow the
language of fiscal conservatives in arguing that the nation could
grow its way out of a projected Social Security deficit through a
booming economy that adds workers and employers paying payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these opponents support a plan offered by Robert
Reischauer, former head of the Congressional Budget Office now at
the Brookings Institution, and Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at
Brookings, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, the government would continue to pay Social
Security benefits, but the trust fund would be bolstered through
government investment in an array of assets, including stocks. A
quasi-independent agency similar to the Federal Reserve Board would
oversee all investments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With an impeachment vote likely in the House this week,
relations between Clinton and Congress have hit bottom. But both
sides clearly want to fix Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are anxious to overcome the hurtful
image emanating from last month's elections that GOP lawmakers are
obsessed with scandal and do not care about issues important to
average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is anxious to put his stamp on what will be landmark
legislation, if only to offset the stigma of the Monica Lewinsky
sex scandal. ``He needs a legacy,'' said Sharon Canner, a Social
Security expert at the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats appear to agree that 1999 provides the
best political window to do something about Social Security. As
Sperling put it, next year _ coming at the close of Clinton's
second term with a relatively strong economy and no national
elections until November 2000 _ ``offers a unique opportunity to
address this.''

UNEXPECTED JERSEY CITY DISCOVERY WHETS APPETITE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
 CITY-TRAVEL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. - Jersey City hasn't changed much, it seems.
Oh, the ethnicity has changed from when my great-grandmother lived
there with a whole community of Norwegians.
</P>
<P>
   Now, buildings are scrawled with Spanish words and stores
occasionally flash some Korean.
</P>
<P>
   But the streets and buildings look the same: brownstone
apartments, old three-story wooden homes, and streets lined with
first-floor shops.
</P>
<P>
   Bus fumes and knotted traffic add to the nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   I mention these because _ although travel writers tend to wax
eloquent about the big tourist destinations and travel sections in
the nation's newspapers tend to cover mainstream events with
``what-to-see'' stories emphasizing places with giant smiling mice
or beachfront hotels _ a great deal of our travel is in between the
places we actually want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I came to New Jersey to find cheap lodging for the nights
while spending the days in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But travelers learn that sometimes there are treats where you
least expect them, that come unbidden to you while you wait for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City sits at the western ends of the Lincoln and Holland
tunnels. Buses collect commuters in the mornings and ship them
through the din and stench of the tunnels into the Port Authority
Terminal at 42nd Street, where they herd down the stairs into the
subway station.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the whole process reverses.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City is a long, skinny town, built along the crest of the
southern end of the Palisades, those high, black basalt cliffs that
line the Hudson River on the Jersey side.
</P>
<P>
   It is old, with alternating layers of autumn leaves and
fast-food litter, like the strata of archaeology, bound together
with soot.
</P>
<P>
   It is connected to Newark by the Pulaski Skyway, that archaic
two-mile bridge _ a black web of girders and struts across the
lower end of the Hackensack River and one of the great monuments
from that great age of American highway building in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   My motel was reasonably clean and nice, much nicer really than I
had expected in Jersey City _ I was prepared for a real dive _ but
though it was nice, it still displayed the standard New York/New
Jersey grime-and-dried sputum-covered concrete, complete with a
garnish of cigarette butts, along the stairs and sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, I ventured out into the sea of cars once
more to find supper for real.
</P>
<P>
   At the crest of the hill, I found a tiny Puerto Rican restaurant
on J.F. Kennedy Boulevard. It is called the Candlelite Cafe, and it
is about 10 feet wide, with a white tile floor. Along the left wall
runs a counter with some stools and a display case filled with
pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Along the right wall runs, well, the right wall. There is no
room for anything more. They managed to squeeze in some travel
posters, but anything thicker than that and there'd be no room for
paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   I knew right off it was worth it: The smell was thick and spicy
_ the combined fragrance of hot cooking oil and (begin ital)
achiote. (end ital) The woman behind the counter was smiling and
friendly. An older man sat at the last stool dividing his attention
among the newspaper spread out on the counter, the Spanish-network
news on the TV up on the wall, and a cup of coffee. He turned out
to be the cook's husband.
</P>
<P>
   These little shops are what make a place like Jersey City. The
city is old; it is not one of these new plasterboard and stucco
cities that seem to pop up all over the West. These cities were
built when to build still meant to build to last. So, instead of
tearing things down and putting up yet another Denny's, they use
the old buildings and recycle the businesses in them.
</P>
<P>
   The front window displayed a pan of fried chicken, some pork
chops and several varieties of bread that I'd never seen before,
along with a menu sign that listed the day's specials in chalk. The
(begin ital) biftek encebollado (end ital) looked good, so I went
in, sat down on a stool and ordered it.
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked at me funny. My Spanish is not good, but I
didn't think it was that bad. I repeated it in Spanish and then in
English _ beef with onions?
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have that, she said, looking at me funny. I pointed
to the chalkboard, and she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was yesterday,'' she said, figuring out what I meant.
``Today, we have stew.''
</P>
<P>
   I let on that stew would be quite nice, so she served it up: a
plate piled high with yellow rice, beans and fried plantain, with a
side bowl of stewed beef and potatoes. It smelled heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   I downed it with a bottle of Goya Malta, a beverage whose
existence had eluded me until then. It is sort of like an unbrewed
beer drink, only very, very sweet. It had the flavor of a
carbonated iron tonic. It sounds terrible; it looked terrible. But
when I tasted it, to my surprise, it was very good, and, what is
more, it was the perfect accompaniment to my Puerto Rican beef
stew.
</P>
<P>
   We talked over the meal, and the husband chimed in periodically,
pointing to something interesting on the TV news. A hurricane
headed for Honduras, someone he knew knifed at a service station, a
political ad for Al D'Amato, aimed at the Hispanic voter. The
husband laughed.
</P>
<P>
   I answered their questions about Arizona. They were eager to
tell me about Puerto Rico. He loved it; it was his motherland. She
was a little more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Nelly Cintroan. Her non-Hispanic name was the name
of the nurse in the hospital where she entered this planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to Puerto Rico. It's beautiful, but I never want to
drive there again; the traffic is worse than here. The roads are
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the husband admitted. His name was Angel. ``Puerto Rico
is only 100 miles long and 70 miles wide. To drive that far here
takes what? I made a delivery last week to Hartford (Conn.), and it
took me two hours to get there. In Puerto Rico, you're lucky if you
get there by next week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that bad,'' Nelly responds, ``but it's close. And the
road over the mountain. It's all up and down and around.'' She
makes her hand into a karate chop and wiggles it around like a
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars go around the corners like this and this and you
don't know what is around the curve'' _ at this point, her left
hand makes an alternate wiggling fish and plunges into her right
hand _ ``like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go there sometime,'' Angel says. ``You'll love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``You'll love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The meal leaves me stuffed like a salami. It is the best thing I
have eaten in five days on the road and sets me back an entire
$5.75. ``That's too cheap,'' I complain. ``You can't stay in
business that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no. It's fine. We Puerto Ricans know how to get the most
from a dollar,'' Nelly says.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless I leave behind a very fat tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you cooking tomorrow?'' I ask just before leaving. &QL;

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM: WE DON'T CARE _ WHY SHOULD THEY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the Federal Election Commission auditors are asking for
repayment of almost $25 million from the Republican and Democratic
parties for ``soft money'' violations during the 1996 Clinton-Dole
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Big woo.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone really believes this will serve as a wakeup call for
either party to straighten up and fly right, please stand up and
state your name for the record. There are some telemarketers who
would like to sell you a time-share in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Substantive change that is actually in the interest of the
American people happens only one way in Washington: when the voters
get ticked off enough about an issue that they contact their
elected officials and read them the riot act _ often and loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a great groundswell of public outrage and
indignation about the obscene amount of money going into political
campaigns, Congress will continue to ignore campaign finance
reform. It's not in the overall best interest of either party to
start mucking around with a system that, frankly, both of them
abuse with equal impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, now the third most influential
Democrat in the House and a consummate fund-raiser for himself and
his party, cut to the chase this week when he told our Editorial
Board that campaign finance reform is not likely to be an issue
when the new Congress convenes in January. Elected officials
respond to the electorate _ that's how the game is played. And when
an issue barely raises a blip on the radar screens of the voters,
you can bet Congress isn't going to go out of its way to do
something on its own volition _ even if it is the right thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, voter apathy has reached such a height that folks can
hardly drag their sorry rears to the polls on election day. Why
should anyone think they will pick up a phone or a pen to let their
duly elected representatives know that government is being
corrupted by the scandalous amount of money being funneled to
candidates in the guise of ``soft money'' to political parties?
</P>
<P>
   Our current system of political gaming allows virtually
unrestricted soft money contributions _ money that lobbyists use to
gain access to and influence with politicians. The United Widget
Welders of North America give a hefty chunk of change to the
Democratic Party for use in ``issue ads,'' and the next thing you
know, the Widget Welders have subsidies. (I admit to choosing
widgets and Democrats willy-nilly; feel free to substitute the
special-interest group and political party of your liking.)
</P>
<P>
   Or turn it around. Unrestricted soft money allows the political
parties to extort large contributions from corporations and
organizations that will need help in upcoming legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Q. Citizen, who is in desperate need of
assistance from his elected official to clear up a problem with
some governmental snafu in his life, can't get beyond a
receptionist in a district office.
</P>
<P>
   And we wonder why people don't vote.

STORIES BEHIND THE VIVALDI-PLAYING MAN AND OTHER FAMOUS TV-SHOW
CLOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some are legendary: MTM's famous mewing kitty, which was a
takeoff on MGM's roaring-lion logo. Some are self-explanatory: the
howling wolf that adorns shows from Dick Wolf Productions. Some are
even lame, from companies you'd expect would be flashier, such as
Aaron Spelling productions.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about TV production-company logos, those little
few-second blips that come after the conclusion of shows such as
``The X-Files'' and ``Ally McBeal.'' They're like a tiny dessert
after the episode's main course, and true fans know to stick around
through the closing credits, just for those few curious moments.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the more popular ones and what they mean:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TEN THIRTEEN
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``The X-Files'' and ``Millennium,'' both created by
Chris Carter
</P>
<P>
   The image: The words ``Ten Thirteen'' are projected in blurry
black and white (with the sound of a projector running) as a
child's voice says, ``I made this!''
</P>
<P>
   What it means: Ten Thirteen represents Carter's birthday: Oct.
13, 1956 (references to this are continually slipped into ``The
X-Files''). The voice belongs to Nathan Couturier, son of
supervising sound editor Thierry Couturier. Nepotism is out there.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DAVID E. KELLEY PRODUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago
Hope''
</P>
<P>
   The image: A granny in a rocking chair is watching TV. When she
clicks the remote, the words ``David E. Kelley Productions'' whoosh
out of her TV, knocking her backward. As she falls over, she
exclaims, ``You stinker!''
</P>
<P>
   What it means: According to a Kelley spokeswoman, the woman is
Kelley's 97-year-old grandmother, Mildred, and that's her saying
``You stinker!'' _ one of her favorite phrases. Kelley lived with
Mildred while he attended law school, and he remains close to her.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MUTANT ENEMY
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   The image: The hand-drawn Mutant Enemy wording appears as an
animated cut-out zombie ambles across the screen, saying, ``Grr!
Aarrgh!''
</P>
<P>
   What it means: ``Mutant Enemy'' comes from words that ``Buffy''
creator Joss Whedon stenciled on his first typewriter when he was
15 (no one seems to know WHY he did that). Whedon did the zombie
animation, and that's his voice too.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BOCHCO PRODUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``NYPD Blue''
</P>
<P>
   The image: A man furiously plays a violin as the company logo
appears, written in script.
</P>
<P>
   What it means: The man is Rudolph Bochco, Steven's father and an
accomplished violinist. He's playing a snippet from Vivaldi's
``Four Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN LEVITAN PRODUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``Just Shoot Me''
</P>
<P>
   The image: Silent film of a small child being tossed in the air.
</P>
<P>
   What it means: Levitan looks back on his childhood. That's him
as a kid; the snippet was filmed sometime in the early to mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   UBU PRODUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``Spin City''
</P>
<P>
   The image: Right now, it's just the company logo and a still
photo of a black Labrador retriever with a Frisbee in its mouth.
But it's better-known in the incarnation that became famous after
creator Gary David Goldberg's ``Family Ties,'' which featured this
exchange: ``Sit, Ubu, sit.'' ``Woof!'' ``Good dog.''
</P>
<P>
   What it means: Ubu, who belongs in the logo hall of fame next to
the MTM kitty, was Goldberg's dog when he was in his late 20s and
early 30s. The real Ubu is gone, but he lives on in the company's
logo. The audio is still around, despite its disappearance from
``Spin City'' this year. ```Spin City' just did that to cut down
the time,'' says Heather Greene, Goldberg's assistant. ``They also
trimmed back the Lottery Hill (see below) and DreamWorks logos,''
she adds, referring to the show's other two production companies.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that's not Ubu doing the woofing. That's Goldberg's
sound editor. But it is Goldberg giving the commands.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   LOTTERY HILL
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``Spin City''
</P>
<P>
   The image: A childlike, pastoral drawing of a farm, with little
barns, trees in the background and rolling hills that run over the
logo. Over this, a voice says, ``Moo.''
</P>
<P>
   What it means: Lottery Hill is ``City'' star Michael J. Fox's
production company; it's named after his childhood farm in Vermont.
Fox selected the design from several submitted by John Segal, an
acquaintance of Fox's. That's Fox saying, ``Moo.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MAD COW PRODUCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Airs after: ``The Daily Show''
</P>
<P>
   The image: A drawing of a cow, with only the lips moving as it
states: ``The cow says ... mooooo'' like an old See 'N' Say toy. At
the end, the cow rolls its eyes slightly.
</P>
<P>
   What it means: It's a tribute to Madeleine Smithberg, one of the
``Daily's'' executive producers. ``I wanted something that had
`Mad' in it,'' says Smithberg, ``because people call me `Mad' for
short. `Mad Dog' was already taken, which was disappointing,
because I thought it would have been really cool. But then I
thought of the `mad cow' thing running around.'' Graphic designer
Nan North designed the logo as a gift for Smithberg; the voice
belongs to an unknown sound technician. Smithberg says it'll be a
little different on the ``Daily's'' Dec. 13 year-ender: ``Because
we did so much on Clinton, it now says, `The cow says I revert to
my former testimony.' ''

SOCIAL SECURITY IS A THING OF PAST FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND TEXANS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
 
By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ While millions of Americans worry and wonder
about the future of Social Security, the controversial federal
retirement program already is a thing of the past for several
thousand Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed 17 years ago, employees of Galveston, Brazoria
and Matagorda counties collectively jumped through a loophole in
federal law that let them opt out of Social Security and save for
retirement through a private annuity program.
</P>
<P>
   The program's promoters and participants say employees have made
out like bandits, averaging a 7.25-percent annual return vs. less
than 2 percent for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The success of what is called the Alternate Plan has led the
federal General Accounting Office to study it as a possible model
for reform of the troubled Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   People who stay in the plan _ which offers guaranteed return
rates _ for 30 to 40 years will draw monthly benefits of $5,000 or
more when they retire, managers predict.
</P>
<P>
   The program's guaranteed disability benefits, along with death
benefits that are three times an employee's annual pay, beat the
federal retirement program hands-down, managers say. The annuity
plan is coupled with a state-run pension program that provides
substantial retirement income to long-term employees.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years in the Alternate Plan, Carmella McTyre left her
job as Galveston County payroll supervisor in 1996 with about
$50,000 in cash savings on which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   For the 19 years she had spent in the Social Security program,
McTyre, now 62, gets $407 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She said she not only got more return on her investment in the
Alternate Plan but also had the comfort of knowing that no
politician could mess with her money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was there and it wasn't going to go into anybody
else's pocket but mine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Breslin spent 11 years in the Alternate Plan before
retiring from her Galveston County probate court job in 1993. She
had about $40,000 in cash with which to ease into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I wasn't too happy about getting out of
Social Security, having seen how well it took care of my nephews
and my sister when her husband died,'' Breslin, 73, said. ``So I
was reluctant, but after I got into it and I received it and got my
end of the stick, I was real happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has spent that money, which she took out in five
annual payments because she didn't know she could have extended the
payout over a longer period. Still, Breslin said, the money was a
big help.
</P>
<P>
   Each month now, she gets $580 in benefits from her 15 years in
the Social Security system, $360 in retirement from an early
railroad job and about $1,900 from the state-run pension program.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the Alternate Plan acknowledge that, if it were to
replace Social Security, safeguards would be needed to ensure that
people cannot withdraw their money over a short period and use it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a payout designed to make benefits last through long
retirements, an annual cost-of-living increase would have to be
included to make sure inflation doesn't eat up retirees' benefits,
supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would make some adjustments to meet the needs of a
national plan instead of a local plan,'' said Richard Gornto, whose
Houston firm, First Financial Benefits Inc., manages the plan for
all three counties.
</P>
<P>
   First Financial Chairman Don Kebodeaux, who designed the
Alternate Plan with Gornto, said it also would need a requirement
that the money be put into safe investments such as treasury bills
or federally backed annuities.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late Galveston County lawyer Bill Decker who, spurred
by widespread concern in 1979 over the stability of Social
Security, began looking for what ultimately became the Alternate
Plan, former County Judge Ray Holbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I thought it was kind of a hare-brained
scheme,'' Holbrook recalled recently. ``I was skeptical, but all
the numbers looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 401(k) investment plans familiar to employees of many
companies today, the plan precluded investment choices, thus
avoiding a situation in which some employees lose money while
others gain, Holbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Some commissioners and some county staff members jumped on the
bandwagon. But Holbrook said opposition persisted from many elected
officials, labor leaders, minorities and Democrats simply opposed
to dropping a part of the legacy of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt. &QL;

LAST YEAR'S TECHNOLOGY GOES OUT THE WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The real story on computers these days is in
the way the software/hardware folks are forcing users to replace
satisfactory equipment. Examples: I was using TurboTax for years on
DOS. All of a sudden TurboTax only runs on Windows. I was using
Juno for E-mail with a 386 motherboard. All of a sudden Juno will
not run on less than a 486. My Print Shop files will not transfer
to the new model. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voice In The Wilderness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WILDERNESS: So what should we do? Ignore any sort of
technological advance that might make your life a little bit
easier? You might as well sit in a cave, wondering why the fire
crashed and won't reboot (Hint: Add more random-access mahogany.)
</P>
<P>
   Innovation and obsolescence are integral parts of computing,
just as they are for every endeavor. They're a tad more obvious,
though, because the underlying technology seems to double every
couple of minutes. In fact, I've upgraded hardware three times
since beginning this paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's got a gun to your head, forcing you to use newer,
better computers and software. If you're happy with your
steam-powered clunker, just keep on using it, and pay no attention
to what's going on in the world. And if you can't find software to
do your taxes, find an accountant instead. Trust me, you'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What can the government really do to Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   _ Concerned Taxpayer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CONCERNED: Look, whatever the government does, you can be
sure it will take too long, cost too much and be exactly the
opposite of what the people really want.
</P>
<P>
   What the well-intentioned pinheads in the Justice Department
don't seem to realize is that even if Microsoft has been guilty of
strong-arming its way into every conceivable marketplace, any
attempt to break it up or restrain it will be disastrous for the
90-odd percent of the world that relies on Microsoft operating
systems and software. A monopoly has its advantages, especially
when you're trying to get all the computers in the world to speak
the same language.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Someone used my debit card number to purchase
$6.95 of online time with Playboy. His listed E-mail address was
(withheld)(at)usa.net (Playboy provided me with that). How can I
trace back to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bunny Boy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUN: Now you're sure you're not just writing this because
your wife saw the bank statement? If not, then you'd better figure
out who got hold of your debit card, and that should narrow it down
to a very few suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Always start at the domain, in this case usa.net, and see if
there's a home page. If you go to www.usa.net, you'll find one of
those companies that provide ``free'' advertiser-supported E-mail.
That means anyone in the world might own the account, but these
companies are just as concerned about fraud as you are. You can
fire off an angry letter to abuse(at)usa.net, but I prefer the
old-fashioned way: getting a real, live human on the phone. Find
their numbers on the site, and maybe they can help you nail the
little horndog.

<P>
   ``We were scared to death because it looked like it was
unpatriotic or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After holding meetings to explain the plan, Galveston County
employees voted 3-1 in late 1980 to adopt it. It took effect in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Brazoria and Matagorda county employees followed suit.
Employees of Texas City and the Brazoria County Appraisal District
have plans similar to the Alternate Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harris County and about 50 other counties were ready to join
when Congress passed a bill in 1983 to `save Social Security,' ''
Holbrook said. ``That bill increased taxes, gradually raised the
retirement age and closed the door on other local governments'
withdrawing from Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was authored by then-U.S. Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Beaumont,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook, a lawyer and engineer, was elected county judge in
1966. He decided not to run again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the plan for 14 years before I retired and I was in
Social Security for 27 years,'' he said. ``What I get out of that
14 years is about two-thirds of what I get from Social Security. I
get about $1,100 from Social Security and about $700 from this
county plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best things I ever did in 28 years as county
judge, although at the time it wasn't that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Alternate Plan has its critics, chief among them
Democratic County Commissioner Wayne Johnson, a lawyer who has been
invited to participate in a White House summit meeting on Social
Security that begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot outlive Social Security benefits and you can
outlive the benefits of the Alternate Plan,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have employees literally quit their county jobs so they can
withdraw their Alternate Plan money to pay off credit-card debts or
bills they owe or make down payments on houses,'' he said. ``This
plan will provide more cash when you retire on a monthly basis, but
that's the only major advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes Social Security will remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 100 percent funded through the year 2032 and it would
take only a 2.2 percent increase in the payroll tax to make it
solvent for the next 75 years,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston County workers pay 6.13 percent of their wages into
the Alternate Plan, the same percentage they paid into Social
Security in 1980.  &UR;  &LR; The Social Security tax is 6.2 percent of pay.
 &UR;  &LR; The county match is equal to 7.78 percent of each employee's
annual pay.
</P>
<P>
   The return on the Alternate Plan has ranged from 5.5 percent to
14 percent over the years. The insurance company from which First
Financial bought annuities in the early 1980s filed for bankruptcy,
causing delays in some payments, but employees lost no money in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   The Alternate Plan reduces employees' taxes as well as providing
better benefits, Gornto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a worker dies at a young age, in some instances the
spouse can't even get Social Security survivor benefits,'' he said,
noting that the Alternate Plan's minimum death benefit is $50,000.
``Under this, it's automatic, with three times the salary paid
immediately upon death.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the Alternate Plan is a good retirement
program for most county employees, Johnson argues that Social
Security retirement, disability and death benefits are still more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   While the Alternate Plan could pay a lump sum of as little as
$50,000 to the family of a young worker who dies, Social Security
provides such a family up to $250,000 in long-term benefits,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security does not pay money in a lump sum that can be
squandered or lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems can be fixed, Alternate Plan supporters maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the country had a fully privatized plan like we have in
Galveston, anybody who works 40 years will get payments five times
greater than Social Security would provide,'' Kebodeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alternate Plan is expected to be discussed at the White
House summit. It ultimately could be the prototype of a new
national system, said U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-South Carolina, who
will participate in the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Change is needed because young people, especially, will be
short-changed without it, Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, for all workers paying into Social Security, the
average (annual) rate of return is 1.9 percent,'' he said. ``If you
go to people born after 1974, the rate of return is actually
negative. For every dollar they put in, they'll get less than a
dollar back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides politics and fear of change, transition costs are a huge
hurdle for those who would change the nation's retirement plan more
radically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should just dump Social Security and put in
a privatized plan,'' Gornto said. ``You should phase it in over 10
to 20 years, possibly a generation. There would be less money going
into Social Security from people under age 40, say, and more money
going into a privatized fund as time goes on.'' &QL;

   NOT ALL MERGERS ARE CREATED EQUAL
</P>
<P>
   In these days of proliferating mergers, it's many an investor's
dream: buying a stock, then picking up the paper the next day to
read that the company is being bought by a rival _ for a fat
premium.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone hoping for such a payoff should pay attention to what
industry they are buying into, because the takeover premiums vary
accordingly. On average this year, through Dec. 1, the offering
prices for drug-company targets were 35 percent above what share
prices had been a week before the deals became public, according to
Securities Data Co. That compares with a 9.4 percent premium, on
average, in offering prices for food companies.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for such differences? Thomas Burnett, director of
Merger Insight, a research firm, says the high premium for drug
companies reflects their prospects for steady growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're buying a highly confident growth-rate company, and
you're going to pay up for that,'' Burnett said. As for the food
companies, he suspected that they might have been bid up far ahead
of announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-premium business, as far as takeovers are
concerned, was the Internet, at 34 percent. ``That just represents
the mania of trying to get into the Internet business,'' Burnett
said.

   FUNDS WATCH: STRONG CAPITAL STARTS A NETWORK OF ITS OWN
</P>
<P>
   Strong Capital Management of Milwaukee has tossed its hat into
the funds network arena with a service that offers investors the
funds of eight other no-load families, without transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   The eight are Acorn, Ariel, Baron, Fasciano, Marsico, Oakmark,
Rainier and Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the network, named Prime Managers, receive a
consolidated monthly statement with cost and performance data on
each fund.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, with about $31 billion in assets, is the smallest fund
company to offer such a network. ``Strong has had a desire to be a
big player in the mutual fund business, and this is what the big
players are doing,'' said Susan Belden, editor of No-Load Fund
Analyst, a newsletter. The networks of giant firms like Charles
Schwab, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard offer hundreds or even
thousands of funds to investors and will continue to offer any of
the Prime Managers funds they currently do. By contrast, Strong's
network offers just 79, more than half from Strong itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Mackey, marketing manager at Strong, said the
network would distinguish itself by offering service and guidance.
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, will provide
information on the individual funds. ``We expect to be able to talk
about the details of those funds as well as, if not better than,
our own funds,'' Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   The network requires a $5,000 minimum investment per account,
charges a quarterly maintenance fee of $12.50 for accounts below
$10,000, and hits frequent traders with a $50 penalty for
non-Strong funds held less than 90 days.

LAWSUIT CHALLENGES PART OF ANTI-BILINGUAL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Supporters of bilingual education filed a
lawsuit in federal court to block a provision of the voter-approved
ballot initiative that requires California students to be taught in
English.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks to overturn a part of the
initiative, Proposition 227, that holds teachers, administrators
and school board members ``personally liable for fees and actual
damages'' in case of a civil lawsuit by parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposition 227 hangs over teachers' heads like the Sword of
Damocles,'' said Carole Shields, president of Washington,
D.C.-based People For the American Way Foundation, which is
co-counsel in the lawsuit. ``We should all be horrified that
teachers might be forced to lose their jobs, sacrifice their
families and even have their homes taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wrote Proposition
227, called the lawsuit ``a bit strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If teachers obey the law, nothing will happen to them,'' Unz
said. ``They only face risk if they willfully and repeatedly
violate the law. Individuals who refuse to obey other laws
certainly face consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz pointed out that a federal judge refused in July to block
implementation of Proposition 227, approved by 61 percent of the
vote on June 2. The law abolished most bilingual education programs
for California's 1.4 million children who speak little if any
English. It replaced such programs with English-only instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that these arguments are any different than
those raised before,'' Unz said of the previous lawsuit and appeal,
which is pending. ``I guess they feel if they repeat the same
argument enough times, they'll eventually find a judge who will
agree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the suit, however, say the proposition is not
clearly defined. They point to the wording in the law stating that
classroom instruction must be ``overwhelmingly in English,'' but
does not explain what ``overwhelmingly'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Brien, deputy director of the California office of the
People For the American Way Foundation, said the plaintiffs in the
suit are not attempting to argue the merits of Proposition 227.
Instead, he said, teachers need clear standards on how the statute
should be implemented, and need to know that if they make a
mistake, they will not face ``potentially devastating lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz, however, said that it is unlikely teachers would be
penalized. ``We really have always felt the most appropriate
targets of our action would be the senior administrators and
elected officials of schools that are not complying with the law,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other plaintiffs in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for
the Central District of California, include the California Teachers
Association, the Association of California School Administrators,
the Association of Mexican-American Educations and the National
Association of Bilingual Educators.
</P>
<P>
   The California Federation of Teachers, which is not a plaintiff,
also asserts that Proposition 227 is ambiguously written and poses
a risk to teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think folks who have been looking for vulnerabilities in 227
have found it in this provision,'' said Mary Bergan, head of the
55,000-member California Federation of Teachers. ``People have
questions about what `overwhelmingly' means. But, we've been
telling our folks to be very familiar with the law _ and obey it.''

   VENEZUELA-ELECTION-$ADV05 _ MIAMI _ Supported by millions of
peasants and shantytown dwellers, a failed coup leader is poised to
win the Dec. 6 presidential election in Venezuela, an important
South American country that provides most of the oil imported to
the United States. The prospect of a win by Hugo Chavez is
reopening old woulds in the armed forces and stirring worries that
the military may try to block his rise to power. The election is
being watched closely by the business community since Chavez has
run on a controversial platform that includes a pledge to stop
paying Venezuela's foreign debt. The Carter Center will be
monitoring the election that could prove to be a turning point in
Venezuela's 40 years of democracy. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CROATIA-TORAH-$ADV05 _ DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ For almost five
hundred years, through earthquakes and war, the tiny Jewish
community here protected and cherished a precious deerskin torah
from the 13th Century. During World War II, they wrapped it like a
baby and hid it beneath roof tiles, along with 17th and 18th
century Venetian wraps, a pair of gold Torahs and even a candelabra
taken down from the ceiling of the synagogue. In 1991, the
synagogue even took a direct hit from a Serbian shell. But in 1995,
the treasures of Dubrovnik were lost _ not to foreign armies or
Croatian Nazis _ but to a Croatian-American Jew living in
Manhattan. Dr. Michael Papo arranged for their restoration and
display at Yeshiva University in New York City, and then fought
their return to Dubrovnik. Now, after three years spent in court
battles in New York and the Croatian capital Zagreb, the Jewish
community here is quietly celebrating the return of the treasures.

visitor past this culinary assembly line. ``If there is an empty
corner in the White House, you will find somebody rolling cookies
there.'' Like Santa's elves, some White House staffers regard
Christmas preparation as a never-ending job. On Monday, First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton will unveil the 1998 Christmas theme and

Its top executives are thirtysomethings already thinking about
their next career moves, their bosses are financiers who know
little about health care, and their business model is young and
unproven. But make no mistake, the top hospitals in town are
worried about losing their most lucrative source of revenue _ heart
surgery _ to this upstart start- up from out of town. They will use

BELLAGIO: A WORK OF ART  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Bellagio, the most expensive hotel ever built (for
now), stands on the western edge of an 8.5-acre artificial lake.
</P>
<P>
   At regular intervals throughout each evening, lyrical sprinklers
animate the water.
</P>
<P>
   Framed through the falling mist and the twinkle lights
decorating the lakeside foliage, Bellagio appears every bit as
enchanting, romantic, stately and dignified as its TV commercials
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Erected by casino magnate Steve Wynn for $1.6 billion, Bellagio
is a luxury hotel, packed with luxurious amenities, planted in the
heart of America's capital of garish excess and low-ball thrills.
</P>
<P>
   It rises 36 stories above a glass-enclosed conservatory filled
with flowers, an elegant shopping gallery filled with Rodeo Drive
retailers, a gallery filled with artworks by famous painters,
restaurants filled with food prepared by famous chefs, and a
theater filled with wonder.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a casino. But Bellagio, which opened to the public
in mid-October, aspires to be more than Sin City's newest hot-slot
destination. That's a fleeting niche, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mandalay Bay, a $950 million hotel built around a tropical
theme, opens in the spring. The Venetian, a $2 billion resort
rising on the grounds of the fabled Sands, will debut shortly
thereafter. Later in 1999, Paris, a $750 million hotel fronted by a
50-story replica of the Eiffel Tower, will open across Las Vegas
Boulevard from Bellagio's front threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn launched his empire by first rehabilitating the downtown
Golden Nugget. Then came an Atlantic City Nugget, the Las Vegas
Mirage, a property in Laughlin and Treasure Island, also in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn knows that Las Vegas will grow ever-larger hotels. Mandalay
Bay will have 3,300 rooms; Paris, 2,900; The Venetian, eventually,
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio, with 3,000 rooms, is his stab at distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunes, a declining relic from Vegas' Rat Pack era, died to
make way for Bellagio, which ``is about things that are good for
the soul,'' Wynn has said. ``Fine art, gardens, flowers, fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from certain angles, Bellagio appears to be a departure
from the pedestrian-level temptations that still drive Las Vegas
life. Sufficiently bankrolled, it's likely possible to stay there
for days and never see a girlie-show pamphlet or be tempted to
indulge in a buffet pigout.
</P>
<P>
   The fine art may be the most striking diversion from the Las
Vegas ``style,'' defined until now by neon, lame and
cocktail-waitress cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn has assembled a fairly stunning little $300 million
collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, which is displayed in two
small rooms not far from the check-in desk.
</P>
<P>
   Short fences and honking motion detectors guard the artwork from
patrons who might not be conversant with the art world's
please-don't-touch-the-priceless-masterpie ces code of etiquette,
but the display otherwise is dignified and restrained, and would be
considered so even outside its context.
</P>
<P>
   Once you recover from the cultural whiplash of it all, it's
possible to establish a genuine relationship with the paintings,
which include a couple of Warhols and Renoirs, a Pollock, a
Matisse, a Monet, a Manet and a Gauguin, among others. Some are
from Wynn's personal collection; the house owns the others. Art
expert Edmund Pillsbury has advised Wynn on some of the
acquisitions, many of which are for sale. Reportedly for tax
purposes, Wynn is, technically speaking, an art dealer, and several
of the pieces displayed during the Bellagio's opening weeks already
have been purchased and removed.
</P>
<P>
   The collection's destination pieces, or the important paintings
that art lovers might travel long distances specifically to
inspect, include its Cezanne (``Portrait of a Woman,'' 1900), Miro
(``Dialogue of Insects,'' 1924-25), Picasso (``Portrait of Dora
Maar,'' 1942) and van Gogh (``Peasant Woman Against a Background of
Wheat,'' 1890), all of which still were displayed prominently
during ``The Arizona Republic's'' recent visit to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $10, and the gallery is open from 8 a.m. to
midnight every day. Staggered reservation times are assigned in
advance (888-488-7111) to keep the gallery appropriately populated.
</P>
<P>
   According to a hotel publicist, the art has averaged nearly
2,000 visitors a day so far, and plans were launched almost
immediately to configure bigger quarters. The display's popularity
has forced Wynn _ whose voice you hear in your headphones if you
take the audio tour _ to visit the paintings after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth _ and it's worth quite a lot, actually _
``Time'' magazine art critic Robert Hughes toured the gallery and
more or less deemed it not bad for a city ``where `Art' is normally
the name of someone's limo driver,'' he reported. ``And anyone who
looks down his nose at the whole enterprise as a piece of splashy
Vegas promotion ought to remember the origins of American museums
in the late 19th century, built up from nothing by self-taught
meatpackers and railroad kings who got good advice, took deep
breaths and opened their checkbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio's art collection isn't completely contained by the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A floral glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly _ titled ``Fiori di
Como'' , it's supposedly the largest glass piece ever blown _
covers a massive expanse of ceiling in the main lobby.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bellagio's eateries, Picasso, is a shrine to the artist,
whose original paintings, sculpture and ceramics look down on the
Mediterranean cuisine of chef Julian Serrano, formerly of the San
Francisco restaurant Masa's.
</P>
<P>
   Edible art is another of Bellagio's compelling draws. There's an
annex of New York's Le Cirque, a version of San Francisco's Aqua
and Boston's Olives, plus Chinese, Japanese and Italian
restaurants, a high-end steakhouse, a 24-hour cafe that's not quite
a coffee shop, and the obligatory buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's good-for-the-soul flowers fill the conservatory, located
just off the main lobby. The room debuted with a harvest motif, but
now is being transformed into a holiday theme, highlighted by a
Christmas tree decorated by none other than Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The theme will change with the seasons, and botany lovers will
flock to the flowers like bus-tour crowds to 99-cent shrimp
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   There and in the shopping gallery, visitors can witness one of
Bellagio's oddest attractions: natural light, which streams into
these public, non-gaming spaces while the rest of interior Vegas
remains as perpetually sunless as a tomb.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the upstairs accommodations revealed that the
Bellagio's just-folks guest rooms, which carry a publicized nightly
rate ranging from $159 to $459, rival a typical Ritz-Carlton in
understated swank, right down to the marble bathroom and oversize
soak tub.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these lower-story rooms already have been discounted
occasionally to $99, and a Bellagio spokeswoman said that rate
quotes can fluctuate several times in a day. Try your luck at
888-987-6667, and dig the Euro-pop music while you hold for an
operator.
</P>
<P>
   High rollers are housed on upper floors, where suites carry
listed nightly rates ranging from $375 to $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio might have been designed to echo the resorts of the
Italian Lake District, but its room corridors are typical Vegas: a
hub of central elevators feeds loooong spoke wings. The design
maximizes guest rooms with Strip views, but can make for seemingly
endless trudging.
</P>
<P>
   As Las Vegas' newest attraction, Bellagio veers from the
luxury-hotel model in one important way: Its public areas generally
are packed with gawking visitors from all social classes, retired
pensioners to millionaire NBA stars.
</P>
<P>
   Local custom dictates that many of these visitors tote highball
glasses or beer bottles around with them at all times, and not even
the Bellagio can buck local custom. Also, Las Vegas is still a
place where smoking indoors is not only tolerated, but nearly
expected. It's hard to picture, but Bellagio's talented gardeners
no doubt regularly fish flicked butts out of the floral finery.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's huge casino is new and nice, but for non-gamblers a
nerve-jangling casino nonetheless. If slots, cards, dice and the
wheel are your vices, the Bellagio won't turn you away.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're pushing a stroller en route to the tables. It's
been reported widely that security staffers at Bellagio's entrances
block unsupervised children, as well as parents with kids in tow
who aren't registered guests.
</P>
<P>
   This practice would seem to discriminate against thrill-seeking
teens and the stroller patrol, which until recently had been a
prime target for Las Vegas marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody got a problem with that? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anti-rugrats policy, the crowds mobbing Bellagio's
grounds on a recent weekend appeared to be only slightly more
upscale than comparable customers at The Mirage, Caesars Palace or
any number of class joints around town.
</P>
<P>
   As you tour the casino, lobby and conservatory, you say this to
yourself _ ``Hooker? Nah'' _ only slightly less frequently than the
Vegas norm.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the crowd improved noticeably in the wait queue
at ``O'', the Bellagio's theatrical experience, where many male
patrons wore coats and ties, and the women clearly came dressed to
impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'' defies descriptive language. Its dramatic spell will feel
familiar to anyone who's seen one of the Cirque du Soleil's
traveling tent shows, or Mystere, the Canadian troupe's permanent
show at Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is the ``O'' part, pronounced ``eau,'' as in
the French word for water.
</P>
<P>
   The Cirque's trademark acrobatics, clowning and surreal
storytelling occur in, above, beside and under a 1.5 million-gallon
pool of 85-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, players make their exits (begin ital) into (end
ital) the stage. For the first time ever, anywhere, synchronized
swimming isn't goofy, but artful and cool.
</P>
<P>
   The ``O'' dreamscape, which unfolds in a theater built to
resemble a gilded European opera house, is flat-out magical.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outrageous ticket prices ($90 for balcony seats and
$100 for the main floor, which largely explains the dressy crowd),
``O'' is one of the most aesthetically satisfying entertainment
values Las Vegas has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkler show out in the front-yard pond is free, however,
and when the waters are dancing to the tune of an Italian aria or
Sinatra classic, the effect can be just as serene.
</P>
<P>
   At such times, Bellagio transcends, even escapes, its setting.
</P>
<P>
   No small feat. &QL;

HYUNDAI'S NEW SONATA   LOOKS GOOD, PRICED RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hyundai rolled into the Museum of Transportation in Brookline,
Mass. to roll out its 1999 Sonata sedan for inspection by the New
England Motor Press. It looks good. It's priced right. The Korean
company is running hard to catch Japan, Europe, and Detroit in
quality while beating their ears off on price.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Halper, Hyundai's director of service,said the company
will ``concentrate on value and capitalize on quality improvement''
to improve its market position. Meanwhile, its Sonata is virtually
all new _ the cigar lighter is a carryover _ and while content has
gone up, O'Neill said, the price has not.
</P>
<P>
   (Content is a popular buzz word in the auto biz; it means the
standard equipment offered. When equipment is deleted, the car is
said to have been ``de-contented.'' To change equipment is to
``re-content'' while an upgrade is simply to ``add content.'' This
is all done in the name of ``adding value'' no matter which way the
contenting proceeds.)
</P>
<P>
   The standard version Sonata for '99 is available fairly well
equipped with a 2.4-liter 149-horsepower 16-valve I-4 engine and
5-speed manual transaxle for $14,999 plus $435 delivery. A 4-speed
automatic electronically controlled transaxle adds $800 to the
price. For the money you get front and side air bags, air
conditioning, AM/FM stereo/cassette, dual power mirrors, power
steering, tach, and power windows.
</P>
<P>
   If you require more, the GLS is available with a 170-horsepower,
24-valve 2.5-liter V-6 for $16,999 plus delivery with a 5-speed
manual, $800 more for the automatic. The GLS adds 4-wheel disc
brakes, heated mirrors, and some other niceties. Only the GLS
offers antilock brakes and traction control, and then only together
as part of a $3,225 option package including leather, power
moonroof, power driver's seat, and a CD player. That's still a lot
for the money, but it is viciously antisocial to tie availability
of vital safety options to purchase of nonvital, pricey luxuries.
After all, Hyundai's best customers are people on limited budgets
who can't afford pricey luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   The car looks good _ it's nicely styled _ offers reasonable room
for four adults, and appears well put together. The proof of the
pudding, as they say, is in the eating, so judgment is withheld
until after a taste test on the road.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The press announcements from Mazda about its Dec. 7 ``Out of the
Box'' awards party continue, bigger, bolder, and more informative.
In the latest installment, we learn that the six cutups listed here
last week are not the finalists; they are the judges. Previous
mailings failed to list the finalists (or the correct telephone
number).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finalists sound like interesting people who have
accomplished something, but I really have my doubts about Leanne
Schmidt, a Kentucky photographer whose specialty is requesting
subjects to disrobe and leap into a hot tub so that she ``can
photograph them tasetfully in the buff.'' Or the New Jersey guy
whose major contribution to World Civilization is breaking into the
``Guinness Book of Records'' for organizing 43,000 people to do
``The Chicken Dance.'' Honest, I'm not making this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   The info was accompanied by color photos, one of a very
attractive barefoot young woman clad in a ``tastefully'' low- cut
dress and lying atop a Mazda Protege. She was unidentified,
possibly because being very famous we're all supposed to know who
she is.
</P>
<P>
   So, what I'm anxious to know is why five people are willing to
come to a party in New York on Pearl Harbor Day for the chance to
be named oddball of the year by Dennis Rodman, undoubtedly an
expert on the subject _ and why do the other judges want to be seen
with this guy? And how does this sell cars?
</P>
<P>
   But this sort of ``Out of the Box'' publicity stunt is liable to
be one answer to the question: Why don't we automatically think
``great car'' when someone says ``Mazda''? After this escapade,
maybe General Electric should sue them for giving a light bulb a
bad name _ surely you remember GE's Mazda lamps?

CUTTINGS: ENDLESS COMPOST? SOME CURES FOR SLOWPOKE PILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Dec. 6)  
(th) 
 By LEE REICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1970s, composting was all the rage, an earth-friendly way
to get rid of ``garbage'' and to create a material in which plants
would revel. Lots of people took up the cause, and lots of them
stopped doing it. True, composting is a natural, self-regulating
process, bound to succeed. Even so, problems sometimes arise along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main complaint voiced by composters is that raw
materials turn to compost too slowly. This can usually be traced to
a limiting factor in what a pile is fed (that is, the raw
materials), water or air.
</P>
<P>
   Compost piles work most quickly if the two most important
foodstuffs _ nitrogen and carbon _ are in balance. Old, usually
brown and dry plant materials, like autumn leaves, straw, hay and
sawdust, are rich in carbon. The older the plant material, the
richer it is in carbon.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen-rich materials include succulent green plant parts,
like tomato stalks, vegetable waste from the kitchen and grass
clippings, as well as manures. Nitrogen fertilizers are
concentrated sources of nitrogen. They commonly are the active
ingredients in commercially available compost ``activators.''
</P>
<P>
   In autumn, the garden and yard generally yield an excess of
compostable materials rich in carbon, so to speed up compost piles
built now add supplemental nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even attempt to balance out nitrogen and carbon materials
too precisely, though. It's unnecessary, because microorganisms
will eventually balance out an excess of one or the other by
themselves, albeit slowly if the excess is of carbon foods.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to be too precise are also unfeasible, because other
factors come into play, like actual carbon and nitrogen
concentrations and the particle sizes of the raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Chopping up the raw materials is another way to speed up
composting, giving microorganisms more initial surface area at
which to chew away.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline or electric-powered shredders will do the job, but I
find a machete to be the most convenient tool for chopping coarse
materials, everything from corn and broccoli stalks to a springy
layer of bean plants. The machete does not leave materials
uniformly fine, but it takes up little storage space (it's stuck in
the ground near my compost pile) and needs no more maintenance than
an occasional filing of the blade.
</P>
<P>
   How fine you chop the pieces is up to you, but the finer they
are, the faster they'll compost.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent cause of a sluggish compost pile is
insufficient moisture. Sun and wind dry out piles that are
freestanding or enclosed by wire mesh. A solid-walled enclosure not
only helps speed things along by holding in moisture, but also
retains generated warmth, so decomposition can continue even as
outdoor temperatures cool. Water can be especially limited at this
time of year, when you gather quantities of often dry materials,
like autumn leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for insufficient moisture is, of course, to add water,
and the most effective way to do this is to layer raw materials,
watering each layer as you build, just enough to make the surfaces
glisten.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite condition, too much water, can also result in slow
composting. And soggy ingredients lead to two other common
composting problems: offensive odors and flies. When too much water
gets into a compost pile, air is displaced and a whole new set of
microorganisms goes to work, ones that work slowly and
malodorously.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for a waterlogged pile is aeration, accomplished either
by stirring the pile or by turning and rebuilding it. Rotating drum
bins make it especially easy to stir ingredients. My bin, made of
boards notched to stack like Lincoln Logs, also makes turning easy
because the sides go down and up as I remove or add ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   To keep moisture at the right level, I water my compost pile as
I add ingredients; then, when the bin is full, at about a four-foot
height, I cover the top with black plastic film to seal in the
moisture and keep out excess water from rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Odors due to poor aeration also result when piles contain an
excess of dense, succulent raw materials, like grass clippings or
kitchen wastes. With either of these materials, the odor problem is
compounded, because they are so rich in nitrogen. Any materials
rich in nitrogen vent off the excess as ammonia gas, unless some
carbon-rich materials are present to combine with the nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, turning the pile and adding some fluffy,
high-carbon material, like straw, puts everything in order. Some
gardeners actually build compost bins out of straw bales. As the
bales disintegrate, the straw conveniently balances out
nitrogen-rich materials in subsequent piles.
</P>
<P>
   To monitor compost progress beyond what your nose or time will
tell you, allowing you to make adjustments to an existing pile or
to know what to do differently next time, slide the long probe of a
compost thermometer deep within a pile's innards. Temperatures
within a pile that is at least 27 cubic feet and that is built over
the course of a few days can quickly soar to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit, or higher.
</P>
<P>
   No heat is an indicator of insufficient moisture, nitrogen or
air, or too small a pile. Under carefully controlled conditions,
composting can go from start to finish in as little time as two
weeks; I aim for finished compost in two to three months in warm
weather; seven to eight months for piles built now.
</P>
<P>
   Whether progress is fast or slow, and whether or not intense
heat is generated, any pile of living or once-living materials will
eventually turn to compost, and a few benchmarks signal just when.
Take the pile's temperature. Heat will no longer be generated. Look
at the compost. Most raw materials will have been transmuted into a
dark brown, crumbly fudge. Smell it. Finished compost has a
pleasant, woodsy aroma.

<P>
   Women everywhere this holiday season are out buying neckties for
the men in their lives. They might just as well be gift-wrapping
spittoons.
</P>
<P>
   December 1998 finds the American workplace more casual than
ever: Four out of five workers get to dress down at least one day a
week, according to Peter Simon of NPD Group, a market research
firm. And a recent survey of hiring executives by Management
Recruiters International found that 42 percent believe the suit and
tie will ultimately disappear. (Most of these doomsayers think it
will happen in the next 10 years.)
</P>
<P>
   Consider the situation at the Pro Player sports licensing unit
of Fruit of the Loom in Hudson, N.H. A company spokesman described
the place as so actively hostile to neckwear that it bans ties from
the premises. Until recently, the company had a rack in the lobby
where guests could park these primitive totems; the rack was
removed recently because no one ever turns up in a tie anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Times certainly have changed. In the days of afternoon baseball
and snap-brim hats, of hair oil and smoker's coughs, men who
pretended to any sort of social class wore neckties to ball games
and apologized for being in public without a suit coat. The necktie
was the emblem of masculine propriety. As Monica Lewinsky put it,
in grand jury testimony that must have rung bittersweet with
haberdashers everywhere, ``Ties were a big issue with us.''
</P>
<P>
   If neckties are an endangered species, it should not be too
surprising. They are the ultimate Freudian accouterment in an
increasingly gender-neutral workplace. In that sense, the old
four-in-hand can seem as Neanderthal as pinup calendars and
secretary-chasing.
</P>
<P>
   Neckwear is also associated with a more formal era, when people
worked in downtown offices and did business face to face. These
days, more of us do at least some of our work at home, or in
suburban office parks far from the public gaze.
</P>
<P>
   And in an age when everyone is cool and confession is valued
over concealment, neckties can seem awfully buttoned up, their
wearers secretive, rigid and constrained. On sitcoms, a high-school
student in a tie is usually a geek, the sort of social climber who
intends to run for student council president. He may be liked, as
Biff says in ``Death of a Salesman,'' but he isn't well liked.
</P>
<P>
   So why do women (who account for half of all necktie purchases)
keep buying them for men? Dr. Joyce Brothers has weighed in on the
subject. ``It is a gift of manhood,'' she said, citing an ``implied
intimacy'' that prevents women from giving ties to just any casual
acquaintance or co-worker. A cigar may be just a cigar, but Ms.
Lewinsky knew that a necktie is something else again, which is why
she made presents of them to the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   There's no equivalent to the tie in women's wardrobes. They once
tried floppy bow ties but soon abandoned them for a less derivative
brand of business attire. And in men's wardrobes, there is no
substitute: Without neckties to channel decorative instincts, men
are left to flounder uncertainly in a sea of corduroys, khakis and
``dressy casuals.''
</P>
<P>
   G.K. Chesterton once said, ``When man ceases to believe in God,
he does not believe in nothing. He believes in anything.''
Post-necktie, we may be in for the sartorial equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a necktie implies a certain maturity in a man, the way
long pants once did. Should we really be wearing T-shirts and
flip-flops to the office when we're past the age of reason? Haven't
school districts across the country, in adopting dress codes and
uniforms, acted on the belief that disdainful clothing and
disdainful behavior are connected?
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of a backlash against the untie-ing of adult
America as well. The Douglas County, Neb., Register of Deeds has
adopted an employee dress code, including ties for male managers,
and sent a copy to private firms whose employees often visit the
office, in the hope that they, too, will comply.
</P>
<P>
   And the necktie on America's most influential office worker,
Dilbert, always points upward, an inextinguishable symbol of hope
in the office-cubicle wasteland. Either that, or it badly needs
ironing.

REPORT POINTS TO MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the push to cut class size, California
ranks dead last among states in the number of teachers, counselors
and librarians per pupil, according to a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is a distinction that is hardly welcome, but not surprising:
California's system of public education is bigger and more complex
than any other in the country. Still, California, one of the
wealthiest states in the nation, spends far less per pupil than
many other states.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``How California Compares,'' was conducted by Palo
Alto-based EdSource, an independent, nonprofit, educational
research group. It ranks 50 states and the District of Columbia on
graduation rates, teacher salary, funding and the number of
teachers, administrators and computers per pupil, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a common (misperception) that all the money that's
been added to the K-12 budget in the last few years has helped,''
EdSource research director Barbara Miller said. ``That's not true.
These invisible services, such as counselors and librarians, have
been cut. They're services that complement the classroom and have a
real impact on the education of youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Gray Davis said this week that ``restoring
California's schools to greatness will be the cornerstone of my
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The report paints a detailed, eye-opening picture of the
immediate needs posed by a surging student population, an aging
teaching force and inadequate, antiquated schools.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, California:
</P>
<P>
   _ educates about one in eight of the nation's children.
Enrollment, now 5.6 million students, is expected to grow by 15
percent during the next decade. Nationally, growth is expected to
be about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ is ninth among states in average teacher salary _ $43,474.
Alaska is highest at $50,647 and South Dakota lowest at $26,764.
When adjusted for inflation, the average California teacher's
salary has dropped 0.8 percent in the past decade, compared with an
increase of 3.5 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   _ ranks 37th in high school graduation rates, with 65.3 percent
of students who enter high school graduating four years later.
</P>
<P>
   _ is 47th in revenue for public schools per $1,000 in personal
income. While most other major states increased their per-pupil
expenditures between 1990 and 1996, California's spending on public
schools was virtually flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ ranks 15th in students per teacher and principal, and 51st in
students per guidance counselor and librarian. California has
nearly three times more students per district administrator and
twice as many per counselor as the national average. The paucity of
librarians is stunning: one for every 6,334 students, compared with
the national average of one per 885 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other states in the same boat, but
California is experiencing the pressure of recruiting and retaining
new teachers sooner than most and on a scale greater than most,''
said Elizabeth Fideler, vice president for policy and research at
Recruiting New Teachers Inc., a Belmont, Mass.-based nonprofit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   California will need about 300,000 new teachers during the next
decade to keep up with projected enrollment growth and teacher
departures. The average age of California's more than 236,000
teachers is 43; one of seven is over 55. About 50 percent of new
teachers leave the profession within the first five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reasons to be guardedly optimistic about
California's efforts to recruit new teachers,'' Fideler said,
pointing to Cal Teach, a statewide program established by Gov. Pete
Wilson in 1997 to remedy the dearth of qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   There are other glimmers of hope, according to the EdSource
report:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, 47 percent of the state's high school graduates took
the SAT, 4 percentage points more than the national average. Scores
have climbed for four straight years, and in 1997 were the highest
since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, 13.4 percent of all juniors and seniors passed
advanced placement exams, compared with the national average of 9.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wilson, California adopted new and rigorous standards for
what children should know in math, history, science and English.
The new statewide Standardized Testing and Reporting program, given
last spring to California students in grades 2 through 11, is being
aligned to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to improve the state's academically inferior schools,
policymakers and the new Davis administration will have to do more
than implement reforms enacted by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As outgoing state Board of Education president Yvonne Larsen, a
Wilson appointee, said, ``I hope Gray Davis will build on the
reforms we've made. What his administration has going for them is
that everyone is talking about improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes and ears are on the state to move schools forward. We
can't let this moment in our lifetime pass by without making major
reforms for kids in the classroom.''

HOW THE AGING POST-DEB MEETS HER MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's an aging, still-single former deb to do? The
traditional route to marriage for many social types brought up in
the world of debutante balls and Southampton summer houses is to
meet a mate through introductions by friends or family or at
country-club parties and black-tie charity affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when a woman has spent a decade or more in this
insular world and still come up empty-handed? For many, the answer
is a last resort so outside their social ken that it is barely
mentionable: a matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   And the matchmaking service of choice for the post-deb in New
York is It's Just Lunch, whose two offices, on East 56th Street and
in the Wall Street area, have reputations for attracting preppy men
with good manners, no facial hair and substantial incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to find anyone in New York,'' said a single
Upper East Side woman of 38 who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and
whose name appears on the invitations sent out by more than a
half-dozen charitable groups. Speaking on condition of anonymity
because of the stigma attached to a dating service by her set, she
said: ``In the New York social scene, all the men are either
married, gay or neutral. After a while you know everyone, and
you've passed through.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several friends from similar backgrounds, she handed over
$1,000 to It's Just Lunch for a one-year membership or 16 lunch
dates. She said that friends had told her that the service had many
``well-bred men'' as members who worked too hard to be active
socially.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company, which matches prospects for
first-name-only introductory dates over lunch and sometimes dinner
(all Dutch), advertises a high success rate _ 500 marriages in New
York in the last five years, it says.
</P>
<P>
   An added incentive was that It's Just Lunch plans to open a
Connecticut office early next year. The woman and her friends are
eagerly anticipating that the Connecticut office, which will be in
Stamford, will collect the pool of divorces from wealthy Greenwich
and single men from the Fortune 500 companies in Fairfield County.
``It will be a whole new crop,'' the woman said. ``Those guys are
well mannered, well bred.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Dolan, the president and chief executive of It's Just
Lunch, which was started in 1992 by Andrea McGinty, now his wife
(yes, they met through the service), said: ``For some reason, I
can't open up the Connecticut office fast enough. I've been getting
so many calls. Lots of men calling.''
</P>
<P>
   From a single office in Chicago, It's Just Lunch has grown to 30
branches around the country, with a membership of 20,000. In New
York City, there are 2,000 members ranging in age from 23 to 48,
with most in their late 20s to mid-30s, Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that 40 percent of its members are men, 60
percent women, but the imbalance becomes greater for those over 40,
with fewer men. Several women in their 30s said their dates
arranged by the company were sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the average income of men who are clients in
New York is $155,000, and of women who are clients, $85,000. The
most common profession for the men is lawyer, followed by
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Both men and women ``are very specific, very focused,'' said
Tammy Korol, 28, the director in the New York office. ``Women want
men who will stand when they walk into the room,'' she added. ``Men
want women they can bring to a black-tie affair.''
</P>
<P>
   One client, a man who is 42 and asked not to be identified,
compared the service to ``a social secretary.'' ``I just can't be
bothered doing the whole finding-a-date thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A management consultant, he spends the workweek in Manhattan and
weekends at a second home in Fairfield County, where he sails and
plays tennis at a country club. Most of the women he's met through
the service are ``striking and from good backgrounds,'' he said,
and he nearly married his first set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Brady, a 41-year-old Upper East Sider who signed up a few
months ago, has gone on lunch and dinner dates with different
prospects the same day. The dates are almost always at restaurants
where It's Just Lunch reserves tables regularly. The company says
it strives for a romantic but not intimate atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced, Brady, who works for AT&AMP;T, joined the service
because he felt unsure how to rejoin the singles scene. ``I wanted
to find a woman with good values, passion, intelligence and
sensuality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Rich, an executive recruiter, wanted to find a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   They went on a first date. They clicked. And the other day at
Tuscan Square, a restaurant on 51st Street near Fifth Avenue, they
had a follow-up date, this time over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The candles glowed. As Ms. Rich approached the table, Brady
stood to pull back her chair.

HATE THAT GRAY? NO WAY. FEELING BLUE? NO, NEVER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (HLW)  
 By STEPHAN TALTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My color has come into its season: gray is the new
black, as you've no doubt heard, decreed by the panjandrums of
fashion. This fall, the least attention-seeking, in many ways the
saddest, color has become the toast of Seventh Avenue. It's
everywhere, from the pages of fashion magazines to the clothing
racks at Saks or the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   But I have my doubts. I don't believe gray was cut out for
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   I have been a fan of gray as long as I can remember. To me, it
always meant fall, northern skies, rain, ash and smoke _
classicism. Gray is the final resting place of color itself, tired
of the extremities of orange and the ferociousness of black.
</P>
<P>
   My choice did not go over big in the old neighborhood, in
Buffalo, N.Y. It was the equivalent of saying your favorite band
was Air Supply or your favorite pastime was collecting butterflies.
Among my rowdy Irish-Catholic friends, choosing any color other
than green bordered on reckless foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   You might get away with silver _ at least silver was a football
color (the Raiders). But gray was for the old, the rich and the
neutral, which no one who is 17 wants to be. The expression ``gray
matter'' only emphasized its nerd associations. So did those Grey
Poupon commercials, which imprinted the hue with snob appeal in the
character of a Rolls-Royce-driving sandwich-eater.
</P>
<P>
   After those commercials hit the air, when I was in my teens, I
convinced myself that gray was not my color. When girls I'd met
asked the getting-to-know-you questions, I fibbed. Sign?
``Cancer.'' Movie? `` `The Searchers.''' Football team? ``The
Bills, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   All true. But then, color? ``Um, blue.'' They would say, ``Oh,
yeah, it's the color of your eyes,'' and leave it at that. I liked
blue, but I was hiding behind it. Blue was socially acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   I had one moment of naked courage when I became the editor of my
school literary magazine, The Juvenalist. It had been revived after
years of neglect, and I did the assigning, the editing, the
typesetting and some of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   When my staff asked what color the cover was going to be, I
didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray!'' I decreed, drunk on power. They looked at me as if I
had just landed from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty adviser overruled me, and The Juvenalist arrived in
jackets of Kelly green, the school color.
</P>
<P>
   As a Northern kid, I read Faulkner and the rest of the Southern
writers and beheld them gorging on the South's colors _ the
grotesquely colorful vegetation, the drama of Southern skies. I
began to ask myself, what is the North's signature color?
</P>
<P>
   In winter, Buffalo becomes deeply acquainted with gray; I grew
to know its infinite shadings like no other. There were slate-gray
skies heavy and black-edged with approaching snow. There was the
luminous gray of cloudy mornings after a snowfall, when the light
would bounce between the sky and the earth, sharply etching the
details of everything in between. Most of all, there was the very
clear pearl gray of early fall evenings, when the air acquires its
first hard snap.
</P>
<P>
   Another major factor in my obsession with gray is my hair. The
first gray appeared beneath my wheat-brown mop when I was still in
my early 20s. Judging from my father, I knew I would be fully gray
by my late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   When people first asked what was causing me to turn prematurely
gray, I would sigh, ``Women.'' In fact, I couldn't wait to be fully
gray. My body was catching up to my taste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fashion has, too. Forty years after gray became stigmatized
as the color of dull conformity, in the person of the Man in the
Gray Flannel Suit, it has returned.
</P>
<P>
   It has won over its rival in the competition to be fashion's
uniform _ namely, black. Gray is a more nuanced expression of that
which black states absolutely. Black is grief; gray is the sadness
that comes afterward. Black is impenetrable; gray has depths. Black
is definitive; gray (as in gray areas) eludes finality.
</P>
<P>
   This season, gray has conquered black, the biggest upset since
Earth Shoes replaced ... whatever it was Earth Shoes replaced. Why
did gray overtake black now? I asked an expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to reintroduce color, as designers are doing
now, you need a neutral base,'' explained Sally Singer, the fashion
director at New York magazine. ``And there's been a move away from
the hard perfection to the early '90s, the Gucci all-black
silhouette, which seemed too strident and obvious. I think people
were in the mood to be imperfect. Gray has the seductiveness of
someone coming undone.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded good, but I don't believe New York can be
faithful to gray, a color whose motto might be, ``What are you
getting all emotional about?'' Already, the next color (khaki, I
hear) is on the style horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Gray is merely a moment of silence in fashion's ceaseless
chatter. Next spring, when gray recedes to become once more the
color of tweedy blazers worn by history professors and the hue of
Buffalo skies, I won't be sad; that's where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray teaches you to live with good-byes.

FISHING'S THE BAIT, GRAND CANYON'S THE HOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RON DUNGAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON, Ariz. - I don't hike much anymore. I (begin ital)
walk (end ital) a lot because I like to fish mountain streams all
over Arizona, or for that matter whatever state I happen to be in.
For some reason the fishing always looks better around the next
bend, which means I wind up going on some fairly long and
interesting walks, but I rarely just hike for the sake of hiking.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago I was invited by some friends to backpack the
Hermit Trail in the Grand Canyon. I started sorting through various
pieces of gear that I had stored in corners and closets throughout
the house but had not actually used in quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   This seems strange to me now, because when I moved to Arizona
about all I had besides some clothes and books was a pair of hiking
boots and a backpack. They got a lot of use, but after a few years
the boots started to break down from wading a favorite stream a
little too often, and the pack took a beating once when my camp was
ransacked by a bear.
</P>
<P>
   Over time the boots were retired, the pack was hung in the
garage and new toys took their place: waders, fly rods, float
tubes. For one reason or another, I simply stopped backpacking,
though from time to time I thought I might take it up again.
</P>
<P>
   When the invitation came, I dusted off the pack and started
taking running and trips to the gym a lot more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in shape for any trip down the Canyon is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermit Trail begins, logically enough, at Hermits Rest. From
there it goes pretty much straight down for about a mile. There are
plenty of books about the Hermit, and they will tell you that along
this first mile there are cobblestones that formed the early mule
trails, but I happen to know that the park service put those rocks
there to keep people from sliding over the edge, and that mules
never actually went down that trail because mules have more sense
than that. You don't realize how steep it is until you make the
hike up, but it is one of the more challenging parts of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   I got in good shape, but as it turned out I needed a little
something extra to keep me going. Most people do. I told myself
there was great fishing at the bottom and cold beer on top; that
was all the mental edge I needed.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacking is one of those odd pleasures that, for most people,
involve a little pain, but you still feel pretty good about the
whole thing. After the first day, you make a lot of jokes about how
stiff you are and how you are going to lie down and die right
there, but they are just jokes. In the morning when you wake up,
you may be sore, but you have a whole day ahead of you, very little
time in a very special place, and hopefully, fish to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then you hear a rumor that the Grand Canyon is one
of those places where the trout are as long as your arm and not too
particular about what they eat. I knew enough to regard these
rumors with a certain amount of skepticism and, as it turned out,
we didn't get a single bite.
</P>
<P>
   A ranger we saw on the trail said that Hermit Creek didn't have
the best fishing in the Canyon anyway. Never mind where he said
(begin ital) does (end ital) have the best fishing. He said not to
tell anyone when he told my friend, who told me. That's as far as
it gets.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the usual assortment of dry flies, scuds, nymphs and
midges, dragged woolly buggers through the deeper holes and
basically threw out every fly in my box, but I didn't have much
hope because the river was pretty muddy, which will put fish off
from feeding. Fishing is like that. You can spend a lot of time and
effort getting to a lake or stream, only to hear someone say,
``Well, you should have been here last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time was that, even though the fish weren't
biting, we were in the Grand Canyon. I've been a lot of places
where I've been told I should have been there a week ago, or maybe
next week, or whatever, and they've all been nice places, but they
weren't, well, they weren't the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Things get real quiet late in the day. The light begins to fade,
hikers stop moving around and you have the place _ and everything
that comes with it _ all to yourself. The view at sunset. The
starry nights. The first light of dawn. And as you leave, you
figure out what has been missing _ the best part of any backpacking
trip is reaching the top.
</P>
<P>
   When you hike the Canyon, you don't do this until the very end.
And you begin to realize what you knew all along. You didn't come
here to fish after all, and even if you had, you're glad you came
anyway. &QL;

THERE'S NIGHT LIFE AFTER THE ICEBERG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VIJAI MAHESHWARI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Regulars call it ``Kafe.'' Mick Jagger, who dropped in
four nights in a row while in town on a concert tour this summer,
referred to it as ``Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   By whatever name, the ultrahip uninhibited Jazz Kafe, which is
Moscow's most-sought-out night spot, is riding out Russia's
economic implosion as if the party never ended.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty banks that added gleaming ziggurats to the skyline in
the last decade are half empty. Both the ruble and the Russian
stock market have collapsed. Western executives are heading for the
exits, as one of the worst emerging-markets disasters of recent
years plays out.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Jazz Kafe, the economy and the onset of a Russian
winter are just conversational ice-breakers. ``What crisis?'' Boris
Lifshits, a young entrepreneur, said, guzzling a $10 Corona.
``There is no crisis until the Jazz Kafe empties out.''
</P>
<P>
   Young women in tight-fitting designer clothes shook their
Wella-conditioned hair all around him to the jazz beat in the
intimate lounge-size club, which occupies the basement of a jazz
school near Moscow's Tretyakov Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Men in retro leather gear or Hugo Boss jackets mobbed the bar
for drinks. It was early on a Friday evening last month, just days
after Russia asked the West for emergency food aid, but the club
was more packed than the Moscow metro at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, supplicants without membership cards, which cost up to
$500, shoved one another in the sub-zero temperatures, hoping to
get past the doormen. On the street were the hulking shapes of
Mercedes-Benzes, BMW's and foreign-made convertibles, known here as
cabriolets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a small group of people who are going to party, no
matter what,'' said Sin Lazarovich, 32, the Jazz Kafe's co-manager.
``Where was Coco Chanel during World War II? Not sitting home and
sulking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazarovich, a Serb who was a club promoter in Belgrade during
the late '80s and who moved to Moscow two years ago, said the
ruble's nose dive had not ``wrecked the high'' of the so-called
Golden Youth, the sons and daughters of the former Communist elite,
who in many ways are still the country's elite.
</P>
<P>
   They constitute a significant part of the club's clientele. (For
several months after the club opened last year, foreigners were
excluded because they were not considered stylish enough.)
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow today, young models are still being given new cars by
their flush boyfriends, or ``sponsors,'' as the men are
euphemistically called. ``Someone handed his girlfriend the keys to
a cabriolet the other day,'' Lazarovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5 a.m., the party swung into high gear. A lissome young
woman climbed onto the mini-stage near the bar and began undressing
in an impromptu striptease. Revelers crowded around and jousted
with one another to peel off her clothes, while the deejay pumped
up the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men shoved American $100 bills at her, chanting
``davai, davai'' _ ``more, more.'' Within minutes there were three
near-nude women on stage, and the tension had reached such a peak
that when someone popped a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, the crowd
shrieked in alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things like this stop happening, I'm out of here,''
Christophe Charlier, a French-American banker from the brokerage
house Renaissance Capital, said. It has laid off 30 percent of its
work force, but he is hanging onto a job. ``The quality of life has
not changed yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Kafe is not the only night spot that's been twisting
and shouting its way through Russia's financial crisis. A new disco
named Gallerie, decorated with Naugahyde couches, a granite-topped
bar and prints of the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, is
buzzing on weekends, attracting a cocktail of models, bohemians and
``biznismen.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are other signs that luxury has not gone out
of style for a privileged few. A glitzy Fendi boutique opened a few
weeks ago, and the manager told a local newspaper, ``Some people
are still updating their wardrobes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a new multiplex movie theater, and new restaurants
serving Japanese and Italian food. Two new magazines _ a
Russian-language Vogue and one about golf _ hit newsstands this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   All contrast sharply with the disgruntled lines snaking around
banks that have declared insolvency, or the harried food shoppers
carefully counting their kopecks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men at Gallerie _ Russians, except for a smattering
of foreigners _ dress in dark European suits and seem to have money
to burn. ``No one knows what they do, and no one asks,'' said
Victor Gelman, a television producer, taking in the scene.
``They're making money somehow, and that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is these shadowy men _ a potpourri of Russian and foreign
yuppies, children of the elite and mobsters _ who are subsidizing
Moscow's Saturday night fever.
</P>
<P>
   One concession to hard times has been the scrapping of cover
charges at many clubs. And this has encouraged the newly
unemployed, with no offices to report to the next day, to come out
to party, especially on weekends, dancing until the metro opens at
6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fired from the advertising company I worked for a few
weeks ago,'' said Masha Kuznetsova, who was at the Jazz Kafe in a
tank top, navel ring and tinted pink glasses. ``So what? I'm not
going to stay home and eat sausages, am I?'' She believes that
Russians are whooping it up even more now that the Russian Titanic
has hit the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our Russian soul,'' she said. ``We turn to vodka in times
of crisis.'' With shots of vodka promoted at a post-crisis discount
of $1 at many clubs, the revelry actually seems to have gone up a
notch. Call it the last days of Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent bash in a raw, plaster-strewn space that was to have
been an upscale cigar bar until funds ran out, actors dressed as
bums panhandled, while models handed out papyrosi, cheap
hand-rolled cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mood and the mood of the economy are not necessarily in
synch,'' Masha Repina, an anchor with the Russian television
station NTV, said at the Jazz Kafe. ``Moscow was getting boring for
a while; now it's exciting again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Kafe has had no need to adopt an anti-crisis theme; it
is still Moscow's hottest club a year and a half after its opening.
Some compare it to Studio 54 in its heyday.
</P>
<P>
   The designer Alexander McQueen held a private party there last
winter, the night before mounting a show of his fall collection for
Givenchy in a Moscow metro station. The Pet Shop Boys have drifted
through on visits. There was even a sighting of Leonardo DiCaprio
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb managers, Lazarovich and a fellow Belgrade transplant,
Vladimir Ostojic, work the crowd, handing out membership cards to
the bold and beautiful of Moscow. They recently branched out to
open a cafe and fashion boutique near Red Square, despite the hard
times.
</P>
<P>
   Even more gilt-edged than the Jazz Kafe, it features uniformed
waiters and a high degree of Euro-snobism _ no beer and no
American-style coffee are on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to make ``Dorian Gray envious,'' Lazarovich
boasted. Not to mention the masses of Russians struggling to
survive. But the few who have made the Jazz Kafe the focal point of
their lives are in no mood to scale back yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people can't go back to drinking around the kitchen
table,'' said Gelman, the television producer. ``They might have
lost their jobs, but they haven't lost their social status. And
that's more important for us.''

FAKE `PSYCHO' NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Psycho,'' Gus Van Sant's nervy remake of the 1960 horror
classic, is less a film than a vague curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in the most strident, unbending sense of the word, a
remake. Van Sant used Joseph Stefano's original script and
painstakingly re-created virtually every camera angle, every shot,
every trick first used by Alfred Hitchcock. Van Sant himself has
called his film ``a forgery. Like we're making a copy of the Mona
Lisa or the statue of David.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, raises the question: Who wants to see a
forgery when you can see the real deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho,'' Van Sant's $25 million remake of Hitchcock's
$800,000 movie, brings practically nothing new to the party. This
is the film equivalent of karaoke. Van Sant uses color, and a few
modern touches like push-button phones _ as one might add a shaky
melismatic swoop to Aretha Franklin's ``Respect,'' at a late-night
bar _ but it adds nothing significant, and only deepens the longing
for the still-stunning original.
</P>
<P>
   Even the opening credits, with Bernard Herrmann's shrieky,
string-laden score, are the same, except, of course, the names of
the actors have changed. Anne Heche takes over for Janet Leigh as
the world's most unfortunate motel guest, Marion Crane, and we
first see her the same way audiences saw her 38 years ago _ in a
Phoenix hotel room, catching a little afternoon delight with her
lover Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Marion is tired of their
no-tell hotel trysts and wants to get married, but Sam's deep in
debt, and has little to offer other than a threadbare life in the
back of his father's hardware store. With his cowboy boots and
dopey stare, at least Mortensen looks more like the poor hick
Stefano's script imagined than John Gavin's woodenly gorgeous,
well-dressed Sam in the original.
</P>
<P>
   Heche is said to have watched each of Leigh's scenes before
re-creating the role, and does it ever show. She apes every
movement, every smirk, every eye roll, using none of her
considerable talents to make the role her own. Then again, she was
probably just following Van Sant's (Hitchcock's?) direction.
</P>
<P>
   The same problems are apparent in Vince Vaughn's performance as
murderous momma's boy Norman Bates. Certainly any actor attempting
that role after Anthony Perkins would be in trouble; Perkins's
performance was so indelible it pretty much ruined his career,
since few could accept him playing anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But like Heche, Vaughn, an interesting actor, is never given the
chance to put his stamp on the role. He's hamstrung by Van Sant's
lunkheaded decision to literally remake the film, and his turn as
Norman Bates is less a performance than a Rich Little
impersonation. Like Perkins, he is first shown in an ill-fitting
corduroy jacket with the collar turned up. He carts out Perkins's
nervous laugh when he's expected to, but it never really works, and
he almost seems to be spoofing the role.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Vaughn lacks the boyish innocence that
duped the first ``Psycho'' audiences into believing such a lovely
young man truly would never hurt a fly. As Norman, the strapping
Vaughn always seems as if he may do damage. Even if audiences
weren't already familiar with Norman's true disposition, Vaughn
just oozes danger and malice _ among other things 1960s censors
never would have allowed Hitchcock to get away with.
</P>
<P>
   Less problematic are the small roles of William H. Macy as
private investiagtor Milton Arbogast, and Julianne Moore as
Marion's sister, Lila. Moore does manage to bring a feisty feminist
spark to her performance. Robert Forster plays the psychologist who
explains Norman/Mother, here named Dr. Simon, a nod to the late
actor Simon Oakland, who played the role in the original.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the target audience for this film. If Van
Sant fancied capturing the teenage audiences that made the
``Scream'' films hits, he should have upped the body count, the
cool pop references, and the gore content. There are still only two
murders, there's no profanity, and even in color, the blood is kept
to a minimum. And for anyone familiar with the original, well,
where's the suspense? You already know about the shower scene, and
Norman's penchant for taxidermy and cheap wigs.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a shame, since Van Sant has often brought a
distinctive bravura to his films such as ``My Own Private Idaho''
and ``To Die For.'' The mind boggles at what the filmmaker could
have done with this fertile material if he hadn't been so committed
to slavishly copying Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Van Sant's ``Psycho'' may imitate Hitchcock's in a way
he probably wasn't striving for: The original was panned by
critics. While history has proven them wrong, don't expect the same
reversal of fortune for Van Sant's wholly unnecessary rip-off.

SPORTS BROADCASTING NEEDS A DOSE OF REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The football is heaved deep, the receiver has a
step on the defensive back, the ball falls into his hands, then
drops harmlessly to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   How often have you heard this: ``He has to catch that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Often. Maybe every game. Conversely, if the ball is thrown
behind him, there's this: ``He's gotta make better throws than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Football analysis is dead. Going into the pro football games
this weekend, you can expect to hear the same things your father
heard all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sports has always been littered with cliches. It's part of the
charm and part of the contract with fans. Terminology and
description become common because an announcer can convey to a fan
exactly what he or she is thinking as the action unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the problem. See anything familiar in this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to step it up.'' ``He's under a lot of pressure
tonight'' (pressure and momentum being two of the most overused
words in broadcasting). ``You could hear that hit up here.'' ``He
turned it up another level.'' ``That's a big line.'' ``This team
has so many weapons.'' ``Here's where experience pays off.'' ``On
any Sunday, any team in the NFL can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that needs to be asked is, when did broadcasters
begin to frown on original description and simply fall back on
familiarity? You'd think that if it was your job to add ``color''
to a football broadcast, you'd study for it. Maybe think about new
ways to say things. Try to be thoughtful or informative.
</P>
<P>
   This problem exists in most sports, of course, but the current
football season has been uncommonly bad. One of the worst trends
this year is spending a quarter of each broadcast talking about the
officiating. If it's bad, say so and move on. Come back to it once
or twice, but harping on it only shows you're bored or on
autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   A problem with any kind of sports broadcast is that true fans
are educated through years of watching and reading. ESPN's pre- and
post-game shows are the best at illustrating new ideas, dissecting
events. Ron Jaworski's game-film breakdowns are the finest examples
of this.
</P>
<P>
   Yet virtually every other network pre-game show is little more
than ex-athletes or coaches talking fast and saying nothing.
Whatever happened to substance?
</P>
<P>
   Sideline reporting is the worst offender. At this point in the
season, the only mystery is what kind of hat and jacket combination
Leslie Visser is going to throw together. It's safe to say that
Visser _ and her sideline peers _ have added nothing of value this
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to the coach, and he says the team is going to
stick with the game plan despite being down two touchdowns.''
``Coming out of the locker room, the coach said his team's
confidence is high but they need to retain their focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Some real gems come out of those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ESPN has vaunted pre-game and post-game shows, the
network still has a lot of work to do in the booth. It's not good
enough to just tell us how the safeties couldn't get back in
coverage or that playing off receivers during a blitz is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be something more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the trick is in telling viewers what they didn't see,
not what they could so easily see a moment earlier. Is that so
hard? Anyone can say, after the fullback plunged 2 yards for the
first down, ``He bulls his way for two and looks to have picked up
the first down.'' Yeah, got it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the solution? A revolution. And those are never easy. The
comfort factor in sports is part of the reason people watch.
</P>
<P>
   We've been programmed since childhood to like repetition. John
Madden has repeated the same broadcast for more than a decade, and
nobody seems to mind. Hearing about those fat bellies and socks
falling down and muddy uniforms _ not to mention the ubiquitous
``boom!'' _ is like wearing comfortable jeans and an old sweat
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   One day three guys in a booth will have sat down the previous
night, talked about a way to do things differently, executed the
whole thing in front of a national audience and _ boom! _ we'll be
a changed country.
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off, they'll have to stay focused, take it one game
at a time and give 110 percent. Is that asking for too much?
</P>

VH1 DOES SOME BUSINESS WITH R.E.M. ROCKUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, Variety magazine ran an article on the market power of
``Behind the Music.'' Turns out VH1's beautifully executed
rockumentary series sells CDs _ and not just CDs from the artist's
catalog of music, which matter, but the newer product, which
really, really matters. It's no surprise, then, that ``Behind the
Music'' is choosing to flex its newfound muscle these days by
telling the stories of still-vital musicians who just happen to
have a new album out _ usual suspects like Madonna, Metallica, and,
Sunday night at 9, R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   Since these performers are abundantly present on the pop scene,
they make for only mildly compelling documentary fare. I mean do we
really need yet another look at the many faces of Madonna? Their
stories are still in progress, and their promotional instincts
remain in play, unlike more interesting and historical ``Behind the
Music'' subjects like the Mamas and the Papas, the Grateful Dead,
John Denver, and Jim Croce. While the trumped-up voiceover
narration of R.E.M. ``Behind the Music'' tries to instill drummer
Bill Berry's ``tragic brush with death'' and his departure from the
band with all the drama of a Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash, the
unfortunate events are not enough to lift R.E.M.'s story to the
level of true rock-biopic pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that the R.E.M. ``Behind the Music'' is not
worth a good look. As usual, the filmmakers have stuffed their hour
with fantastic clips _ and the R.E.M. clips are particularly
eye-popping as they chronicle Michael Stipe's long hair journey
from romantic poet to space egg. (Stipe's eyeglasses, too, make for
quite the parade.) Also worthwhile are recent interviews with the
band, including comments from Berry about his aneurysm (``It felt
like a bowling ball hit my head'') and his decision to leave R.E.M.
to spend his days crop farming. Stipe shares some thoughts about
his ``queerness,'' as well as his shift from shy boy with bangs to
bold, bald front man. In one old clip, Stipe is actually seen
hiding from a greeting by David Letterman after singing ``So.
Central Rain'' on the late-night talk show.
</P>
<P>
   On the new R.E.M. ``Storytellers,'' which VH1 premieres at 10
p.m., Stipe reveals a little of his look-at-me-don't-look-at-me
bashfulness, stumbling through explications of his songs and
admitting ``I think I'm a little nervous _ I just realized that.''
But who expects clarity and directness from Stipe, who is famous
not only for hiding his lyrics behind muddy pronunciations but for
obscuring his meaning with gorgeous but impenetrable phrases? It's
amusing, though, to hear him finesse his descriptions of songs like
like ``Fall on Me'' and ``Losing My Religion,'' which some people
think is a theological inquiry. ``It's not,'' Stipe says. ``It's
just a song about having a crush.'' And at moments he is quite
eloquent, introducing ``Man on the Moon'' with a touching reverence
for comic Andy Kaufman, ``the greatest Elvis Presley impersonator
of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's musical performance on ``Storytellers'' is fine, if a
little uninspired. Without Berry, some of the older songs seem to
take on a mechanical, hurried drive. The exception is Berry's
``Perfect Circle'' from ``Murmur,'' which Stipe sings beautifully
and with clear affection for the former drummer. The cuts from the
new album, ``Up,'' are more dynamic, including ``Daysleeper,'' with
some energetic piano playing from Mike Mills and ``At My Most
Beautiful,'' with its Beach Boys-like purity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Prescott grabbed a clipboard, a No. 2 pencil
and some scrap paper and took a seat alongside 100 other
nerve-racked men in a stuffy, overheated basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope I do well,'' Prescott, a graduate student, muttered as he
glanced at a neighbor, whose hand appeared to be jealously
shielding a standardized test form. A sociology midterm? Hardly,
unless you consider the Single Gay Man in Premillennium New York a
subject worthy of academic study.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott, 31, recently dumped and hungry for holiday-season
company, was braving Date Bait, a brutally efficient, high-tech
mixer that tries to ease the sting of face-to-face rejection by
using a computer to make matches.
</P>
<P>
   Created two years ago by Rafael Risemberg, a dateless psychology
professor who was weary of the bar scene, Date Bait has become a
huge draw among gay men in their 30s and 40s, and the Saturday
night events, held at A Different Light bookstore on West 19th
Street, are often so crowded that dozens are turned away at the
door.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Risemberg says, his matchmaking method has produced
4,837 dates, although he does not track how many of those led to
second dates. ``That is something only God knows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the popularity of the events, Risemberg has started a
series of nights for heterosexuals, lesbians and HIV-positive men.
``I never knew it, but I must have been born with some Jewish
matchmaking gene,'' said Risemberg, 39, who has reaped several
dates from his own events, but still remains unattached.
</P>
<P>
   Date Bait affairs couldn't be less fussy: identified with a name
tag and three-digit number, participants sit on chairs that are
arranged in a square. After each person has stood and delivered a
brief description of himself, the seats are cleared for 45 minutes
of ferocious mingling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limit conversations to one minute per person,'' Risemberg
shouts as the men plunge into a frenzy of small talk. ``No
hogging!''
</P>
<P>
   The mixing done, participants turn to their score cards _ those
SAT-style answer forms _ and begin shading in the ovals that
correspond to the numbers worn by the prospects who appeal to them.
Then comes a nervous 20-minute wait as the forms are fed into a
scanner, which tabulates and coldly spits out pairs of matching
numbers. The evening ends with instant gratification _ or deflation
_ as men who have selected one another scurry to collect phone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety was thick on a recent Saturday night as the
conservatively dressed crowd _ mostly white and professional _
registered, paid a $15 entry fee and quietly took a seat. David
Moschel, the evening's bubbly emcee, apologized for the heat, which
he blamed on the room's incandescent lighting. ``We used to have
fluorescent bulbs, but everyone complained about how green it made
them look,'' he said. ``Now, everyone suffocates but at least they
look good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before starting, Risemberg warned the group members to make
their choices prudently. ``You are fully expected to go on a date
with those you match,'' he said sternly, defining a date as a
half-hour meeting in a public place. ``Violators should be reported
to the Date Bait hot line and will be barred from future events.''
</P>
<P>
   The next hour was filled with a numbing litany of 30-second
personal spiels that ranged from the standard
theater-going/long-walk-loving/hopeless-romantic variety to the
self-deprecating and confessional. ``I have a really big mouth, but
I'm kind hearted,'' said Rami, No. 031, while Otto, 077, admitted _
against a friend's advice _ that he lived in New Jersey. ``I can be
in midtown in 30 minutes,'' he said meekly. Jeff, 001, back for the
28th time, offered the following description of himself: ``I'm a
40-year-old neurotic Jew from Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, 039, sparked groans when he said he had broken up with a
boyfriend just five days earlier, as did Matt, 003, who blithely
remarked that he had recently used his cell phone on the Stair
Master. Heads shook with dismay when Rob, 099, said he enjoyed
``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Others tried unconventional appeals. Mark, 064, an accountant,
offered any comers a discount on their 1998 taxes, and Joe, 015,
said he was a nonsmoker but was willing to start for the right
person. Doug, 030, a ``brilliant unrecognized artist from the East
Village,'' made a straightforward appeal. ``I'm basically a nice
person who doesn't have cooties, so go for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the madness began as participants mingled like ricocheting
pinballs. Tim Bird, 35, who scribbled two dozen names of men who
had caught his interest, appeared overwhelmed. ``I'm trying to
whittle them down,'' Bird, a publicity agent, said as he crossed
out three names, including a guy who had said that he wasn't
interested in anyone with emotional baggage. ``Get real,'' Bird
said. ``Who doesn't have emotional baggage?''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the men, Jeff Suna, 43, said he preferred Date Bait
to personal ads and bars, veritable set-ups for embarrassment and
disappointment. ``It's sort of like a secret ballot,'' he said.
``No one gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was thrilled by the bait. Matt Locker, 31, a radio
station disc jockey with exceedingly white teeth, stood in a corner
drawing smiley faces on his otherwise blank form. ``There's nothing
here for me,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the participants agreed that Date Bait is an
efficient way to meet men who are likely to be sober (no alcohol is
served) and at least nominally interested in a relationship. ``At
bars, the physical is primary,'' said John Bonelli, 35, a community
organizer from the Clinton neighborhood of Manhattan. ``Here, looks
are important, but there's something more holistic about it. Also,
you can't posture as easily as you can in a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harper, 35, an adjunct professor of economics at New York
University, has proof that Date Bait works: one of the five dates
he got last year turned into a serious relationship. ``From my
point of view, they were three hours well spent,'' he said. Unlike
rendezvous that originate in clubs or bars _ and often end in the
morning _ Date Bait dates, he said, force gay men to pace
themselves. ``And even if you don't get a date, at least you'll
walk away with your ego intact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After 28 spins, Jeff Rutsky, the Brooklyn neurotic, is still
single, but he keeps coming back. ``I don't care, because I've made
some good friends,'' he said. Once, after failing to score a date,
he went to a nearby diner and ended up meeting another unrequited
Date Bait participant. ``You know, we had a really nice time,''
Rutsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Before handing out the matches, Risemberg offered encouragement
to those who were about to be disappointed. He said that 66 percent
of the participants had been chosen by men who interested them,
too, and 41 percent had two or more matches. ``You think that
two-thirds of people who go to a bar are going to go home with a
date?'' he asked. ``I don't think so.''
</P>

   As the men collected the computer printouts, boyish smiles
appeared on many faces. Steve Brickman, 23, a computer programmer
from Brooklyn, was pleased with his two matches but said he felt
strange after watching one of them swap phone numbers _ and a
goodbye hug _ with another match. ``I didn't exactly feel like No.

   As the men began drifting out, Rutsky shook his head and offered
a thumbs-down sign. ``I guess I'm going to the diner again,'' he
said.

NOAM CHOMSKY DID IT, NOW HE'S UNDOING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Noam Chomsky is spinning a fable.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, linguist, teacher, author and social critic, is sitting
in a pose so customary it has been captured in scores of
photographs taken since he upended the study of language 40 years
ago. He leans slightly back in his chair, one foot propped on the
pulled-out bottom drawer of his desk, hands aloft.
</P>
<P>
   His office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology exudes
both a Spartan asceticism and a pleasant disorderliness: the
primary decor consists of piles of paper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Chomsky says, that some divine superengineer, in a
single efficient stroke, endowed humans with the power of language
where formerly they had none.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of a single, brilliantly designed language mechanism
is the cornerstone of Chomsky's newest _ and most unconventional _
approach to the discipline he founded in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, who turns 70 on Dec. 7, is the father of modern
linguistics and remains the field's most influential practitioner.
Although he has revised his theoretical framework over the years,
no modification is as dramatic as the present one, called the
Minimalist Program, in which he largely breaks with the last four
decades of his own work.
</P>
<P>
   The Minimalist Program, said the linguist Morris Halle,
Chomsky's longtime colleague at MIT, ``is the most radical thing
I've ever heard anybody say in linguistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chomsky's method has changed, his fundamental mission has
remained the same: to construct a symbolic representation of the
``language faculty'' _ the inborn mental endowment that allows
human beings to acquire, use and understand language.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike its predecessors, the Minimalist Program (or
Minimalism for short) seeks to do this in the most streamlined way
possible, dispensing with concepts that were more or less canonical
in Chomsky's earlier work, like ``deep structure'' and ``surface
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the properties which were explained in terms of deep and
surface structure were really mistakenly described,'' Chomsky said.
``And they ought to be explained, and maybe can be explained
better, without postulating these systems.'' Linguists hope his new
approach is the start of a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, sharp-featured man with graying wavy hair and
wire-rimmed glasses, Chomsky was dressed casually on this morning
in a sweater, running shoes and corduroy trousers. His voice is
soft and measured, and he speaks as he writes, in perfectly formed
sentences that spin out into page-long, reasoned paragraphs. To be
in Chomsky's presence, a colleague once said, is to see ``the
overwhelming picture of Rational Man standing before you.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory of language that Chomsky introduced in 1957, often
called the Chomsky revolution, has been equated with Darwin's
theory of evolution and Freud's theory of the unconscious in terms
of its importance in the history of ideas: it was the first
concerted approach to investigating the human mind through a
systematic study of how people produce and understand sentences.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this century, structural linguistics
reigned as the field's dominant methodology. Structuralism viewed
language as a purely social phenomenon, like tool making or table
manners. Deeper questions of language and mind, including how young
children can dope out their native language from the wash of adult
talk surrounding them, were never considered.
</P>
<P>
   But Chomsky was deeply troubled by this account. In the
mid-1950s he began wrestling with questions he felt the
structuralists could not answer: If language was simply learned
behavior, what gave people the ability to produce and understand an
infinite number of sentences, including those that had never before
been uttered? How did children acquire language seemingly
spontaneously, without being overtly taught?
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky was by nature a questioner _ and, where he deemed
necessary, an exploder _ of received truths. Over the years, this
trait became evident in his political work, including his early
opposition to the Vietnam War, his outspoken condemnation of U.S.
policy in Central America, East Timor and elsewhere, and his
castigation of the mainstream news media in general (and The New
York Times in particular) for what he describes as complicity with
governmental and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to taking on 50 years of structural linguistics,
Chomsky was singularly well suited for the task. Growing up in
Philadelphia, he was exposed to language scholarship firsthand
through the work of his father, William, an eminent Hebraist. As an
undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, Chomsky studied
linguistics, mathematics and philosophy, setting the foundation for
his novel perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Language, Chomsky came to believe, was rooted not in behavior
but in biology _ in an inborn set of principles that speakers
unconsciously draw on whenever they produce or understand
sentences. The goal of linguistics, he argued, should be to
reproduce these principles.
</P>
<P>
   Since one couldn't go mucking around in people's brains, the
linguist would attempt to mirror the workings of these inborn
principles with a set of abstract, quasi-mathematical rules
intended to generate the range of possible sentences in a given
language _ in other words, a generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the aim of linguistics was to formulate not
just the grammars of specific languages but a ``universal grammar''
as well _ a model of the shared properties that underpin all human
language. It is these universal principles, Chomsky argued, that
all people are ``born knowing'' and that allow children to acquire
whatever native language they're exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Chomsky ushered in modern linguistics with
the publication of the monograph ``Syntactic Structures'' (1957),
which set forth the theory of generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   But early generative grammar was a rococo device. It posited an
unconscious level of linguistic knowledge (the deep structure),
which was distinct from what people actually say (the surface
structure). It also contained a vast set of grammatical operations,
called transformations, used to produce the range of constructions
found in actual speech: questions, statements and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But this thicket of rules presented a major obstacle to the
development of universal grammar. A true universal grammar, Chomsky
argued, must satisfy two conditions. The first requires it to be
detailed enough to describe any possible construction in any human
language: questions in Navajo, passive sentences in Japanese,
relative clauses in Urdu. This is called the condition of
``descriptive adequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the second condition, known as ``explanatory
adequacy,'' required the grammar to be simple enough to reflect the
small set of inborn principles that allow humans to acquire and use
language.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, linguistic research was snagged between these two
competing demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire development of Chomskyan generative grammar is a
history of tension between descriptive and explanatory adequacy,''
said Howard Lasnik, a professor of linguistics at the University of
Connecticut and a frequent collaborator of Chomsky's. ``In order to
have a descriptively adequate theory of language, you need to have
a rich variety of descriptive devices available. But here's the
kicker: The more devices available, the harder the child's task in
sorting through the maze of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   This impasse persisted until the early 1980s, when Chomsky
partly resolved it with a more streamlined framework called
Principles and Parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were discovering completely new and unexpected
properties of languages,'' he said. ``It was beginning to become
possible to find what at some level we know must be true: that
they're all cast in the same mold, otherwise you couldn't learn any
of them. And though they look extremely different, you began to see
how they really were variations on the same theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this work, the Minimalist Program emerged in the early
1990s. Minimalism takes as its point of departure an essential fact
about language: it is a system of communication connecting sound
and meaning. Now comes the unorthodox part: Minimalism speculates
that this system has been optimally designed _ that the connection
of sound to meaning was forged as simply as possible, as by the
divine superengineer of Chomsky's fable.
</P>
<P>
   Any theory of language, therefore, should reflect this simple
design. To that end, Minimalism jettisons most of the baggage of
early Chomskyan grammar. What remains is a single, multipurpose
mechanism used to generate the same rich array of sentences that
transformations did.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Minimalist Program will do what earlier models
could not: be both simple and complex enough to fulfill the
competing demands of a true universal grammar. Some linguists say
it holds out at least a tentative promise.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, find Chomsky's new program difficult to work
in, and they continue to use alternative models that have sprung up
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a whole lot of linguists who have adopted it
and seem _ for reasons that are incomprehensible to me _ to find it
attractive,'' said James McCawley, a prominent linguist at the
University of Chicago. ``There are others, like me, who find it
completely unintelligible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chomsky is quick to point out, Minimalism is years away from
being a full-fledged theory (hence the term program). ``It's
difficult, and it's also a shot in the dark,'' he said. ``You don't
have any particular reason to believe that it's going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Should it succeed, however, he will be that much closer to
realizing the goal he set for his field 40 years ago. ``The
subject,'' Chomsky said, ``is trying to find out how humans really
work.''

RENO NEARS DECISION ON ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Dec. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno faces a Monday deadline
to decide whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate
possible campaign law violations by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Reno must determine if there is evidence that Clinton knowingly
violated election laws when he directed a multi-million dollar
advertising campaign by the Democratic National Committee that
might have improperly benefited the Clinton-Gore presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno asks the U.S. Court of Appeals to appoint an independent
counsel and if the court agrees with her, it would be the 11th time
she has sent a case to a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also could delay her decision by asking the court for more
time to study the question, though she has been mulling it for two
years. Late last month, Reno came right up to the deadline in
another case and ended up asking for more time to study it. That
case involved allegations that Harold Ickes, a former top Clinton
aide, lied to federal investigators about his efforts on behalf of
the teamsters to get top administration officials to intervene for
the union in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the case with the Monday deadline, Reno is investigating
whether Clinton and top White House advisers illegally controlled a
DNC television advertising blitz that began in the fall of 1995.
Those ads touted Clinton's stand on the budget showdown with
congressional Republicans that year.
</P>
<P>
   She must determine if the DNC commercials were in reality
re-election ads for the president's campaign, masquerading as
issue-advocacy spots that political parties can legitimately
produce. Because the ads were placed by the DNC, they could be
largely paid for with so-called ``soft-money'' _ big, unregulated
contributions from individuals and corporate and union treasury
funds that couldn't be contributed legally to an individual
candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue boils down to trying to keep big donors from
influencing candidates,'' said Viet Dinh, an expert on campaign
finance law at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be helped by a report issued last week by the
Federal Election Commission staff that investigated the issue of
campaign advertising for both the Clinton campaign and Republican
challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Although FEC staff auditors concluded that both Clinton and Dole
improperly coordinated with the DNC and the Republican National
Committee on nationwide television advertising blitzes during the
campaign, the auditors stopped short of alleging criminal
activities on either candidate's part.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended that Clinton and Dole pay fines of $7
million and $17.7 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Since Reno often looks to the FEC for guidance on how to
interpret election laws, some legal specialists say the auditors'
report should help Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reno may find a lot of comfort in the fact that the FEC staff
isn't alleging criminal conduct and use that to dismiss the whole
matter,'' said former independent counsel Joseph E. diGenova.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the attorney general also may put off her decision
on an independent counsel until the FEC's full commission makes a
final ruling on whether to accept, reject or modify the staff
audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the full commission is something of the final word on
all of this, it wouldn't be that surprising if she just waited for
its decision on the staff report,'' diGenova said.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former FEC commissioner, agreed, saying in an
interview that the laws governing campaign advertising are often
``vague'' and that Reno may be waiting for more clarification from
the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the need for clarification was obvious at a Thursday
meeting of the full commission to discuss the staff report on the
Clinton and Dole campaigns. Several of six commissioners admitted
that even they could not fully understand the statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Commission Chairman Scott E. Thomas called the laws
governing campaign advertisements ``less than clear.'' He said
previous FEC rulings had allowed advertisements that told viewers
not to vote for a certain candidate even though the commercials
were supposed to promote only generic party themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how you say that doesn't help that candidate's opponent
is something I don't fully understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David M. Mason who called the statutes ``fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Reno has refused to comment on either the FEC
staff audit or the views of the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Reno decided against appointing an independent
counsel to investigate whether Vice President Gore lied to Justice
Department officials during an investigation last year of
fund-raising phone calls he placed from his White House office
during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision drew fire from Republicans who said there was
abundant evidence to justify the appointment of a special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that Reno's hand-picked campaign-finance
prosecutor, Charles La Bella, who left the job last July,
recommended appointing an independent counsel to look into possible
campaign law violations by Clinton. In addition, they noted that
FBI Director Louis Freeh also recommended a special prosecutor to
investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said no evidence of impeachable offenses
against the president were found in a review of secret memorandums
on campaign fund-raising written by La Bella and Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Dinh said the committee's abandonment of the campaign finance
issue relieves some of the pressure on Reno to appoint an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans lose their ability to point to the
recommendations of Freeh and La Bella and say, `You must be
covering up something,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinh added: ``Clinton could very well walk away without a
scratch _ again.''

 &HT;    JACKSON CALLS INCOME GAP 'DIRTY LITTLE SECRET'
 &HT;    430 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson vowed Friday to ``set the
pace'' in the campaign for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination by focusing the nation's attention on income inequality
and the unbroken cycle of poverty in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised luncheon speech to the National Press Club,
Jackson said his recent visits to poverty-stricken communities of
Appalachia have expanded his views, most of which were formed in
the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I am driven by the moral imperative to leave no
American behind,'' he said. ``That's why I am more convinced than
ever that the single most important issue facing our nation as we
move into the next century is the ever-widening gap between the
haves and have-nots in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, noting that other prominent Democrats have tested
campaign themes this week, said he was ``pleased to be able to
participate in this important exercise.'' But he did not commit
himself to running what would be his third presidential campaign
for his party's nomination. He ran in 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have not yet decided whether or not to enter the race,
I do intend to set the pace,'' he said. He would do so by
challenging the Democratic candidates to come with him to such poor
Appalachian communities as Mud Creek, a tiny town in hills of
eastern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The ``test'' of Democratic presidential candidates in 2000 is
``Do you matter to Mud Creek?'' Jackson said. ``Do you have
anything to say that is relevant to the people of eastern Kentucky
and central West Virginia and Appalachian Ohio, where good people,
working hard, have tried to break the cycle of poverty?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said ``America's dirty little secret'' is how the gap
between the richest and poorest Americans has grown over the past
two decades. According to the Census Bureau, the bottom half of the
wage-earning population has seen its income stagnate over the past
20 years, while the top 5 percent of households have seen their
income double.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't hear presidential candidates talk about this much,
if at all,'' Jackson said. ``We need to talk about this gap. We
need to confront it. We need to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has persuaded President Clinton and House
Speaker-designate Bob Livingston to participate in a two-day
conference with Wall Street executives in New York next month to
examine ways to promote private investment in inner cities and
rural areas. It is the second such event hosted by Jackson. Both
have been timed to commemorate the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.

FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   The following stories are budgeted for Sunday, December 6, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   DELTA-VPS _ ATLANTA _ Fred Reid doesn't know all the gory
details behind the management overhaul that brought him to Delta
Air Lines, nor does he particularly care to. Reid is one of four
new EVP's recruited over the past few months by CEO Leo Mullin, who
has steadily eased out the old guard and installed his own team of
newcomers. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING-TOYS _ATLANTA _ Kids play a big part in influencing
family spending, to the tune of $150 billion a year. Everything
from cereal, toys, tvs, cars and even family vacation destinations.
Marketing to children becomes a very complex and sophisticated
communication process. Parents may also come to realize that the
marketplace is an important agent for socialization of children's
culture as much as, or more so, than schools and parents. How do
marketing firms design ads that get kids to put pressure on their
parents to purchase certain items? And how do parents feel about
this pressure on kids for consumerism? (Brraddock/Poole, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-BOOKS _ATLANTA _Seldom in recent years have book readers had
such a wide array of business topics, from the markets to the
millennium. (McNaughton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   $GIFTS-KIDS _ATLANTA _Financial gifts for children. Here are
some gifts with staying power.Photo: Eighth grader Justin Oberste
will talk about the money his dad gave him and why he now puts a
third of his allowance into a mutual fund. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CHARITY _ ATLANTA _ During the holiday season, you may give to
charities ``from the heart.'' But be sure to use your mind also to
avoid wasting your money. Bitten by the holiday spirit, many people
are more free with their money, and solicitors _ honest and
dishonest _ know this. Americans annually give more than $100
billion to charities and other non-profit groups _ and about $1
billion goes to frauds. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE-GIFT _The thorny issue of gift-giving in the office. How
do you do it without appearing like you're sucking up? The
etiquette of office gift giving can be a minefield. How much should
you spend? What's too personal? One hint: stay away from ties,
(think Monica and Bill on this one). And scratch those cigars off
your list. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic
truths of human nature: one person's trash is another person's
treasure. The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a
little too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with
online shopping. Still, if you read the directions carefully and
ignore the $250 Furby's, (unless the money is going to charity) you
can find your own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate_ at an
online auction. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>

<P>
   The following stories are budgeted for Sunday, December 6, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   DELTA-VPS _ ATLANTA _ Fred Reid doesn't know all the gory
details behind the management overhaul that brought him to Delta
Air Lines, nor does he particularly care to. Reid is one of four
new EVP's recruited over the past few months by CEO Leo Mullin, who
has steadily eased out the old guard and installed his own team of
newcomers. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING-TOYS _ATLANTA _ Kids play a big part in influencing
family spending, to the tune of $150 billion a year. Everything
from cereal, toys, tvs, cars and even family vacation destinations.
Marketing to children becomes a very complex and sophisticated
communication process. Parents may also come to realize that the
marketplace is an important agent for socialization of children's
culture as much as, or more so, than schools and parents. How do
marketing firms design ads that get kids to put pressure on their
parents to purchase certain items? And how do parents feel about
this pressure on kids for consumerism? (Brraddock/Poole, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-BOOKS _ATLANTA _Seldom in recent years have book readers had
such a wide array of business topics, from the markets to the
millennium. (McNaughton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   $GIFTS-KIDS _ATLANTA _Financial gifts for children. Here are
some gifts with staying power.Photo: Eighth grader Justin Oberste
will talk about the money his dad gave him and why he now puts a
third of his allowance into a mutual fund. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CHARITY _ ATLANTA _ During the holiday season, you may give to
charities ``from the heart.'' But be sure to use your mind also to
avoid wasting your money. Bitten by the holiday spirit, many people
are more free with their money, and solicitors _ honest and
dishonest _ know this. Americans annually give more than $100
billion to charities and other non-profit groups _ and about $1
billion goes to frauds. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE-GIFT _The thorny issue of gift-giving in the office. How
do you do it without appearing like you're sucking up? The
etiquette of office gift giving can be a minefield. How much should
you spend? What's too personal? One hint: stay away from ties,
(think Monica and Bill on this one). And scratch those cigars off
your list. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic
truths of human nature: one person's trash is another person's
treasure. The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a
little too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with
online shopping. Still, if you read the directions carefully and
ignore the $250 Furby's, (unless the money is going to charity) you
can find your own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate_ at an
online auction. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

has won 10 games in five of his six seasons as head coach, won the
SEC championship last season and is favored to win another title

   FBO-PREPFOOTBALL _ ATLANTA _ To many Georgia high school
communities, winning football programs is of paramount importance.
Schools and their backers go to great lengths to assure that trophy
cases in the campus lobby will fill up. In the '90s, the vehicle
for providing the resources for success is well-financed booster
clubs who provide first-class facilities and equipment and
well-paid coaches to the schools. While many urban schools toil in
run-down stadiums, a few of the booster-driven teams play in spiffy
areans with ``luxury boxes'' and fancy clubhouses outside the
gates. A look at how booster clubs operate and how counties and
schools across the state compensate football coaches. (Fish,

</P>
<P>
   VALDOSTA _ The originator of booster clubs, founded in 1944.
It's no coincidence that claims the most football victories
nationwide. But because it's a city school in an area where other
schools are gaining on them, times have been tougher in recent
years. The club has 1,300 members, down from 1,800, but still pays
for a two-week camp before the season for players, a car for the
head coach and a coaches fund to slip the staff bonuses after the
season. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BROOKWOOD _ The model for metro Atlanta. Brookwood has quickly
become a statewide power since its birth in the mid-'80s, and other
schools in Gwinnett are imitating the Broncos. The head coach has
his own TV show and is treated royally. He teaches no classes and
boosters gave him and his wife a trip to Hawaii. The touchdown club
has been a rallying point for affluent parents who donate their
time and money to the football program. (Fish, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WESTSIDE _ The new kid on the block. The Macon, Ga., school,
just two years old, was created in part to draw students back from
the dozen or so private schools in the city. And the lure is
football. Parents and Bibb County school officials see football to
better things in the community. Officials claim the school system
has been in decline since integration. The new superintendent from
football-crazy Odessa, Texas, convinced the board of education to
increase coaching stipends to $22,000. Enrollment at the school is
1,700 and growing, and the team is winning. (Fish, Atlanta

ROMAN ROOST FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rome has seven hills, and from the best rooms at the Hassler
Hotel, which sits gloriously at the top of the Spanish Steps, the
panorama includes not only two of them _ the Aventine and the
Quirinale _ but also the Piazza di Spagna, St. Peter's and the
Pantheon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other important Roman hotels boast great locations. At the
Excelsior a visitor can practically fall out of bed onto the Via
Veneto, and the Eden is a stone's throw from the Spanish Steps. But
only the Hassler has dazzling views, a 120-year-old pedigree and
the best shopping in Rome just 136 steps away _ at the foot of the
famous steps that spill directly into the heart of the elegant Via
Condotti. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years the Hassler has been the hotel of choice for
international celebrities, American politicians and movie stars
from Audrey Hepburn, who wanted her room filled with camellias when
she filmed ``Roman Holiday,'' to Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise, Woody
Allen and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone told Roberto Wirth, the managing director, that she
had stayed at the Hassler on her first honeymoon. When asked when
that was, the actress replied: ``Before my first divorce.'' Roughly
40 percent of the hotel's clientele is American, according to
Wirth.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the Hassler's haughty stature is that it does not
hesitate to turn away clients that it feels would make its guests
unhappy. On that list: Madonna, when she was only a rock star
(motherhood got her through the Hassler's doors), and Muhammad Ali,
who refused to put on a tie to enter its august rooftop
restaurant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The classically elegant eight-story building is done in ochre,
with greenish brown window shutters. Above the windows are
ornaments reminiscent of the Medici family crest. The lobby has a
formal, Old World feel, with its marble floors, boiserie and
upholstered chairs. The back of the hotel faces the private Villa
Medici park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lobby also boasts a sculpture of a she-wolf, symbol of Rome.
It is a copy of the original made for the Hassler in Naples. But
the nose of the otherwise bronze statue is white. It was worn down,
so the story goes, by American officers who used to touch it for
good luck when the U.S. military took over the hotel in World War
11.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the Hassler has been sufficiently central to
Roman life that even Mussolini took note, complaining that the name
did not sound Italian enough, and insisting that the hotel be
renamed Villa Medici, which it was until the end of World War II.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fairly small hotel _ just 85 rooms and 15 suites _ remains
one of the few leading city hotels still owned and run by a single
family. Roberto Wirth's father, Oscar Wirth, was the partner of
Albert Hassler. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hassler's father, born in Switzerland, started the
business when he bought a small pension in Naples. By 1870, he had
changed the name to the Hotel Hassler. Fifteen years later, after
the family had moved to Rome, Albert Hassler bought the
200-year-old palazzo, once home to Napoleon's sister, from the
Santorelli family and converted it into a hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1915 a Hassler son-in-law, who then owned the Eden Hotel,
joined his Swiss-born friend Oscar Wirth, and the pair started
running the two hotels. Though Robertogrew up living at the Eden in
1964, when the families went their separate ways, the Wirths kept
the Hassler. (Descendants of the Hassler family sold its interest
in the Eden to the Forte group in 1989.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Hassler from one generation to the next was not
easy. The Wirths' older son, Roberto, was deaf at birth, and though
he worked at odd jobs at the hotel as a small boy and wanted
desperately to be in the hotel business, his father was not
particularly supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband wanted to get a farm for Roberto or maybe have him
become a graphic designer,'' said Carmen Wirth, Wirth's mother, in
a telephone interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Wirth wouldn't give up. After attending the American
School for the Deaf in New Haven, and Gallaudet University in
Washington, ``he applied to Cornell Hotel School himself and got in
as a special student,'' his mother said proudly. ``He was the only
deaf person they have ever taken. I think to a great extent he owes
his success to his will power.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once out of school, Wirth did the traditional training at
various hotels. It was not always easy. ``I was working in the
kitchen of one hotel, when a cook shouted to pass the butter,''
Wirth recalled. ``Since I did not understand what he wanted, I
asked him to write a note. He reacted badly. I lost my patience and
threw a cloth at him. As a reaction he took his knife and
threatened to hurt me. Fortunately another cook intervened and
divided us. The chef wanted to fire us, but I explained what
happened and we made peace.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today Wirth, who reads lips with ease in English, French, German
and of course Italian, has the hotel firmly in hand. ``The most
difficult part of my job is of course communications,'' he
acknowledged during a recent interview at New York's Four Seasons
Hotel, where he stayed when he came to run the marathon.

increase coaching stipends to $22,000. Enrollment at the school is
1,700 and growing, and the team is winning. (Fish, Atlanta

 UNDATED: the marathon.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the interview he communicated with the help of an
interpreter who talked with him using both lip reading and sign
language, and then translated.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth spoke about the great skill required in running a hotel
and the need to meet clients' demands. It helps that over the years
he and his 170-person staff have become familiar with some very
fussy clients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each year a South American family rents a pair of
suites for three weeks. ``One suite is just for fitness machines,''
Wirth said. ``The gentleman rents a pair of treadmills: one for
himself and one for his wife. Then he rents a Stairmaster and a
bicycle.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like some other stars, the rock singer Brian Adams brought his
own chef, who also stayed at the hotel. ``They want special diets
and so we let the chef go into the kitchen,'' said Sabina Galdiolo,
who handles the hotel's public relations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Shiffer, the model, asked for special chocolates late at
night. The hotel's chef made her small milk chocolate turtles on
the spot  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Hassler, where a standard double is $420 and
suites begin at $1,357, has competition for well-heeled guests, but
not so much as one might assume. Despite the boom in tourism for
Italy, far fewer chains have made appearances on the hotel
landscape in Rome than in other major European cities.
</P>
<P>
   Rome, of course, is not a business destination in the way that
Paris, London and New York are, and it has neither a Ritz Carlton,
a Peninsula nor a Four Seasons, though Wirth said that the Four
Seasons chain had made an offer for the Hassler. However, Wirth
intends eventually to turn the hotel over to his 6-year-old twin
son and daughter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the Hassler is family-owned is probably one of
the most important ingredients of its success,'' he said, citing
``the feel of a private club or a home where being personally
welcomed really counts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The Hassler is not a commercial hotel. We don't have
the facilities or size to cater to a business population. We do
have a few people who ask for e-mail, but not many.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Hassler you can still leave your shoes out to be polished
overnight, and one of the hotel's five concierges hands guests real
keys instead of cards. Pages arrive at any time of the day or night
bearing messages on silver trays, and the hotel florist goes to the
flower market daily and arranges fresh flowers for the guest rooms
and public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Galdiolo said that sometimes as many as 30 percent of the
guests dine in their rooms. Since 22 of those rooms have terraces,
its easy to understand the tempation. Soaps and lotions come from
an Italian firm called Bottega dell'Albergho, which provides
personalized items for a variety of Italian hotels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing the hotel still lacks is a health club. Until the
health facility is completed next year, the principal sports
activity will continue to be a jog with Wirth, who runs daily
through the nearby Villa Borghese gardens. ``Clients like to go
with me because I know the special parts of the park,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite guest activity, with Prada, Bulgari, Ferragamo
and Gucci so close at hand, is shopping, and Wirth has helped make
that somewhat easier. He is president of the Associazione Trinita
dei Monti, which, together with the Associazione Piazza di Spagna,
monitors the upkeep of the upper and lower piazzas.
</P>
<P>
   While even he could not stop what he sees as the lamentable
arrival of a McDonald's in the Piazza di Spagna, Wirth is pleased
that two public elevators have been installed and are open after a
long hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   They carry Romans, along with tired foreign shoppers, from just
under the Spanish Steps to a subway entrance on the Piazza Trinita
dei Monte _ only steps away from the Hassler.

INTERNET COMPANY BROKERS GOOD IDEAS FROM EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the corporate world's most undervalued assets is the
employee idea bank.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies aren't very good at cultivating this resource.
They may encourage employee suggestions, for example, but they
don't follow through on them. Or they fail to reward employees when
suggestions save money. Either way, employees get the message their
ideas don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies do sometimes have ideas that go unheard,'' said
Barry Lawrence, director of the Society for Human Resource
Management in Alexandria, Va. ``It's a crying shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Laurin wants to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin, 37, used to develop employee suggestion systems for
several management consulting firms before striking out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I'd meet smart people with great ideas, and they
were just stifled,'' he said. ``The mechanics of getting ideas
approved in organizations killed a lot of innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   So a year ago, Laurin founded the internet company BrainBank
(www.brain-bank.com) to serve as a kind of idea broker.
</P>
<P>
   He solicits cost-saving suggestions from people, then takes them
back to the companies they work for. If the company uses the idea,
both BrainBank and the employee who came up with the suggestion get
to share in the savings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, BrainBank, which is headquartered in Montreal, claims to
have brokered more than 30 ideas, some of them worth six and seven
figures in savings to companies and a tidy sum to the people who
came up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie, who wouldn't give her last name or the name of the
business she worked for, said she used BrainBank to get her company
to save money on overnight delivery costs.
</P>
<P>
   She works for a company that wholesales tour packages to travel
agencies. Many times, the company would send multiple overnight
packages to the same address, she said. She figured the company
could save $37,000 a year in carrier costs by consolidating its
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going directly to the company with her idea, she went
to BrainBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I were to bring it up (to the company,) I wouldn't
get the recognition or monetary reward,'' she said. ``It's not a
part of our pay scheme. There's no real incentive to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to put her plan into action, and she pocketed
$13,875 for the idea, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' she said. ``It felt like I actually made a
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   For each idea that a company agrees to implement, BrainBank
takes 12.5 percent of the net first year's savings. The employee
who suggested it gets 37.5 percent of the first year's savings. The
company that implements the idea gets the rest of the cost savings,
plus 100 percent of future savings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some initial success with BrainBank, however, Laurin
said it quickly became clear that companies weren't always eager to
pay a middleman for their own employees' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encountered increased resistance,'' Laurin said. ``What we
saw is companies want to manage this process themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin took the suggestion. Now BrainBank has developed intranet
software that allows clients to form their own in-house idea
management systems, and it is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence of the Society for Human Resource Management said many
companies are looking for a fresh approach to soliciting employee
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The old suggestion box systems have a lot of stigmas attached to
them, he said. ``People feel like they're beating their heads
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The BrainBank software allows employees to make their
suggestions anonymously. Using software applications developed by
BrainBank, the employee does a complete cost-benefit analysis on
his idea. Then the idea goes into a central file. Department
managers can peruse all the ideas, but they won't know where they
came from.
</P>
<P>
   That allows the ideas to be evaluated solely on their merit,
Laurin said. If a manager likes an idea, he can ``take ownership of
its implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   When ideas are turned into programs, both the employee and the
manager who implemented the program get to share in the rewards, he
said. BrainBank, which licenses the software, also gets 10 percent
of the savings for the first year only.
</P>
<P>
   BrainBank is testing the intranet software at several companies
and said demand has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion that ideas come from top management is changing,
Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the best ideas come from the bottom of the pyramid,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Listening for solutions. That's the whole idea.

SYNTH-POP BAND DEPECHE MODE FINDS ITSELF BACK IN FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Gore, guitarist, keyboardist and background vocalist for
Depeche Mode, is enjoying the live, visceral power of the English
synth-pop band's first concert tour in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing a musician sitting there behind us at a drum kit and
feeling that physical sound coming from the drums is very different
for us,'' Gore said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we've used a drummer for the whole set.''
</P>
<P>
   And thanks in part to an array of sophisticated computers, the
shows are running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running computers for the first time on this tour,''
Gore added. ``And we've got this really good guy running them. So
we haven't really had one problem on the whole tour, which is
pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tour supports ``The Singles: 1986-1998,'' a 21-song
double album that includes the new single, ``Only When I Lose
Myself,'' but excludes early hits by Vince Clarke, now with
Erasure.
</P>
<P>
   There's a definite advantage to a tour based on a retrospective
album, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to go out and play songs that most people know,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go out on tour with a new album, a lot of our fans are
obsessive, so a lot of them know the songs anyway. But there's an
element in the audience that won't have bought the new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this tour, I think everyone in the audience knows every
song we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he is proud of the album, and quite satisfied with how
it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to putting out this album for some
time,'' he said. ``From 1986 until now, we've pretty much liked
everything we recorded. I think we started getting things right in
about 1986. But we put off releasing the album at least a couple of
times, so it's good to finally get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Depeche Mode, which very loosely translates as ``quick fashion''
in French, formed in 1980. The group discarded its guitars in favor
of synthesizers and jumped headlong into London's stylish ``new
romantic'' scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Clarke left the group in the early '80s, Gore took over the
role as chief songwriter. A run of hit singles featuring Gore's
moody, introspective lyrics transformed the group into an
arena-size act with a legion of fans.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Black Celebration'' in 1986, the group reintroduced
guitars and increased its profile in Europe. The 1987 album ``Music
for the Masses'' lived up to its title by turning the group into a
major concert attraction in the United States. The band's 1988 U.S.
tour, later captured on the 1989 double live album ``101,''
concluded with a concert at Pasadena's Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Depeche Mode now enjoys newfound popularity in the United States
as electronic-based music increases in profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly America got electronica and everybody wants to know
about it, whereas in the rest of the world it's been accepted for a
long while,'' Gore said with a touch of disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think too much importance, especially over here,
is being paid to the instrumentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the synth-pop pioneers were the subject of a tribute
album featuring current techno artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the greatest honors a band can have,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's previous album was ``Ultra,'' a dark, redemptive
techno-rock collection. Its release followed singer David Gahan's
1996 drug overdose, which delayed the group's plans to tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had actually been clean for about six months at that
stage,'' Gore said. ``We just thought it would be a bit precarious
for him to be going out into a really unstable environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from that, we'd been in the studio for 15 months on and
off making `Ultra,' and we weren't really in the right frame of
mind for going straight into rehearsals and straight out on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to core members Gore, Gahan and keyboardist Andy
Fletcher, the tour includes keyboardist Peter Gordeno (replacing
Alan Wilder, who left in 1995) and Austrian drummer Christian
Eigner, as well as gospel singers Jordan Bailey and Janet Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the band has no immediate plans to return to the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a relaxed attitude about the next album,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have lives outside of the band and there are times when
we want to do things that normal people do. After the tour, we'll
sit down and decide what to do.''

FOR SINGLE VOLUNTEERS, ROMANCE AT THE SOUP KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C., Pa., Fla., Ohio, Texas, Mass., Vt.)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Single men and women beware. It's mistletoe season
yet again, which means it's time for your annual holiday endurance
test: trying to dodge meddling relatives who insist you call the
son or daughter of a friend (``One dinner won't kill you!'') and
cocktail parties where no one will let you drink in peace
(``There's this woman from my office I've been wanting you to
meet''). Finally there is the blessed release of January, when the
nasty truth about so many of those happy couples touting
togetherness comes out and the single population gets a fresh
infusion of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, here at least, is that not everyone is
despairing, starting with the 3,500 members of Single Volunteers of
D.C. This organization, founded in March 1997 by Dana Kressierer
and Catharine Robertson, has a different take on the dating game:
if you're going to spend time and effort to meet someone but have
no luck, your energies won't have been wasted if you've done good
works while looking. And that means all kinds of work, everything
from delivering meals to homebound people with AIDS to building
houses to pulling ivy off the monkey house at the National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a stereotype to singles groups,'' Ms. Kressierer, 29,
says. ``That women are only interested in dressing up and guys are
only there to pick up women. In our group, the superficiality of
singles bars and dances isn't there. People are meeting with no
makeup on and up to their knees in mud. You meet in your natural
state, so it's about who you are, not what you look like or how
much money you make or what kind of car you drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kressierer runs Single Volunteers alone these days. At the
group's first meeting, lightning struck. Ms. Robertson met Patrick
Savolskis, fell in love, and the couple are to be married next
year. This automatically disqualifies her since members are
required to be single and available.
</P>
<P>
   On this Saturday afternoon, Ms. Kressierer stops for lunch at
the Capital City Brewing Company before heading for the Capital
Area Food Bank. While sipping a beer and chain-smoking (``It keeps
me sane''), she is greeted by a morning shift of Single Volunteers,
a dozen men and women who have come from Bright Beginnings, a day
care center for homeless people, where they have built cribs before
lunch. It is Single Volunteers' policy that all work be followed by
a social event. ``It gives everyone a chance to mingle,'' Ms.
Kressierer says. ``The work gives them an initial topic of
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the table are men and women who seem to be in their
late 20s and early 30s, dressed in sweaters and jeans, talking
comfortably, if not amorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shy,'' Ms. Kressierer says. ``The first time they
come they think, `This must be a bunch of losers,' then they see,
`Oh, they're just like me.' We have beauty queens and non-beauty
queens, every size and shape. I've never seen a group with more
lawyers in my life. There are a lot of computer people. And I think
every Hill staffer is in the group, too. You can make a lot of
friends here. People write and tell me, `I've gone out on a couple
dates and haven't met the right guy, but I've met my best
friend.'''
</P>
<P>
   The same afternoon, at the Capital Area Food Bank, more Single
Volunteers are split into sections, some sorting donations, others
assembling Thanksgiving care packages. The latter dozen work so
quickly that Food Bank personnel are summoned to bring more
supplies. In one afternoon, 700 boxes are assembled. In this
instance, shyness seems to be a great motivator. Most of the men
concentrate fiercely on their work, while the women seem more
chatty, with each other at least.
</P>
<P>
   The day's team leader is Mary Pletcher, who is all of 21. ``I'm
the young one,'' she says, blushing. ``I've been doing this for six
months and I've really enjoyed it. I've had a couple of good dates
and met some really neat people. I think if you volunteer, you
generally meet quality people. No creeps.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth project for David Piccirilli, 28. He's had no
dates yet, but says gamely: ``That's what I'm hoping for. At least
everybody's in the same boat, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Single Volunteers events are scheduled on the weekends and
all are organized to include a minimum of 12. While single men
everywhere have figured out that volunteering can be a fertile
meeting ground, it is only because the ratio of women to men tends
to be so overwhelming. It is Single Volunteers' policy to divide
members equally, so the women have a fighting chance, too. The
organization averages 40 events a month.
</P>
<P>
   Women sign up first, Ms. Kressierer says, while ``men wait until
the last minute.'' She adds, ``If they did it quicker, we could do
more projects, but there's a lack of planning on the part of men.''
</P>
<P>
   The group does not screen membership, nor does it charge fees or
accept phone calls. All communications are through the Internet
(www.singlevolunteers.org).
</P>
<P>
   Since most projects require only 20 to 30 volunteers, Ms.
Kressierer says the chances of meeting new people each week are
high. The group also sponsors a cocktail party once a month that
draws between 300 and 500 members. The minimum age is 21, though
the group's average age is early 30s. ``The 35-and-older group is
particularly active,'' she says, organizing additional social
activities for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel at all like a meat market the way traditional
singles things do,'' says Meg Spencer, 38, who has dated men
through the group. ``It's also great for people, who work at home
who don't have a steady way to meet people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Rogers, who would say only that she was over 40, did her
first project with Single Volunteers in August for Trash Force, and
spent an afternoon picking up garbage on the Washington Mall with
David Kerlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been on a date in years,'' she says. ``We walked and
talked and went to lunch and ate and talked and I guess we got
lost, because I don't know where the rest of the group went.''
They've been seeing each other ever since, and Ms. Rogers refers to
him fondly as ``my trashy date.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its projects, Single Volunteers has built a house with
Green Home, an organization that builds environmentally friendly
homes, and Habitat for Humanity, and has worked on the American
Horticultural Society's annual fund-raiser and its Chili Pepper
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular activity is the Equine Rescue and Rehabilitation
Program. ``It's for horses people don't want or who have been
abused,'' Ms. Kressierer says, ``and they nurse them back to
health. We have people fighting for the privilege of mucking stalls
and oiling fences. If a project like this closes early, I'll
usually get disappointed e-mails saying, `I was waiting for this
for six weeks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, complaints are few, Ms. Kressierer says. When
she does need counsel on issues concerning the group, she contacts
Anne Lusk, who started the original Single Volunteers in Stowe,
Vt., in 1993. Ms. Lusk, now 50, was then newly separated from her
husband, and her children were grown. She spent her first
Thanksgiving alone, working in a local restaurant that was feeding
the homeless and that later fed the volunteers, most of whom were
single, with a communal meal.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of combining singles and volunteerism stuck, and Ms.
Lusk was in a position to do something about it. A design
instructor at the University of Vermont, she was also a
gubernatorial appointee to the Vermont Board of Forests, Parks and
Recreation and knew all the right people to get volunteer work. The
only thing she was missing was men, so she joined a local dating
service, got its list and called all the men on it, cold. They
came.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Lusk moved to Ann Arbor, where she is pursuing a
Ph.D. in urban planning and landscape architecture at the
University of Michigan. Since her departure, the Stowe chapter of
Single Volunteers has folded. The amount of work it takes to keep a
chapter going can be daunting; Ms. Kressierer says she spends 20
hours a week on her group, in addition to her full-time job as a
quality control expert at HT Medical Systems in Rockville, Md. (It
is a job she got through a man in Single Volunteers who had praised
her organizational skills and urged her to apply.)
</P>
<P>
   Single Volunteers continues to flourish, however, in Bucks
County, Pa., South Florida, Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth and
western Massachusetts. And Ms. Lusk still advises people on how to
set up chapters (AnneLusk(AT)aol.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kressierer says she has received numerous inquiries from
people in New York to start a chapter, in spite of the active
volunteerism there already _ and its own resulting social scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those groups are all the same with way more women,'' she
notes. ``When you finish a project, it's over. There is no team
leader dedicated to making sure people are introduced around and
have someone to talk to. And there's the age issue. We now have
groups for people 40 and over because they don't want to have to
hang out with 20-year-olds. They meet people in their age group who
they know are interested in dating.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her group's success, she adds, it still has some
glitches. ``A girl might think she's in a committed relationship,
but the guy is still in the group,'' she says. ``I once saw a guy
at an event who wasn't supposed to be there, but I was glad since
we had gone out the week before and had such a good time. But he
was with a woman who thought he was seeing only her. I didn't know
about her and she didn't know about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kressierer shrugs and smiles philosophically. ``It's up to
the individual to determine if he or she is available,'' she says.
``Every couple of months, I'll send out a message asking, `Is there
anyone still here who has met someone?' And I'll get answers
saying: `Yes, but don't kick me off the list. We're dating, but we
may break up.'''

 &HT;    TRUCK CRASHES KILLED 5,335 PEOPLE LAST YEAR
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crashes involving large trucks killed 5,335 people
nationwide in 1997, the highest toll in eight years, a consumer
safety group reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Government transportation agencies need to step in to make the
highways safer from these big rigs, Joan Claybrook, chair of
Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH), warned. She
announced the results of the study, which is based on U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) data, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking remains America's most dangerous commercial
enterprise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trucking industry said that ``the risk of being
killed in a car-truck collision is at an all-time low.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of trucks and cars on the highways has increased
dramatically over the past two decades. So while the total number
of deaths rose slightly last year _ from 5,142 in 1996 to 5,335 in
1997 _ the number of deaths per miles driven has dropped steadily
for decades, said Walter McCormick, president of the American
Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any death on our nation's highways is a tragedy,'' said
McCormick. ``But the hysteria being orchestrated cannot hide the
facts. ... Miles driven are up. The fatality rate is down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, the fatality rate in crashes involving big
trucks has fallen from 6 deaths to 2.4 deaths per million miles
driven, the DOT figures show.
</P>
<P>
   But Claybrook said the fact that more Americans are being killed
in truck-related crashes is reason enough for tightening government
controls on the industry. She called for reforms including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Restricting the size of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing fatigue by limiting drivers to eight-hour workdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Subjecting trucks to more inspections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating better training for all drivers and tougher
penalties on bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring better reflectors on trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are being killed by increasingly heavier trucks
driven by increasingly fatigued drivers,'' charged Michael Scippa,
executive director of CRASH, a non-profit advocacy group devoted to
``working to make the highways safer for all motorists, including
truck drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, whose group represents the trucking industry, issued
a written statement disputing the CRASH conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is doing more than the trucking industry to make our
highways safer. We have to. The roads are where our nation's 3
million truck drivers live and work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CRASH report said there were 444,000 highway accidents
involving big trucks in 1997, resulting in 5,335 deaths and 133,000
injuries. This is the highest number of deaths since 1989, when
5,360 people where killed in crashes involving trucks.

EVERY BIOGRAPHER'S DREAM: `HOT DOCS'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAI BIRD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I like to call them ``Hot Docs.'' Every biographer
dreams of stumbling upon a private archive of old letters and
diaries. Interviews and oral histories are necessary, of course,
but notoriously unreliable. A diary entry, a private letter or
better yet, a verbatim telephone transcript is like gold.
</P>
<P>
   I first hit a vein in 1982 when I went to interview Averell
Harriman for my first book, a biography of John J. McCloy, the Wall
Street lawyer and perennial ``chairman'' of the foreign policy
establishment. Harriman, the former governor of New York and
diplomat who was then 91, gave me 30 minutes, but it was a
lackluster interview and he knew it. His hearing aid was not
working very well, and he couldn't remember much about his old
friend Jack McCloy.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy that he had not been particularly useful, he turned to
his secretary and said: ``Why don't you show Mr. Bird down to the
dungeon and see if he can find anything there?''
</P>
<P>
   Escorted downstairs to a spare, windowless room, I was left
alone to rummage through a score of file cabinets bulging with tens
of thousands of letters, telephone transcripts and top-secret
government documents. One file cabinet drawer contained papers from
his stint as ambassador to Moscow during World War II. Another
housed classified documents on the Central Intelligence Agency's
financing of Christian Democrats in Italy's 1948 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Harriman had evidently made it his habit to take home with him
carbons and sometimes the originals of top-secret State Department,
CIA and White House documents from his stints as ambassador, as
chief of the Marshall Plan in the late '40s and as assistant
secretary of state and ambassador at large under Presidents John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. There was, for instance, a complete
copy of Harriman's negotiations with Nikita Khrushchev in 1963 over
the Limited Atmospheric Test Ban agreement. There were thousands of
pages of State and Defense Department cables on the Vietnam War.
There were reports from the Joint Chiefs on the status and number
of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Being a rich man, Harriman had also made it a practice to have
his own personal secretary when he was in government. This
secretary routinely listened on a ``dead'' phone extension to all
of Harriman's phone conversations, and recorded them in shorthand.
These were then transcribed, typed up and filed chronologically.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that first day, a Friday, I came upstairs and said
that I'd found some correspondence between Harriman and McCloy, but
that there was more material, and could I come back next Friday?
Sure, why not? said the secretary, who is best left unnamed. I came
back the next week, and the week after that. In the end, I spent
literally a year of Fridays in Harriman's dungeon. By the end, I
had filled a four-drawer file cabinet with copies of his documents.
This file cabinet now resides in my own dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most sensitive material came from a collection of
papers _ memos, reports and letters _ written by Michael Forrestal,
a key aide to McGeorge Bundy, who had served as national security
adviser to both Kennedy and Johnson from 1961 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Forrestal was assigned by Bundy to report to him on intelligence
matters, specifically the meetings of the 5412 Committee, which
supervised covert action programs like the ``34-A'' operations
against North Vietnam in 1964 that provoked the Gulf of Tonkin
affair. Forrestal also became Bundy's chief eyes and ears on things
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, I heard that Forrestal, who died in 1989, had
gotten all copies of his papers back from Harriman. So last year, I
tracked down a friend of Forrestal's in Manhattan who I had learned
might have inherited some of his estate. Hoping to find more of
Forrestal's papers, I called her up and over the phone she said,
yes, she had some boxes of his papers downstairs in her storage
cage. And yes, if I helped her dig out the boxes, I could have a
look at them. On the appointed day, I arrived and was greeted by
her and, alas, a senior partner from Forrestal's law firm, Shearman
&AMP; Sterling. This gentleman introduced himself as Forrestal's
literary executor. He explained that I could not look at the papers
because they were still classified.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Forrestal's papers remain unpublished and classified.
But thanks to Harriman's dungeon, I was able to publish numerous
extracts in both ``The Chairman: John J. McCloy, the Making of the
American Establishment'' and my new book, ``The Color of Truth,''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster) a biography of McGeorge Bundy and his brother
William.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these still-classified documents include crucial
evidence about such historical controversies as whether Kennedy had
decided to withdraw from Vietnam before he was assassinated. One
Forrestal memo, for instance, quotes Kennedy instructing his aides
``to seize upon any favorable moment to reduce our involvement'' in
Vietnam. Aside from unsubstantiated oral history statements, this
is the only contemporaneous archival document that attests to
Kennedy's desire to find a way out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Harriman's papers eventually landed at the Library of Congress.
Many of them, however, also remain classified. Copies from my
dungeon can be found on the Web site: www.historians.org.

DOCTORS, OTHER PROFESSIONALS AT VETERANS HOSPITAL VOTE FOR UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Physicians at the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Kansas City on Wednesday became the first doctors in the
Kansas City area to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   They, along with nurses, physical therapists and other
professional care providers, voted for the American Federation of
Government Employees to represent them over the National Federation
of Federal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   But a protest filed by the national Federation of Federal
Employees kept the election results from being certified Wednesday
night by the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   Union supporters had complained that a sweeping reorganization
of the hospital over several years had left the 500-member
professional staff with little say in how it was run.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's staff joins a growing number of physicians and
other health professionals participating in unions as managed care
takes away their independence and cost-cutting undermines their
financial security.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only about 2 percent to 3 percent of nation's 700,000
doctors belong to unions, according to the American Medical
Association. Sixteen percent of nurses are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   But the ranks of unionized medical professionals are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Two unions, one in Florida and another in California, together
represent about 10,000 physicians and dentists nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Organized doctors have been challenging health maintenance
organizations in New Jersey and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Department of Veterans Affairs system, the American
Federation of Government Employees has organized professional
bargaining units at about 10 hospitals in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional workers in the past had some control over the
quality of their work,'' said Eugene Martin, the union's national
organizer. ``Now they see decisions being made that the people
actually doing the work don't think should be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansaas City, Veterans Hospital Director Hugh Doran said he
would work with the union, but he was puzzled as to why his
professional employees would want to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to accept or understand...the need to have a
union,'' he said. ``You have the Number 1 hospital in the (regional
VA) network in terms of quality and patient satisfaction. Our
accomplishments here in the past couple of years have been
exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors at Veterans Hospital are the first to unionize
locally, they may not be alone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Some Kansas City area orthopedic surgeons in private practice
have met with the Federation of Physicians and Dentists, based in
Tallahassee, Fla., for information on organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some general discussion whether they want to
move in that direction,'' said union Executive Director Jack
Seddon.
</P>
<P>
   As managed care has grown in recent years, doctors have felt
like David against a medical Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Because large health plans often cover many of their potential
patients, doctors feel compelled to sign contracts with the plans
to stay in business. Often those contracts call for large discounts
on fees and other concessions from doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors hope that unions will give them the clout to resist the
repeated cuts in reimbursement that some health plans are
demanding. And they foresee improvements in patient care if unions
can give them more authority over medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the downside of unionizing for patients is more
hypothetical than real.
</P>
<P>
   Federal employees aren't allowed to strike, so VA hospitals
aren't threatened with closure.
</P>
<P>
   And doctors in private practice haven't proven they have the
clout to seriously take on managed-care plans. Antitrust laws
forbid them from collective bargaining with health plans. Unions
expect legislation to be introduced in Congress next year to
eliminate that prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care industry doesn't appear threatened. As long as
physicians stay within existing antitrust laws, it's ready to work
with unions, the American Association of Health Plans says.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing at the Kansas City VA hospital started about 18
months ago when professional workers in Kansas City approached
union officials at the VA Medical Center in Leavenworth, Kan.,
which already has a professional union.
</P>
<P>
   The VA system has been undergoing several years of
reorganization that has consolidated the services of hospitals in
Kansas and Missouri. The result has been a more cost-efficient and
``patient-centered'' form of care modeled after health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Although patients appear pleased with the results,
administrators say, many professionals at the hospital have worried
about their job security.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical professionals complained that they no longer had
the ear of the administration. That's because the number of medical
people in management was reduced as the hospital streamlined its
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us feel we're being reorganized into oblivion,'' said
Al Schmidt, past national president of the National Federation of
Federal Employees. ``Years ago, professional staff was looked at as
part of management, but now management looks at professional staff
as a cost factor.''

EXPLETIVES GOT WORKER DELETED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Charles Corry admits he swears like the Marine he used
to be. He contends that criticizing him for swearing is ``morally
comparable to criticizing a Catholic for going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   But criticize him his co-workers did. One associate was
particularly upset when Corry repeatedly used ``God'' and ``Jesus
Christ'' as expletives.
</P>
<P>
   Corry's supervisors were notified. Meetings were held. Within
weeks, Corry was dismissed from his computer job.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, a federal trial is under way this week to decide
whether Corry, who says he is a Buddhist, was a victim of religious
discrimination, as he contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mountain News quoted Corry as saying that being fired
``touched one of my deepest fears...people being terminated on the
basis of their religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Corry contends that a supervisor told him to study and follow
the Ten Commandments. Attorneys for the supervisor's company,
Analysts International Corp., say the supervisor merely explained
to Corry that his co-worker believed in the Ten Commandments'
prohibition against taking the Lord's name in vain.
</P>
<P>
   However Corry's lawsuit turns out, its existence shows what
happens when co-workers have different beliefs and different
standards about what constitutes acceptable workplace language.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day in the American workplace, words that some
workers consider profane will flow from co-workers' mouths.
Sometimes the words have religious ties. Sometimes they're sexual
in nature. Sometimes they're scatological or just plain gross.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their nature, words that are offensive to others' ears
put great strain on workplace relationships. I know co-workers who
visibly cringe, like Corry's co-worker, when fellow workers pepper
casual discussion with profanity. Others are less bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that foul language slips past many co-workers with
nary a raised eyebrow. That doesn't mean it's right or acceptable.
It means cussing is a part of the American vernacular that is rife
in many workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are truly offended, there are two options:
Complain directly to the swearer or complain to management. The
latter course is what eventually brought Corry's case to court.
</P>
<P>
   Corry says he never intended to offend anyone. He says he
offered to move his desk away from the offended co-worker. But
after his firing, he wouldn't back down on the religious freedom
issue. No supervisor, no workplace, he contends, should impose one
religion's doctrine as a workplace guideline.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Corry's former employer say Corry's cries for
religious freedom are poppycock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking someone to watch his language, to act professionally,
to avoid offending others, is not a form of religious
discrimination,'' the employer's attorney said at the trial's
outset.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what the jury _ which includes a
Baptist minister _ decides. Meanwhile, it occurs to me that freedom
to (ital)hear(end ital) may be as important as any other freedom.

OPTIMISM FACES A LONG, COLD NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The icy fist of winter has closed around the Arctic
regions of Russia, whose 8 million inhabitants now face an ordeal
of privation and suffering like none they have known since the last
great war.
</P>
<P>
   The general outlines of the dreadful situation are contained in
a sheaf of stories clipped from newspapers and magazines, or
received in the mail from friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, datelined more than a month ago, told of a
freighter racing the season along the Arctic coast, carrying half
the year's food supply for a large area of Siberia. The ship was
ordered to turn back because the freight bill couldn't be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the order was rescinded, and the ship was allowed to
unload at the port of Tiksi. The cargo was to have remained under
seal there, but local officials ordered the goods loaded on barges
for transport up the Lena River to needy villages.
</P>
<P>
   I have been in that part of the world, not this deep into
autumn, but as the season turned. Tiksi is a raw outpost of
civilization, clinging to the upper rim of the Asian continent.
There's nothing to the north but the polar sea and the cap of
Arctic ice.
</P>
<P>
   And I know the Lena. An expedition of us Americans and four
Russian companions traveled the river's whole 2,700-mile length,
from the mountains above Lake Baikal to Tiksi, the year before the
Soviet empire fragmented and the economy collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   During its summer season free of ice, the Lena is a major artery
of transport and supply for a region of Siberia larger than all of
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, after the worst Russian harvest in nearly a
half-century, the shipments of food and also of diesel oil were
meager _ by some accounts less than half the amounts needed for the
long winter.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian icebreaker fleet immobilized by lack of fuel,
the shipping lanes along the Arctic coast are freezing shut. And,
in any case, the north-flowing rivers are icebound now.
</P>
<P>
   So the normal avenues of supply have closed. Food reserves are
exhausted. Power in some regions is rationed to only a few hours a
day. With rivers frozen, the only means of relief will be by air.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television has described the situation in the most
isolated and desperate areas as catastrophic, and there is talk of
the possible need to evacuate many thousands of the
worst-threatened villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be freezing, and they are already. People will go
hungry _ it's a fact,'' one newspaper account quoted a government
official as saying. And that was weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Always, as the long night of the far northern winter commences,
my thoughts are with our Siberian friends, who must attempt somehow
to make lives for themselves and their families in such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They were young when we negotiated the Lena together. They were
strong then, and filled with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are hard, and will get harder,'' one of them said as the
old, despised system unraveled and the economy began falling apart.
``But it's the price we pay to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they're well on in middle-age. Their strength must be less.
The price of freedom, in terms of hardship, has increased by
multiples.
</P>
<P>
   About the durability of their optimism I cannot know.
</P>
<P>
   For years, one of them corresponded with fair regularity,
telling of provision he was making for himself, his wife and two
sons, against that time when the situation could become even worse.
</P>
<P>
   But some months ago his letters stopped. I think it must mean
the worst is upon them now.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Earlier this year, cartoonist Brian Basset
changed the name of his daily comic strip from ``Adam'' to
``Adam &LR; home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee. What trends could have been his motivation?
</P>
<P>
   Basset started drawing ``Adam'' in 1984. At the outset, there
was a ``Mr. Mom'' flavor to the strip, which chronicled the woes
and joys of a stay-at-home dad.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Basset _ who admits to being a lot like his comic
character, Adam Newman _ decided to emphasize the evolution of Adam
into an everyman for the explosion of home-office workers and
Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Adam still deals with his children while his wife, Laura, is off
at work. Ditto the Basset family, where his wife, Linda, works
outside their Issaquah, Wash., home and Basset sometimes has more
face time with his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``sometimes'' because Basset has found what many
home-based workers know: Creativity often flows from interaction
with others. That, and the infusion of caffeine _ another recurring
theme in the strip.
</P>
<P>
   Basset's strip often shows Adam in a neighborhood coffeehouse
these days. There, surrounded by other laptop-toting professionals,
``home workers'' do their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Basset made a publicity tour through Kansas City recently with a
publicist from Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes his
strip to more than 200 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Very rarely, he said in an interview, he gets a letter or e-mail
blaming him for the breakdown of traditional family values.
Usually, though, fans write that Adam reflects the push-pull
between work and home lives they feel.
</P>
<P>
   Such themes are universal, Basset said. His ideas come from his
experiences and any he can borrow from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife thinks I ask how her day went out of compassion,''
Basset joked. ``But I'm just fishing for ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Because working at home can be isolating, he relishes his daily
escapes to a local coffeehouse. In the Pacific Northwest _ the
original Starbucks land _ Basset finds plenty of compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Starbucks executives have said they pointedly set out
to create that kind of ``third space'' _ a place that's not home
and not office but a place where people congregate _ in their
coffeeshops.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his coffeehouse forays, Basset said, he's still the
parent who's most available to run car pools and midday errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's also what makes working at home a lot harder than
what most people think,'' he added. ``You need tremendous
self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the very flexibility that says you don't have to be
dressed up for a 9 a.m. meeting also says you can work at 3 a.m. if
you need to. That's the problem when your work is always there and
you can't leave it at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Basset says he fights two other home-worker challenges: getting
enough exercise and keeping track of what day it is.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donna Withers' father has a hard time making ends
meet on his $350 a month Social Security check.
</P>
<P>
   So the 26-year-old waitress was not thrilled to learn that when
she reaches retirement age Social Security is predicted to be in
poor financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to think what they expect us to live on then,'' said
Withers, who is now on maternity leave and lives in Clute, Texas,
in Brazoria County south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But does she believe lawmakers in the nation's capital will fix
the problem soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more worried about who is sleeping with whom,'' she
said, referring to the White House sex and lies scandal that has
preoccupied lawmakers and the media for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, President Clinton will try to convince
Americans such as Withers that he and members of Congress are
willing to tackle the technically and politically daunting task of
reforming the system conceived during the Great Depression and
which now covers 43.6 million people, most of them elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The president will host a two-day summit to discuss various
options to shore up a program that is predicted to be in trouble in
the next century when the aging baby boom generation will have
drained the reserves built up over the years.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done, Social Security officials have said, the
system will be able to pay out only three-quarters of current
benefits beginning in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties along with representatives from
interest groups and academics will debate a menu of possible
solutions including the most radical one _ letting people take some
or all of their Social Security contributions and invest them in
the private markets. Groups at sites in all 50 states, including
Houston, will be able to watch the panel discussions through
satellite hookup.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who first raised the issue of preserving Social
Security in his State of the Union address in January, has yet to
endorse a specific plan. The president has said he is opposed to
raising taxes and is open to the suggestion of private investment.
He also has said that he hopes to devise a solution in the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the prospect that lawmakers will expend the
political capital and make the controversial changes necessary to
overhaul a popular program are remote.
</P>
<P>
   Already the president is facing pressure from unions and many in
the more liberal wing of his party who vehemently oppose
privatization of Social Security, claiming it will put low income
and vulnerable people at the mercy of an unpredictable stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans also are wary of getting too far out front on
an issue that has long been associated with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A leading House Republican, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the president must go
first in offering a detailed plan if he wants anything to get done
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a quarterback and not a punter,'' said Archer, whose
committee must consider any Social Security legislation. Like the
president, Archer has not proposed a specific plan but rather
backed broad principles that include no tax increases, fairness for
future and current retirees and new options for younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the skeptics, there are those who believe there is a
greater chance now than in the past that the program can be
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   They say both the scandal ridden president and Republican
controlled Congress in pursuit of him may be looking for an
accomplishment that will improve their image with voters fed up
with Washington politics.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a budget surplus and a sound economy means there is more
money to fix the system.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show an increasing number of voters, particularly younger
people, willing to accept changes in the system that has long been
considered sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have some stars that are aligned in the right
direction,'' said Evelyn Morton, the legislative director of the
AARP, the nation's largest senior citizens advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   While AARP is one of the most influential lobbying groups in
Washington, it has not yet endorsed or opposed any of the options
to shore up the program.
</P>
<P>
   Those alternatives include the methods that have historically
been employed to keep the system solvent, such as raising the
payroll taxes, increasing the age of eligibility or reducing
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Currently workers and employers each contribute 6.2 percent of
an employee's wages up to $68,400 of income. The retirement age for
full benefits is 65 but is slated to gradually rise to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional options include reducing cost of living
increases and enlarging the pool of contributors to the system by
forcing state and local government employees, who now have their
own retirement programs, to join Social Security. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers are tiring of what they believe are the
short-term fixes that do not address the long-term demographics _
far fewer workers supporting a bulging generation of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who promises you can fix it with a nip and tuck here is
misleading the public,'' said Will Marshall, the president of the
Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic group that has
joined with others in embracing more dramatic solutions that
involve to varying degrees using the private market to increase the
rate of return on taxpayer investment.
</P>
<P>
   One option considered by those who do not want to change the
basic structure of Social Security but would like to see its
reserves stretched further, is to have the federal government
invest at least part of that money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has amassed $757 billion in reserves which are
invested in low-interest-bearing government securities.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics say that such an option would give government
officials far too much power to influence corporate decisions since
Social Security would own huge blocks of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they fear that government officials could use the
stock ownership to push social positions. They cite public employee
pension funds that have tried to punish certain companies for their
products, such as tobacco, or their policies, such as benefits for
partners of gay employees.
</P>
<P>
   Archer dismissed such a proposal is a ``non-starter'' because it
means ``the federal government would own control of most of the
major corporations in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most intriguing and controversial proposals would
allow individuals to divert some of the taxes they now pay into
Social Security and invest them in stocks and bonds, much as many
workers do now with 401K plans, where employees and employers
contribute to market-invested tax-free retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has been embraced by a broad spectrum of
lawmakers, ranging from conservatives such as Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, to moderate Democrats including Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that such an approach would give younger people, in
particular, the opportunity to get far better return on their
retirement contributions while making it unnecessary to raise taxes
or cut benefits in the future. They add that while the stock market
has its ups and downs, over time it still earns a higher rate of
return than Social Security, where many workers will barely get
back what they put in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plans would maintain a certain degree of government
involvement, allowing current retirees to remain in Social Security
and guaranteeing everyone else minimum retirement benefits even if
their investments don't do well.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that the conversion to private accounts ``won't make
people instant millionaires'' but it will eventually ``make
everybody better off than they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that while the concept of allowing people to
invest their Social Security money in the stock market may have
superficial appeal, it is a risky proposition that will not only be
a nightmare to administer but will create vast income inequities.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that people who have the misfortune of retiring
when the stock market is in a slump will suffer with much smaller
retirement income than those who hit old age during a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   They note that such an investment system will not help the
disabled and children and widows of deceased workers who also
depend on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security provides vital support for vulnerable
groups,'' said Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, who opposes private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines over privatization became increasingly clear
last week when the National Federation of Independent Businesses
came out in favor of personal accounts one day and a coalition of
labor, women and minority groups met the next day to rail against
such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson warned that politicians,
Democrat or Republican, who jumped on the privatization bandwagon
would suffer at the polls and join departing House Speaker Newt
Gingrich ``on the midnight train to Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Convincing the public to accept private accounts in a year when
many have nervously watched the stock market behave like a yo-yo
could be a tough task.
</P>
<P>
   Even Withers, the waitress from Clute who wants lawmakers to
deal with Social Security, expressed doubts that most people have
the sophistication to successfully play the stock market with their
retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, ``In my high school class I was the only who passed
the section on the stock market.'' &QL;

PACIFIC BELL SEEKS HIGHER CHARGES FOR DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Several consumer and interest groups have
sternly criticized Pacific Bell's proposal to double what it
charges for 411 directory assistance calls.
</P>
<P>
   In a public hearing on the matter Thursday, opponents of the
rate increase said Pacific Bell shouldn't be allowed to raise 411
charges from 25 cents to 50 cents per call.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the groups told the state Public Utilities
Commission that Pacific Bell shouldn't be allowed to lock in a
ceiling price of $1.10 per 411 call. That would be the maximum
amount the telephone company could charge in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a rate increase of this magnitude,'' said
Sylvia Siegel, director of Consumers Cable Cop, a watchdog group in
Mill Valley. ``It's the height of chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Berzok, who represented the San Francisco chapter of the
American Association of Retired Persons, also criticized the
proposed rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amounts to nothing more than unjustifiable price
gouging,'' he said. ``There are no options for consumers to get
(411) service elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cain, a Pacific Bell operator services director, said
competition did exist because companies like AT&AMP;T and MCI also
offered 411 service and charged much higher prices to customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly Boyd, an attorney in the PUC's Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, said the vast majority of residential customers got 411
service from Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Cain said Pacific Bell has been subsidizing the cost to provide
411 service for years. However, Cain wouldn't disclose the actual
cost of the service, saying the figures are proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stein, an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a San
Francisco-based watchdog group, said he had seen Pacific Bell's 411
service cost figures and said ``no price increase is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein said Pacific Bell had originally wanted to raise rates to
33 cents per call. As a result, he said, ``50 cents (per call) is
not reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition to the proposed rate increase, some who
attended the hearing spoke in favor of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pac Bell is losing money on every call,'' said Margie Marks,
president of Local 9410 of the Communications Workers of America,
which has 200 Pacific Bell directory assistance operators as
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pac Bell has made a commitment to having live operators to
handle calls,'' Marks said. ``They're making a commitment to
keeping jobs here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's proposal _ which was filed with the PUC in May _
states that the number of free 411 calls for residential customers
would drop from five to three calls per month. This means that
Pacific Bell, which is owned by SBC Communications Inc. of San
Antonio, would charge customers 50 cents per call after the first
three.
</P>
<P>
   A PUC vote on the proposal is expected next year.

 &HT;    FAULTY TESTS PROMPT NATIONWIDE FEDERAL REVIEW OF POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS WASTE SITES
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for release Sunday, Dec. 6
 &HT;    By JANET JACOBS and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The federal government is re-examining the danger
posed by hundreds of hazardous waste sites nationwide after the
discovery that two Texas labs allegedly provided thousands of
incorrect test results over a six year period.
</P>
<P>
   The labs tested for cancer-causing chemicals in the soil, water,
air and tissue. Such tests are routinely used by government and
industry to determine if toxic wastes are, for example, leaking
into drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental officials said they have opened a criminal
investigation into operations at the two labs, which were owned by
Intertek Testing Services, a British company that specializes in
various kinds of testing. Intertek discovered the faulty tests a
year ago. Both labs are no longer in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials would not name specific sites involved in the
investigation. But Mary Adler, head of criminal enforcement for the
Environmental Protection Agency, said that the government has not
yet found any instances where the public was placed in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, an attorney for Intertek, also said that his
company's review has not turned up a single case where the faulty
test data resulted in any danger to public health. However, Kelly
acknowledged that the company has reviewed data from only about 25
percent of the affected sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite company and government assurances, the faulty test data
already has become an issue in at least one lawsuit involving the
defunct Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Texas. Because
it is considered among the most dangerous toxic waste sites in the
country, EPA says part of the cleanup costs will come from its
so-called Superfund.
</P>
<P>
   A group of people near the abandoned plant has sued the federal
government and numerous contractors in federal court in Marshall,
Texas, asserting that leaking toxic chemicals from the Longhorn
facility made them ill and killed 27 people over the last ten
years. A lawyer for the group alleged that a number of these people
died of cancer or lupus, a disease that attacks the kidneys and
liver.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says residents were repeatedly told by state and
federal officials that contamination from the plant could not have
caused these injuries. However, lawyers filing the suit argue that
because of the unreliable testing, the government doesn't know how
bad the contamination is.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly denied in an interview Thursday that the Karnack case
represented an instance where Intertek's test data missed a major
environmental threat. He said that his company's tests there, which
were performed for the Army Corps of
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, proved to be accurate and showed ``extremely high
levels of pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   This was disputed by an Army spokesperson who said tests done by
Intertek and other companies have repeatedly shown only limited
pockets of high pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Intertek and government officials face a substantial challenge
as they try to reconstruct how decisions were made, which tests
were relied upon and what risks were run in hundreds of complex
pollution cases dating back to the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of tests is in the thousands,'' said Dave Barry,
spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas. ``It
was pointed out that the (questionable test data) goes back to
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said his company traced its current troubles back to one
employee who allegedly ``cut corners'' to speed up the time it took
to complete various tests.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the employee began working at the lab in the early
90's, the environmental testing service consisted of four
laboratories run by a company called Inchcape. When Intertek
purchased the Inchcape labs in December 1996, Kelly said his
company had no idea tests were not being properly performed. In
fact, Kelly said the labs were certified by several professional
organizations, as well as by some states, to do environmental
testing and were routinely audited.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the faulty testing procedures were discovered in
December 1997 by new managers from Intertek. Kelly said that
Intertek immediately notified its clients and the EPA. While the
lab never did work for EPA itself, whoever was responsible for the
cleanup would submit the lab's test results to the EPA to be used
in deciding how to deal with toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
   While Kelly said the ``shortcuts'' caused only minor variations
in the test results, Barry said the faulty data may have caused the
government to do too little or too much pollution cleanup at some
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to talk about exactly how serious the
situation might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A criminal investigation is ongoing,'' Adler said. ``The
agency would not at this point want to comment on the extent of the
data integrity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the agency is doing right now is conducting a systematic
review of its case files and action files to try to identify where
we might have relied on its (Intertek's) data and then make an
assessment of how that data
</P>
<P>
   was used.''

RENO NEARS DECISION ON ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR CLINTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno faces a Monday deadline
to decide whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate
possible campaign law violations by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the last of pending Justice Department
investigations that have confronted Reno with the question of
whether she should seek an independent counsel to investigate the
president or other top administration officials. She has done so in
10 previous cases.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Reno must determine if there is evidence that
Clinton knowingly violated election laws when he directed a
multi-million dollar advertising campaign by the Democratic
National Committee that might have improperly benefited the
Clinton-Gore presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also could delay her decision by asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals for more time to study the question, though she has been
mulling it for two years. Late last month, Reno came right up to
the deadline in another case and ended up asking for more time to
study it. That case involved allegations that Harold Ickes, a
former top Clinton aide, lied to federal investigators about his
efforts on behalf of the teamsters to get top administration
officials to intervene for the union in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the case with the Monday deadline, Reno is investigating
whether Clinton and top White House advisers illegally controlled a
DNC television advertising blitz that began in the fall of 1995.
Those ads touted Clinton's stand on the budget showdown with
congressional Republicans that year.
</P>
<P>
   She must determine if the DNC commercials were in reality
re-election ads for the president's campaign, masquerading as
issue-advocacy spots that political parties can legitimately
produce. Because the ads were placed by the DNC, they could be
largely paid for with so-called ``soft-money'' _ big, unregulated
contributions from individuals and corporate and union treasury
funds that couldn't be contributed legally to an individual
candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue boils down to trying to keep big donors from
influencing candidates,'' said Viet Dinh, an expert on campaign
finance law at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be helped by a report issued last week by the
Federal Election Commission staff that investigated the issue of
campaign advertising for both the Clinton campaign and Republican
challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Although FEC staff auditors concluded that both Clinton and Dole
improperly coordinated with the DNC and the Republican National
Committee on nationwide television advertising blitzes during the
campaign, the auditors stopped short of alleging criminal
activities on either candidate's part.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors recommended that Clinton and Dole pay fines of $7
million and $17.7 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Since Reno often looks to the FEC for guidance on how to
interpret election laws, some legal specialists say the auditors'
report should help Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reno may find a lot of comfort in the fact that the FEC staff
isn't alleging criminal conduct and use that to dismiss the whole
matter,'' said former independent counsel Joseph E. diGenova.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the attorney general also may put off her decision
on an independent counsel until the FEC's full commission makes a
final ruling on whether to accept, reject or modify the staff
audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the full commission is something of the final word on
all of this, it wouldn't be that surprising if she just waited for
its decision on the staff report,'' diGenova said.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former FEC commissioner, agreed, saying in an
interview that the laws governing campaign advertising are often
``vague'' and that Reno may be waiting for more clarification from
the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the need for clarification was obvious at a Thursday
meeting of the full commission to discuss the staff report on the
Clinton and Dole campaigns. Several of six commissioners admitted
that even they could not fully understand the statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Commission Chairman Scott E. Thomas called the laws
governing campaign advertisements ``less than clear.'' He said
previous FEC rulings had allowed advertisements that told viewers
not to vote for a certain candidate even though the commercials
were supposed to promote only generic party themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how you say that doesn't help that candidate's opponent
is something I don't fully understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David M. Mason who called the statutes ``fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Reno has refused to comment on either the FEC
staff audit or the views of the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Reno decided against appointing an independent
counsel to investigate whether Vice President Gore lied to Justice
Department officials during an investigation last year of
fund-raising phone calls he placed from his White House office
during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision drew fire from Republicans who said there was
abundant evidence to justify the appointment of a special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that Reno's hand-picked campaign-finance
prosecutor, Charles La Bella, who left the job last July,
recommended appointing an independent counsel to look into possible
campaign law violations by Clinton. In addition, they noted that
FBI Director Louis Freeh also recommended a special prosecutor to
investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said no evidence of impeachable offenses
against the president were found in a review of secret memorandums
on campaign fund-raising written by La Bella and Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Dinh said the committee's abandonment of the campaign finance
issue relieves some of the pressure on Reno to appoint an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans lose their ability to point to the
recommendations of Freeh and La Bella and say, `You must be
covering up something,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinh added: ``Clinton could very well walk away without a
scratch _ again.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: That giant sucking sound
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The big news in my little hometown is that the
interstate highway system has finally found its way here, some 40
or 50 years after cementing together most everywhere else in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in favor of the interstate say it's for the common good of
the common man. Of course, folks in favor of the Mobil-Exxon merger
are likely to say much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin's not exactly isolated, off here in the pineywoods of
Deep East Texas. Granted, the nearest existing interstates are 100
miles in most any direction. Never mind that the airlines won't fly
here.
</P>
<P>
   If you're coming to Lufkin from afar, best bet is to fly to
Houston or Shreveport and then rent a car for the two-hour drive.
It's not that convenient for everybody. But in the past it's helped
to deter big-city corporate-baggers from giving us more attention
than we would appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   We've got highways, sure enough. Paved, too. Not counting the
pot holes, of course. I doubt if anybody could count the pot holes,
especially on U.S. 59 between here and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That highway has a certain Third World charm. You'd almost think
you were in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, U.S. 59 is on its way to Mexico. Thanks to NAFTA,
the traffic is something akin to wall-to-wall diesel trucks backed
up most all the way to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the purpose of the proposed interstate, dubbed I-69, a
major trade route for the NAFTA traffic that's taking our business
south.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin's leaders have been all for it. Otherwise, the world
might pass us by, without so much as honking.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the preferred route will swing east of the city,
cutting a swath through farms, ranches and rural settlements. What
used to be out in the country is now going to be under an overpass.
</P>
<P>
   I'm waiting for our first cloverleaf intersection to open up for
local traffic. That'll be something to see, especially in a town
where most drivers have yet to master the principle of four-way
stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   But I've seen it all before, to lesser degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a young boy, the highway traffic came straight
through downtown on First Street. Back then, there was a service
station on every other corner.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there's only one left along that same route.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of Timberland Drive, the four-lane bypass that
opened in 1950. The cafes and service stations followed in swift
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Funny story that most everybody has forgotten, how Timberland
Drive got its name.
</P>
<P>
   Several names of prominent leaders had been put forth for the
honor. So it was that the powers that be decided to let the people
choose, in the form of an election, as to who among the prominent
was the most favored. The choice of Timberland Drive was added to
the ballot as an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what won by a wide majority. Timberland Drive, by any
other name, was None Of The Above Drive.
</P>
<P>
   A loop followed in the 1960s and '70s, and business stretched
itself accordingly. I expect much the same when the interstate
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   I have every hope of living to see that day, assuming that
between now and then I don't get run over at one of our four-way
stops.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER 6
 &HT;    Jazzed up and crossing over
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ Seamless decorum will not be part of the program
on this evening at the Jacksonville Jazz Festival. Behind the
stage, the smell of grilled meat drifts over the dull roar of a
hundred conversations in the roped-off VIP area. Children shriek.
Partyers jostle. Beers slosh.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Krall winces. Or is she trying to summon her telepathic
powers? Leading her trio from behind a piano, she can't hear a
thing above the din. But as she gazes out at the thousands of fans
scattered across the downtown Metropolitan Park, the vocalist
suddenly smiles, nods to guitarist Russell Malone and bassist Ben
Wolfe, and they slip into a ballad that's intimate and candlelit.
</P>
<P>
   You're thinking how warm and cozy it all is. But Krall isn't
thinking that at all. ``How do you connect with somebody you can't
see because you have a light in your eyes, like you're Mildred
Pierce, like you're being interrogated?'' she asks later.
</P>
<P>
   Though she identifies with Joan Crawford's 1940s film heroine,
the 34-year-old pianist and vocalist stands accused only of growing
popularity, of crossover success that's uncommon for a jazz artist.
</P>
<P>
   Krall's most recent CD, ``Love Scenes'' (Impulse), has become
that rare mainstream jazz title to sell nearly 500,000 copies _ a
feat that has kept the singer at the top of the traditional jazz
charts for more than a year. (She's been there before: ``All for
You,'' Krall's 1996 tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio, sold more
than 200,000 copies.) She's scored a few other coups as well:
touring with Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair; gigging twice on
``Melrose Place,'' where she played as herself in the show's
fictitious bar; and backing up Celine Dion on the ``Titanic''
diva's Christmas album.
</P>
<P>
   The singer, who performs Friday and Saturday at Variety
Playhouse, is a long, long way from the Oak Room in New York's
fabled Algonquin Hotel, one of those venerable establishments,
redolent of a certain fussy prestige, where Krall made her name.
It's a name associated with the vintage aura of American popular
song as practiced by so many other names, such as Frank Sinatra and
Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday and Nat ``King'' Cole. Names
with voices that came to define a shared national experience: a
timeless time, a placeless place, at once as fixed and as fluid as
a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has this honey-laden voice with a touch of whiskey,'' says
Deb Moore, a longtime fan who also hosts the ``Midday Renaissance''
program on WCLK-FM (91.9), an Atlanta jazz station. ``She has a
wonderful way of setting a mood.'' Not one of those Killer B type
of jazz singers _ the brassy, brazen, boisterous, blazing,
bodacious kinds _ Krall prefers a light touch. When she wants to
insinuate ``I've Got You Under My Skin'' with an ounce of extra
sass, she lets the melody percolate as a wispy bossa nova. When she
wants to cry the blues, well, she cedes the urge to former Atlantan
Malone, who unleashes some startling gutbucket runs with a
knowingly arched eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that has even notched a hit single of sorts.
Krall's version of veteran hepcat Dave Frishberg's ``Peel Me a
Grape'' (which includes such inspired couplets as ``Never outthink
me/Just mink me'') has found airplay on contemporary jazz stations
where smoothies such as Kenny G are the norm. Within the rigorously
fixed constellation of jazz stardom, Krall has the buzz of a
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever anyone who would be considered a jazz musician hits
in this way, it's a little bit of a strange alchemy that we can't
figure out,'' says Larry Blumenfeld, editor in chief of Jazziz, a
national music monthly that splashed Krall across its cover last
year. ``In terms of her appearance and the way she uses jazz
tradition, she's more accessible to a broader audience than a lot
of other artists are, without necessarily dumbing things down. One
thing that really works in her favor is she's able to straddle that
fence between what a real jazz fan wants and what a popular
audience needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing after the recent Jacksonville show in her hotel's
lobby, Krall sips a glass of cabernet. She's tired. She's hungry.
She just finished a two-week swing through Europe and craves
nothing more than an honest, all-American meal: steak, on the rare
side of rare. Though she's still wearing the black Donna Karan gown
and high heels she had on onstage, Krall comes off less like a
newly anointed diva than an exceedingly well-traveled girl next
door. Her idea of a folk hero is Garrison Keillor, whose invitation
to play ``Prairie Home Companion'' ranks as a career high point.
And though she indulges her love of designer clothes, the proudest
item in the singer's closet may be an outdoorsy jacket from Roots,
the back-to-nature Canadian clothing brand.
</P>
<P>
   When someone wanders over to a nearby piano and begins to play,
Krall is quick to note that, until four years ago, she was still
commuting to Boston from New York every week to play in a hotel
lounge. Sometimes for one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, what makes you different? I have no clue,''
says Krall, who's encountered the media enough in the past year to
ably conduct a bit of a self-interview. ``Sometimes they're pushing
my buttons: Well, is it because you're a half-decent looking young
woman or is it marketing? I always find that kind of insulting,
because I put so much passion into it. I'm sure that's part of it,
but you can't see me on the radio. I tend to get a lot of flak from
that, and it irritates me.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said to me,'' she continues, inflating her tone
with mock pomp, `` `You have to go out and be grand, and you have
to be a vision, and you have to be this.' Forget it! I couldn't do
that if I tried. I'm going to go out and trip on my dress! I'd
rather be able to just be myself. I talked to Rosemary Clooney
about that. She said it's always better to tell the audience
exactly how you're feeling. The audience is like my family in the
living room. You don't have to distance yourself or put up a
mystery.''

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE: a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   That's apt advice. The singer, who was born to an extremely
musical family in the seaside town of Nanaimo, British Columbia,
was virtually weaned on her accountant father's collection of old
78s. When Krall reels off a dozen names, like a New Deal hit
parade, you realize she could moonlight as a soundtrack consultant
for Woody Allen _ or win really big at musical ``Jeopardy!''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hard-hearted Hannah' and `Ain't Misbehavin' ' were things we
sang at Christmastime,'' says Krall, who frequently flies home even
for brief visits, though she keeps an apartment in Manhattan's
Chelsea neighborhood. ``I thought everybody else's households were
like that. I used to play (piano) at the rest homes, and I thought
that all the old people, because they were old, would love Fats
Waller.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she discovered, they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one of the rare occasions when Krall misjudged her
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting part of all this is you can really tell where
the talent lies,'' says Tommy LiPuma, Krall's producer and chairman
of her parent label, GRP. The concept ``is right on the borderline
of walking into a piano bar and hearing someone sing standards. But
the difference is, it's on the other side of that fence. It's got
style and the manner _ her interpretation _ that takes it 180
degrees from being (lounge music). But you've got to be careful
because you're always right on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   LiPuma signed Krall after she had recorded her first album,
1993's ``Steppin' Out,'' for the Canadian Justin Time label,
encouraged by a video he saw of the singer alone at the piano. The
fact that she has been gigging in clubs since age 15, and had been
schooled by jazz legends Jimmy Rowles (Billie Holiday's pianist)
and bassist Ray Brown, also meant that Krall had absorbed a lot of
tradition firsthand. But it was a few months into the contract,
when Krall recorded ``And I Love (Him)'' for a Beatles tribute,
that ``suddenly I realized the full potential of what she had,'' he
says. ``She worked two or three hours trying to get the right feel,
and she dropped this performance that was amazing. It gave her a
lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As Krall's career continues its upswing _ a new album, with
arrangements by Johnny Mandel, is in the works _ that confidence
will count for a lot. Happily ensconced at a riverfront steakhouse,
the kind that serves brick-size baked potatoes ushered to the table
by courtly, bow-tied old gentlemen, Krall can bubble away with
amusing family anecdotes. Her grandparents' diner, lovingly kept
intact by new owners. Her sister Michelle, the drug enforcement
cop. Her buddy the Canadian astronaut, who carried a copy of her
album onto the Space Shuttle. How her love for Willie Nelson's
music was a major, unacknowledged influence on her last album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out to please the jazz police,'' she'll say, all too
aware that success can have its repercussions, ``nor am I out just
to win an audience. I'm just out to make the kind of record that I
would love to put on and listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who's been collaborating with Krall since they met four
years ago at the now-defunct New York after-hours hang Bradley's,
puts it even more succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about her singing,'' he says, ``is she just
sings the song.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, December 5, 1998: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After some of the highest readings ever measured in December
Friday, the Northeast will be more seasonable today as high
pressure builds eastward from central Quebec. The clockwise
circulation around the fair weather system will draw cooler air
from eastern Canada and the North Atlantic into New England. The
leading edge of this ocean cooled air will push southwestward into
the coastal Middle Atlantic States. Clouds and scattered showers
will attend a weakening disturbance at 15,000 feet crossing the
central Appalachians and this will temper the record warmth.
</P>
<P>
   A very mild air flow will continue from the Gulf of Mexico into
the Plains and Mississippi Valley. More record maximums are likely
in the Middle West and Ohio Valley, but clouds will limit the
direct heating from the sun. Fog will be dense across the lower
Mississippi Valley Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure near Lake Superior will advance warmer air into
Michigan while drawing colder air into the northern Plains.
Intermittent light snow is expected from western Minnesota into the
Dakotas and eastern Rockies. A second disturbance over western
Kansas will produce heavier snow in parts of central Colorado with
snow showers farther south.
</P>
<P>
   The interior West will be seasonably cold as clouds remain over
northern sections and sunshine returns to the Southwest. High
pressure moving through California will sponsor sunny skies and
more pleasant conditions. A robust cold front entering the
Northwest will cause a cold rain to spread down the coast with snow
developing across the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow Levels &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell at elevations as low as 1,000 feet in the Cascades of
Washington on Tuesday. Below this altitude, precipitation fell as
rain. Almost all precipitation that falls over the middle latitudes
begins as snow thousands of feet aloft. Even the splotches of rain
that will fall over the unseasonably warm Middle Atlantic states
Saturday will likely have a snowy start. The profile of temperature
below the altitude where snowflakes form determines the type of
precipitation that reaches the ground. On Tuesday, the melting
level over western Washington was estimated to lie close to 1,000
feet.

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HUGO CHAVEZ EXPECTED TO WIN
ELECTION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ He hasn't receive a single vote, but
leading Venezuelan presidential candidate Hugo Chavez has already
tested his political coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chavez's father, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, was
elected governor of western Barinas state. A 65-year-old retired
schoolteacher, the elder Chavez had never before held elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He capitalized on the Chavez phenomenon,'' said Jose
Machillanda, a retired Venezuelan army colonel who runs a research
center in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates running under Hugo Chavez's Patriotic Pole, a
coalition of 13 leftist and nationalist parties, won eight of 23
governorships and about one-third of the seats in the Venezuelan
house and senate in Nov. 8 regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although that would leave Hugo Chavez with a divided legislature
should he win Sunday's presidential election, his movement
out-polled Venezuela's traditional political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, like his son Hugo _ the second of six
sons _ describes himself as an outsider. He said his experience
includes teaching school for 40 years as well as grass-roots work
in political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea (to run for governor) came from the people, and I
accepted,'' said the elder Chavez, who wore a baseball cap
embroidered with his son's name. ``We have a realistic project to
improve education and health care and to create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Hugo de los Reyes Chavez as a regional
powerbroker could force his son to reconsider some of his proposed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez has promised to convoke a special assembly to
rewrite the Venezuelan constitution. Sweeping changes could include
everything from scrapping the congress and the courts to remaking
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez has said that the assembly would have the power to
dissolve the legislative assemblies of the states and to redefine
the roles of the governors,'' said a Caracas businessman who didn't
want his name printed.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, he said, the newly elected governors _
including Chavez's father _ ``are basically not going to be in
power very long.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that scenario, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez shook
his head, saying he trusts his son to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even being considered,'' he said. &QL;

A NEWCOMER IN THE LIBERAL ARTS: CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Wis., Ore., Texas, Md., N.H.)  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ At first glance, Bernice Jones is not your
typical college student. At 33, she is a little old, and she
arrived for her criminal-justice class at Rutgers University
straight from work at the Essex County Prosecutors Office, neatly
dressed in a navy blue suit, blue pumps and matching handbag.
</P>
<P>
   There is also what she delicately calls ``my family background
in the criminal-justice system.'' Her two brothers served time in
prison for drug convictions (one of them has since died), and the
father of her 2-year-old daughter is serving a 10- to 15-year
sentence for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But both her job and her family situation make Ms. Jones
representative of the multitude of students flocking to
criminal-justice courses, making criminal justice the
fastest-growing major in the United States, according to the
Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, a professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   From an obscure discipline scorned by most academics, with only
two small doctoral programs as recently as 1970, criminal justice
has exploded to 350,000 undergraduate majors at colleges and
universities, said Freda Adler, a professor of criminal justice at
Rutgers and a former president of the American Society of
Criminology.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the appeal of criminal justice is a result of the huge
growth in crime since the 1960s, the prison-building boom and the
fascination with criminals. These factors have combined to create a
major new job market for police officers and prison guards. For
some students, like Ms. Jones, criminal justice also offers a way
to understand the lives of those around them better.
</P>
<P>
   But at another level, the flood of new courses and students is a
reflection of the intellectual success of criminal justice. Ten to
20 years ago academic criminologists and law-enforcement
authorities thought the police could do little to fight crime, but
now many new ideas have proved successful in reducing the country's
high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   Among these seminal theories was the suggestion by James Q.
Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles and George
Kelling of Rutgers University that the police concentrate on
``fixing broken windows,'' meaning that they could avert more
serious crimes like murder by arresting people for petty crimes
like vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Herman Goldstein of the University of
Wisconsin pioneered the concept of community policing, which means
that police officers, instead of sitting in their patrol cars
waiting for a 911 call after a crime has occurred, get involved in
their communities, thereby preventing crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ideas have come directly from the police themselves.
Foremost among these is the management strategy introduced by
William Bratton when he was police commissioner of New York City in
the '90s, in which he insisted on the rapid collection of crime
statistics and then held his local police commanders responsible
for crime control in their areas. Like community policing, this got
his officers more involved in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   On a different track, Gerald Patterson, a psychologist at the
Oregon Social Learning Center in Eugene, demonstrated that early
intervention with troubled children, particularly getting their
parents to do a better job of monitoring and supervising their
behavior, could prevent delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   And John Braithwaite at the Australian National University in
Canberra has introduced a less punitive alternative to jail and
prison by bringing criminals together with their victims to mediate
a resolution, an idea being rapidly copied in cities around the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of criminal justice on campus has cut deeply into
traditional fields like sociology and psychology. And it has
emerged as a ``cash cow'' for college administrators, said Donna
Hale, a professor of criminal justice at Shippensburg University in
Pennsylvania and past president of the Academy of Criminal Justice
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   At Shippensburg, criminal justice has become the second-largest
major, after education, with 409 undergraduates in a total
enrollment of 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could easily be the largest, if the administration gave us
the resources, because there are so many students transferring here
for criminal justice and there are so many students on the waiting
list,'' Ms. Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors that set criminal justice apart from some
traditional fields is the makeup of the student body. At both
urban, inner-city schools like Rutgers, where many of the students
are black or Hispanic, and rural universities like Shippensburg,
where most of the students are white, the majority of those
majoring in criminal justice are from working-class backgrounds and
are the first members of their families to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is jobs as police officers, prison guards, probation
officers, private security company employees or FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the private prison field,'' said Michael
Bonavota, a 22-year-old senior who took Ms. Adler's class. ``It's a
growth field with good job opportunities. As long as there are
criminals, there will be prisons and jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hale and other specialists in criminal justice are quick to
admit that their field has also benefited from movies, television
and widely covered trials like that of O.J. Simpson. ``The largest
single impact on criminal-justice enrollment in the past 10 years
was ``Silence of the Lambs,''' said Timothy Flanagan, dean of the
College of Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Thaxton, a student who was also in Ms. Adler's
criminal-justice class at Rutgers, is an administrator for an
investment bank by day but wants to become a profiler for the FBI.
Her inspiration comes from watching the NBC show ``Profiler,''
which is about a beautiful, blond FBI agent who solves gruesome
murders through psychological analysis of demented killers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm teaching,'' Ms. Hale recounted, ``I ask students why
they take the class and what they want to be. It used to be they
wanted to be police officers or state troopers. Now they all want
to be FBI profilers. They see it on TV; it's very glamorized.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Criminal justice as a subject dates back to the 1890s when the
University of Chicago's famous School of Sociology began studying
deviance in society. But it remained the poor stepchild of
criminology until the late 1960s when President Lyndon B. Johnson's
Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice recommended that
police officers be college graduates to cope with the explosion of
violent crime in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, as a result of the commission's findings, Congress
created the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which spent
$7 billion, much of it going to new departments of criminal justice
at colleges and universities to improve education for the police,
Ms. Adler recalled. As part of this surge, Ms. Adler helped create
a School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   While the border between criminology and criminal justice is
sometimes hard to define, Lawrence Sherman, chairman of the
Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of
Maryland, describes criminal justice as ``applied criminology, that
portion of criminology that specializes in studying the police, the
courts and prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader, older field of criminology is more focused on the
study of what causes crime and criminal behavior, issues like
poverty, the family, neighborhoods, gangs and, increasingly,
biology.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal justice is still looked down on by some academicians
and is still not taught at some prestigious schools like those in
the Ivy League. But Sherman says it has ``really become a liberal
art,'' explaining that ``it combines sociology, psychology,
history, economics, politics and statistics'' and uses the
scientific method.
</P>
<P>
   With all the interest in crime, criminal-justice studies have
taken on a gold-rush feel. At Franklin Pierce College in New
Hampshire, the administration long lobbied the faculty to create a
criminal-justice major because it was one of the most frequently
requested majors at college job fairs and looked like a way to
attract applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration presented a message that we had to respond
to the market demand and offer a criminal-justice major,'' wrote
Forbes Farmer, a professor at Franklin Pierce, in a bulletin for
the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. ``Like other small
liberal arts colleges, the administration was promoting strategies
to survive the enrollment and financial crunch of the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the faculty finally and reluctantly approved, Farmer
said, a decision he said was greeted ecstatically by school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   At Rutgers, Kimberly Robinson, a sophomore from Newark, is
thinking about majoring in criminal justice. A major reason, she
said, is that she ``grew up around crime.'' Her brother is in
prison, her three uncles are each serving life sentences and her
father has been incarcerated four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a personal level, I felt I just didn't understand the
criminal-justice system,'' Ms. Robinson said. But now, she added,
``I'm so interested in criminal justice, it's the only class where
I stay awake.''

WEB WILL WEIGH IN FOR 2000 ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So how much did the Internet affect last month's elections?
Some, but nowhere near as much as the PC webheads say it will alter
the voting in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible but not-yet-invincible PC network that eliminates
geography in politics, as in everything else, helped re-elect a US
senator by a handful of votes, enabled a wrestler sans college
degree to become governor by running under the old media's radar
screen, and sparked a grass-roots rebellion that dampened the
impeachment campaign when Congress saw the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet does not yet pack the political wallop of
television. And as older heads recall, radio did not kill off
newspapers, TV didn't kill radio, and the Internet, while an
impressivly dynamic new collection of mediums, will probably not
obliterate the old mediums, but will instead layer over them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone in the room at Harvard Thursday, where the
Kennedy School of Government convened its third Politics on the Net
conference, seemed convinced that the Internet will change
campaigning, eventually move votes by the ton, and therefore alter
the way politics controls our governance.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Senator Harry Reid's eyelash-wide victory (by 400-odd
votes) came after about 10,000 hits on his Web site. Jesse
Ventura's followers tracked his campaign for governor in Minnesota
closely on the Net. One of the fastest ramp-ups in Net history (if
history can refer to a phenomenon that is barely five years old) is
credited to an outfit titled MoveOn.org, which ignited a virtual
prairie fire of middle-of-the-road discontent over the Republicans'
impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the simple premise of urging Congress to censure President
Clinton and then get back to the nation's real business,
MoveOn.org's version of an electronic chain-letter went from a
handful of e-mailers the first day to 3,000 the next to 10,000-plus
the day after, mushrooming rapidly to a 300,000 strong virtual
movement organized in 200-plus congressional districts inside of a
week, something never done before.
</P>
<P>
   There's new lingo to go along with this: ``ad-hocracies,'' for
the spontaneous coalitions erected over the Web; ``cheap
eyeballs,'' for the masses it's possible to spin with ``banner
ads,'' the strips of overlines that net-users click on. Television
is still the medium that is ``mass-iest,'' i.e., corrals the most
humans paying attention at any given time. The Web people still
have to figure out how to make a splash, without being disdained
for spin, or as spam.
</P>
<P>
   If you invest campaign cash unwisely in the Net world, you may
become part of the bleeding edge, instead of the leading edge.
Democratic consultant Andy Brack of South Carolina described the
difficulties in organizing ``interactive mouse potatoes,'' and
displayed a business-card sized, $2 CD-ROM that can put a
campaign's whole story before a contributor or volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of Internet political sites this year, a few
of them state-of-the-art creations with all the bells and whistles,
most just electronic bulletin boards featuring mundane candidate or
cause ``brochure-ware.'' Among the most cited fancy sites were
those of Jeb Bush, elected governor in Florida, and Roy Barnes,
elected governor in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Barnes, Web master for his father's winning campaign,
used the Net to help a staff of just six full-timers win the
primary, and there were only 20 full-timers to win a $10.5 million
general election campaign. He lined up volunteers, delivered press
releases, high-resolution campaign photos, and video and audio
soundbites to small papers and rural radio stations across Georgia
_ all via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley Prof. Marion Just said her work for the Markle
Foundation's voter education experiment, called Web White and Blue,
turned up voters who liked access to specific, targetted and local
political information. Still, some users complained that
``basically a computer is more work than reading a newspaper . . .
you gotta click . . . television is more relaxing . . . using a
computer is just less convenient'' than absorbing political dope
from newspaper or tube.
</P>
<P>
   But as a way of quickly and cheaply recruiting crowds,
volunteers, and attention from smaller newspapers, distant
broadcast outlets and sometimes even your competitors spying on
your schedule or speech texts, the web is the way.
</P>
<P>
   The model is still that of the carnival barker: you have to get
the customers inside your tent before you can sell them the show.
Said one private-sector marketing consultant: ``The political
people are about a year-and-a-half behind the private sector.
Campaign consultants still talk about building their web sites. he
private sector has learned from e-commerce that you have to get
people to your site.''
</P>
<P>
   To Republican consultant Robert Arena Jr., ``the critical mass
is not there yet.'' Despite promise for organizing volunteers and
harvesting credit-card contributions over secure computer-moden
hookups, the Internet is still no match for television _ network,
local, cable _ when it comes to moving votes en masse. If you build
it, you have to advertise it, said one panelist.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the new political machine of the future will be the
personal computer,'' claimed Harvard Prof. David King. Kennedy
School Dean Joe Nye opened the show asking: ``Are we with the
Internet about where we were with television in 1952?'' and ``Will
it transform the political process?'' The emerging consensus seems
to be yes, and probably yes, respectively. But to close the
conference Nye quoted an aphorism: ``When information is free, the
scarce commodity becomes attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce crowd will show the way, one listener said.
``'The political sites are like storefronts, little campaign
headquarters, hoping people will show up. They are not yet
marketing or advertising on line, the way cutting-edge private
sector firms are doing. But when they do that, they will move large
numbers of voters.''

THE GIFT OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   However analytic they may be, most business people enjoy knowing
about the history of the markets in which they make their livings.
It is no accident; they know, as the poet wrote, that ``Yesterday
this day's madness did prepare. Hope, passion, anger and despair.''
So business folk dote on stories, especially stories that point the
way to possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This year has seen the publication of a number of very good
business history books. Some of them especially suitable for
holiday giving because of the compass of their aspirations. They
are software for the mind that, once installed, should last a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and
Some So Poor'' by David Landes (W.W. Norton, $30). This is the the
distillation of the famous Harvard course that Landes has been
teaching for 20 years, nicknamed by students ``the West and the
rest.'' The professor relates the economic history of the world
since 1000 A.D. in 29 chapters that are shrewd, acerbic, and
unfailingly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Molecular Biology'' by Michel Morange (Harvard
University Press, $39.95). The foundations for today's medical and
biotechnology boom were laid in the 1950s, when Harvard, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago,
and a handful of California universities hired the young scientists
who had solved the mystery of the gene. This elegant telling of the
story, translated from the French, ranges from the early influence
of the Rockefeller Foundation to Kary Mullis's 1983 discovery of
the reaction that permits DNA to be amplified practically without
limit. Long on science, but short on color.
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Modern Computing'' by Paul E. Ceruzzi (MIT Press,
$35). Ceruzzi is curator of the Department of Space History at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and he has a good eye for
history's shapes. This book is intended more for nostalgia buffs
than for Net-heads: thereare plenty of pictures of perforated tape
and old machines. But, especially combined with, say, the next
book, it gives a vivid picture of how unforseeable are
technologies' twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rescuing Prometheus'' by Thomas P. Hughes (Pantheon Books,
$28.50). The subtitle tells it all: this is ``the story of the
mammoth projects _ SAGE, ICBM, ARPANET/Internet and Boston's
Central Artery Project _ that created new styles of management, new
forms of organization and a new vision of technology.'' Hughes is
convincing in his argument that the Cold War had a profound effect
through technology on social organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paths of Innovation: Technological Change in 20th Century
America'' by David C. Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg (Cambridge
University Press, $27.95). Rosenberg and Mowery are among the
nation's premier historians of technical change. They relate the
sagas of four technologies _ the internal combustion engine, the
chemical industry, electric power, and the electronics revolution
that followed the invention of the transistor in 1947 _ and look
for patterns that repeat among the details that do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Economic Theory: Classic Contributions
1720-1980'' by Jurg Niehans (Johns Hopkins University Press,
$25.95). It is eight years old now, but this history by a retired
theorist of thought is still the best guide there is to how
economics came to be the way it is today. Fifty profiles of the
greats, from Smith and Ricard to Samuelson and Friedman, compolete
with textbook-grade exposition of their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' (Random House,
$30). Author Ron Chernow has a knack for finding new relevance in
old lives. This utterly absorbing biography of the man who created
Stantard Oil paints the 19th century brilliantly and at the same
time illuminates the 21st _ in which Rockefeller's oil companies
are being re-united, and parallels of Rockfeller to Microsoft's
Bill Gates are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle: The True Story Behind
Monopoly'' ($17) by Ralph Anspach. Anspach is the entrepreneur who
marketed a send-up of Parker Brothers Monopoly in the early 1970s
and then spent the next 25 years fighting the company in the
courts. Here he relates the story of how he discovered that Parker
Brothers stole the game itself, fair and square, from groups of
Quakers around the country who had devised it to illustrate the
principles of single-taxer Henry George. It can be ordered on the
Internet from www.antimonopoly.com
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions''
by John. S. Hammond, Ralph L. Keeney, and Howard Raiffa (Harvard
Business School Press, $22.50). There are all kinds of practical
roadmaps here for decision-making: how to think of problem-choice,
objectives, alternatives, consequences, tradeoffs, uncertainty,
risk tolerance, linked decisions, and pysychological traps. This is
deeply grounded advice from one of the world's great decision
theorists, Raiffa.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Competition'' by Michael Porter ($35.95, Harvard Business
School Press). What is so interesting about this brainy expositor
of the economics of growth? Instead of sprining for the handsome
new three-volume set ``strategy'' series, you could settle for this
well chosen but overpriced selection of his shorter pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth'' by Al Ehrbar (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, $29.95). ``Economic value added'' is the latest
approach to evaluating corporporate performance. Ehrbar, a veteran
financial journalist, explains the framework lucidly, illustrates
it with plenty of examples drawn from the experience of companies
like Coca-Cola, Eli Lilly, and Siemens, and links it all to the
well-known yardsticks published by Stern Stewart &AMP; Co., where he
now works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy by
Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian (Harvard Business School Press, $tktk
). Two reigning experts on network economics explain the ins and
outs of the Internet and how it differs from the great networks _
railroads, telephones, airlines -- of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last year I mentioned an unusual sort of a wish book. ``The
Catalogue for Philanthropy'' showcases a blue-ribbon list of
little-known but well run foundations, organized by purpose: the
amelioration of poverty, education, the environment, the arts, and
so. The organization behind it makes giving appreciated securities
easy. To receive a copy of the Massachusetts version, call
800-298-7141 or e-mail www.catphilanthropy.org.
</P>
<P>
   I have saved the best for last _ or worst, if you have no
discipline with your credit card. The Internet market for used
books has had a banner year. Three huge networks of used bookstores
can be found on line: Advanced Book Exchange (abebooks.com);
Bibliofind.com; and Interlock.com. These search services show Web
commerce in its very stage, before the relentless efficiency of the
medium eliminates all the bargains: prices, in other words, are all
over the map. For those of who love books, this is the equivalent
of a rainy afternoon in Bath, England, every day of the week.

THE FEAR THAT MADE THE FED STEP IN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Conn.)   (Eds: Please note the subslug for INVEST-FLAWS-FED)  
 (af)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slide toward financial panic would have begun with a flutter
of pages off a fax machine in Greenwich, Conn., each a notice of
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The instant that Long-Term Capital Management missed a payment
to a creditor, it would technically have been in default to all of
its roughly 75 creditors, thanks to loan provisions that required
it to remain current on all its debts.
</P>
<P>
   Facing losses, those creditors would have sold assets that the
firm had pledged as collateral, sending prices plunging. Dozens of
markets, from Denmark to Brazil, would have bucked like terrified
stallions.
</P>
<P>
   The selling frenzy would have roiled American markets in junk
bonds, corporate takeover stocks, mortgage securities and even
Treasury bonds. Businesses that depend on those markets for money
to expand and add jobs would have suffered. So would consumers
whose mortgage rates are influenced by those markets and who have
billions in retirement savings in them.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of such a financial panic and its economic aftershocks
prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help arrange an
11th-hour rescue of the fund by 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage
firms in September.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue prevented the fire-sale liquidation of Long-Term
Capital's far-flung, $125 billion portfolio, assembled almost
entirely with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   But even though no public funds were involved, the rescue also
produced some of the most stinging criticism the Federal Reserve
has faced since its inflation-fighting efforts prompted a national
recession in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists and members of Congress _ and privately, even a
few Wall Street executives _ accuse the Fed of overreacting by
helping to rescue a speculative partnership of wealthy investors
and the bankers who allowed its speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the weight of the federal government be brought to
bear to help out a private investor?'' asked Paul A. Volcker, the
former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the markets could have coped with the fund's
collapse, although plunging prices would certainly have inflicted
some pain on market participants. ``There is the impression that
the Fed interfered with a market solution,'' said Robert Litan, an
economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials have defended their limited role as essential in
avoiding what could have become a free-fall panic in markets
already struggling with the aftershocks of Russia's debt moratorium
a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my judgment that the American people, whom we are
pledged to serve, could have been seriously hurt if credit dried up
in a general effort by banks and other intermediaries to avoid
greater risk,'' said William J. McDonough, president of the New
York Fed, in testimony before Congress a week after the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, agreed that the
times required action.
</P>
<P>
   ``With markets currently volatile and investors skittish,'' he
told Congress in October, helping to facilitate a timely rescue of
the fund ``seemed entirely appropriate as a matter of public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics worry that by orchestrating the rescue of
Long-Term Capital, the Fed suggested that a speculator that grows
large enough to threaten the system will be saved _ a message that
might encourage recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get away from the `too big to fail' idea,'' said
Hans Stoll, a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and the
author of a number of important studies of the volatility in stock
markets. ``We are not in the position of saving hedge funds, and
the Fed or someone should make that pretty clear.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A senior Wall Street banker who is a director of the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association argues that the
markets for swaps and other derivatives could have coped with
Long-Term Capital's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There surely would have been price changes, and they might
have been significant,'' the banker said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. But as the prices changed, he added, bargain hunters
would have stepped in and the markets would have adapted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market crashed in 1987, swap activity trudged
right through without a problem _ with less liquidity and less
standardization than we have today,'' he added. ``Would prices have
changed? Yes. Would the system have than been in jeopardy? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Few critics of the Fed can be found in Wall Street's corner
offices, however. Top executives of banks and brokerage firms
estimate privately that the collapse of Long-Term Capital alone
could have cost their businesses a total of $8 billion to $15
billion, and one senior executive said he believed that the amounts
could have been 10 times higher in a market stampede. ``It would
have turned a machine gun on the Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Levy-Lang, chairman and chief executive of Paribas, the
French investment bank that contributed $100 million to the rescue
effort, said the Fed ``was right in raising the question and making
sure the solution is found.'' There was, he added, ``the beginning
of a systemic problem'' for the markets, and the situation ``might
have unraveled very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Litan, the Federal Reserve was ``damned if it
did and damned if it didn't.'' If the Fed had done nothing and the
hedge fund's collapse had precipitated a bank failure or a market
panic, he said, criticism of the sort being cast at the central
bank today would seem trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some people say a key lesson of the debacle is the need
for more regulation, not less. Long-Term Capital's troubles
demonstrate that ``the regulatory infrastructure is not strong
enough or encompassing enough,'' said Henry Kaufman, an independent
market strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it improves, he added, there is ``a better-than-even
chance'' that the markets will see ``future significant financial
problems of this magnitude, or greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has acknowledged that an emergency like this one could
occur again, and he recently called on bankers and regulators to be
more alert to the risks of financial derivatives and other
investments in unseasoned markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``New instruments, like derivatives, afford the opportunity to
reduce risk, but they also afford opportunities to become more
vulnerable,'' Greenspan told a meeting of Wall Street executives
early last month. ``Borrowers, lenders and regulators need to
improve their understanding of the risk characteristics of the new
instruments under a variety of circumstances _ some extreme.''

ENDEAVOUR SOARS INTO ORBIT TO DELIVER SPACE STATION COMPONENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The shuttle Endeavour soared into orbit
on Friday, its six U.S. and Russian crew members eager to assemble
the first components of the new U.S.-led international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle and its cargo, a 33-foot-long module called Unity,
was on a course to reach the station's orbital construction site
late Sunday. The nearly 13-ton, U.S.-built module is fitted with a
half-dozen docking ports intended to link future station
components, including living quarters, research laboratories, power
generating equipment and an airlock.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of carefully timed maneuvers, the Endeavour crew
plans to rendezvous with the Russian-built Zarya propulsion and
power module. Launched from Central Asia on Nov. 20, the
41-foot-long, 21.5-ton Zarya serves as the new station's orbital
cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   Using the shuttle's long robot arm and at least three
spacewalks, the Endeavour crew plans to link Zarya with Unity,
forming a permanent structural bridge between the station's future
U.S. and Russian segments.
</P>
<P>
   The new global outpost represents the sixth and most complex of
the human spacecraft developed by U.S. engineers and the first to
include substantial foreign contributions. Mercury, Gemini and
Apollo enabled Americans to reach the moon; Skylab, to experiment
with space station activities; and the shuttle, to pioneer the
operation of a reusable spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial contributions from the Europeans, Japanese and
Canadians as well as the Russians will be incorporated into the
station over its six-year construction.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour thundered from its coastal launching pad at NASA's
Kennedy Space Center at 3:33 a.m.,EST, skirting a passing threat
from rain showers. Trailing a spectacular exhaust that lit up the
darkened skies, Endeavour climbed steeply and steered a northerly
course before settling into a near 200-mile high orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great show,'' mission control told the astronauts. ``Welcome
to orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement after launch, calling it
``a bold and exciting step toward a permanent U.S. presence in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts were especially eager to liftoff after a
momentary drop in the pressure of the shuttle's hydraulic system
stalled the first attempt on Thursday with only seconds left in the
countdown. Engineers traced the difficulty to the system's sluggish
response to a cockpit activation switch, and Friday's countdown was
flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do this tonight,'' urged Endeavour commander Bob Cabana,
who displayed a ``thumbs up'' as he crawled into the cockpit.
``We're ready to start on a new era in international cooperation in
space and get this space station built.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those present for the launching was U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupendous work,'' Albright told space agency workers,
offering her endorsement for NASA's efforts to fold the
contributions of 16 nations into the project. ``It was really
inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission was originally scheduled to blast off a year ago.
Chronic problems with the Russian economy, however, have stalled
the production of a still-to- be-launched module that has an impact
on the launch of other components. Now slated for launching no
sooner than July, which is 15 months late, the Russian service
module will furnish living quarters for the first resident
astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   Cabana's crew includes pilot Frederick ``Rick'' Sturckow, flight
engineer Nancy Currie, spacewalkers Jerry Ross and Jim Newman and
Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya soared 250 miles directly over Cape Canaveral, Fla., as
Endeavour lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Endeavour, the astronauts spent their first hours aloft
carefully checking out the shuttle's long robot arm and the space
suits that will be crucial to the success of their flight.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, astronaut Nancy Currie was to take control of the arm
from her post in the crew compartment to carefully lift the 25,600
pound Unity module from the shuttle's cargo bay. Her task is to
re-orient the module into a vertical posture so that it can be
lowered atop the docking apparatus in the shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is the first in a sequence of delicate steps
needed to join Zarya to Unity. Shuttle astronauts successfully
executed a similar operation in November 1995 as they fitted an
American docking module to Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   But experts believe Endeavour's astronauts face a more difficult
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the difficulties are in the tight tolerances we are
talking about,'' Currie explained before the mission. She trained
two years for the tasks.
</P>
<P>
   To join Zarya to Unity, Currie has trained to rely on closed
circuit television views to first grab the large Russian module
with the robot arm and then to align it atop the smaller U.S.
component.
</P>
<P>
   Her alignments will be crucial because brief pulses of the
shuttle's steering thrusters will be required to drive the
components into the docking mechanisms that will latch them in
place.
</P>
<P>
   As Endeavour meets up with Zarya, Currie's view of the big
module from the window of her control station will be blocked by
the four-story-tall Unity module.
</P>
<P>
   Video cameras stationed in the shuttle cargo bay and on the
robot arm will replace her eyes, furnishing the televised views for
her to grab Zarya and position it above Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Newman are to begin the first of their spacewalks on
Monday. The excursions will enable the two men to hook up power and
computer data cables between the two modules, establish a
communications link with NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston
and stow tools and other equipment for future visitors.

REPORTING ON MITCH WAS OVERBLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, as journalists streamed into Nicaragua to report a
landslide that killed nearly 2,000 people, Honduran President
Carlos Flores went on television to remind the world of the
calamity inflicted upon his country by the same storm, Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' Flores said, making an appeal for massive international
aid. ``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.'' That same day, the official
Honduran death toll went from 246 to 5,000. It later reached a high
of 6,748 confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Flores' impassioned speech helped shift the world's focus from
Nicaragua to Honduras, making it sound as if a perfect storm had
raked the country. The official Honduran death count also prompted
a disaster relief drive and sparked a media frenzy. Harried
reporters based in the region--such as me--embraced the idea that
this was the natural disaster of a lifetime and reported the
government's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But new evidence suggests that the Honduran government grossly
exaggerated the death count. In a phrase, we were all had: the
press, the relief organizations, and the public. While thousands of
poor Hondurans did lose their homes in the wake of Mitch, and
survivors watched as their subsistence crops washed away, I'll
wager that an independent count would prove that hundreds rather
than thousands of Hondurans died.
</P>
<P>
   The first law of disaster reporting--as editors like to remind
writers--is that developing countries usually underreport deaths.
And, as a rule, editors insist that reporters depend on credible
sources for their stories. Since almost no one in Honduras refuted
Flores' extravagant body counts, his assertion went largely
unchecked in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The first dispatches filed by the Associated Press and Reuters
about Hurricane Mitch's course through Central America recounted
the difficulties of collecting accurate death tolls, but neither
wire service challenged the official numbers--even though some of
their reporters on the ground thought they should have done so.
</P>
<P>
   The wire services play a key role in setting the tone for
coverage by the rest of the media. Having cut back on foreign staff
since the close of the Cold War, the major newspapers and TV
networks increasing rely on the wires to provide the basic facts of
a breaking story. They also depend on the wires in order to make
news judgments about overseas coverage. In the case of Hurricane
Mitch, assignment editors used early wire reports to decide whether
the story warranted sending reporters, photographers, and film
crews to the scene. When the wires declared 7,000 and then 10,000
dead in the region, editors sent jet-loads of journalists to
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps had little incentive to doubt the numbers once
they hit the ground. Having budgeted untold thousands to fly
himself and a crew down to the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to
broadcast ``Nightline,'' Ted Koppel would be nuts to downplay the
storm's impact. With the pictures telling the story of the
devastation and the good people of Kansas organizing food drives,
it would seem downright churlish for a reporter to question a
Honduran official about his body-count methodology.
</P>
<P>
   The first report to question the official numbers was published
in the Miami Herald, two weeks after Mitch subsided. In region
after region, Herald reporters Juan O. Tamayo and Glenn Garvin
failed to substantiate the official numbers. Flores, however,
responded sharply to the Herald's doubts. ``When we give out
numbers, those are the dead bodies that have been actually been
counted,'' Flores told the paper. ``I have absolute confidence in
those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   My own experience was probably typical of most reporters who
covered the storm. By the time I arrived in Tegucigalpa on Nov. 5,
Mitch was universally accepted as the hurricane of the century.
Editors phoned reporters saying they wanted ``color''--interviews
with victims--rather than numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But fanning out into the capital's neighborhoods, I found death
more rare than expected. The government said it knew of 250 dead in
Tegucigalpa, and some officials told me they believed the actual
number of dead in the city would rise to the thousands. But the
hardest hit neighborhood we reporters could find was Nueva
Esperanza, where there were 14 dead. Poor Selvin Perez, who lost
his wife and daughter in the storm, was subjected to dozens of
interviews with color-seeking reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters story from Nov. 5 quoted a government disaster
commission official, Norberto Otero, as saying that a mass grave
had been dug for 100 storm victims in Tegucigalpa. To confirm the
story, I hired a taxi driver to take me to the neighborhood where
residents said a truck had in fact dumped 20 bodies in a mass
grave. I used that fact in my report.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a couple of weeks later when I revisited the storm-ravaged
country, I consistently found that region by region, the
government's original numbers were wrong. Officials first reported
531 confirmed dead on the Bay Islands just off Honduras' Caribbean
coast. When visiting reporters found just 14 dead in the islands,
the government dropped its number to 81. Military leaders in the
region currently put the death toll on the islands at 12.
</P>
<P>
   In La Ceiba, a coastal city where the people are now busy
hanging Christmas decorations, I learned that the official death
toll is nine. The government once pegged its death toll at 979. A
new report from the government's regional disaster relief office
covering north-central Honduras shows 46 dead there. But a report
released by the federal government two days later declared 1,426
deaths in that same area. Did the federal officials never get a
copy of the report from their regional office, or did they just not
read it?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the mountainous state of Santa Barbara, where the
Red Cross reported 50 dead but the government counted 1,124
corpses. On Nov. 27, the day after I began asking questions about
the 1,124 dead in Santa Barbara, the government released a revised
death toll of 282. Even so, it continues to report absurdly high
death numbers in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters who covered the storm in Honduras aren't
surprised at the exaggerations. Everybody had an interest in
reporting big numbers, says the Herald's Garvin. ``If you are
reporter, you want to cover the story of the century, and that
requires lots of bodies. Editors want something they can put on the
front page. Relief agencies want more aid. And the interest of
local governments is so obvious it doesn't warrant detailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Flores deliberately overstate the crisis to draw
international aid? Perhaps. He's a media-savvy leader who owns one
of Honduras' principal newspapers, La Tribuna. A noted press
manipulator, he is said to dispense favors in return for favorable
stories. Flores also knows that journalists will forgive a
politician for making a natural disaster sound bigger than it is
but will crucify anyone who tries to downplay the story.
</P>
<P>
   A postscript to my own reporting about the mass grave in
Tegucigalpa: The story turns out to be false. City morgue officials
explain that the storm damaged their freezer so they dug a mass
grave to stow the corpses that had sat unclaimed in the morgue for
months before the storm. At last count, the Honduran government had
deflated its official death count to 5,657.

ECONOMIC VIEW: A BLESSING AND A CURSE _ LIFE WITHOUT OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Ind. _ Now that his weekends are suddenly free, Ronald
Grissom is not sure how to spend the idle time. He slept a lot on
that first free weekend, in November, and he and his wife,
Stephanie, decorated the Christmas tree last weekend. They have
been talking about the various movies they would like to see, and
if the weather stays warm they will probably go bicycling in the
flat, open countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, 57, is not unemployed. He is not one of the thousands
of manufacturing workers who have been laid off around the country
because of global economic turmoil. In fact, he has been employed
as a blue-collar factory worker in this industrial and agricultural
area northeast of Indianapolis for 36 years without ever being laid
off, even for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the time on Grissom's hands results from a first cousin
of downsizing. He has suddenly lost the overtime that had kept him
at work nearly every weekend and every holiday for five years.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Grissoms find their income and purchasing power
sharply reduced and their everyday lives altered _ both for better
and for worse.
</P>
<P>
   For better, the Grissoms will spend more time together. Mrs.
Grissom lists the ways: They will take more day trips and
vacations, and they will work together on the 15-acre farm they
bought and moved to three years ago. ``I had only helped her with
the tomatoes and beans,'' Grissom said. ``Now we will till the
land, and I will have time to paint the barn and do other neglected
repair work.''
</P>
<P>
   But would he go back to all the overtime if he could get it?
Absolutely, they both said: The money is irresistible. ``When I
worked a Sunday, I got double time, $40 an hour, and on holidays,
triple pay, $60 an hour,'' Grissom said. The extra pleasures this
money bought and the extra retirement savings must now be
sacrificed. ``I have never known anyone our age,'' said Mrs.
Grissom, 45, ``who has turned down overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's wage history over the past decade helps to explain
why the current economic expansion has featured such robust
consumer spending _ and why, even now, Grissom and many other
American factory workers, most of them unionized, are still among
the nation's better earners.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic expansion unfolded, Grissom's annual income more
than doubled, reaching $117,000 last year, thanks to overtime,
which manufacturers have piled on their existing workers to avoid
hiring more people.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom was headed for another six-figure year when the overtime
all but stopped last month. Now he calculates that he will finish
1998 at $97,000, and next year at about $60,000 _ $43,000 in base
salary and the rest, he hopes, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   His experience, though dramatic, reflects a national trend.
Overtime for the nation's 18.6 million manufacturing workers has
fallen to 4.5 hours a week on average over the last three months,
from 4.9 hours in January. The 8 percent drop in so few months is
unusually sharp, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, who dropped out of Indiana University after three
semesters, has spent most of his career working for General Motors
in several of its auto parts plants in this area. Today he works in
a former GM plant now owned by Magnequench International Inc., a
Chinese company. The factory produces tiny magnets for computers,
anti-lock brakes, ignition switches and the like. It also produces
a special powder from which the magnets are made. Grissom works in
the powder-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Magnequench sells both the powder and the magnets, and some of
the powder has been exported to Asia. But the powder is also
produced now in China, cutting into the Indiana plant's exports.
That is one reason that overtime has suddenly been curtailed at the
plant _ although Grissom did manage to work on Thanksgiving Day, at
triple pay.
</P>
<P>
   The curtailment translates into an altered life style. A
high-powered telescope is mounted on an aluminum tripod near a
dining room window in the Grissoms' bungalow-sized home. They had
paid $700 for the telescope as an early Christmas present to
themselves and they have looked at the stars a couple of times.
That sort of purchase won't happen again, they said, and their
practice of buying a new car each year is also on hold.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Mrs. Grissom plans to be working full-time again as
a freelance legal secretary. She hopes to earn $20,000 in 1999, up
from $7,000 this year as a part-timer. And Grissom, who plans to
retire in four years _ if he is not laid off first _ is reconciling
himself to a $7,500 contribution to his 401(k) plan in 1999, down
from $10,000 this year. He now has $100,000 saved up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of the last of the wealthy blue-collar workers,'' he
said. ``I am a dying breed.''

CALIFORNIA HIGH COURT BLOCKS INITIATIVE THAT LEGALIZED VIDEO GAMING
IN INDIAN CASINOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   California's Supreme Court this week blocked enforcement of the
November ballot initiative that legalized video gaming in Indian
casinos, pending two lawsuits that claim Proposition Five violates
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were not unexpected by the Indian tribes who backed
the proposition. But an attorney representing the tribes says the
federal government continues to threaten to seize gaming equipment
from reservation casinos while the legality of Proposition 5 swings
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition Five was the most expensive ballot initiative in
U.S. history, pitting well-financed Indian tribes against wealthy
Nevada casinos in a nearly $100 million battle. But there's a huge
amount of money still at stake _ money the tribes stand to earn
from the already lucrative casino business, and business their
competitors in neighboring Nevada stand to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The state government of California has been battling with the
tribes for years over what kind of gaming is legal in the casinos,
all of which sit on reservation lands. Federal regulations restrict
Indian gaming to those types already legal in the state and
requires the tribes to sign compacts with the state.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the casinos started as bingo parlors, and evolved
into video slot machine palaces over the past decade without
compacts. California Gov. Pete Wilson recently negotiated a
restrictive compact with a handful of tribes, but the majority
refused to sign and backed Proposition 5 instead.
</P>
<P>
   California voters passed the ballot measure by a 63 percent
margin last month. Subsequent lawsuits filed by a homeowners group
and a state union claim the ballot measure violates a
constitutional ban on casinos like those operating in Nevada and
New Jersey, a ban approved by voters in 1984 when they authorized
the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson applauded the Supreme Court's decision to stay
Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a stay, this state would have begun its transformation
into a Nevada-by-the-sea, populated with dozens and dozens of new
Las Vegas style casinos in violation of our constitution's ban,''
Wilson said. ``Few people recognized that without the court's
action, the tribes' sovereign immunity could have prevented the
state from stopping tribes' operation of these illegal casinos once
they took effect regardless of how unconstitutional the courts
later found the initiative to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Levine, a Los Angeles attorney representing the tribes,
said he believes the ballot measure will pass constitutional
muster. The constitution prohibits the legislature from authorizing
Nevada or New Jersey style gaming, he said, but does not prohibit
the voters from authorizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is read more broadly, we don't think that what's
authorized by Proposition 5 authorizes (that) type of gaming,''
Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we weren't surprised that Nevada continued in its
relentless attempt to strip these programs from the tribes,''
Levine said. ``Nevada seems to be consistent in its concern for
retaining its business interests, even if it means putting lots of
Californians out of work and injuring tribal programs.'' &QL;

`REMEMBERING THE KINDERTRANSPORTS': WOUNDED HEARTS FIND EACH
OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Melissa Hacker was an elementary school girl growing up in
New York City, she remembers feeling that her relationship with her
mother, Ruth Morley, a successful costume designer for Hollywood
films, was different from the relationships other children had with
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up knowing there were things she was afraid of that had
to do with her refugee experience,'' Ms. Hacker says. ``Even when I
was a little girl I would try to protect her from this big, bad,
dangerous world. I felt that since so many scarier things had
happened to her when she was my age than had happened to me, I
shouldn't bother her with my little child's troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until many years later that Ms. Hacker, now 37,
learned the full story of her mother's separation from her parents
at the age of 13 in Vienna at the outset of the Holocaust. Ms.
Morley, along with thousands of other Jewish children from Germany
and Central Europe, was sent away to England where for the next
year and a half she was shuttled among various foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ms. Morley's emigration in January 1939 and its
reverberations on Ms. Hacker's relationship with her mother, who
died of breast cancer in 1991, form the core of Ms. Hacker's debut
documentary film, ``My Knees Were Jumping: Remembering the
Kindertransports,'' which is playing at Anthology Film Archives
through Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Kindertransport is the name of the movement, organized by
British Jews and Quakers, to rescue some 10,000 mostly Jewish
children from the Nazis in the nine months before the outbreak of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe word spread quickly through the Jewish community that
there was a rescue program for Jewish children, most of whom ranged
in age from 5 to 17. Parents would bring their children to local
Jewish community centers, where information and photographs were
collected and sent to committees in England. A few weeks later
transit papers would come back for some but not all of the children
who applied.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the parents had only 24 hours to prepare their children
and say goodbye. Many of the trains left at night, and parents were
not allowed on the platforms to see the trains off. The children
were taken to the Netherlands, then transferred to ferries that
took them to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 percent of the children never saw their parents
again. Ms. Morley was one of the lucky ones. She was reunited with
her parents in England a year and a half later, and the family
sailed to New York in the fall of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky title of Ms Hacker's documentary refers to an
incident Ms. Morley recounts in the film. On Kristallnacht, Nov. 9,
1938, she was hiding in a back room with her older half-sister,
Lily, when Nazi officers stormed into the apartment, smashed
furniture and arrested her father, a pharmacist. When Ms. Morley
began to scream, Lily muffled her cries with a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   After being held in prison for 10 days, Ms. Morley's father was
brought home by two Nazi officers. Listening through the wall in
the next room as one of them telephoned headquarters to inquire
whether they should leave her father there or return him to prison,
Ms. Morley fainted.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, she recalls feeling as though her knees were
jumping out of her skin. It was then and there that her parents
decided they had to get their child out of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Hacker started planning her film 10 years ago, the
story of the Kindertransports was just beginning to be told. In the
1950s, Lore Segal, the novelist and children's author, who appears
in the movie, had written a book, ``Other People's Houses,'' about
her experiences as a child refugee in England, but it was out of
print. (It was reprinted in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hacker had originally planned to make a movie about her
relationship with her mother (whose costume-design credits include
``The Miracle Worker'' ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Annie Hall'' and ``The
Prince of Tides'') and began interviewing her.
</P>
<P>
   As the details of Ms. Morley's childhood came out, Ms. Hacker
realized there was a larger story to tell. She did extensive
research at the Library of Congress and National Archives, where
she discovered one of the movie's most haunting film clips _ a
woman waving goodbye _ in the back of a file of Universal
newsreels.
</P>
<P>
   Her first major shoot was in the fall of 1990 at the first
American Kindertransport reunion in the Catskills. More than 300
people attended this intensely emotional gathering, shown in the
film, where Ms. Morley spoke publicly for the first time about her
childhood experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hacker, while filming, was moved to tears. ``All around
there were people who hadn't seen each other in 50 years finding
each other,'' she recalls. ``Many had brought their children and
their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Morley was in temporary remission from her cancer, she
and her daughter traveled together to Vienna and visited the house
where she had grown up. But because the Nazis didn't want the
Kindertransport to be a public relations spectacle, the archival
material in Vienna proved to be scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hacker, who studied film at New York University after
attending Oberlin and the University of Washington, paid for the
movie mostly from her earnings as an assistant film editor. The
total cost was around $110,000, and it took her seven years to
complete the film. Even before it was finished, she had begun to
show it at Kindertransport reunion meetings as a work-in-progress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to looking at the lives of those who were saved by
the Kindertransport movement, ``My Knees Were Jumping'' examines
the complicated feelings of the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hacker was not alone in having grown up sensing a traumatic
parental experience without ever being told exactly what had
happened. Yet somehow the next generation knew. Ms. Hacker used to
brood about what she would do if confined in a concentration camp,
and her sister, Emily, who is two years younger, had nightmares
about storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Such anxieties, Ms. Hacker discovered, are shared by many of the
second generation of the Kindertransport. She now belongs to a
second-generation organization called KT2, which has about 200
members in the United States. They gather three times a year to
share their experiences and have begun compiling a collection of
videotaped oral histories as part of an archive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morley died before she could see her daughter's movie. But
the making of the film had already brought them closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to get it all out in the open and to share
everything,'' Ms. Hacker says. ``One thing I want the film to do is
to open up communications in families. What has impressed me is the
strength of the Kindertransport people and their ability to create
new lives and new families. And I'm simply in awe of their parents,
who had the strength to send their children away not knowing where
they were going or what would happen to them.''

 &HT;    1999 1/2 is a good year for Saab
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not content with turning its 5-year-old 900 models
into the frisky 9-3 coupe and sedan for 1999, Saab _ whose North
American headquarters is in Norcross, Ga. _ now moves on in the
automotive race toward the millennium with mid-model-year '99 1/2
versions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a marketing or public relations ploy, either. Saab
has made significant changes _ mostly underneath and inside _ to
the front-drive cars. The test 9-3 SE sedan, with a base price of
$31,700 pushed to a total of $32,775 by $500 for heated seats and
$575 for delivery, performed more strongly and carried noticeably
more comfort/convenience features than the original '99 model
tested earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But first, in accordance with Saab tradition, there's the matter
of quirkiness. You think after all these years the Swedish/Finnish
carbuilder is going to eliminate ``quirky'' from its list of
standard features? So the ignition switch remains on the center
console between the front seats, turbo lag is still an irritant,
there's an airplane wing in the slotted front grille and it's
virtually impossible to use the center-mounted parking brake
without first raising the new folding center armrest.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its avowed dedication to improving the safety of
its cars, Saab has given the reworked '99 9-3 more overhead padding
for additional head protection. Other safety features shared with
the coupe (starting at $25,650) and convertible (starting at
$38,150) include dual front air bags and an active head-restraint
system. The latter uses an impact-sensitive headrest that moves up
to catch the head and, hopefully, reduce whiplash injuries in
rear-end accidents. The system doesn't make the multi-adjustable
front seats sit better, but it does seem an idea whose time has
come. Regardless, the seats lack thigh support.
</P>
<P>
   The ``B'' or center-of-the-car pillars are given a pendulum
design intended to disperse energy in increasing amounts from top
to bottom in case of a side-impact. The theory is this will lessen
impact energy potentially directed at the head and channel it to
the lower part of the torso. (It's a grim subject, but crashes are
just that.)
</P>
<P>
   Performance, which isn't exactly shabby with the regular
2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (185 horsepower), is boosted
by raising the hp rating to 200 for the high-output turbocharged
engine, available only in the line-topping SE cars.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-3 SE, it quickly becomes apparent, now is certifiably
zippy _ once turbo lag is overcome _ and more challenging to the
pep of competing Acura, Audi and Volvo cars.
</P>
<P>
   Interior updates include the addition of a four-spoke steering
wheel with redundant stereo controls that are actually easier to
operate than those on the dash-mounted unit. Revised heater/air
conditioning controls also are easier to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new and convenient pop-out drink holder on the dash,
and while it won't accept large containers, the unlidded storage
cubby on the center console will take jumbo cans, bottles and
glasses. It's also deep enough to keep them stable.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 1/2 naturally retains improvements given the regular
'99, including a tighter steering system and barely noticeable
changes to the front and rear lights and a grille borrowed from the
larger, costlier 9-5. The upshot is owners of the '99s introduced
in May may feel slighted by Saab's midyear updates. There's no
question they make the 9-3 a better and more driveable car.

BANKS ARE RUSHING TO PREPARE FOR LAUNCH OF EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ The bank where Salvatore Bellu works is
strongest in Italy's dynamic northern industrial belt, filled with
mighty little multinationals, like Zanussi and Rex, washing-machine
makers in Sweden's big Electrolux appliance group. Come January,
Electrolux is shifting its business to Europe's new single
currency, the euro, and Zanussi and Rex are under orders to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sweden will be outside the euro zone, Electrolux, by
adopting the single currency, expects to reduce costs and avoid
having to hedge against currency fluctuations, all of which should
pay off in increased competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   So if Electrolux wants to pay bills in euros, or transfer funds
from one bank to another, Bellu's bank, Cariverona Banca SpA, will
be ready for it to do so. For two years the bank has been throwing
money and people at the task of getting ready for the euro, or risk
seeing lucrative customers flee to better-prepared competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Cariverona is caught in a rush that is reaching a crucial stage
as the date for introducing the new currency, Jan. 4, nears,
pitting bankers, software specialists and consultants against the
guts of a banking system that serves 290 million Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   If it works _ and major banks are reasonably sure it will _
Europe will take a further giant stride toward overcoming
traditional economic fragmentation by operating under the umbrella
of a uniform monetary policy on most of the old Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by cutting short-term interest rates simultaneously on
Thursday to a nearly uniform 3 percent, the central banks of the 11
nations that will join the euro essentially opened the door to the
new era this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 countries in the European Union, three qualify but are
staying out for now: Britain, Denmark and Sweden. Greece has not
met the requirements. The participants are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, banks in the euro countries will be required by
law to keep track of day-by-day operations _ deposits, withdrawals
and the like _ in euros as well as the local currency, and to make
all bank-to-bank transfers in the new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Regular reporting to national central banks, which will function
under the new European Central Bank somewhat as regional Federal
Reserve Banks operate in the United States, must be in euros. And
since securities markets like the stock exchanges in Paris, Milan
and Frankfurt, Germany, must operate in euros, the banks' brokerage
units will have to be equipped for euro-denominated investments.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, brokerage firms, banks and financial-service companies,
spurred in many cases by euro-prone customers, are racing to get
ready. Most will use the long weekend in early January to fine-tune
systems for the start of business on Monday, Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there will be some problems,'' said Bellu, who has
overseen his bank's drive to the euro, with a sigh of realism.
``Monday the 4th will tell us if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Noyer, deputy chairman of the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, said the central banking system appeared ready to go.
``All the systems have been tested and retested,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``The worst has been imagined, along with the
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and bills will not be introduced until the end of
2001, but starting in January the marks and francs and lire in
circulation will simply be fixed units of the new euro, the banking
system's fundamental yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   And since much commerce in Europe, as in most modern economies,
is conducted without cash, hotels, department stores and most other
consumer-oriented businesses are moving to list prices and take
payment in both euros and local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   American Express will offer credit-card and banking services in
euros and local currencies; in January it will start selling euro
traveler's checks in 21 countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early indications are that large department stores and hotel
chains are ready to price in euros and accept payment,'' said Keith
Meyrick, spokesman for the traveler's-check program in London.
</P>
<P>
   For American travelers to Europe, the advantage is clear. With
11 European currencies locked together in the euro, euro traveler's
checks will be exchangeable for all 11 currencies at a predictable
rate, reducing the need to exchange dollars into local currencies
along the way and thus the risk of losing money if the dollar-euro
exchange rate shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who sees a competitive advantage in the euro will use
euros,'' said Bruno Leresche, who heads the transition to the euro
at Paribas, the big French financial-services group.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question for bankers is the extent to which ordinary
consumers will switch to euros. Will customers want bank accounts
denominated in euros, or request monthly statements in both euros
and local currencies? Partly, that will depend on how soon, say,
employers begin transferring salaries to employees' bank accounts
in euros, or how soon landlords require that rents be paid in
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Given their druthers, many customers do not appear eager to
switch, bankers say. Recently, Paribas surveyed its private
clients, and few even bothered to reply, Leresche said. Customers
reacted, he said, as they do to a new model television set. ``When
I see my neighbor get one,'' he said in describing the common
attitude, ``I'll buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, banks that want to be competitive are striving to be
ready. They are tailoring computers and software to enable monthly
statements to be issued in euros, or in a combination of euros and
local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a bank customer who regularly receives deposits on a
French franc account in German marks and Spanish pesetas might
request that monthly statements give the total euro amounts plus a
breakdown into local currencies. Some banks are already gearing
their computer software to be able to provide such information.
</P>
<P>
   And well-prepared banks are trying to persuade customers to make
the switch to euros sooner rather than later. Paribas, Leresche
said, spent $71 million preparing. Come January, it will offer all
services in French francs, euros or a combination of currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Over two years, Cariverona invested $8 million to overhaul
30,000 software applications, said Bellu, including some that
prepare monthly statements and others for making interbank
payments, and to train personnel to explain the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2002, Deutsche Bank will have spent $295 million for
euro conversion, according to Victor Bruns, its euro project
manager. He figures the bank has burned up ``1,200 man-years'' on
the project. ``We believe we will make it, but a switchover of this
magnitude is a unique thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, the U.S. technology consultants, estimates that
Europe's total investment between 1996 and 2002 to introduce the
euro will be as much as $400 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just in time for Christmas, Esther Dyson has
updated her book about life in the digital age, and what it means
even for those of us who aren't technologically bent.
</P>
<P>
   The update is appropriately called Release 2.1, following the
same version-numbering conventions used for software updates.
</P>
<P>
   Release 2.0 was itself a play on Dyson's influential technology
newsletter, Release 1.0. In the new paperback version, Dyson not
only updates the fate of companies she mentioned last year, but
includes vigorous debate about her book that took place on her Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Though some criticized her for cheerleading about the 'Net's
possibilities, Dyson devotes much of the book to concerns such as
copyright protection, privacy, security and community building. But
she does remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'Net is not going to push us into some antiseptic, digital
landscape,'' Dyson writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a medium for us to extend our intellectual and emotional
selves, but it will not change anyone's basic character,'' she
continues. ``On the contrary, the 'Net will celebrate human nature
and diversity ... if we do it right. Precisely because there will
be so much information, so much multimedia, so many options, people
will learn to value human connection more, and they will look for
it on the 'Net as they do in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A YOOT: The ad is rather, ahem, eye-catching. In the
two-page color picture of an office building, there's a man mooning
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our deepest apologies to PC users, but YootTower is coming out
on Mac first,'' the ad copy reads. Um, yes. Well, regardless of the
ad's sentiments, YootTower does mark several notable firsts.
</P>
<P>
   The game, a successor to the building simulation SimTower, is
coming out on the Macintosh first, which almost never happens with
games.
</P>
<P>
   These days, if a game isn't a hybrid title that runs on both
IBM-compatibles and Macs, it comes out first on the PC side because
of the size of that market.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's hugely successful iMac may eventually create a more
substantial Mac gaming market. But Sega PC's decision to publish
Mac first was still unusual, and made for unusual reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developer is a die-hard Mac fan, and he wanted to make
sure it made it to the Mac platform first,'' said Sega PC
spokeswoman Jennifer Walker. It's also the first Mac title for
3-year-old Sega PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sega is just excited to get into the Mac market,'' which it
estimates at more than $200 million in sales annually, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The game was created by Yoot Saito, whose earlier SimTower was
part of Maxis' successful line of simulations that began with the
classic SimCity.
</P>
<P>
   In Yoot, a player builds and runs a hotel, resort or office
building, balancing income with tenants' demands and operational
costs. The game is challenging but absorbing, even for my young
children, who were fascinated by the ability to create a
self-contained world.
</P>
<P>
   And the game is more than a simple matter of build it and they
will come. VIPs have to be cared for in particular, because their
good opinions can allow the building to grow to a five-star
facility. Fires and terrorist attacks, annoying buskers and lovable
dogs also change things up.
</P>
<P>
   The game isn't perfect, however.
</P>
<P>
   Its graphics are attractive, but relatively static (this is,
after all, a building), yet the game remains a resource hog,
requiring at least 24 megabytes of memory to function. And the game
shows its Japanese roots (for instance with the tone-deaf
translations in help screens) perhaps a bit too much for some in
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY 1.2: And speaking of new releases, here's release 1.2 of
the Holiday Gear and Gift Guide, with more stuff of interest that
came in too late or otherwise didn't make our original set of
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   A BUG'S LIFE PRINT STUDIO and A BUG'S LIFE ACTION GAME have been
released in conjunction with Disney's terrific new animated movie.
Print Studio allows children of all ages to create and print out
everything from photo frames to posters featuring images from the
film and anything you can import from other sources. Sheets of
sticker paper are included. In the fun Action Game, Flik collects
grains, flies on dandelion puffs, recruits warrior bugs, fights
grasshoppers and avoids birds. Somewhat similar to the PlayStation
version, this one looks great and is fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   AGE OF EMPIRES, Microsoft's great strategy game set in the
ancient world, is still worth buying, but so too is an expansion
set, Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome. It adds units such as camel
cavalry, war elephants and ancient warships, plenty of new
scenarios and four new civilizations (Rome, Carthage, Palmyra and
Macedonia).
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE is something of a history lesson in
pinball games, with virtual versions of seven landmark games from
the 1930s on. With all the recent video game nostalgia, this really
should take you back.
</P>
<P>
   PLANE CRAZY is a fast PC airplane-race game whose basics can be
picked up relatively quickly, though its speed makes it difficult
to master.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERMERCS is a dark cyberpunky role-playing game involving a
team of nanotech-enhanced warriors to clean out nasty aliens.
Includes a ``spawn'' mode so more than one person can play a
network game with only one copy.
</P>
<P>
   BUST A GROOVE is a challenging PlayStation music and dance game,
succeeding the huge if unlikely hit Parappa the Rapper. Cut the rug
in time with hip hop, techno and disco, and try not to embarrass
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB'99 updates Acclaim's bestselling Nintendo
64 football game. Good graphics and sound; team-specific playbooks
like the 49ers' West Coast offense; all 32 Super Bowls; even teams
like the expansion Cleveland Browns that don't exist yet.
</P>
<P>
   BUCK BUBBLE lets you play a cybernetic bee protecting your hive
on the Nintendo 64. Get a bug's eye view of life. &QL;

 VERONA, Italy: $400 billion.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts agree that much has already been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been mostly a people and systems challenge, and overall,
it's been very well met,'' said Keith Stock, head of A.T. Kearney's
global financial institutions group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given the costs, many banks are trying to kill two birds with
one stone, eliminating the so-called Y2K millennium bugs from
computers while preparing for the euro. Despite shortages of
consultants and software experts that have driven up the cost of
services, what makes the situation manageable, bankers say, is that
not everything must be done at once.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have concentrated efforts on absolute requirements, like
interbank payments. Paribas' Leresche said French banks had done
``virtual transfers'' on recent weekends to test transfers among
banks. The banks, he said, distinguish between fundamental snags in
the system and those that simply make it slower or less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no fundamental bugs,'' he said, reflecting a
widespread impression in other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   What troubles bankers much more, however, is the euro's impact
on their income, a problem not fixable with new software.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from foreign exchange, traditionally a lucrative source
of profit, will dry up. Italy's banking association predicts that
gross profits in the industry will drop an average 37 percent after
the euro. Cariverona says it will shed 80 percent of its
foreign-exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fiscal belt-tightening required to qualify for the
euro has led to lower interest rates, narrowing the spread between
the relatively low interest banks pay on deposits and what they
earn by reinvesting the deposited assets in high-yielding
securities, like government bonds, thus squeezing a second major
source of bank income.
</P>
<P>
   To offset this decline in traditional income sources, many banks
hope to expand investment banking. But experts agree that the
process will create many winners and losers, leading to further
bank concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In France, small rural banks with few corporate customers are
moving more slowly than banks in Paris. In Italy, banks in the
south, still struggling with losses accumulated in the early 1990s,
are far from ready. Experts say most will be able to execute
essential functions, like interbank transfers, but may not be
prepared to offer customers extra services, like dual currency
statements or other euro-denominated services.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the government-owned bank
whose executives have been getting it ready for an offering of
shares on the stock market, will be ready to meet the requirements
for the euro, but they have had little time to push a euro strategy
much beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Often small banks are under little pressure from corporate
customers to change. ``Among Italian small businesses, the degree
of preparation is very low,'' said Angelo Peretti, an economist at
Cariverona. They view the euro, he said, ``mainly as an accounting
and monetary problem, not as a strategic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, General Motors' European unit told 15,000
suppliers across Europe, many of them small and medium-sized
companies, that they should be ready by January to quote prices in
euros. Hans De Vriese, director of cost management for GM's
European purchasing, said that 95 percent replied that they were
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, big corporate customers have told Volkswagen that
they want prices in euros as soon as possible. Beginning in
January, VW will comply, and it has passed the message to its
suppliers. Brigitte Dietz, who heads VW's push to the euro, said
the company hoped to switch from dollars and German marks as its
operating currencies to the euro. Still, she said, ``We won't force
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very governments that imposed the euro are
the biggest obstacles to its wider use.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Italy said its tax-collecting and
social-security offices would not be ready to deal in euros until
2002; in Belgium and Germany, local and federal tax offices and
benefits agencies have said the same. Thus, for internal
accounting, VW will introduce the euro ``at the latest possible
date, in order to spare resources,'' Ms. Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving sooner, she said, would mean ``still having to do
everything in German marks, and that would cost two to three times
as much.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; First, you take 40 naked Christmas trees. And you
add the usual stuff _ tinsel, balls, angels. Then comes the really
good stuff _ lengths of tulle, ribbons, handmade figures, china
plates, porcelain dolls, race cars, sailboats _ and just about
anything else you can think of.
</P>
<P>
   You add the final ingredient: star power. And then you sell the
designer creations to the highest bidders.
</P>
<P>
   That recipe, officials of the nonprofit Young Musicians
Foundation hopes, will yield a year's worth of scholarships and
cash for young conductors' programs, musical instrument loans to
public schools and free concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful program, especially now that music is really
not included in the public schools anymore,'' said Susan Chalek,
chairwoman of the board of the foundation. ``And the trees are
wonderful, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars' trees, being lovingly decorated in the Rodeo and
Santa Monica rooms of the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Wilshire
Boulevard, will be auctioned off, with proceeds going to the
musicians' foundation. Hotel owner Merv Griffin picked the stars
the trees would represent in the annual Christmas tree auction,
which each year benefits a different charity. Last year's auction
raised $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the trees _ hand-selected by Griffin _ will be auctioned
off at 6:30 p.m. Monday by Sotheby's of Beverly Hills. The
remaining 30 trees will go on display in the Beverly Hilton lobby,
with silent-auction bidding books open until noon Dec. 11, when the
successful bidders will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Even as works in progress, the trees are seemingly the work of
elves, fairies and Santa Claus all rolled into one. They glitter.
They glow. They twinkle. They dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Stevens, the only one of the celebrities to decorate her
own tree, used dainty, flower-painted ornaments and gold garland,
then swathed the entire tree in airy pink tulle.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields' tree is being decorated on the set by the cast
of her show, ``Suddenly Susan,'' and will be delivered this
weekend. Bloomingdale's florist will decorate Calista Flockhart's
tree, starting with pingpong ball-sized blue lights. Randy and Tori
Spelling's tree is covered with a shower of dried flowers, with a
raffia garland spiraling top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Gelson's florist manager Jim Rodacher and crew are working on a
tree for Burt Bachrach containing 500 twinkling lights, musical
notes and clefs, trumpets, balls covered with sheet music and
Bachrach's newest CDs, all in white, black and silver.
</P>
<P>
   A decorating firm called Dr. Christmas _ owned by partners Bob
Pranga and Debi Staron _ is decorating trees for Paul Newman, Angie
Dickenson (co-chair of the auction with Griffin) and the
husband-and-wife team of Jayne Meadows and Steve Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's tree, which was just beginning to take form on
Thursday, featured a miniature ``Hollywood'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is Hollywood,'' Staron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we decided to make the tree about all the things in his
life _ his race car driving, the products he sells, his
philanthropy,'' said Pranga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angie's is going to be about her life as a glamour girl,'' he
said. ``And for Jayne and Steve, we're doing a reversible tree _
one half for her, one half for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jayne's is going to reflect her personal life,'' Staron said.
``She told me a story about Garry Moore teasing her about her
chandelier earrings, so we'll have some of those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Steve's will reflect his studio work, early TV, music and
comedy,'' Pranga said. ``He's basically a New Yorker, so it's going
to be a very Friar-esque tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Designer Brent Ries, hired by Griffin to decorate a dozen of the
celebrity trees, rooted through boxes of decorations to find
something to reflect each of the personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Mariette Hartley's tree is covered with dainty porcelain doll
angels, purple and gold ribbon and tulle. Burt Reynolds' tree
sports jesters and marionettes and giant tassels, all in black and
white. Christine Lahti's tree includes red and green lights, golden
angels and harps. Bruce Boxleitner and Melissa Gilbert's tree is
covered with golden lights and dried flowers. And Sara Gilbert's is
a jungle theme, complete with miniature frogs, elephants, giraffes
and other exotic creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nell Carter's tree _ ``a Hanukkah bush,'' explained Ries _ will
reflect a Hanukkah theme, with tiny bears and dreidels with a
blue-and-white color scheme. Denzel Washington's tree will reflect
modes of transportation: boats, trains, cars and even a hot-air
balloon _ ``a very masculine theme,'' Ries said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alec Baldwin's tree will have a toddler theme because he has a
2-year-old,'' said Reis. ``There'll be Mr. Potato Heads, blocks,
Legos, alphabet letters.''
</P>
<P>
   And home-run hitter Mark McGwire's tree will pay homage to the
St. Louis Cardinal's hitting record with red and white lights, tiny
cardinals and baseball-shaped ornaments. ``I'm actually going to
put a real ball, glove and bat on the tree,'' Reis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Harmon, commercial relocator for Gaebel Los Angeles
Movers _ the firm that will deliver all the trees once they're
auctioned off _ plotted delivery strategy as she and her sister,
Jodi Oniedo, decorated the firm's tree with china plates
representing countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stretch-wrap the trees, bend the branches up gently so we
don't disturb the ornaments. We really secure 'em to hold
everything in place,'' she said. ``And we suspend them in the truck
so nothing breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, some decorators and stars chose very tall trees that
proved very difficult to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tree last year that was 12 feet high,'' Harmon said.
``We couldn't stand it up in the truck, so after we shrink-wrapped
it, we made a cradle for it and suspended it, like in a hammock. We
decided this year that 6 feet was tall enough.''

ANALYSIS: INDIAN POLITICS WORKING AGAINST NUCLEAR TEST BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Hindu nationalists who lead India's
government were trounced in state elections last week because of
their failure to deliver on pocketbook economic issues. But the
defeats, which weakened their already tenuous grip on power at the
national level, are also likely to make it more difficult for them
to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists, who lead an 18-party coalition
government, would face heavy political criticism from militants in
their Bharatiya Janata Party, as well as from their victorious
opponents in the Congress Party, if India signed the test ban
treaty without securing what could be sold at home as a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sign it is not an easy thing, especially for a government
which enjoys a paper-thin majority and has its own domestic
problems,'' said Pramod Mahajan, a senior leader in the party.
``The United States has to give something to this government so it
can say, `Look what we got for it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since first India and then Pakistan conducted underground
nuclear tests in May, India has engaged in long talks on
nonproliferation and security issues with U.S. officials, who felt
betrayed by India's action and imposed economic sanctions on both
India and Pakistan after the tests.
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been no breakthrough despite more than 50 hours
of discussions in seven diplomatic rounds between India's envoy,
Jaswant Singh, and President Clinton's representative, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. It is not clear that the eighth
round, scheduled for January in New Delhi, will be any more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is to address Parliament
next week on the status of the talks with the United States and the
negotiations on the test ban treaty, officials in his
administration said Thursday. Talbott spelled out the U.S. position
three weeks ago in an article he wrote for The Times of India.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the Indians to sign the test ban treaty,
to stop producing materials for nuclear weapons and to hold the
development and deployment of nuclear-tipped missiles to the lowest
possible levels, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians want a complete lifting of economic sanctions and
the freedom to develop what they term a minimum, credible nuclear
deterrent, according to Brajesh Mishra, principal secretary and
national security adviser to Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Since November Indian and Pakistani officials have been doing
one thing the United States had requested of the adversaries, and
that is to talk to each other in a series of formal meetings. But
the meetings have yet to yield much fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton recently lifted some of the sanctions on
the two nations to reward them for steps they have taken to reduce
tensions in the region. For instance, Clinton decided to allow U.S.
banks to lend money to their governments.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also exercised his discretion to lift more of the
sanctions on Pakistan than on India _ a step that angered leaders
in both the Bharatiya Janata and Congress parties here and that may
complicate future efforts to sell the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States decided that Pakistan was such an economic
basket case that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
should be allowed to resume lending to it in hopes of restoring
stability there, while such loans to economically stronger India
should continue to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discriminatory attitude creates an unhelpful atmosphere
in India,'' Mishra said in an interview Thursday. ``And it creates
problems for a smooth dialogue between India and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahajan, the Hindu nationalist leader who serves in Parliament,
was less diplomatic about what he described as the unequal
punishments meted out to the two countries. ``If you made a law,''
he said ``that you would hang someone for murder and then you say,
`I won't hang him because he's thin, but I'll hang him because he's
strong,' what kind of law is that? A murder is a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vajpayee may find that signing the treaty entails
significant political risks, he is also in need of accomplishments
that show he can govern effectively. His central political task in
the coming months will be to win back the public's confidence by
bringing down the prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Their
high prices led to his party's devastation at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But his administration has also put its prestige on the line
with the high-profile negotiations over nuclear issues with the
United States. The political challenge for Vajpayee is to change
the nature of the debate here on the test ban treaty. He has
already said publicly that India learned enough from the nuclear
tests in May to make further testing unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the treaty is still widely seen here as part of an unfair
effort by the big nuclear powers to keep the rest of the world out
of their club. Vajpayee has bitterly referred to the status quo
before India tested as ``nuclear apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   His primary opposition, the Congress Party, opposed the test ban
treaty when it was in power in the mid-1990s. Its position was that
the nuclear powers should agree to a scheduled series of steps
toward nuclear disarmament before India would sign.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, which won three major state elections last week, has
not taken a position on the treaty since the nuclear tests, but its
leaders could depict a decision to sign as capitulation to American
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans continue to say, `We will unilaterally dictate
the role of nuclear weapons in your defense strategy,''' said Mani
Shankar Aiyar, spokesman for the Congress Party. ``It becomes very
difficult for any Indian government to put a signature on a piece
of paper for something that the American government wants that is
not perceived to be for Indian security.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishra, Vajpayee's security adviser, said he still believed that
the political obstacles to India's becoming a party to the test ban
treaty can be overcome if his country's core security needs are
met.
</P>
<P>
   India has promised never to use nuclear weapons first, he said,
but wants its adversaries to know that it would retaliate if
nuclear weapons were used against India. To achieve that, he said,
India needs the ability to develop missiles and the means to
deliver them. So far, he said, the United States has not given
India the room it needs to do so.

   MIAMI _ The way some residents tell it, the area on the edge of
the Everglades National Park known as East Everglades can have all
the charm of a swamp _ flooding, mosquitoes, remoteness. But the
same residents describe the bright side of the neighborhood as
``magical'' and ``breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The privacy, the quality of the air, the low noise, the
safety, the spiritual contact with nature,'' said Jose Exposito,
38, an East Everglades resident and the owner of an orchid
business, ``it's just a way of life you don't find anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That way of life is about to end for the area, about 25 miles
west of Miami. Exposito's rural neighborhood, government officials
say, stands as one of the obstacles to a comprehensive effort to
repair the vast expanse of wetlands that is the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the South Florida Water Management District, the
agency that oversees flood protection and water supply for 16
counties, voted last month to spend about $120 million to buy out
the 1,400 landowners in East Everglades area by the year 2002.
Those who refuse to sell will have their properties condemned,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the water management agency say plans are for most
of the area of 6,000 acres, or eight and a half square miles, to
have continuous standing water once the residents are gone, as they
try to restore the flow of water to the Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of these crucial components'' for restoration,
said Mark Kraus, conservation director for the Everglades office of
the National Audubon Society, ``and the people living in the area
are victims of circumstance. We support the plan for buyout but we
know there's a human factor here and there ought to be fair
treatment, including relocation costs.''

   East Everglades neighbors say money does not begin to compensate
them for wiping out their homes and businesses, which started
developing in the 1950s. The area, an eclectic collection of small
farms, ranches and cement-block homes on plots of several acres,
oozes self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   There are no government services such as trash collection or
door-to-door mail delivery, and if a house should catch fire,
residents say, it would probably burn down before firefighters
could reach it on the pothole-filled dirt strips they call roads.
</P>
<P>
   But residents say all troubles are forgotten at the sight of an
Everglades sunset or with the feeling of independence that comes
with their isolation. Among the residents, most of Hispanic
descent, are breeders of birds, fish and snakes, growers of
tropical crops like mamey, papaya guava, and those who assert their
privacy with signs like, ``No Trespassing. Sniper on Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some fences also feature signs reading, ``This land and my
life are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses include Exposito's Soroa Orchids Inc., whose motto,
``an exquisite encounter with nature,'' is a promise he said he
might not be able to keep somewhere else. And neighbors include
Berta and Humberto Valdes, who built their 2,800-square-foot home
in 1979 as a haven to raise five sons and had planned to grow mamey
trees to support their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compensate 20 years of a lifetime,'' said Mrs.
Valdes, 48, a teacher. ``We did everything right to build our
family house, our retirement house. Our future retirement income is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Everglades, the community has become a casualty of
what Everglades preservationists call a monumental environmental
mistake _ ditching and draining that started in 1947 as a
flood-control project mandated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It resulted in the loss of about half of the Everglades' four
million acres to agricultural production and urban development and
allowed rural communities like East Everglades to spring up even
outside flood protection zones.
</P>
<P>
   The project by the Army Corps of Engineers spurred growth in
South Florida, which today encompasses the state's most populous
counties. But the project also disrupted the natural southward
water flow that nourished plants and animals in the protected
Everglades and fisheries in Florida Bay, endangering an ecosystem
unlike any other in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To try to undo the damage, federal and state officials announced
in October the comprehensive $8 billion plan, which is subject to
congressional approval. It calls for reconstructing the flood
control system and acquiring land to recapture through new
reservoirs and channels most of the fresh water that is now
channeled to the sea and to help restore the slow flow of water
that seeped across the Everglades for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For that, government officials say they need to retake more than
200,000 acres of mostly agricultural land and a few populated
tracts, prominent among them East Everglades. The buyout in East
Everglades was authorized under restoration efforts that preceded
the proposed new plan, said officials of the Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the humans' turn to pay. Except for a narrow coastal
strip and some higher areas, most of South Florida at one time
belonged to the Everglades, environmentalists say. But even today,
they note, local governments are allowing development in areas that
are needed for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development pressure is just enormous,'' said Alan Farago,
conservation chairman of the Sierra Club's Miami Group. ``The
Sierra Club considers urban sprawl the worst environmental problem
we have. We're dealing with an almost intractable local political
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many East Everglades residents and their supporters said that as
nature lovers they would understand the need to give the land back
to the Everglades in order to insure its health. But many refuse to
believe that their displacement is necessary to restore water flow
to the Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some note that the Army Corps of Engineers had proposed at one
time a less costly alternative _ building a levee around the area
to allow it to survive as more water was released into the park.
Richard Bonner, a deputy district engineer for the Army Corps in
Florida, said state officials had decided against that option for
fear that such protection would induce more population growth and
ultimately become more of a barrier to getting water to the park.
``Controlling growth is tough,'' Bonner said. ``It's hard to keep
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many neighbors are suspicious of the government's motives for
deciding to dislocate them, and some even accuse the water
management district of manipulating levees and dikes to
periodically flood the area on purpose to get them out, an
accusation that agency officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is flooding them out,'' said John Neuharth, a district
spokesman. The South Florida Water Management District had already
been buying property from willing sellers in recent years _ 16
parcels have been acquired _ as it grappled with what to do about
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony over the current plan underscores the pain involved
in the displacement of hundreds of residents and doubts that any
sale price would ever make them whole again. Many East Everglades
homes were rebuilt or underwent major repairs after the area was
hit by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Among Cuban residents, there are
comparisons to the land confiscations they suffered under Cuba's
Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Neuharth said that the agency was getting many calls from
willing sellers. But many homeowners are also digging in their
heels. Ms. Valdes, who heads a loosely organized homeowners'
association, says most residents do not want to sell and are
consulting with lawyers. Some residents have closed their doors to
government appraisers making the rounds in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Hector and Georgina Beceiro, a retired couple who moved into the
area in 1975, spending five years building their house on two and a
half acres, where they grow plantains and tangerines, say it will
take a court order to get them out. The ashes of her father, who
once lived with them, are scattered around the property according
to his wishes, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 67,'' said Beceiro, a retired salesman. ``Do you know what
it's like to have to start over at 67? Can the government pay me
for all the hours of work over 23 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Fortin, 48, a nurse, said she checked with state and
Miami-Dade County officials before she bought her home only four
years ago and was told there were no plans to acquire the land. She
said she wanted quiet, having lived in a noisy apartment, and now
has a view of a saw-grass prairie from her rooftop and sees white
ibis, egrets and storks in her yard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fortin accuses government officials of lies and double-talk
and says that because the residents have been pitted against the
Everglades, their plight has little sympathy from the public. If
forced to sell, she vowed, ``I'd move away and give up my
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes my breath away that they're doing this to us,''
she said. ``If they can do this to us they can do this to anyone.''

TNT FILM TRIES TO UNLOCK MAGICIAN'S LORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than 70 years after his death, Harry Houdini
remains our most famous magician, his name still a synonym for the
astonishing escape.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to somehow worm out of straitjackets, prison cells
and sealed water tanks created an enduring myth little dimmed since
his 1926 death, not from a failed stunt but a ruptured appendix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houdini,'' the made-for-TV movie about the magician that
premieres at 8 tonight on TNT, explains some of Houdini's secrets,
but it also takes some unexpected, even unlikely leaps that
nonetheless provide a substantial emotional payoff.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, writer-director Pen Densham's script holds that
Houdini's most impressive escape might just have occurred after he
died.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is constructed around flashbacks by his wife
(``Chicago Hope's'' Stacey Edwards) and other close associates at a
seance in a Hollywood theater, conducted during a live radio
broadcast 10 years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Those flashbacks fill in the magician's life, starting as a poor
immigrant youth whose father died while he was still a teen,
forcing the lad to work as a sweatshop cloth cutter to support his
emotionally distant mother and his younger brother (Mark Ruffalo).
</P>
<P>
   His brother's discovery of a book by magician Jean-Eugene
Robert-Houdin started Ehrich Weiss (``That Thing You Do!'s''
Johnathon Schaech) on the road into illusion, and gave him the
inspiration for his stage name.
</P>
<P>
   It shows how he met his wife at a vaudeville audition and how
they eventually persuaded Martin Beck (George Segal) to become
their manager after Houdini concocted a death-defying escape stunt
that riveted a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Densham (``Moll Flanders'') sets for himself a difficult
narrative task, trying to show the basis for Houdini's tortured,
sometimes explosive personality and quirks (he used a former
electric chair as his den chair). Surprise, surprise, it was
because his mother never told him she loved him.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to show Houdini's inner life is the most difficult
and least satisfying part of an otherwise engaging film. Movies as
a medium struggle to portray the mind's inner workings, and Densham
is only moderately successful in this regard. But it helps explain
other parts of Houdini's life _ and death.
</P>
<P>
   His absence at his mother's death led him to try to contact her
through spiritualists. But he soon became disillusioned, believing
that they were frauds, and dedicated much of his later life to
unmasking them, sparking hundreds of libel suits.
</P>
<P>
   At his own deathbed, however, Houdini promises his wife that if
he can, he will escape one more time and contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Densham said the series of seances that Mrs. Houdini then held
during the next decade to contact her dead husband really occurred,
as did a climactic one on Halloween night on Hollywood Boulevard
(where a seance is annually held each year since in commemoration).
And for a time, Mrs. Houdini did say she had contacted her husband
in a seance before disavowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Perlman plays the medium who attempts to contact Houdini
two decades after his death, and there is a scene where she appears
to contact the spirit of someone who claims he would find an escape
from the great beyond if one possibly existed.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the other events of that night really happened as
the movie portrays them, Densham won't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can look at it three ways: Either he dreamed it, or
she dreamed it, or it really happened,'' Densham said. ``I have my
own theory, but I'd prefer not to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch the movie yourself. The acting is uniformly good, and the
story is well done, if not a perfect evocation of an interesting
life. But with a dramatic payoff in the end, Densham has pulled his
own death-defying escape.

MAN'S DISCOVERY OF YANKEE GUNBOAT CONFIRMED; EXCAVATION DENIED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN MAKEIG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SABINE PASS, La. _ Pentecostal preacher Bruce Lockett gets
almost starry-eyed as the dozen white plastic tubes come into clear
view not far from the old Sabine Pass lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been searching for this for two years,'' he explained,
standing on the bow of the tugboat The Legacy. ``And now we're
close to finding two others, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The white tubes sticking out of the muddy water are markers set
up by Lockett's Texas Archaeological Studies Association that has
prowled the Louisiana side of the Sabine River in search of the
sunken remains of the USS Dan, an old Yankee gunboat.
</P>
<P>
   What has Lockett, 49, excited nowadays is a letter he received
from a Louisiana archaeologist, Dr. Chip McGimsey, verifying that
beneath the dozen plastic markers does, indeed, lies the USS Dan.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would have a hard time getting thrilled about a
bunch of lumber and two rusted cannons that have been buried under
a mound of oyster shells a few feet underwater for 135 years, but
Lockett is no mere passerby.
</P>
<P>
   He admits to being obsessive about the USS Dan, saying there is
something ``addictive'' about digging around in Civil War history
and actually finding something worthwhile. He started off years ago
reading historical accounts about the Alamo and since has evolved
into a fan of shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of them hereabouts, but Lockett is focused
wholly on the Union and Confederate wrecks around Sabine Point, in
particular the USS Dan, the paddlewheeler that terrorized the
rebels along the Sabine River until it finally was destroyed Jan.
8, 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Lockett and his 65-member band of amateur archaeologists have
been wading in the mud on the Louisiana side of the river and
getting a big thrill every time they uncover an old bottle or a
rusty scrap of metal.
</P>
<P>
   What others might consider worthless junk are, to Lockett and
his group, priceless artifacts containing clues to the past. They
treasure the chunks of coal that came off the USS Dan, long pieces
of metal plate, wooden remnants of the paddlewheeler and nails with
square tops.
</P>
<P>
   If they get formal permission from the state of Louisiana to
begin further excavations, they no doubt will be ecstatic if they
find the USS Dan's Parrott cannons, its bell and whistle. They
could even find the bones of Yankee troops killed when the gunboat
sank.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas rules on historic shipwrecks, people are not
supposed to disturb even the silt around the wreckage. Louisiana's
rules, according to Lockett, allow amateur archaeologists to dive
and poke around until they find actual wreckage, and then the state
must be notified before anything is removed.
</P>
<P>
   McGimsey and Texas Historical Commission officials say they have
appreciated having Lockett and his workers find the USS Dan, but
beyond that telling him to let well enough alone has been
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to excavate it,'' McGimsey said.
</P>
<P>
   That hardly deters Lockett, who has grand plans about restoring
the vessel and sailing it around. That would require countless
hours of work and permits from the Navy Department and Louisiana.
It might cost $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the USS Dan was among the Confederacy's last
hurrahs.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel originally was a cotton-hauling paddleboat, 199 feet
long and weighing 112 tons, that cruised the Sabine River. Once the
Civil War started, the equipment-hungry Confederacy confiscated the
Dan along with other ships and the Union began blockading Southern
ports to keep out supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1862, after chasing the Confederate paddlewheeler around for
weeks, Union troops found it hidden in a bayou and took it over
without firing a shot. One of their first actions was installing
twin Parrott guns on the bow. The guns had rifled bores and fired
rounds that had twice the range of the cannonball-firing Southern
guns and exploded on impact.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Dan could blithely sail up the Sabine River and shoot up
Sabine City and Southern positions without worrying about getting
hit by the weaker Confederate weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the USS Dan had barely arrived here before it caught a
Southern blockade runner, the Mary Ann, and burned it up. Then it
caught two more Confederate ships, the Conchita and the Eliza.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Dan spent the next three months annoying and harassing
Confederate troops and civilians living in Sabine City.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1862, exasperated rebel cavalrymen began firing
rifles at the gunboat. The next day, troopers from the USS Dan
retaliated by burning down a sawmill and homes in the area. A few
days later, they burned down Confederate barracks and stables.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly unhappy over all this, Confederate First Sgt. H.N.
Connor got permission to go directly after the pesky USS Dan that
was causing so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On their third try, Connor and his soldiers sneaked through a
fog bank and found the USS Dan anchored not far from the lighthouse
across from Sabine Point.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling alongside, they used torches to set the gunboat afire.
The Confederates pulled back to safe distance and watched for an
hour as the USS Dan burned down to its waterline. The blast that
accompanied the explosion of the USS Dan's magazine must have been
gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing from the October 22, 1863 Harper's Weekly suggests
that the better-known Battle of Sabine Point _ one of the final
bright moments of the war for Dixie _ was fought on the river close
to where the USS Dan had sunk nine months before.
</P>
<P>
   In the Battle of Sabine Pass, a Houston saloon keeper,
Confederate First Lt. Dick Dowling and 47 other Irish immigrants,
using cannons, routed a force of 26 Union vessels carrying more
than 4,000 troops intent on capturing Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling became a serious Confederate hero by sinking two ships,
killing 30 Yankee troops and capturing 350 more. What they
accomplished was to keep Texas from being invaded by Union troops.
</P>
<P>
   All this is background for Lockett, who combs such accounts
looking for wreck locations. From the Battle of Sabine Pass
stories, he now is hot to locate two Union blockade vessels, the
Morning Light and the Velocity.
</P>
<P>
   It was while looking for the Morning Light's location, in fact,
that Lockett found the clues that led to the USS Dan. &QL;

DON KING BACK IN THE FRAY IN ATLANTIC CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ Don King returns to Atlantic City Saturday night
with a band and a bang.
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight years since King last promoted a boxing match
in New Jersey. He had been banned from doing business with the
state's casinos in 1990 following a federal indictment on insurance
fraud charges. Never convicted, King nevertheless had his
promoter's license revoked in New Jersey while he battled the
government through a hung jury and finally an acquittal in a
retrial this year. Now he is back with a card that could produce
fireworks at the new Atlantic City Convention Center, a building
that was not even standing when King last ran a show on the
Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   With King will come two-time junior bantamweight champion Johnny
Tapia, newly crowned World Boxing Association welterweight champion
James Page, two fierce opponents, and a marching band empowered to
launch what King called ``a homecoming parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be a total American again,'' King said after
having his license reinstated. ``This is like a homecoming. It'll
be like a pep rally for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your presumption of innocence is denied, you can throw
bricks, but that changes nothing. I'm sensitive now to the fact an
allegation can end your existence in New Jersey. That's why I got
to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some good can come of this. Maybe an unreasonable
situation will be corrected for those who come after me. Maybe this
rule will be revisited, revised, reassessed, and removed from their
books because of what happened to me. The only way you can cure an
evil is to expose it to the light of day. That's why I'm back. I'm
back to let New Jersey see the kind of fights I can put on here.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind he's putting on Saturday night could be hot flashes of
violence if they go according to form. In the first, Page defends
his 147-pound WBA title for the first time since he won the then
vacant crown by stopping No. 1 contender Andrei Pestriaev with one
thunderous hook to the head two months ago in Paris. No one
expected Page to do what he did there when he lifted his record to
22-3 and kept his five-fight winning streak alive. But Saturday
night he will be in with an even tougher opponent, who was supposed
to fight Pestriaev in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Lopz (42-3-2, 33 knockouts) is one of the toughest
welterweights in the world, a guy who won the World Boxing
Organization title in 1996 by destroying Eamonn Loughran in one
round and twice had then-WBA champion Ike Quartey on the deck
before fighting him to a technical draw.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was supposed to have fought Pestriaev, but King's
behind-the-scenes maneuverings with WBA officials blocked that
until Lopez's lawyers went to court and forced the WBA to at least
make Lopez Page's mandatory challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lopez is back for another shot at a title he thinks he
already won once. Because of that, he fervently believes he will do
unto Page what Page did unto Pestriaev. An old ally in his corner,
trainer Lou Duva, refused to disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Page is a pretty good puncher,'' Duva said this week. ``But my
guy is a good puncher with guts. Lopez can be a hell of a fighter
on the nights he wants to be one. (Oscar) De La Hoya has already
said he won't even get in the ring with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand how strong this kid is. He cold-cocked Yory
Boy (Campas, the current International Boxing Federation 154-pound
champion). He can do the same to Page.''
</P>
<P>
   WBA bantamweight champion Nana Yaw Konadu intends to do the same
to Tapia in the main event. Tapia is one of the most gifted
fighters in the ring today, but at 115 pounds, he has gone all but
unnoticed except on the nights he's had run-ins with the law. Early
in his career, there were as many of them as there were fights in
well-lit arenas. But Tapia has righted himself in recent years
despite a mercurial personality that has caused a half-dozen top
trainers to come and go.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Freddie Roach of Dedham, Mass., will be in his
corner when Tapia moves up 3 pounds from junior bantamweight after
having defended the WBO's version of the 115-pound title 13 times
since winning it from Henry Martinez in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia also won the IBF junior bantamweight title with a
surprisingly efficient 12-round decision over heavily favored Danny
Romero a year and a half ago. Since then, Tapia has twice fought at
the bantamweight limit before King finally maneuvered him into a
position to challenge the hard-punching Konadu.
</P>
<P>
   Konadu (39-3-1, 32 KOs) is as heavy-handed as Page and Lopez,
having first won the title in 1996 by stopping Veerapol Sahaprom,
then losing it in his first defense, only to win it back again a
year ago in the same knockout fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Konadu is a product of Ghana who not surprisingly believes Tapia
is too small to adequately test him before the hammer falls. That
might, but Tapia is undefeated in 46 fights for a reason. He is
resourceful, resilient, and reactionary, and all three
characteristics might be of use to him against the rocket launching
of Konadu. They certainly didn't hurt his promoter these past eight
years.

ANOTHER CHAPTER FOR TONY BENNETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tony Bennett has thought about writing his life
story from time to time during his 50 years in show business. But
the stories Bennett wanted to tell _ memories of his loving family,
tales from the recording studio and thousands of concert
appearances, lessons learned from friends famous and otherwise _
didn't interest most publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to write a scandal book and snitch on my
friends and enemies,'' Bennett says with a laugh. ``I always said,
`No, thank you.' It's not like I really felt the need to write a
book anyway. I've always kind of concentrated on today and then
loosely sketched out the future. And I've been so busy that I've
never really had time to retrogress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett found the time when Simon &AMP; Schuster approached him last
year and pitched an idea. Write a book, call it ``The Good Life''
(after one of the many songs Bennett made famous) and include
whatever stories you want. Bennett agreed, and once he got going
with co-author Will Friedwald, he realized just how much living he
had packed into his 72 years on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not slowing down much, either. Bennett and his beaming
smile seem to be everywhere you turn these days. Switch on the
television and Bennett is singing with Elmo (of ``Tickle Me'' fame)
on VH1's ``Storytellers'' series and taking calls on another
edition of A&AMP;E's ``Live by Request.'' His latest album, a
collection of songs for young and old called ``The Playground,''
has been selling well, as has ``The Good Life,'' which hit
bookstores last month. It's enough to give a fan's Visa check-card
(another current Bennett promotion) a serious case of meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Singing remains Bennett's first love. He continues to tour the
world (he'll be at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on
Saturday and the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert Dec. 13),
performing many of the same songs he was singing for audiences when
Harry Truman was in the White House. Bennett's emphasis now, as it
was then, is on quality. He will not sing a song that he doesn't
love. It's a commitment that ensures that the material as well as
the enthusiasm is always top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that from my mom,'' Bennett says in his smoky
speaking voice. ``During the Depression, she would take in dresses
to sew. The more she sewed, the more money she would make. And we
needed the money because my father was ill, and there were three of
us children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, at least twice a day my mom would take a dress and
throw it off to the side and say, `I will not work on a bad dress.'
And funny enough, that became part of my education. When I went
into music, I found myself bucking all these producers who wanted
me to sing cheap songs so they could make a fast buck. Me, I just
wanted to build a catalog and have everything sound right. And it
was all because of my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Bennett (then named Anthony Dominick Benedetto _ Bob
Hope gave him his stage name) formed many other lifelong traits
during his early years in Queens, N.Y. Even though his father died
of congestive heart failure when he was 10, Bennett remembers his
childhood as a wonderful time full of sunny optimism and loving
relatives who encouraged him to pursue his love for performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I've traveled around the world and hung around
museums and musicians and painters trying to learn things on a
daily basis,'' Bennett says. ``But in writing the book, I realized
that everything I've ever learned came from my family, the people
who made a circle around myself and my brother and sister and
inspired us to follow our dreams. It's funny, because as a young
man, I really thought everyone was optimistic about things. I mean,
why be any other way?''
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 years have marked something of a rebirth in
Bennett's illustrious career. Bennett himself never changed. But
his son, Danny, found a way to market his father in ways that
bridged the generation gap. The culmination of that effort was an
MTV special four years ago in which Bennett drew standing ovations
from an audience of people who weren't born when his biggest hit,
``I Left My Heart in San Francisco,'' reached the top of the charts
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Says Danny, who assumed control of his father's career in 1979:
``I told him, `Look, marketing isn't a bad word.' Tony wanted to do
his music, and he had grown up with the premise that you perform
for the entire family. He told me, `I hate the notion of
demographics. Why can't I be on MTV?' And he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his new album, ``The Playground,'' Bennett is singing
for an even younger audience, successfully proving something he has
always believed _ great music is timeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '50s, I played the Paramount Theatre in New York,
and there were at least three distinct audiences coming to see the
shows,'' Bennett says. ``In the morning we had kids, and in the
afternoon the senior citizens would come in. Then in the early
evening, I'd perform for the young lovers and married couples. I
did the same show for everyone, and everyone enjoyed it. It's like
Duke Ellington said, quoting Toscanini: ``Music is either good or
it isn't. It's not someone's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has no plans to slow down any time soon. Next year, he's
planning to record an album of Duke Ellington songs to mark the
composer's 100th birthday. He's traveling to Australia and New
Zealand in January and will bring his show to Europe later in the
spring. When he's not performing, Bennett can usually be found
pursuing his other love, painting, always requesting a hotel room
with a view so he can sketch new scenes on his pad. And he's
continuously refining his music, boasting that he never sings a
song the same way twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ambition has always been to get better and better,''
Bennett says. ``One of my heroes is Hokusai, the Japanese print
artist. He used to call himself `the mad old painter.' But he
really changed the whole history of art, and he got better as he
got older _ simpler, more beautiful. That's what I'm trying to do,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Frank Sinatra (whom Bennett repeatedly calls
``my best friend''), some critics have crowned Bennett the living
king of pop singers. Bennett wants no part of it, saying he is
content to be one of the best instead of the one of the biggest.
Besides, he misses Sinatra. The singer's death left Bennett feeling
a little lonely and remembering friends like Judy Garland, Count
Basie and Louis Armstrong who are no longer with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Frank was always there, always encouraging me and
staying optimistic through good times and bad,'' Bennett says.
``There wasn't a performance he gave where he didn't mention my
name and tell people that they should come see me. He really was a
magnificent friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett will continue to pay tribute to these friends and count
his own blessings in the one place he truly calls home _ on the
stage, with a microphone in his hand. &QL;

 &HT;    Better investigations help snuff out high number of church
arsons
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More thorough investigations and tougher prosecutions
have significantly cut the number of church arsons over the last
two years, a top official with the U.S. Department of the Treasury
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   James Johnson, Treasury's undersecretary for enforcement, said
during a visit to Atlanta that since the National Church Arson Task
Force was formed in mid-1996 in response to concern over the number
of churches being burned, church fires have decreased by about 30
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, fires were reported at 297 churches nationwide, 119
with predominantly black congregations and 178 others.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the total dropped to 208 fires, 53 at black churches
and 155 at other churches.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 8, 1998, 114 church fires were reported, only 28
at black churches. Those numbers represent fires that were
investigated as arson, bombings or attempted bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to prevent additional fires and to bring those
responsible to justice and that is being done,'' said Johnson, who
is also co-chairman of the task force and oversees the
investigative efforts of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms on church arsons.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the task force has opened 690 investigations of
church fires, about 230 of which have been closed with the arrests
of 320 people.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest rate in cases investigated by the task force, 34
percent, is more than double the 16 percent national average in
other arson cases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who presented these figures during a speech to the
National Church Burning Status meeting in Atlanta this week,
reiterated previous findings that there is no evidence of a
nationwide conspiracy in the church arsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that only a handful of fires actually
involved conspiracies of more than two or three people, the largest
one being about five,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Motives for the arsons were widely varied in the roughly 30
percent of the cases in which a motive could be determined,
according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from racism to insurance fraud to bias against
religion to mental instability of the arsonists.

AMERIACN EAGLE BUYING BUSINESS EXPRESS AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business Express Airlines, New England's largest regional air
carrier, said Friday it is being bought by American Eagle, the
commuter-airline affiliate of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, by a Philadelphia investment firm that rescued
Business Express from bankruptcy in 1997, could radically alter
commercial aviation in the region, people familiar with the
industry said, as American Eagle makes expected changes.
</P>
<P>
   The price paid to Dieling, Schreiber &AMP; Park was not disclosed.
The investment group took over ownership in May 1997, settling a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding begun when Business Express
defaulted on aircraft lease payments in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With 330 flights daily out of Boston and LaGuardia Airport in
New York, to points as diverse as Philadelphia; Washington, DC;
Presque Isle, Maine; and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Business Express
draws most of its passengers from arrangements it has with
American, Delta Air Lines, and Northwest Airlines, to provide
connecting service to smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether Delta and Northwest will continue
that relationship once the American Airlines unit that operates
American Eagle, AMR Eagle Holding Corp., takes over Business
Express. ``We would like to maintain those,'' an AMR Eagle
spokesman said, for the ``significant revenues'' they provide.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, N.H., where Business Express displays Delta's
emblem at its check-in counter, airport director Alfred Testa Jr.
said the deal ``has implications on implications.'' Even with no
other changes, he said, it marks the first time American has ever
had a formal presence north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangor, Maine, where Delta earlier announced it is ending its
daily jet service to Atlanta and replacing it with commuter flights
to a Cincinnati hub, officials cheered. ``This plugs Bangor right
into a much larger network of schedules,'' Bangor International
Airport spokesman Jeff Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Dover, N.H., Business Express has about 1,200 full-time
employees, and, with 1.3 million passengers, was ranked as the 19th
largest US regional carrier last year. A spokeswoman said revenues
in 1997 were about $150 million but declined to disclose profits.
She said ridership this year is expected to exceed 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   American Eagle, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is the largest US
regional airline, reporting 12.1 million passengers in 1997 and
11.9 million for the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deal includes Business Express's schedules, route
system, operating certificate, and a fleet of 43 leased Saab 340
aircraft, each with 34 seats.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes 20 firm orders and 40 options Business Express
holds for Brazilian-made, 37-seat Embraer jet planes, scheduled for
delivery starting next August.

TEAMS TAKE THE FIELD WITH FIESTA BOWL IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Usually, game days in college football are clear-cut.
Winners, losers. Move on.
</P>
<P>
   Not this season. The controversial Bowl Championship Series
rankings have sent this message: While it's important whether you
win or lose, how you play the game also matters.
</P>
<P>
   All of that will come to some sort of conclusion this weekend,
beginning with Saturday three ``championship'' matchups involving
the three unbeaten teams who are vying for a spot in the Fiesta
Bowl Jan. 4 that will ostensibly determine the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Here No. 3 UCLA (10-0) will perform its final audition for one
of the two leading roles in the Fiesta Bowl when it takes on Miami
in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, No. 1 Tennessee (11-0) hopes to continue its
championship run with a victory over No. 23 Mississippi State (8-3)
in the Southeastern Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, No. 2 Kansas State (11-0) will try to persuade
both voters and computers that a win over Texas A&AMP;M (10-2) is good
enough to merit a trip to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The way it stands now, Kansas State, mainly because of a weak
nonconference schedule, is the odd team out, sitting at No. 3 in
the BCS rankings, which will come out for the final time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers crunchers who have studied the probabilities
should all three teams win are hedging on what the final BCS
rankings will reveal, saying it is too close to call and that any
of the three teams could finish No. 1 or No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand the system itself and the nuances,'' said
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder. ``But we do understand we're not
going to have any impact on how it all plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Kansas State, just like Tennessee and UCLA, will have a
big impact on how it plays out. If the Wildcats simply lose, they
will reduce the magic number of unbeaten BCS contenders to two.
</P>
<P>
   The odds say that is unlikely, since the Wildcats, Volunteers,
and Bruins are all double-digit favorites. If all win, the Fiesta
opponents would be determined based not only on how the coaches and
writers vote but also on computer printouts from Jeff Sagarin, the
New York Times, and the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   So complicated is the procedure that even the results of the
Western Athletic Conference championship game between Brigham Young
and Air Force and the Mid-American Conference championship game
between Toledo and Marshall could have an impact, since opponents'
records are factored into the calculations.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, Miami is simply the latest speed bump in a season
filled with them. But the Bruins, to their credit, have not even
been slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   With a 20-game winning streak, the Bruins are the hottest of the
three contenders in terms of sustained success. Not that they
haven't had scares _ a wild 41-38 win over Oregon and
come-from-behind victories over sub-.500 teams Stanford and Oregon
State have somewhat tarnished the Bruins' reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through some battles,'' said UCLA quarterback Cade
McNown, ``and come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Miami should not prove to be the stumbling block
that sends the Bruins to the Rose Bowl instead of the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are coming off a humiliating 66-13 loss to
Syracuse _ Miami's worst in more than 50 years _ and have beaten
only one team, West Virginia, with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   But being in the Orange Bowl and playing the role of spoilers
appeals to the Canes' sense of pride. ``You've got to get excited
about the chance to spoil their chances for a national
championship,'' said linebacker Dan Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, UCLA has drawn a bad hand here. The Miami game was
originally scheduled to be played in September, but Hurricane
Georges ripped through the region that weekend, causing a
cancellation that turned into a postponement when UCLA officials
agreed to reschedule the game for December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what happened last week in Syracuse, the Miami team UCLA
will see is much better than the one it would have faced in
September.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo knows what's at stake as well as anyone.
And although the consolation prize for losing or getting bumped out
of the Fiesta Bowl by the computers is the Rose Bowl, Toledo
desperately wants the Bruins to at least have a chance to play for
the national title.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the task is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to understand it's a one-game tournament now for
us,'' Toledo said. ``If we lose, we're out.''
</P>
<P>
   The same messages no doubt are being delivered by Tennessee
coach Phil Fulmer and by Kansas State's Snyder.

MCGINEST, COLLINS READY TO BOLSTER PATRIOTS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When you have the 20th-ranked defense and
the 28th-ranked pass defense in the NFL, you have to do something.
That something is under wraps, but it appears the Patriots will
take a different approach to their defensive game plan against the
Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who lost two heartbreaking games to the Steelers
last season, including a 7-6 decision in the AFC playoffs at Three
Rivers, are expected to get end Willie McGinest and linebacker Todd
Collins back, which could greatly bolster the defense.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest practiced Thursday and Friday and seemed ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good today,'' said McGinest, who has battled a chronic
groin injury. ``It's still a game-time decision, but the last two
days have been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said after practice, ``We got through it
pretty well. Willie looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   The personnel additions should make things flow. McGinest _ if
he plays and doesn't have a relapse, as he did in Buffalo _ should
improve the pass rush, which has produced two sacks in five games
and has put extra pressure on the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started being known for the blitz and stuff,'' said
defensive tackle Chad Eaton. ``We have to go back to what we do
best, whatever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, like Carroll and defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell, is
mum on just what ``it'' will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emphasis has turned,'' said Carroll. ``We're trying to
improve and make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety blitz stuff is just not catching people off
guard,'' he said. ``What do you do now? That might be what those
changes are about.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll did say every team from Pittsburgh to Pottsville now
uses the strong safety blitz. But while it's preferable to have
Lawyer Milloy blitzing the quarterback than a lot of other people
in the Patriots' defense, the pressure on Kordell Stewart could
come from elsewhere, like cornerbacks Tebucky Jones and Steve
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have some things to clear up,'' said Milloy,
``but we have a really good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Clay has been emphasizing this theme for a while: ``The
problem is they're spreading us out. We haven't been adjusting to
anybody. There are gonna be mismatches and they've found the
mismatches in our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense was fourth in the league after their 4-1
start, but it's been a free fall since then. In their last seven
games, the Patriots have allowed an average of 363 yards. Beyond
that, they have had only three fumble recoveries. Their
sacks-per-pass ratio is 27th in the league, they are 23d in
third-down efficiency, and they've had only two sacks in the last
five games.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Patriots have gone six games without having all
their front seven available.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wheeler remains sidelined with a knee sprain. Henry Thomas
has played almost a month with a sore left ankle. Chris Slade is
said to be returning to full health after a month of ankle
problems. McGinest has been in for four plays in six games. Brandon
Mitchell, an up-and-coming pass rusher, was sidelined for the
season just when it appeared he was coming on. Collins (groin) has
missed three games. Eaton missed one game, was hurt for two more,
but is now at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Patriots may be the healthiest they've been in
some time, and that, along with the changes, could restore their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think it would help, but it all depends at what
level do these guys return at?'' said Sidwell. ``With Willie, it
turned out he was reinjured early, so what good does that do us?
It's just something you have to wait and see what it feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares whether you have guys injured and playing out of
position. What they care about is, are you getting the job done?
We're a better team when we have all of our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell said stopping the Steelers starts with the battles up
front and ultimately containing Jerome Bettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get them into long third-down situations,'' said
Sidwell. ``That's the primary emphasis for us. In Pittsburgh, it
all starts with the run, so you have to stop that first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell, who did a tremendous job changing the Patriots' defense
last December to make it much more unpredictable, shrugged off talk
of major alterations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been basically doing the same things for most of the
season, so you'll only see us make a couple of subtle things that
the average fan won't even notice,'' he said. ``You never make
major changes at this time of the year. To do that would be
confusing and difficult for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   But tendencies can be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may try blitzing from a different side with a
different player at a different time. They may try more
containment, spending more time in the basic defense. Or they may
try an all-out zone blitz in an effort to beat the Steelers at
their own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do things for so long before people pick things
up,'' said Collins, who will back up Tedy Bruschi. ``You try to
time it up when they least expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, nobody's saying. What the Patriots are
acknowledging is that they're giving up too many yards, too many
big plays. And those things will get you killed in Pittsburgh.

HYUNDAI'S NEW SONATA   LOOKS GOOD, PRICED RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: fixes second reference to Chuck Halper in 2d graf.)  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hyundai rolled into the Museum of Transportation in Brookline,
Mass. to roll out its 1999 Sonata sedan for inspection by the New
England Motor Press. It looks good. It's priced right. The Korean
company is running hard to catch Japan, Europe, and Detroit in
quality while beating their ears off on price.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Halper, Hyundai's director of service,said the company
will ``concentrate on value and capitalize on quality improvement''
to improve its market position. Meanwhile, its Sonata is virtually
all new _ the cigar lighter is a carryover _ and while content has
gone up, Halper said, the price has not.
</P>
<P>
   (Content is a popular buzz word in the auto biz; it means the
standard equipment offered. When equipment is deleted, the car is
said to have been ``de-contented.'' To change equipment is to
``re-content'' while an upgrade is simply to ``add content.'' This
is all done in the name of ``adding value'' no matter which way the
contenting proceeds.)
</P>
<P>
   The standard version Sonata for '99 is available fairly well
equipped with a 2.4-liter 149-horsepower 16-valve I-4 engine and
5-speed manual transaxle for $14,999 plus $435 delivery. A 4-speed
automatic electronically controlled transaxle adds $800 to the
price. For the money you get front and side air bags, air
conditioning, AM/FM stereo/cassette, dual power mirrors, power
steering, tach, and power windows.
</P>
<P>
   If you require more, the GLS is available with a 170-horsepower,
24-valve 2.5-liter V-6 for $16,999 plus delivery with a 5-speed
manual, $800 more for the automatic. The GLS adds 4-wheel disc
brakes, heated mirrors, and some other niceties. Only the GLS
offers antilock brakes and traction control, and then only together
as part of a $3,225 option package including leather, power
moonroof, power driver's seat, and a CD player. That's still a lot
for the money, but it is viciously antisocial to tie availability
of vital safety options to purchase of nonvital, pricey luxuries.
After all, Hyundai's best customers are people on limited budgets
who can't afford pricey luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   The car looks good _ it's nicely styled _ offers reasonable room
for four adults, and appears well put together. The proof of the
pudding, as they say, is in the eating, so judgment is withheld
until after a taste test on the road.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The press announcements from Mazda about its Dec. 7 ``Out of the
Box'' awards party continue, bigger, bolder, and more informative.
In the latest installment, we learn that the six cutups listed here
last week are not the finalists; they are the judges. Previous
mailings failed to list the finalists (or the correct telephone
number).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finalists sound like interesting people who have
accomplished something, but I really have my doubts about Leanne
Schmidt, a Kentucky photographer whose specialty is requesting
subjects to disrobe and leap into a hot tub so that she ``can
photograph them tasetfully in the buff.'' Or the New Jersey guy
whose major contribution to World Civilization is breaking into the
``Guinness Book of Records'' for organizing 43,000 people to do
``The Chicken Dance.'' Honest, I'm not making this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   The info was accompanied by color photos, one of a very
attractive barefoot young woman clad in a ``tastefully'' low- cut
dress and lying atop a Mazda Protege. She was unidentified,
possibly because being very famous we're all supposed to know who
she is.
</P>
<P>
   So, what I'm anxious to know is why five people are willing to
come to a party in New York on Pearl Harbor Day for the chance to
be named oddball of the year by Dennis Rodman, undoubtedly an
expert on the subject _ and why do the other judges want to be seen
with this guy? And how does this sell cars?
</P>
<P>
   But this sort of ``Out of the Box'' publicity stunt is liable to
be one answer to the question: Why don't we automatically think
``great car'' when someone says ``Mazda''? After this escapade,
maybe General Electric should sue them for giving a light bulb a
bad name _ surely you remember GE's Mazda lamps?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CORRECTION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The telephone number listed last week for Hemmings Motor News
was incorrect. The correct number is 802-442-3101, or fax
802-447-1561, if you want one of their collectibles catalogs.

INTERNET MARGIN TRADES SUBJECT TO TIGHTER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic of maintenance requirement on 22 internet stocks
is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about wild swings in the prices of hot Internet
stocks, a number of brokerage houses said last week that they had
changed their rules so that investors who buy these stocks on
margin _ with money borrowed from the broker _ may have to put up
more of their own money to maintain their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The increases vary from firm to firm and don't apply to all
investors. And some brokerages have not changed their margin rules
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the recent big swings in prices of companies like
Ebay, Yahoo and Amazon.com led Salomon Smith Barney to raise its
``maintenance'' margin limit on 18 stocks to 40 percent from 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules originally set by the Federal Reserve Board,
customers who trade on margin must put up to 50 percent in cash or
securities to cover the initial transaction's market value. Stock
market officials, however, mandate that in order to maintain the
position, investors need only put up 25 percent of the holding's
value. But most brokerages have maintenance margins of 35 percent
on all stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. became the latest broker to
raise them. It said it had raised maintenance requirements on 22
Internet stocks to 50 percent, from 35 percent. But the rules will
not apply to all clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50 percent maintenance requirement will apply to those
accounts with highly concentrated positions in Internet stocks,''
Dan Hubbard, a Schwab spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new requirements would ``apply to a very, very small
percentage of the 5.4 million customer accounts here at Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the new minimums apply, this is how they will
work:
</P>
<P>
   Assume that a customer wants to buy one of the stocks on
Schwab's list on margin, and the current market value of the stock
is $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Fed's guidelines, the customer initially
would be required to put up $50 a share for the stock and take on
$50 worth of margin debt from Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of the stock falls 30 percent, to $70 a share, the
current market value of the customer's equity has fallen to $35 a
share. So the value of customer's equity has declined by 30
percent, too. His margin debt, meanwhile, has stayed constant, at
$50.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with Schwab's new maintenance requirements, a broker
will call the client and ask for $15 a share more to achieve the 50
percent maintenance level. Usually, clients are given several days
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much buying of these stocks is being done on
margin, or how many investors have been unable to meet margin
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any firm statistics, but the people who do trade
these stocks do tend to trade them on margin,'' said Melissa
Gitter, a spokeswoman for Waterhouse Securities, a brokerage
subsidiary of the Toronto Dominion Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Waterhouse has raised margin requirements
on 20 Internet stocks. While the firm never before increased the
requirements for so many stocks, the action was not unprecedented.
Its most recent increase involved biotechnology stocks in the early
1990s.

1999 ACURA 3.2TL: SMART CAR WITH A STUPID NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: corrects name of car to 3.2TL)  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology brings us wondrous things, not all of which are worth
the effort it takes to deal with them. For example, let us consider
the automobile navigation system, at once a wonder, a distraction,
a frustration, a convenience, and a hazard. The most sophisticated
among them rely on satellites aloft and computer hardware with a
prodigious bank of computer memory on the ground to pinpoint your
car's location on the planet within a couple of feet and guide you
unerringly to your destination. Yeah, right!
</P>
<P>
   Some systems are tied in to cellular telephone networks, can
detect trouble such as a crash or hijack and summon aid. Some are
just navigation tools. Today's case study is the Acura Navigation
System, this time installed on Acura's newest, the 1999 3.2TL, a
very smart car with a very stupid name.
</P>
<P>
   It is Thanksgiving morn and I am heading north to a dinner
appointment. Way north. I know the main route, the alternate
routes, the shortest of shortcuts as well as I know the way to my
refrigerator. So, what better test for a guidance system than to
match its electronic expertise against hard knowledge (and besides,
I carry a bulging map case that would make AAA envious). The
weather is . . . dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the ignition and the VCR in center dash wakes up,
displays Mother Earth aglow amid the twinkling firmament. Select
the menu and commence the exercise; punch in the destination a
letter at a time by touching the appropriate members of the
alphabet displayed on the screen. The computer Imp refuses to
recognize anything but York, Maine, which is not where I want to
go.
</P>
<P>
   I drive a bit, park, resume negotiation. Nada. I'll try later; I
do not have time to waste and I've already spent more time than it
would take to copy a Delorme map by hand. I select ``map'' and let
the illumined array track my progress _ my way.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a handsome four-door equipped to the nines _ the
navigation system is the only option offered. The car derives half
of its idiotic moniker from the 3.2-liter, 24-valve VTEC engine
under the hood, a quiet 225-horsepower mill that has one drawback;
if you try running on an interstate without using cruise control,
you are asking for a ticket _ the TL's a creeper, as in creep up
the speedometer dial. The 4-speed automatic transmission with its
fuzzy logic is already adapting to my driving style and the
handling is quick, precise. I like this car.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray, Maine, I have gained a little time in the light
traffic, stop to program a route _ success! The Imp admits to
knowing the whereabouts of Kingfield and the little animated arrow
points me north on Interstate 95. In Auburn, I pull onto Route 4 _
OK so far _ and then left onto East Hardscrabble heading for Hotel
Road. This is not exactly wilderness; it runs along the edge of an
airfield. But, I am off the ``digitized road,'' thank you _ as far
as the Imp is concerned, I am in Terra Incognita. Shades of Henry
the Navigator!
</P>
<P>
   The things this instrument knows _ in view of what I'm learning
it doesn't know _ are surprising. It recognizes Crash Road, not
where I really want to drive in the rain and it's raining. The
windows suddenly begin fogging up and I need to jack up the air
conditioning to clear them _ which means hitting the AC button next
to the screen, thus turning off the Navigator Imp and bringing up
the work order for the Comfort Elf. One must tap the appropriate
boxes on the illuminated screen to effect ``climate changes''
within and I might as well be trying to change the weather without.
Visibility clouds to urgency and I pull over while madly rubbing
the windshield with a sleeve. After a while, the climate control
begins to cooperate. I prefer knobs to this high-tech tactile
switching nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   At New Vineyard I notice a change in weather character _ snow is
falling and there is an accumulation of something viscous
underfoot, demanding a reduction in speed. But the Imp does guide
me into Kingfield. End of Test I.
</P>
<P>
   Test II is finding Rochester, N.H. You may recall that on a
previous encounter, it didn't seem to be listed. Today, it exists,
if you have time and patience enough to wade through all the
options offered before the Imp will recognize it. But the
Navigation Imp and I disagree mightily on how to travel there and
the Imp finally gets annoyed with the number of recalculations
asked and quits in a huff. Just as well; no matter how low I adjust
the screen illumination, it's still an annoying distraction glowing
at me.
</P>
<P>
   Test III is finding a route from the Globe to the Museum of
Transportation, a veritable urban maze that challenges the stoutest
of tourists. The Imp is on top of the game; he points me south to
Gallivan Boulevard, along Morton, the Arborway, directly to target
_ except the Imp miscounts the exits at a traffic circle. The
reverse is a flop. On exiting the museum, I am directed to go to
the ``designated route,'' which is undecipherable on the maze
presented _ you can zoom these little things into big things but
I'm in traffic now. And although I'm retracing the route in, I am
now ``off the route.''
</P>
<P>
   I reprogram for Rochester, N.H., and, am directed to make a
``slight left turn'' where there is no turn, then another ``slight
left turn,'' which is a Y intersection, and then I'm off the route.
Recalculate. This pattern continues until finally the Imp goes to
lunch and the map freezes. Somewhere on I-95, the system shuts down
and I am able to coax the Imp out of his snit and find South Main
in Rochester. The Imp succeeds but selects the wrong exit off the
turnpike from a traffic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, folks, are wonderful for negoiating
well-known dense urban areas _ boy, does the Imp know Portsmouth,
N.H., well! But, if it's to the boonies you are trekking, buy a
map, Bunkie. The Imp does not do boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.2TL &UR;  &LR; is roomy enough, has a decent trunk, some interior
storage and, with the exception of climate controls with the
navigation option, is fairly convenient to operate. At $27,950 plus
$455 delivery, without the Imp, it's the equal of some much
higher-priced iron. Add $2,000 for the navigation system if you
like expensive, aggravatiing toys _ but two grand would buy a heap
of maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura 3.2TL &UR;  &LR; scores on performance, luxury, handling, and
fuel economy; it delivered 26.44 miles per gallon over 928 measured
miles. Thus, it would seem to score fairly well on value, too.
</P>
<P>
   Final insults. It is overcast; I turn on the headlights and the
navigation screen goes dark, showing nothing but accumulated finger
smudges. No amount of fine-tuning the light levels and screen
brightness results in sufficient illumination. Good thing I know
how to get where I'm going. Coming home, the Imp plots the course,
guides me faithfully to within six miles, then falls asleep. I jar
him with the recalculation prod. Great car, lousy pathfinder.

`PSYCHO': THE MAMA'S BOY, HIS MOTEL GUEST AND THAT SHOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gus Van Sant's new color replica of ``Psycho'' opened without
advance screenings Friday, adopting Alfred Hitchcock's policy of
dodging reviews but neglecting some of his other, even better
marketing ideas. There was a time when no one could enter a theater
playing ``Psycho'' after the film had started. Today's audiences
can traipse freely, and at the theater I attended somebody even
made a loud cellular phone call just as the rest of us were bracing
ourselves for the shower scene. Anyway, the film's main suspense
revolved around a single question: now that room rent at the Bates
Motel is up to $36.50, what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the apparent rocks in Van Sant's head are mere
pebbles. If he isn't Hitchcock, neither is he crazy. His film is an
artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats
plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real
``Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom
diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most
brilliant blueprints. Those of us not quite ready to write off the
first film will gain little from learning that Norman keeps porn
magazines and toy soldiers in his once off-limits childhood
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   If the filmmaker is right in supposing that ``Psycho'' is most
widely remembered as that scary shower movie, here's a brief
reminder. A secretary named Marion Crane (originally Janet Leigh)
has a lover who won't marry her for financial reasons. So she
absconds with a pile of cash that has literally landed in her lap.
Eager to hide, Marion checks into a remote motel and winds up
having a powerfully disturbing effect on the proprietor. Then he
has an even more disturbing effect on her. Three other characters
(Marion's sister, lover and a private detective) begin
investigating Marion's disappearance. Norman, an amateur
taxidermist, has one scary mom watching all this from her perch
atop a hill.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' begins promisingly with bold green added to
the Saul Bass title sequence, a fuller sound to Bernard Herrmann's
unforgettable theme music (re-recorded by Danny Elfman) and Anne
Heche refreshingly cast in Marion's role. Ms. Heche, along with
Julianne Moore as her no-nonsense sister and William H. Macy as the
detective, is one of the players here who speak Joseph Stefano's
dialogue as if it were brand-new and who successfully recreate
their characters in present-day terms. (``Why?'' Ms. Heche asks
irritably, when a policeman asks to see her license and
registration.)
</P>
<P>
   This Marion is almost as demure as Ms. Leigh's, yet she's also
more headstrong and flirty. Aided this time by witty costume and
production design, she now sports orange underwear (in the opening
hotel scene), an orange paper parasol (at the car lot) and orange
nail polish to match her orange blood in the shower scene that Van
Sant has modified only slightly and ineffectually. Shots of roiling
clouds are now interjected into this famous sequence, and the stab
marks show up more.
</P>
<P>
   If this ``Psycho'' makes the most of its Marion, the same can't
be said of its Norman Bates. The absence of anything like Anthony
Perkins' sensational performance with that vitally birdlike
presence and sneaky way with a double-entendre (``A boy's best
friend is his mother'') is the new film's greatest weakness. While
Vaughn gives the role its share of creepiness, his beefy presence
and mechanical recitations also throw off the material's exquisite
balance. (The intriguing physical resemblances between the story's
matched pairs of characters have been eradicated.) And another of
Van Sant's new ideas, having Norman masturbate just before he kills
Marion, would seem to dispel the very tension that matters most to
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond having weakened two principal male characters (Viggo
Mortensen seems equally miscast as Marion's love, John Saxon's old
role, though he does seem more likely to be spending his life in a
hardware store) and greatly bolstered the women, Van Sant adds
extra ambient sound and a few more insect actors. (Fly and spider
wranglers get screen credit this time.) However interesting these
modifications are, they won't make ``Psycho'' any more
``Scream''-like for viewers who like fast, easy fright. It remains
the most structurally elegant and sneakily playful of thrillers. At
least some things never change.
</P>

THE MILITARY-TECHNOLOGICAL COMPLEX IS THRIVING IN ISRAEL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)

   JERUSALEM _ Young soldiers with automatic rifles slung across
their backs are a familiar sight here, defending the country's
borders, boundaries and bus stops. With few exceptions, mainly for
medical or religious reasons, conscription at age 18 is universal,
and almost all Israelis serve a term in the Israel Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft hasn't only provided manpower for national
security. It has also given birth to thriving civilian industries
built by entrepreneurs who gained invaluable technical skills,
leadership abilities and personal connections in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred new companies spring up every year in Silicon
Wadi, as the Israeli technology sector is sometimes called.
Analysts estimate that three-quarters of them grow directly out of
army service.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is arguably Israel's most important industrial
sector, accounting for a third of the country's exports and
absorbing half the foreign investment in the country. Electronics
exports totaled $5.7 billion in 1997 and are growing at 17 percent
a year; software exports, at $500 million in 1997, are growing at
25 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a proportion of its population, Israel has half again as many
scientists and engineers as the United States. Put them together
with the country's burgeoning venture capital industry, and the
result is an abundant crop of start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   One example is GEO Interactive Media Group, which makes
multimedia transmission software used by Web-site designers. Tzur
Daboosh, 32, and Sharon Carmel, 28, two of the founding partners,
met in the army in the late 1980s when both were working on
multimedia combat simulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gained experience in technologies that went to market five
or six years later,'' Daboosh said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after several other business ventures, the men teamed
up with another former army technical specialist, Eli Reifman, and
began turning out software in a Tel Aviv apartment. They brought in
a more experienced businessman, Naftali Shani, 49, to serve as
chairman, and took the company public in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Still a development-stage company, GEO lost $9.9 million in 1997
on just $3.1 million in sales. Its London-traded stock, which
peaked above $3 last summer, plummeted in late July when the
company warned that profits were being hampered by production
delays; it closed on Friday at 26.6 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Though its products have little direct military application, GEO
continues to benefit from its army links, and vice versa. Carmel
and Daboosh serve as reserve officers in technical units, teaching
young draftees software design and programming. And while they
teach, the two executives can scout the class for future hires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most able-bodied 18-year-old Israelis are drafted after
completing high school. Women serve a minimum of one year, nine
months; men spend a minimum of three years on active duty and
remain in the reserves until age 45, taking time out from civilian
life to serve 24 to 30 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious draftees compete furiously to gain assignment to the
military units where their experience will be worth most in later
life: army technology units, paratroop units and the air force.
``If you get in there, it's like getting a bachelor's degree in
computer science plus five years of work experience,'' said one
programmer who served in an electronics unit and now works at an
Internet telecommunications start-up.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, an impressive army profile on a resume carries weight
similar to that of an Ivy League degree in the United States.
Informal networks of veterans of special units open doors the way
alumni networks do for graduates of American colleges.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Joseph Ackerman got into the technology business.
After completing army service as a flight test engineer in 1975,
Ackerman was farming near Haifa when some army buddies persuaded
him to join Elbit Computer, now Elbit Ltd., to oversee one of its
new projects. He is now chief executive of Elbit's military
electronics business, which was spun off as a separate company,
Elbit Systems, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elbit Systems, which had $397 million in sales in the most
recent four quarters and is growing at about 10 percent a year,
makes a helmet-mounted display system that helps tank gunners and
combat pilots aim radar and missiles. The engineers who developed
the technology get to see it in action firsthand during their
annual reserve call-ups, Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   While the government restricts exports of some kinds of military
technology, it generally supports such trade. Domestic demand,
after all, is not large enough to support fully an industry it
wants to see thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ministry of Defense has a finger in this success, so it
can't be unhappy with it,'' said Aharon Beth-Halachmi, head of
Federman Enterprises, a management and investment firm.
Beth-Halachmi, an electrical engineer by training, capped a 30-year
army career as the ministry's chief administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Military technology was the first, and for many years the only
sector of Israeli industry with the technical sophistication to
develop globally competitive software and systems, said
Beth-Halachmi, whom the army sent to graduate school in the United
States in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Military experience also gives Israelis an eye for shortcuts and
a penchant for aggressive innovation, said Shaul Shai, 36, a
reserve major and executive vice president for marketing at Aladdin
Knowledge Systems, a security software maker based in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the IDF, there's a great imbalance between the size of
tasks that must be accomplished and the available resources,'' he
said. ``It's such a huge gap that one needs to think smart all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But military service is no panacea, and starting a company is
not the same as leading a fighter squadron, observed Shlomo Kalish,
founder and chief executive of Jerusalem Global, a technology
investment bank. Kalish spent five years flying combat jets in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a great CEO,'' he said, ``you have to be a natural
leader, and that can't be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Army veterans can be autocratic and somewhat inflexible,
especially when it comes to the culture of titles, said Eran Goren,
a reserve officer and the chief executive of Nessuah-Zannex, an
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   But while rank matters in the army, so does personal initiative,
said Shai, of Aladdin. And that, too, can cause problems, he said,
``when everyone thinks they're a general.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the army's approach seems to breed success in civilian
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned how to live with constraints, and that's an added
value,'' said GEO's Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Daboosh agreed: ``We learned flexibility in the army. The IDF is
huge, but it listens to young soldiers. Things were always
changing, which is good and bad, but very Israeli.''

HYUNDAI'S NEW SONATA   LOOKS GOOD, PRICED RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: fixes second reference to Chuck Halper in 2d graf.)  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hyundai rolled into the Museum of Transportation in Brookline,
Mass. to roll out its 1999 Sonata sedan for inspection by the New
England Motor Press. It looks good. It's priced right. The Korean
company is running hard to catch Japan, Europe, and Detroit in
quality while beating their ears off on price.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Halper, Hyundai's director of service,said the company
will ``concentrate on value and capitalize on quality improvement''
to improve its market position. Meanwhile, its Sonata is virtually
all new _ the cigar lighter is a carryover _ and while content has
gone up, Halper said, the price has not.
</P>
<P>
   (Content is a popular buzz word in the auto biz; it means the
standard equipment offered. When equipment is deleted, the car is
said to have been ``de-contented.'' To change equipment is to
``re-content'' while an upgrade is simply to ``add content.'' This
is all done in the name of ``adding value'' no matter which way the
contenting proceeds.)
</P>
<P>
   The standard version Sonata for '99 is available fairly well
equipped with a 2.4-liter 149-horsepower 16-valve I-4 engine and
5-speed manual transaxle for $14,999 plus $435 delivery. A 4-speed
automatic electronically controlled transaxle adds $800 to the
price. For the money you get front and side air bags, air
conditioning, AM/FM stereo/cassette, dual power mirrors, power
steering, tach, and power windows.
</P>
<P>
   If you require more, the GLS is available with a 170-horsepower,
24-valve 2.5-liter V-6 for $16,999 plus delivery with a 5-speed
manual, $800 more for the automatic. The GLS adds 4-wheel disc
brakes, heated mirrors, and some other niceties. Only the GLS
offers antilock brakes and traction control, and then only together
as part of a $3,225 option package including leather, power
moonroof, power driver's seat, and a CD player. That's still a lot
for the money, but it is viciously antisocial to tie availability
of vital safety options to purchase of nonvital, pricey luxuries.
After all, Hyundai's best customers are people on limited budgets
who can't afford pricey luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   The car looks good _ it's nicely styled _ offers reasonable room
for four adults, and appears well put together. The proof of the
pudding, as they say, is in the eating, so judgment is withheld
until after a taste test on the road.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The press announcements from Mazda about its Dec. 7 ``Out of the
Box'' awards party continue, bigger, bolder, and more informative.
In the latest installment, we learn that the six cutups listed here
last week are not the finalists; they are the judges. Previous
mailings failed to list the finalists (or the correct telephone
number).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finalists sound like interesting people who have
accomplished something, but I really have my doubts about Leanne
Schmidt, a Kentucky photographer whose specialty is requesting
subjects to disrobe and leap into a hot tub so that she ``can
photograph them tasetfully in the buff.'' Or the New Jersey guy
whose major contribution to World Civilization is breaking into the
``Guinness Book of Records'' for organizing 43,000 people to do
``The Chicken Dance.'' Honest, I'm not making this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   The info was accompanied by color photos, one of a very
attractive barefoot young woman clad in a ``tastefully'' low- cut
dress and lying atop a Mazda Protege. She was unidentified,
possibly because being very famous we're all supposed to know who
she is.
</P>
<P>
   So, what I'm anxious to know is why five people are willing to
come to a party in New York on Pearl Harbor Day for the chance to
be named oddball of the year by Dennis Rodman, undoubtedly an
expert on the subject _ and why do the other judges want to be seen
with this guy? And how does this sell cars?
</P>
<P>
   But this sort of ``Out of the Box'' publicity stunt is liable to
be one answer to the question: Why don't we automatically think
``great car'' when someone says ``Mazda''? After this escapade,
maybe General Electric should sue them for giving a light bulb a
bad name _ surely you remember GE's Mazda lamps?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CORRECTION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The telephone number listed last week for Hemmings Motor News
was incorrect. The correct number is 802-442-3101, or fax
802-447-1561, if you want one of their collectibles catalogs.

IRAQ GOES ON OFFENSIVE AGAINST INSPECTION TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Iraqi government shifted its propaganda
campaign against the UN arms experts into high gear Friday,
accusing UN inspectors of spying on the regime and using its access
to Iraqi arms facilities to help US war planners identify potential
military targets.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, made by Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz,
come as the UN Special Commission, charged with disarming Iraq,
accused Baghdad of impeding its efforts to uncover evidence of a
clandestine chemical and biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and analysts say that Baghdad is pursuing a carefully
calculated strategy to undermine the credibility of the inspectors
while providing them with just enough cooperation to weaken
American efforts to gain international support for military action
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis are well aware that the best way to keep the US
threat of force at bay is to keep the Security Council divided,''
said James Placke, an analyst at the Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. ``The lesson Baghdad has drawn is that it will lose its
support in the council if it throws the inspectors out of the
country or blatantly interferes with their work.''
</P>
<P>
   A review by UNSCOM of Iraqi compliance since the last crisis
shows a mix picture. While Baghdad has offered to cooperate with UN
teams searching for evidence of 500 mustard shells and the remains
of 500 additional chemical and biological bombs, they have hampered
the inspectors efforts in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council, UNSCOM's deputy director
Charles Duelfer complained that an Iraqi escort helicopter flew
dangerously close, within thirty feet, of a UN helicopter on
November 23. ``The threat to the safety of the UN personnel caused
by this action was brought to the attention'' of the Iraqi
authorities. Baghdad said that incident was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   Duelfer also said that the inspectors discovered a number of
undeclared dual-use items: a bio-safety cabinet used to prevent
contamination of microscopic material and some filter presses used
to separate cells. ``Frankly there are a hundred and one perfectly
legitimate civilians uses, but it would also be nice for testing
anthrax,'' said UNSCOM spokesman Ewen Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has an obligation to declare all dual use equipment,''
Buchanan added. ``This has been a persistent problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Duelfer also told the council that Iraq denied the UN teams
access to a camp used by pro-Iraqi Iranian rebels. Duelfer said the
UN team was withdrawn after Iraqi officials insisted that the camp
was the property of the Iranian group. The UN continues to
negotiate access to the site with Iraqi officials and the Iranian
rebels. ``We cannot have sanctuaries in Iraq,'' said Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Iraqi verbal thrust against UNSCOM, Aziz Friday
appealed to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to sever links between
UN arms inspectors and western intelligence agencies. The arms
inspectors have received extensive help from US, British and
Israeli intelligence services, according to current and former
UNSCOM officials.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz charged that the UN inspectors provided intelligence to the
Pentagon used to select targets for a planned military attack on
Baghdad earlier this month. The attack, which was ordered by
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair, was aborted at the
last minute because Baghdad capitulated to UN demands to permit
unfettered access to UN arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that urgent steps will be taken to stop the links
between the Special Commission and intelligence apparatuses,
especially of countries with a hostile policy towards Iraq,'' Aziz
wrote in a letter to the UN chief.
</P>
<P>
   The charge follows earlier allegations by Aziz that Charles
Duelfer, UNSCOM's top American official, met with Iraqi opposition
leaders seeking to topple the Hussein regime. Duelfer, who was in
London on Nov 24, the same day, that the opposition leaders were
meeting with Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs, denied he met with the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new evidence emerged this week concerning Iraqi
efforts to acquire banned missile technology since the Gulf War.
Romania's defense ministry admitted Friday that a number of
Romanian companies had signed several contracts between 1994 and
1996 to supply missile components to Iraq, which is subject to a UN
arms embargo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The slide toward financial panic would have begun with a flutter
of pages off a fax machine in Greenwich, Conn., each a notice of
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The instant that Long-Term Capital Management missed a payment
to a creditor, it would technically have been in default to all of
its roughly 75 creditors, thanks to loan provisions that required
it to remain current on all its debts. Facing losses, those
creditors would have sold assets that the firm had pledged as
collateral, sending prices plunging. Dozens of markets, from
Denmark to Brazil, would have bucked like terrified stallions.
</P>
<P>
   The selling frenzy would have roiled U.S. markets in junk bonds,
corporate takeover stocks, mortgage securities and even Treasury
bonds. Businesses that depend on those markets for money to expand
and add jobs would have suffered. So would consumers whose mortgage
rates are influenced by those markets and who have billions in
retirement savings in them.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of such a financial panic and its economic aftershocks
prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help arrange an
11th-hour rescue of the fund by 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage
firms in September.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue prevented the fire-sale liquidation of Long-Term
Capital's far-flung, $125 billion portfolio, assembled almost
entirely with borrowed money. But even though no public funds were
involved, the rescue also produced some of the most stinging
criticism the Federal Reserve has faced since its
inflation-fighting efforts prompted a national recession in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists and members of Congress _ and privately, even a
few Wall Street executives _ accuse the Fed of overreacting by
helping to rescue a speculative partnership of wealthy investors
and the bankers who allowed its speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the weight of the federal government be brought to
bear to help out a private investor?'' asked former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the markets could have coped with the fund's
collapse, although plunging prices would certainly have inflicted
some pain on market participants. ``There is the impression that
the Fed interfered with a market solution,'' said Robert Litan, an
economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials have defended their limited role as essential in
avoiding what could have become a free-fall panic in markets
already struggling with the aftershocks of Russia's debt moratorium
a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my judgment that the American people, whom we are
pledged to serve, could have been seriously hurt if credit dried up
in a general effort by banks and other intermediaries to avoid
greater risk,'' said New York Fed President William McDonough in
testimony before Congress a week after the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed that the times
required action.
</P>
<P>
   ``With markets currently volatile and investors skittish,'' he
told Congress in October, helping to facilitate a timely rescue of
the fund ``seemed entirely appropriate as a matter of public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics worry that by orchestrating the rescue of
Long-Term Capital, the Fed suggested that a speculator that grows
large enough to threaten the system will be saved _ a message that
might encourage recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get away from the `too big to fail' idea,'' said
Hans Stoll, a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and the
author of a number of important studies of the volatility in stock
markets. ``We are not in the position of saving hedge funds, and
the Fed or someone should make that pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Wall Street banker who is a director of the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association argues that the markets for swaps
and other derivatives could have coped with Long-Term Capital's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There surely would have been price changes, and they might
have been significant,'' the banker said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. But as the prices changed, he added, bargain hunters
would have stepped in and the markets would have adapted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market crashed in 1987, swap activity trudged
right through without a problem _ with less liquidity and less
standardization than we have today,'' he added. ``Would prices have
changed? Yes. Would the system have than been in jeopardy? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Few critics of the Fed can be found in Wall Street's corner
offices, however. Top executives of banks and brokerage firms
estimate privately that the collapse of Long-Term Capital alone
could have cost their businesses a total of $8 billion to $15
billion, and one senior executive said he believed that the amounts
could have been 10 times higher in a market stampede. ``It would
have turned a machine gun on the Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Levy-Lang, chairman and chief executive of Paribas, the
French investment bank that contributed $100 million to the rescue
effort, said the Fed ``was right in raising the question and making
sure the solution is found.'' There was, he added, ``the beginning
of a systemic problem'' for the markets, and the situation ``might
have unraveled very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Litan, the Federal Reserve was ``damned if it
did and damned if it didn't.'' If the Fed had done nothing and the
hedge fund's collapse had precipitated a bank failure or a market
panic, he said, criticism of the sort being cast at the central
bank today would seem trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some people say a key lesson of the debacle is the need
for more regulation, not less. Long-Term Capital's troubles
demonstrate that ``the regulatory infrastructure is not strong
enough or encompassing enough,'' said independent market strategist
Henry Kaufman. Unless it improves, he added, there is ``a
better-than-even chance'' that the markets will see ``future
significant financial problems of this magnitude, or greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has acknowledged that an emergency like this one could
occur again, and he recently called on bankers and regulators to be
more alert to the risks of financial derivatives and other
investments in unseasoned markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``New instruments, like derivatives, afford the opportunity to
reduce risk, but they also afford opportunities to become more
vulnerable,'' Greenspan told a meeting of Wall Street executives in
early November. ``Borrowers, lenders and regulators need to improve
their understanding of the risk characteristics of the new
instruments under a variety of circumstances _ some extreme.''

DIVIDING TERRITORIES WRESTLE OVER BEAR PLATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Fangs flash and tempers flare as the Northwest
Territories argues the snarliest of questions _ who gets the bear?
</P>
<P>
   Next April, the 1.3 million square mile wilderness stretching
from Hudson Bay nearly to the North Pole will split in two, with
the eastern region to become Nunavut, a semi-autonomous homeland
for the Inuit, or Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, breakup talks have mostly been amicable.
</P>
<P>
   But the noses of those living north of 60 degrees latitude are
getting seriously out of joint as lawmakers and arbiters seek to
determine which side inherits the territory's famous bear-shaped
license plate, perhaps the most distinctive car tag in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The west will be keeping the polar bear license, that's a
definite,'' asserted Seamus Henry, who heads a committee seeking to
protect the interests of the western region as final negotiations
continue in the territorial capital of Yellowknife. ``The polar
bear has been in use by the Northwest Territories, and there is a
copyright on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Nunavut folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The westerners want to steal our bear,'' said Tommy Enuaraq, a
territorial legislator from Baffin Island. ``It's arrogant, it's
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut hammers home the habitat theme. Polar bears are found
padding around the eastern region in far greater numbers than in
the west. Since Ursus maritimus itself prefers the east, the
thinking goes, the license plate belongs there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical,'' said Chris Cote, president of the Baffin
Regional Chamber of Commerce. ``The polar bear is a Nunavut symbol.
So it's reasonable that the license go to Nunavut.''
</P>
<P>
   But miffed westerners respond they have polar bears, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just as Arctic as they are,'' said Stephen Kakfwi, an
Indian leader. ``The polar bear is just as much our symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, westerners note with a sneer, their region actually
boasts roads that lead somewhere. Well, three or four anway. Still,
you can drive from, say, Fort Simpson to Fort Providence, if you
have a mind. You can even drive down to lower Canada and flaunt
those polar bear tags.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 communites of Nunavut, by contrast, are unconnected by
road. Nor is it possible to reach the region overland except by
snowmoble or dogsled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of Nunavut's 25,000 people do own cars, brought in
by ship during summer months. And so what if they can only drive
around their own villages? They are still under the same legal
obligation to register the vehicles as dwellers in Montreal or
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply ship brought 180 cars to Iqaluit this year,'' said
Madeline Redford of Nunavut Tourism, referring to the regional
capital, which boasts a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet and even a
few stop signs. ``We own cars, we drive cars, and we are required
by law to have license plates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the west, she said: ``If they want an animal for a
license plate, let them take the musk ox.''
</P>
<P>
   While it arouses serious passion on both sides, but perhaps more
so in the western region, which is struggling with an identity
crisis. While nearly all of the inhabitants of soon-to-be territory
of Nunavut are Inuit, creating an ethnic bond, the western region
is composed of a mixed bag of whites, Indians and a sprinkling of
Inuit, with little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are rather desperately seeking symbols to unite
the 45,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   There was huge embarrassment when the territory launched a
contest to choose a new name when Nunavut finally cuts loose next
April 1. Rather than opt for some stirring northland monicker like
``Western Arctic'' or ``Freedom Territory'' -- as more earnest
citizens proposed -- a substantial number of people rallied around
a bizarre campaign to rename the territory ``Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Bob won international headlines. But sober-minded
leaders decided to stick with the name Northwest Territories, at
least for the time being, although Kakfwi once grumped, ``that's
not a name, it's a direction.''

<P>
   Today, with stock markets stronger and bond markets quietly
going about their workaday business, it hardly seems possible that
less than three months ago some of Wall Street's smartest and most
powerful people thought the problems of one giant hedge fund,
Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Conn., might push the
world's markets to the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage houses that
pumped in $3.6 billion and took 90 percent ownership of the fund
when it was only hours away from collapse may now see windfall
profits on what seemed like a desperate roll of the dice, a daring
bailout encouraged by nervous regulators at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's recovery does not itself resolve the argument over
whether the Fed should have brokered the arrangements that rescued
Long-Term Capital from bankruptcy on Sept. 23. Supporters say the
Fed saved the day and laid the groundwork for the current rebound,
while critics say the rebound proves that markets do just fine
without such heavy-handed interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger lessons of Long-Term Capital's crisis may not be
as fleeting as the recent dip in the Dow. The fund was once so
impressive that it garnered billions of dollars from some of the
biggest names in finance. When it almost collapsed, it tested some
fundamental assumptions of the investment world _ and found them
severely flawed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Diversification, the elementary precaution of not putting all
of one's eggs in a single basket, failed utterly. The fund had
spread its bets among many markets in various countries around the
world. But the strategy did not protect it from the chain reaction
that hit global markets in August. Indeed, the complexity and
diversity of its holdings made the last-minute rescue effort
complicated and difficult. In the aftermath, hedge fund managers
and other professional investors have been left wondering whether a
diverse portfolio offers any protection from future financial
storms.
</P>
<P>
   _ The markets for financial derivatives and many other new kinds
of investments, which have been hailed as ways for global investors
and multinational corporations to offset many of the risks of doing
business, suddenly behaved like gawky adolescents _ big enough to
seem mature but clumsy and prone to panic when things go awry.
Investors who expected to be able to exit these new markets as
easily as they had entered them found that the only way out was
through a fire sale that devastated the value of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most worrisome, the use of borrowed money for speculation, a
mainstay of many professional investors in today's markets,
occurred on a scale so much larger than most anyone thought
possible, and involved credit arrangements so complex, that none of
the players _ not lenders, not trading partners and not regulators
_ could respond to the fund's troubles as they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a whole series of structural changes in the
financial markets in the past 20 years so that today, when you come
to the edge of risk-taking, you find the old formulas no longer
work,'' said independent market strategist Henry Kaufman. ``That is
what this crisis was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the return of confidence and liquidity to most markets,
both Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and New York Fed
President William McDonough have suggested in recent speeches that
an emergency like the one at Long-Term Capital could occur again.
</P>
<P>
   The return to more normal market conditions in the last month
``leaves unanswered the question of why such episodes erupted in
the first place'' and why they spread so rapidly, Greenspan
recently told a gathering of Wall Street executives.
</P>
<P>
   He offered his own theory: ``It has become evident time and
again that when events become too complex and move too rapidly, as
appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstrably less
able to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Long-Term Capital was hardly unique in its approach to
investing, the risks of the global marketplace look far sharper
today than they did before that long, edgy week in September when
so much suddenly seemed to depend on the fate of one giant fund in
Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Broken Eggs In Every Basket
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital _ established in 1994 by John Meriwether, a
legendary bond trader formerly with Salomon Brothers, and his
partners, including Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, who shared the
Nobel Prize for economics in 1997 _ is often described these days
as having been speculative and risky.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, it tried to reduce its risks by
spreading its investments around. It held almost every major type
of security and many minor ones, from blue-chip American stocks to
Danish mortgage-backed securities to Latin American government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by every traditional measure, Long-Term Capital hedged its
bets _ across markets, currencies and types of assets. In theory,
losses on one investment would be offset by gains in another,
providing ballast that would allow the fund to ride out any
financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   It did not turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As markets around the world moved in the same direction at the
same time, the diversification on which Long-Term had previously
relied failed it utterly,'' said McDonough, in subsequent
congressional testimony about the fund's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's core investment specialty _ a technique called
convergence trading, used primarily by large banks and brokerage
firms _ was also a supposedly low-risk strategy. But it, too, did
not turn out to be impervious to market gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than betting that stocks or bonds will go up or down,
convergence traders bet that the prices of certain related
securities will move closer together. They identify securities
whose prices have deviated slightly from their historical
relationships to one another and place bets that those prices will
return to their normal patterns. The strategy can be applied to
many investments _ stocks, government securities, corporate bonds,
options, foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In one common convergence trade, Long-Term acted after spotting
a Treasury bond that matured in 30 years and another maturing in 29
years that were trading at prices slightly further apart than
usual. Since Uncle Sam's ability to pay his debts is unlikely to
change between 2027 and 2028, that price gap would no doubt narrow,
the partners believed.

1999 ACURA 3.2TL: SMART CAR WITH A STUPID NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: corrects name of car to 3.2TL)  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology brings us wondrous things, not all of which are worth
the effort it takes to deal with them. For example, let us consider
the automobile navigation system, at once a wonder, a distraction,
a frustration, a convenience, and a hazard. The most sophisticated
among them rely on satellites aloft and computer hardware with a
prodigious bank of computer memory on the ground to pinpoint your
car's location on the planet within a couple of feet and guide you
unerringly to your destination. Yeah, right!
</P>
<P>
   Some systems are tied in to cellular telephone networks, can
detect trouble such as a crash or hijack and summon aid. Some are
just navigation tools. Today's case study is the Acura Navigation
System, this time installed on Acura's newest, the 1999 3.2TL, a
very smart car with a very stupid name.
</P>
<P>
   It is Thanksgiving morn and I am heading north to a dinner
appointment. Way north. I know the main route, the alternate
routes, the shortest of shortcuts as well as I know the way to my
refrigerator. So, what better test for a guidance system than to
match its electronic expertise against hard knowledge (and besides,
I carry a bulging map case that would make AAA envious). The
weather is . . . dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the ignition and the VCR in center dash wakes up,
displays Mother Earth aglow amid the twinkling firmament. Select
the menu and commence the exercise; punch in the destination a
letter at a time by touching the appropriate members of the
alphabet displayed on the screen. The computer Imp refuses to
recognize anything but York, Maine, which is not where I want to
go.
</P>
<P>
   I drive a bit, park, resume negotiation. Nada. I'll try later; I
do not have time to waste and I've already spent more time than it
would take to copy a Delorme map by hand. I select ``map'' and let
the illumined array track my progress _ my way.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a handsome four-door equipped to the nines _ the
navigation system is the only option offered. The car derives half
of its idiotic moniker from the 3.2-liter, 24-valve VTEC engine
under the hood, a quiet 225-horsepower mill that has one drawback;
if you try running on an interstate without using cruise control,
you are asking for a ticket _ the TL's a creeper, as in creep up
the speedometer dial. The 4-speed automatic transmission with its
fuzzy logic is already adapting to my driving style and the
handling is quick, precise. I like this car.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray, Maine, I have gained a little time in the light
traffic, stop to program a route _ success! The Imp admits to
knowing the whereabouts of Kingfield and the little animated arrow
points me north on Interstate 95. In Auburn, I pull onto Route 4 _
OK so far _ and then left onto East Hardscrabble heading for Hotel
Road. This is not exactly wilderness; it runs along the edge of an
airfield. But, I am off the ``digitized road,'' thank you _ as far
as the Imp is concerned, I am in Terra Incognita. Shades of Henry
the Navigator!
</P>
<P>
   The things this instrument knows _ in view of what I'm learning
it doesn't know _ are surprising. It recognizes Crash Road, not
where I really want to drive in the rain and it's raining. The
windows suddenly begin fogging up and I need to jack up the air
conditioning to clear them _ which means hitting the AC button next
to the screen, thus turning off the Navigator Imp and bringing up
the work order for the Comfort Elf. One must tap the appropriate
boxes on the illuminated screen to effect ``climate changes''
within and I might as well be trying to change the weather without.
Visibility clouds to urgency and I pull over while madly rubbing
the windshield with a sleeve. After a while, the climate control
begins to cooperate. I prefer knobs to this high-tech tactile
switching nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   At New Vineyard I notice a change in weather character _ snow is
falling and there is an accumulation of something viscous
underfoot, demanding a reduction in speed. But the Imp does guide
me into Kingfield. End of Test I.
</P>
<P>
   Test II is finding Rochester, N.H. You may recall that on a
previous encounter, it didn't seem to be listed. Today, it exists,
if you have time and patience enough to wade through all the
options offered before the Imp will recognize it. But the
Navigation Imp and I disagree mightily on how to travel there and
the Imp finally gets annoyed with the number of recalculations
asked and quits in a huff. Just as well; no matter how low I adjust
the screen illumination, it's still an annoying distraction glowing
at me.
</P>
<P>
   Test III is finding a route from the Globe to the Museum of
Transportation, a veritable urban maze that challenges the stoutest
of tourists. The Imp is on top of the game; he points me south to
Gallivan Boulevard, along Morton, the Arborway, directly to target
_ except the Imp miscounts the exits at a traffic circle. The
reverse is a flop. On exiting the museum, I am directed to go to
the ``designated route,'' which is undecipherable on the maze
presented _ you can zoom these little things into big things but
I'm in traffic now. And although I'm retracing the route in, I am
now ``off the route.''
</P>
<P>
   I reprogram for Rochester, N.H., and, am directed to make a
``slight left turn'' where there is no turn, then another ``slight
left turn,'' which is a Y intersection, and then I'm off the route.
Recalculate. This pattern continues until finally the Imp goes to
lunch and the map freezes. Somewhere on I-95, the system shuts down
and I am able to coax the Imp out of his snit and find South Main
in Rochester. The Imp succeeds but selects the wrong exit off the
turnpike from a traffic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, folks, are wonderful for negoiating
well-known dense urban areas _ boy, does the Imp know Portsmouth,
N.H., well! But, if it's to the boonies you are trekking, buy a
map, Bunkie. The Imp does not do boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.2TL &UR;  &LR; is roomy enough, has a decent trunk, some interior
storage and, with the exception of climate controls with the
navigation option, is fairly convenient to operate. At $27,950 plus
$455 delivery, without the Imp, it's the equal of some much
higher-priced iron. Add $2,000 for the navigation system if you
like expensive, aggravatiing toys _ but two grand would buy a heap
of maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura 3.2TL &UR;  &LR; scores on performance, luxury, handling, and
fuel economy; it delivered 26.44 miles per gallon over 928 measured
miles. Thus, it would seem to score fairly well on value, too.
</P>
<P>
   Final insults. It is overcast; I turn on the headlights and the
navigation screen goes dark, showing nothing but accumulated finger
smudges. No amount of fine-tuning the light levels and screen
brightness results in sufficient illumination. Good thing I know
how to get where I'm going. Coming home, the Imp plots the course,
guides me faithfully to within six miles, then falls asleep. I jar
him with the recalculation prod. Great car, lousy pathfinder.

 UNDATED: partners believed.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fund bought the 29-year bonds, betting that their price
would rise. It also bet on a price decline in the 30-year bonds by
selling short _ borrowing the bonds from a big institution and
selling them, wagering that they could be replaced later for less
money. If the price gap closed, the fund would make money on both
trades. If the gap did not close, the fund had some protection,
because it had bet on both declining and rising bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other opportunities for convergence trades were found in foreign
bond and government securities markets, including the markets for
Latin American debt, Italian bank notes and British government
securities. In theory, the fund had further reduced its risks by
scattering its investments among so many markets and among so many
different types of investments.
</P>
<P>
   But in real life, anxiety began to spread through most foreign
markets after Thailand's currency collapsed in the summer of 1997.
Prices fell and businesses failed all along the Pacific Rim. In
response, by early 1998, investors worldwide began seeking a haven
in U.S. Treasury markets.
</P>
<P>
   That remarkable flight to safety had unexpected consequences for
Treasury bonds, the bread-and-butter market for Long-Term Capital.
Playing to form, the 30-year bonds climbed in price, but the nearly
identical 29-year bonds did not share in the rally; their lower
trading volume made them look riskier to nervous investors. The
divergence hurt Long-Term Capital, of course, because the fund had
bet heavily that the bonds' prices would move closer together.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, too, investors sought safety. That affected Long-Term
Capital's bets in Italy, where it had been anticipating that the
prices of Italian government securities would move closer to those
of securities issued by Italian banks. Instead, the prices moved
even farther apart as investors flocked to the government
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Russia decided to halt debt payments this past
August, developing markets around the world went into a tailspin.
Long-Term Capital had bet millions on the convergence of
garden-variety bonds issued by Brazil, Mexico and other Latin
American governments and so-called Brady bonds, issued by the same
nations but secured by U.S. Treasury securities. Those convergence
bets also became losers, as issues backed by the Treasury took on
more appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The allergy to risk quickly afflicted the markets for corporate
bonds, mortgage bonds and junk bonds. Again, Long-Term Capital was
directly in the line of fire. It had a collection of securities,
for example, that entitled it to collect the future interest
payments from a pool of home mortgages. The prices plummeted on
these instruments, which are considered highly risky because of
their sensitivity to changes in mortgage rates, and the value of
Long-Term Capital's holdings went down. Prices and trading volume
also fell in the junk-bond market, where Long-Term Capital had
invested several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, investor nervousness had spread to stocks,
with sharp market declines in the United States and elsewhere.
Despite its reputation as a bond specialist, Long-Term Capital had
an estimated $6.5 billion in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that money was in the stocks of companies involved in
mergers. Some was invested in a convergence trade on the stock of
Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport. Because each company
relies for income on a third, related company, Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, the fund had bet that the prices of those two stocks would
move toward each other. As the stock market tumbled, though, Shell
Transport's stock fell faster and further, causing the gap to
widen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market turmoil also created losses in the fund's
multibillion-dollar collection of total-return swaps, a form of
financial derivatives. (Derivatives are financial instruments whose
value is based on the value of another asset _ for example, a stock
option whose price is derived from an underlying stock.)
</P>
<P>
   In a typical swap of this kind, the fund entered into a contract
with a bank or brokerage firm that owned a block of stock. The bank
agreed to pay the fund all future gains and dividends on that
stock, and the fund agreed to pay the bank a fixed fee equal to a
small percentage of the initial value of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock rose, the fund kept the gain; if it went down, the
fund owed the bank the difference between the original price and
the new one. The swaps allowed the fund to benefit from rising
stock prices without actually owning the stocks. But stock prices
fell and remained unsteady into September.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, the only things converging on Long Term
Capital's partners were their losses _ losses so diverse that they
made it harder for the fund's creditors and their regulators to
respond, because the fund's troubles were affecting so many
far-flung markets.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators got their first look at the scale of the portfolio on
Sunday, Sept. 20, when a team from the New York Fed drove to
Greenwich to meet with the beleaguered fund's partners.
</P>
<P>
   It was then, McDonough of the Fed later testified, that
officials ``came to understand the impact which Long-Term Capital's
positions were already having on markets around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital's experience, Kaufman said, shows that
``international diversification works in bull markets, but it fails
in bear markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now live in a much more homogeneous financial world,'' he
said. ``We all talk to each other and share the same information
and have the same biases.'' As a result, Kaufman explained, world
markets now tend to move in lock step _ a line dance that tramples
on the basic concept of portfolio diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-Aged Markets In a Grown-Up Crisis
</P>
<P>
   Putting money in mature, well-established markets with lots of
investors, like the market for 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, is one
thing. Placing bets in younger, less mature markets _ those in
developing countries and those for complicated financial products _
is quite another, as Long-Term Capital soon discovered. Indeed, the
markets for some products in the fund bore little resemblance to
traditional forums for trading securities.
</P>
<P>
   While stock options and some other standardized derivatives are
traded on exchanges, Long-Term Capital favored swaps and other
custom-tailored contracts that were designed specifically for its
own investment strategies. These customized contracts change hands
only in private transactions _ making the market in them more like
the market for homes or luxury yachts than the one for stocks, or
even for stock options.

 UNDATED: stock options.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to arranging its total-return swaps in the stock
market, the fund also made heavy use of a derivative called an
interest-rate swap, in which one investor agrees to pay another a
sum equal to the amount that, say, $100 million would earn if
invested at a floating interest rate for three years. In return,
the second investor agrees to pay the first the amount that the
$100 million would earn if invested at fixed rates. Neither party
owes the other $100 million; that amount, called the notional
value, simply provides a tool for measurement, since it is unknown
in advance how much money will actually change hands under the swap
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of Long-Term Capital's use of swaps and other
financial derivatives was remarkable. Its derivatives portfolio had
a notional value of $1.25 trillion, representing 1/30 of the
worldwide notional value of these investments, according to the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
</P>
<P>
   One person with firsthand knowledge of the fund's portfolio said
the reliance on these exotic derivatives was based on the
assumption that Long-Term Capital could quickly and easily sell its
holdings whenever it wished. But that assumption was profoundly
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the markets for swaps and other privately traded
derivatives have grown enormously in the last 15 years; businesses
and investors use these tools to offset risks from things like
interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. But the trading
value of these markets still pales in comparison with that of the
stock and bond markets, and it can shrink sharply in times of
uncertainty. These markets have fewer participants than the
traditional ones and no public disclosure of prices or volume; they
also lack a clear regulatory structure.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to absorb large volumes of business quickly without
experiencing substantial swings in prices _ a quality Wall Street
calls liquidity _ is one good measure of a market's maturity, and
it is a quality that relies in part on the presence of speculators
like Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, for example, when buyers and sellers are
abundant, an investor can easily sell 10,000 shares of a $50 stock
on a single day without pushing down the price more than a few
pennies. In a market with fewer buyers, the price might plunge to
$25 before the shares were all sold. If a market becomes completely
illiquid, there is simply no one willing to buy that much stock
that quickly. That is where speculators like Long-Term Capital come
in. When many people want to sell, the speculator steps up to buy,
contributing to the liquidity of the marketplace by taking the
unpopular side of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But in many small, specialized markets for swaps and other
exotic, privately traded derivatives, Long-Term Capital's scale of
operation had made it the dominant speculator. Thus, when it needed
to sell in the shaky days of early September, speculators who were
willing to buy were scarce. ``Some of these more exotic swaps were
already trading by appointment only,'' one investment manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the economic crisis that swept Asia, the volume of
worldwide swaps activity fell nearly 40 percent in the second half
of 1997, compared with the first half, according to the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
</P>
<P>
   Activity in the markets for swaps recovered somewhat in the
first half of 1998, but when Russia shocked world markets by
stopping payments on its debt, liquidity in these markets quickly
evaporated again. Exact figures will be months in coming, but one
industry newsletter, Swaps Monitor, estimates that trading revenues
_ a figure closely tied to trading volume _ fell as much as 24
percent during the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A result was a market in which swaps and other derivatives could
be sold quickly only at fire-sale prices _ a condition that
apparently had not been anticipated by Long-Term Capital or other
participants in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Before this crisis, few people even focused on the issue of
liquidity in the swaps market, said Paul Spraos, editor of the
Swaps Monitor newsletter in New York. ``It's not a question of
whether it was less liquid than anybody thought,'' he said. ``It's
a question of whether people ever sat down and thought about this
issue at all. And a lot of people didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly lets Long-Term Capital off the hook, one Wall
Street risk manager said. ``They should have realized they would
not have the liquidity they needed,'' this person said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``In many of these markets, they were the
liquidity.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third week in September, as the markets reeled and
Long-Term Capital's losses grew, regulators and Wall Street
executives began to worry. McDonough, the New York Fed president,
later told Congress that he feared that a number of these already
nervous markets ``would experience extreme price moves and possibly
cease to function for a period of one or more days and maybe
longer'' if Long-Term Capital failed. ``This would have caused a
vicious cycle,'' he continued, in which panic-driven selling would
push down prices, causing further losses and increasing the risk
that the panic would spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, thousands of hedge funds were active in these markets.
Their lenders were growing nervous, and lines of credit might have
been cut if Long-Term Capital collapsed. At the very least, these
funds would have temporarily abandoned their important role as
speculators; at worst, many might have failed _ tipping over a new
row of dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   New Forms of Debt, New Breeds of Risk
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital would never have posed such a threat to the
financial markets if it had not found easy ways to speculate by
using borrowed money _ an amount borrowed in such intricate ways
that the results defied the investment world's assumptions about
the limits on credit and the protection of lenders in today's
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation with borrowed money has been a flash point for
regulators since the eve of the 1929 market crash. In 1928, the
Federal Reserve tried to discourage stock market speculation by
pushing up interest rates on loans made for that purpose, but it
met open defiance from some Wall Street lenders who simply refused
to raise their rates.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, the Federal Reserve was put firmly in charge of
regulating how much stock could be bought on credit _ on margin, as
it is called on Wall Street. Today, no more than half of the
purchase price of a stock may be borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But those Depression-era rules do not address loans made to
those who speculate in foreign currencies, government securities,
bonds and derivatives markets. Hedge funds and other speculators
can borrow as much as they dare, and brokerage firms and banks are
free to lend as much as they wish within broad regulatory limits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fund's considerable reliance on traditional loans,
its use of derivatives contracts had the same practical effect as
investing with borrowed money. The total-return swaps, for example,
allowed the fund to control considerably more shares of stock than
it could have bought outright with the same amount of money.
Similarly, interest-rate swaps allowed the fund to speculate on
changes in bond prices just as if it had owned the bonds, but at a
tiny fraction of the cost.

 UNDATED: the cost.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Long-Term Capital was not alone in its use of credit,
known on Wall Street as leverage, it appears to have borrowed far
more than its lenders or their regulators thought plausible or even
possible. Some hedge funds use leverage to double or triple the
size of their bets; Long-Term Capital used leverage to increase its
bets 25 times over. Of the fund's $125 billion in assets, more than
$120 billion had been acquired with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders of all types were so eager for the business of the
star-studded firm that they lent freely and on generous terms,
without much apparent concern about how much others were lending to
the fund. They viewed the vast majority of their loans as safe,
because they held collateral _ the securities involved in the
fund's various trades _ that they assumed they could sell if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, if they had all tried to dispose of that collateral
quickly, they might have had billions and perhaps tens of billions
of dollars in losses, as they sold into illiquid markets that
Long-Term Capital dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's bankers had also waived their usual requirement for
something called initial margin, an up-front deposit similar to the
down payment on a car. Most bankers require a down payment; if
borrowers cannot repay the loan, the banks rely on the down payment
to cover any decline in the value of their collateral.
</P>
<P>
   But people who have studied Long-Term Capital's trading
practices said the fund usually got 100 percent financing for its
purchases, the equivalent of buying a car with no money down.
</P>
<P>
   The fund did pay its banks money to cover day-to-day declines in
the market value of its investments, and it had to post cash
collateral on its stock investments. As markets moved against it,
the fund satisfied those obligations by drawing down most of the
$4.7 billion nest egg it had held at the beginning of 1998. By
mid-September, it was dangerously close to running out of cash. If
the fund had run out of money and collapsed, the bankers would have
had to seize its stocks, bonds and derivatives. And because they
had not required Long-Term Capital to pay initial margins, they
would have had no cushion if the value of those securities had
continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The lenient borrowing arrangements that Long-Term Capital had
enjoyed caused other migraines for its bankers. Most hedge funds
have a banker or two to arrange their trades. Long-Term Capital had
dozens _ at least 75, according to McDonough of the Fed _ because
it shopped relentlessly for the best derivatives contracts. The
sprawling network of lenders served the fund well, but it created a
portfolio filled with what bankers call unpaired trades.
</P>
<P>
   When banks lend money to finance the purchase of two related
investments in a convergence trade, they encourage borrowers to
finance both legs of the trade through one bank. For example, a
bank that finances a hedge fund's purchase of 29-year Treasury
bonds would prefer to handle its short sale of 30-year bonds, too.
That way, if the hedge fund collapsed, the bank could step into its
place, relatively secure in the knowledge that it now controlled
bets on both rising and falling bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   But because Long-Term Capital had clout, bankers allowed it to
spread its business widely in search of the best prices. That left
most of the banks financing single legs of two-way bets. Long-Term
was the only glue holding together a puzzle-like portfolio,
increasing bankers' anxiety in the dark days of September. A sudden
collapse of Long-Term Capital would have left many of them with
risky one-way bets on their own books.
</P>
<P>
   As the fund's losses grew, its managers tried desperately to
appease bankers by pairing up trades _ persuading the bankers who
had financed one part of a trade to get together with those who had
financed the rest of it. But the task proved fiendishly
complicated. Consider the difficulty if three banks had financed
the bet on 30-year Treasury bonds and five banks the 29-year
Treasury bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quickly discovered that getting them to pair up the trade
could take something like six months, and we had more like six
days,'' one Long-Term Capital manager said.
</P>
<P>
   A Blip, or a Sign Of Crises to Come?
</P>
<P>
   When Fed officials arrived in Greenwich, they identified
unpaired trades as one of the most worrisome problems.
</P>
<P>
   And if the fund had failed to make good on even one small
payment to a single banker, it would have effectively defaulted on
its entire $120 billion in borrowing, thanks to cross-default
provisions in its contracts. A cross-default provision requires
that a borrower remain current on all its debt repayments, not just
on those to the lender itself.
</P>
<P>
   If a default had occurred, some lenders would have been able to
seize collateral and sell it, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's trading partners, the parties with which Long-Term
Capital had contracted for its swaps, would have been in trouble,
too. They would have almost certainly sought to reduce their risks
by doing offsetting transactions with other speculators. At the
moment of a Long-Term Capital default, those offsetting contracts
themselves would have become unbalanced risks on their books.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, a senior Wall Street banker said, ``it would
be sensible in the extreme to go out and get the contracts you need
to replace those defaulted ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of such a sudden scramble on the various swaps and
derivatives markets would have been, at least, extremely disruptive
and, at worst, more than those markets could have handled.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the fears that prompted the rescue of the giant hedge
fund in late September _ fears that have since faded with each
upsurge of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But even as markets grew calmer, Greenspan and other regulators,
including McDonough, continued to worry aloud that broad structural
changes in the financial marketplace _ including the spread of
derivatives, the increasingly global nature of investment and the
immaturity of some developing and specialized markets _ encourage
financial panic to spread from market to market and from country to
country.
</P>
<P>
   This time, at least, people coped. And if Long-Term Capital was
simply a casualty of a once-a-century financial storm, the crisis
may well deserve to become a footnote to financial history. But if
what happened was, as some regulators fear, a result of
developments that have permanently changed how modern markets work,
then investors ignore the lessons of the crisis at their own peril.

IN KENYA'S BEER WARS, NATIONALISM AND ECONOMICS ARE FACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ In 1922 two brothers from England, George and
Charles Hurst, started brewing beer here. But they had no name for
it. A year later an elephant killed George on a hunting trip.
Charles turned tragedy into macabre inspiration: He named the beer
Tusker.
</P>
<P>
   The offending elephant's tusks, dinged with a last-minute bullet
hole, still hang in the corporate boardroom, and Tusker is by far
the best-selling beer in Kenya. Now beer drinkers here, who often
take their beer warm and always take it seriously, are watching as
the maker of Tusker, East African Breweries, face a threat from
another behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a beer war on in East Africa. South African Breweries,
the biggest brewer in Africa, has decided to take on Tusker, and in
early October it began churning out half-liter bottles from a new
plant outside Nairobi. Tusker is in turn nearly half owned by
Guinness, the giant brewer and producer of clever marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In two months the battle has become about more than beer: it
touches on Kenya's tenuous sense of nationalism, the weak economy
and high taxes, the reality that many people are too poor to afford
bottled beer.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been ugly. Thugs have destroyed the ubiquitous
billboards from both companies. Near Nairobi's main airport, one
billboard for Castle, the South African brand, has been shredded
and rebuilt three times. East African Breweries turned around and
is trying to sell Tusker in South Africa, but has become embroiled
in a trademark dispute there. So the Kenyan government is now
threatening higher taxes on all South African imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is correct,'' Michael Karanja, managing
director for East African Breweries, said at a news conference here
recently. ``We are fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, beer-drinking Kenyans seem pleased, in the hope
that the dispute degenerates into a free fall in prices. Only about
15 percent of people in Kenya drink bottled beer because, at about
90 cents for a Tusker and slightly more for Castle, it is expensive
in a nation where per capita income is only $271 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition lowers price,'' said Samuel Wanjohi, 49, a Tusker
drinker, in a crowded bar in downtown Nairobi one recent night.
``So I suspect there may be a reduction in the price. If Castle
were selling at 45 shillings people would stop drinking Tusker.''
His dream price is about 75 cents for a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   As in many places in the world, beer is important business in
Africa. Factions in conflict often disagree on their beer brand as
well. Even when soap and salt cannot get through to war zones, beer
often does; In Kisangani, the rebel-held city in Congo, the brewery
is reportedly still going even though the diamond trade has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But the tussle between East African and South African breweries
is in fact a result of peace: South African companies _ for years
unable to do much business outside their borders _ began looking to
expand after the end of apartheid. And African nations that took
sides in the Cold War, as Kenya did with the West, suddenly had to
liberalize their economies when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   South African Breweries, about the world's 10th largest brewer,
has been expanding rapidly by pouring money into dilapidated
breweries around Africa and Eastern Europe. They moved directly
into territory where East African sells beer, investing heavily in
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, its plans are ambitious: to win 20 to 30 percent of
the market in the first few years, up from roughly 2 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we'd like as big a piece of the cake as possible,'' said
Allen McInnes, South African's sales and distribution manager in
Kenya. He suggested that the cake is big enough for two, if the
economy finally improves: Kenyans are now drinking half as much
bottled beer _ about 200 million liters a year _ as they did in
1989. ``It's a very sizable market,'' McInnes said.
</P>
<P>
   East African, which controls 97 percent of the beer market in
Kenya, is taking no chances: It has responded by cutting costs,
introducing a new upscale brand and spending more on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But its most visible strategy has been a blatant play to
patriotism and fear of South Africa's economic might, in a slogan
that equates Tusker with Kenya itself: ``My country, my beer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where people often identify themselves first by
their tribe, then as Kenyans, it seemed a risky strategy,
especially considering that Guinness owns 46 percent of the
company. But Rick Ashley, a Nairobi stockbroker, said the slogan
strikes a chord, particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still _ not only in the beer side of things _ a great
wariness of these South Africans coming in and taking over the
Kenyan economy,'' said Ashley, managing director of Kestrel
Capital. ``If you can make a few shillings out of exploiting that,
good luck to you.''
</P>
<P>
   But interviews around bars in Nairobi _ where people had
definite opinions about the beer wars _ suggest that nationalism
has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care where it comes from,'' said Stanley Kamau, a
50-year-old farmer drinking Castle. ``There is nothing but fear
that Kenya Breweries is having,'' he added, referring to East
African's name until November. ``They have monopolized this market.
Now we are seeing that there is someone who wants to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said they had not yet seen evidence of a price
war, but they are waiting. Officials at both brewers say they want
to avoid that because more than 75 percent of the price of beer
goesto Kenya's exorbitant taxes. But some people think a price war
is inevitable, particularly if South African introduces a brand to
compete with East African's successful, inexpensive brand, Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Binale Wekesa, a 47-year-old private investigator, sat in a bar
the other evening and said he started drinking Castle because he
was happy to have a choice that keeps him happy the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no hangover,'' Wekesa said. ``Tusker, when I take it, I
get a headache _ very much.''

MILD WEATHER HAS RETAILERS IN A SWEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mild weather in December may be great for golfers and outdoor
enthusiasts, but it has some retailers distraught and disconsolate
as the all-important holiday season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers who rely heavily on sales of overcoats, scarves,
and snow tires, ``you couldn't get a weather scenario much worse
than this one,'' said James Gagne, a vice president of Strategic
Weather Services, a Pennsylvania consulting firm that advises
merchants about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a choice between playing golf or going shopping,
which are you going to do?'' said Gagne, before permitting himself
a rare gloat. ``Our long-term forecast accurately predicted this
warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal holiday weather report for many retailers? Cold
temperatures and several light dustings of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow really puts consumers in a Christmas frame of mind,''
Gagne said. ``Ideally, you want some snow, but not enough to keep
people off the roads and out of the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, several retailers blamed unseasonably mild
weather for disappointing November sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among this group was J. Baker Inc., the Canton, Mass. company
that operates such chains as Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to unseasonably warm weather in November, sales of our
cold-weather related product, which represents a large portion of
our sales at this time of year, were negatively impacted,'' said J.
Baker president and chief executive Alan I. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne and retail analysts hasten to add that one retailer's loss
from warm weather may be another's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of boots and overcoats, a consumer might be inclined to
spend money on home furnishings or a new DVD player or a computer
and a big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to holiday sales, ``weather is only part of the
story,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend
Report.
</P>
<P>
   While some apparel retailers struggled in November, others
excelled. The Gap, for one, was hotter than Miami, and balmy
breezes did little to slow the momentum of Wal-Mart Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If November results are any guide, warm weather did little to
dissuade the customers of Talbots Inc. from buying its classic
women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Many department-store chains turned in lackluster November
results, but that's been the case for much of the year, even in
some months when weather patterns were normal, Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   By his lights, it's not so much unseasonable weather that's
keeping consumers out of department stores, but it's a search for
bargains and good value that draws consumers into stores operated
by discount merchants and off-price retailers.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say warm weather will have no effect. As
cold-weather gear stays piled up on store shelves, retailers are
forced to slash prices and spend more money on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News quoted one portfolio manager who speculated that
slow clothing sales from warm weather could shave a nickel off the
fourth-quarter earnings of Federated Department Stores Inc., which
operates such chains as Macy's, and May Department Stores Co.,
which operates Filene's, among other chains.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of warm-weather damage on earnings _ if any _ may
not be fully known until retailers issue fourth-quarter results in
February and March.

&HT;        PENNSYLVANIA TO LOSE SENIORITY ON APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
 By LISA FINE  
 &HT;    c.1998 States News Service   WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 -- Over the
<TEXT>
years, Reps. John Murtha and Joseph McDade gained a reputation in
the Capitol for knowing how to bring home the bacon for their home
state of Pennsylvania.
<P>
   But when the new Congress convenes next month, Murtha,
D-Johnstown, will have a new partner on the House Appropriations
Committee, a perch from which he and McDade snared their funds.
</P>
<P>
   McDade, who was the second highest ranking Republican member of
the committee, is retiring after representing the Scranton region
for 36 years in the House. Joining Murtha, who will move up to be
the second highest ranking Democrat on the committee, from
Pennsylvania will be Rep. John Peterson, R-5th District.
</P>
<P>
   Just reelected to his second term, Peterson was tapped last
month to join the committee that, along with its Senate
counterpart, determines how federal money is doled out for
projects.
</P>
<P>
   What does the change in the makeup of the committee mean for
Pennsylvania?
</P>
<P>
   Seniority is very important,'' said Elizabeth Morra, a spokesman
for Republicans on the committee. ``But there were a lot of people
who wanted to get on to the committee, and Peterson did. That is
really good for Pennsylvania even though they did lose McDade.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Democrats on the committee, Kori Hardin,
said simply, ``the higher the rank, the more power members have for
their states.''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha will miss the rapport he had with McDade, and the clout
his seniority brought for Pennsylvania, Murtha's spokesman Brad
Clemenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the state be affected by the loss of seniority with
McDade's retirement? Oh definitely,'' Clemenson said. ``Now the
seniority will be more spread out. Murtha has said McDade will be
missed. We were very fortunate in Pennsylvania to have had two
members who were so high-ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his appointment Peterson said it ``gives rural
America a more persistent voice in Congress to protect programs and
initiatives that will preserve our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beneficial for a state to have a member on that
committee, but to have had two, and at such high ranks was a status
that will have to be rebuilt,'' Clemenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha and McDade had a formula that included dropping their
partisan politics with each other, developing statewide priorities
for which to push jointly, and also individually in their different
parties, Clemenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan tag-team of Murtha and McDade on the committee
was held up by members from other states as an effective model of
how to pull the federal purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in Washington saw Murtha and McDade as a dream
team.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional watchdog group, called Citizens Against
Government Waste, criticized the two Pennsylvania members for being
``porkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha and McDade ``prove that pigging out at taxpayer expense
can be a bipartisan affair,'' the group said when it handed out
it's 1995 ``Pig Book Award.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, according to the group, their combined tally in
fiscal year 1995 alone topped an estimated $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   The projects for which they garnered funding that year included
$10.5 million for the renovation of the Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard, $1 million for a pilot health program for the needy at
Misericodrdia Hospital, and a $1 million grant to the Small
Business Development Institute in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha's spokesman, Clemenson, said Murtha would surely reach
out to Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Already some common priorities have emerged for Murtha and
Peterson for the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said he will fight in the next Congress to keep the
federal budget balanced and to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, Clemenson said, was a priority for Murtha as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they will work together,'' Clemenson said. ``It would
be in the best interest of the state.''

ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TO PENGUINS DOUBLES, PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In just two years, the number of species of penguins facing
possible extinction has nearly doubled, an international panel of
researchers warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the threat to one of people's most beloved forms of
wildlife, the penguins' rapidly worsening situation may be serving
as an indicator of accelerating human damage to oceans and remote,
fragile areas where penguins breed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 17 principal species of penguins, nine are now considered
``threatened or vulnerable,'' up from just five two years ago when
IUCN-The World Conservation Union conducted its last survey.
</P>
<P>
   At a New England Aquarium conference in Boston Friday,
specialists cited several apparent factors harming populations:
global climate changes, including this past year's wild El
Nino-related weather, oil spills that destroy penguin feather
waterproofing, overfishing of penguin food species, snagging of
penguins in trawler nets, and damaging human development of
Southern Hemisphere coastal areas where penguins live.
</P>
<P>
   The growing threat to penguins is alarming because ``first of
all, they're cute, but aside from that they are a good flagship''
in spotlighting threats to ``other species that people aren't
interested in,'' said Heather Urquhart, a senior aquarium
researcher who has studied penguins in South Africa extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real problem brewing not just for penguins, but for
the world marine environment,'' said Urquhart. She was joined by a
panel of penguin specialists from Australia, South Africa, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, four species have moved onto the list of
``vulnerable'' species that face a 10 percent chance of extinction
within 100 years: the 179,000 remaining African penguins found off
Namibia and South Africa; the 12,500 Humboldt penguins that live on
the coasts of Peru and Chile; and two species that live on islands
north of Antarctica, the Rockhopper and the Royal, which together
total 1.8 million breeding pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Two other species that were considered vulnerable two years ago
are now considered endangered, meaning they face a 20 percent risk
of extinction in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Erect-Crested Penguin, native to the Antipodes
Islands south of New Zealand, whose 170,000 breeding pairs are
threatened by rats eating eggs and chicks, and the 3,000 to 6,000
Galapagos penguins. The fish they eat have been displaced or killed
by El Nino currents.
</P>
<P>
   Extinction threats are calculated based on observed or estimated
population declines in recent years, said Susie Ellis of the IUCN
group.
</P>
<P>
   One mixed blessing for penguins is that more and more people are
traveling to exotic parts of the Southern Hemisphere to see them.
Annual visits to Antarctica, for example, have grown more than
18-fold since the 1950s, to 5,500 people annually, and daily visits
to the famed penguin colony at Punta Espinosa in the Galapagos have
grown by 100 times, according to studies presented at a 1996 Cape
Town conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Peter Dann, research manager
at the Phillip Island Nature Park in Australia. Well-meaning
visitors can disrupt breeding or trample on nests, but the
increasing number of visitors creates a bigger constituency for
efforts to protect penguins. ``It is possible for large numbers of
people to visit these penguin colonies without causing
destruction,'' Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   While human activities are devastating penguins in some areas,
elsewhere people are helping save them. Over the last decade,
environmentalists have pressed for turning old pasturelands on the
south island of New Zealand into prime penguin-nesting territory,
Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an oil spill off South Africa contaminated 10,000
penguins, but more than 4,000 were saved when rescuers cleaned
them, and half of those successfully bred later, said Tony Williams
of Cape Nature Conservation in Cape Town.

MOVING MONEY INTO IRA WOULD BROADEN OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  
 For release Sunday, Dec. 6, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'm 41 and I changed jobs about seven years ago. I currently
have two 401(k) accounts, each worth about $85,000. I'm looking to
retire at age 65. Up until recently, both of the 401(k)s were doing
pretty well, but with current market conditions, I'm wondering how
I should be allocating my funds. In the 401(k) with my current
employer, I have $60,000 in T. Rowe Price Equity Index 500 fund and
the balance in the T. Rowe Price Value fund. The 401(k) from the
previous employer is with Fidelity and has $45,000 in Fidelity
Equity Income II and the rest in Spartan U.S. Equity Index fund. I
contribute about $6,000 a year to the current 401(k). I no longer
contribute to the Fidelity account. Should I retain it or roll it
over into the Price account? Do I have the right mix of funds? What
do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   P.O., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the state of the current market is a good cause
for a change in portfolio allocations, but I do think that you
should be more broadly diversified, whatever the market condition.
Of the four funds you're holding, three are large-cap stock funds,
the exception being T. Rowe Price Value, which holds a mid-cap
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In your letter, you list the various options available in the
two 401(k) plans. My suggestion would be to provide yourself with
an unlimited menu of options by moving the money that's now in the
old 401(k) at Fidelity to a rollover IRA account. You could stay
with Fidelity through this move, and then avail yourself of all
Fidelity's investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, I suggest you retain half of your total
savings in the large-cap market sector, dividing the balance among
international, mid-cap, small-cap and health care positions. You
would need to make no change in the holdings of the current 401(k)
with Price. If you chose Fidelity for the rollover IRA, you could
then put $25,000 in Fidelity Equity Income II and create three
positions of $20,000 each -- in Fidelity Select Health Care,
Fidelity Overseas, and Fidelity Low-Priced Stock.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to maintain the portfolio balance, you should alter the
allocation of your ongoing contributions to the current 401(k) with
T. Rowe Price. I suggest that you direct that 50 percent of the
contributions go to the Price Equity Index 500 fund and the balance
be evenly divided among Price's Value, International Stock, and
Small-Cap Value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you maintain savings at the current rate and if
you achieve average annual returns of 10 percent from your
retirement portfolio, the accounts would have a value of $2,426,789
by the time you are 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 49 and self-employed. I have nothing in place for
retirement and no savings other than $18,000 invested in Vanguard
Windsor II fund and $180,000 in Janus fund. In my mind, this is my
retirement pool. I will also be eligible for Social Security
benefits. I have been adding about $2,000 a month to these funds,
and I can continue this until September of next year, when the
first of my four children goes to college. I then will have a child
in college for each of the next 12 years, so I will stop the $2,000
contributions during that time. Assuming I will not be able to add
much to my present savings, do you recommend any change? I expect
to retire in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   K.N., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, you'll want to read the letter above, because
your situation is much like P.O.'s -- only moreso. You have 100
percent of your holdings in large-cap stocks, and the fact that the
Windsor II portfolio is value-oriented doesn't give me much
comfort. I suggest you reduce your reliance on the large caps to a
maximum of 60 percent of the portfolio, and I would be happier if
it were 50 percent. That's particularly so since you're a few years
P.O's senior, and should want to moderate risk. If you follow that
line of thinking, you might go further still, putting 50 percent in
large caps, 10 percent in each of the smaller market sectors
outlined to P.O., and finishing with a final 10 percent in a solid
balanced fund, of which Janus Balanced and Vanguard Balanced Index
funds are good examples.
</P>
<P>
   Second, unless you left something out, it appears all of this
money is in taxable accounts. If that's the case, I suggest you
begin the process of moving money into tax- deferred accounts. As a
self-employed person, you could establish a SEP-IRA or a Keogh
retirement savings plan that would defer taxes on the portfolio
accumulation until after the funds are withdrawn in retirement.
Another alternative, if you qualify, would be to move the
maximum.$2,000 a year into Roth IRA accounts. If you took the
SEP-IRA or Keogh alternatives, it would reduce your current tax
liability; if you went with the Roth, it would have no effect on
current taxes, but all the money would be tax-free when withdrawn
in retirement. The point is that as long as you have the earnings
to qualify for such plans, you can make the contributions -- the
funds can be withdrawn from these taxable accounts and then
reinvested in the same holdings, but now having a tax-deferred
status.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this important? Well, if you follow the plan you outline,
adding $2,000 a month for nine months and then leaving the pool to
grow with no contributions for another 171 months, assuming average
10 percent annual growth the accumulation would be $900,665.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of this accumulation, the internal growth
would have grown to about $80,000, and such growth is likely to
cause some fairly hefty tax bills -- perhaps hefty enough that at
some point you'd find you had to invade the principal to satisfy
our mutual Uncle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 39 years old and my wife is 42 and we have children aged
three years and six years. We recently sold our house and cash, and
we have the $150,000 proceeds of that transaction. Because of plans
to relocate to Israel in a year or two, we are not sure what type
of investment is best for us now and for the future. What do you
suggest? M.I., Hillsborough, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest extreme caution. Certainly with such a short
investment time frame, you don't even want to think about stocks or
high-yield bonds or anything that provides the prospect of
substantial returns. I'll suggest four options, although I think
the risks associated with one of them probably outweigh the
potential for gains. The slowest track would be a money market
fund. I called Vanguard to get representative yields from various
fixed-income funds, but you can find similar funds and similar
yields at most major mutual fund families.
</P>
<P>
   As this is written, Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund provides
a yield of 4.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping from the very slow track to the slow track, Vanguard's
Short-Term Corporate Bond fund offered a 5.84 percent yield. And
the fastest mover in this slow race is Vanguard GNMA, with a 6.52
percent yield. But to pick up those 68 basis points of interest (a
basis point is one one-hundredth of one percent), you are moving
from short- term investments into the intermediate term, and
assuming the attendant risk. For my money, the 5.84 percent of the
short-term bond fund looks like the best choice of these three.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you wanted to make things simpler still and get
federal insurance on your investment to boot, you could shop around
for the best CD rate available. As this is written, the nation's
best rate on a one-year CD was 5.5 percent. You can check in the
business pages of the New York Times to get the highest rate
currently offered among the nation's banks and the name of the
institution offering it. The advantage of a CD over the short-term
bond fund is not, in my mind, a question of risk but the fact that
with the CD you will have your rate locked in. You could then asses
your situation after the year's up, deciding whether to reinvest
for another year, for six months, or whatever seems best at that
time. But remember, if you go for a one-year CD and then suddenly
decide that you want to make your move to Israel in nine months,
you'll face a premature withdrawal penalty which will probably more
than wipe out any advantage you may have achieved over the money
market or short-term bond fund.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unexpected jump in new jobs and an even more
surprising drop in the unemployment rate helped stabilize Wall
Street and slow the decline in emerging stock markets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The market was led higher by bank and computer stocks after the
Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll jobs increased by
267,000 in October and that the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to
4.4 percent. Forecasters had expected an increase of 169,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The positive news on the economy's strength _ which investors
see as improving the troubled outlook for corporate earnings _
helped stocks recover most of the losses of Thursday, when selling
was accelerated by the plunge in the Brazilian stock market after
lawmakers rejected a key element of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's fiscal reform package. Investors were worried that a
failure of reform in Brazil would lead to economic turmoil across
Latin America that would be very negative for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the major stock indexes still finished below their recent
highs and down for the week. The bullish economic news could not
fully offset the investor concern that led to this week's selling:
negative earnings announcements and projections at a time when the
stock market was back near its record highs.
</P>
<P>
   And the Wall Street rally was not enough to stabilize Brazil's
market. While the Mexican stock market finished 1.6 percent higher
after a 3 percent plunge Thursday, Brazil's Bovespa index ended
lower. After falling 8.9 percent Thursday, it opened higher Friday,
rising as much as 3 percent but finishing with a 1 percent loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.46 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,016.14 while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks climbed 26.60 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,176.74. The
Nasdaq index jumped 48.83 points, or 2.5 percent, to 2,003.16 while
the Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks finished 3.37
points, or 0.9 percent higher, at 398.37.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow was down 3.4 percent, the S&AMP;P 1.3 percent,
the Nasdaq 0.7 percent, and the Russell 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell as investors figured that the
stronger-than-expected job growth would delay any further cuts in
interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board. The price of the
30-year bond fell 12/32 to 103 8/32 while the yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, rose to 5.04 percent from 5.00 percent
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of the stock market over the last two weeks
reflects the difficult position investors are in right now. Those
in the stock market have had a tremendous ride back from the lows
of the summer, with the Nasdaq index up 41 percent since Oct. 8.
The Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates and the key
European central banks did the same on Thursday. Inflation is below
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, these investors are afraid that the
rebound was probably too fast and that the problems in the global
economy that triggered the summer plunge are not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate earnings outlook is also a problem, as was made
clear again with Boeing's announcement this week that its profits
could be 25 percent lower next year than those forecast. The recent
announcements of layoffs, including Boeing's 20,000 and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's 4,100, could point to sluggish growth ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And the setback in Brazil's deficit-cutting efforts Thursday is
a stark reminder that the improved environment of the last two
months can change quickly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Berner, the chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh, said he wondered why the new layoff announcements had
not yet raised concern on Main Street. ``Maybe it is because people
don't think they will have trouble finding a job, with unemployment
so low,'' he said. But he predicted that the corporate earnings
slowdown would continue and that, despite the employment reports,
there would be signs of a U.S. economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, the chief investment officer at Donaldson Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, argued that this week's sell-off was positive. ``It
shows that investors have their feet on the ground and eyes and
ears open to the global issues that remain serious,'' he said. He
also said it proves that the ``tulip mania in Internet stocks has
not spread.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are two remaining risks that could prevent the
stock market from continuing to rally. One is Brazil. Failure to
implement its deficit-reduction program could lead to a run on the
currency, a devaluation and an even bigger global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Japan, which has been moving to reform its banking
system and is trying to invigorate its economy. But, he said, that
effort remains an ``episodic adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin argued that the problems will be dealt with, allowing
stocks to move higher again near the turn of the year. Until then,
he expects a trading range of 8,800 to 9,300 for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging-markets economic
research at Salomon Smith Barney, said the setback in Brazil is not
as bad as the initial stock-market reaction made it appear. ``I
wouldn't regard this as a knockout blow to the Brazilians,'' he
said. ``It could be contained to a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachman said it may be the ``wake-up call'' Cardoso needed,
because it appeared that he was overconfident about the prospects
for his package of $23.5 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the defeat would keep investors guessing for some
time, because substitute measures for the pension tax that was
defeated would not be acted on until next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the delay of the complete Brazilian reform plan
will slow the cutting of interest rates that had been begun by the
central bank. This, in turn, is likely to make Brazil's current
recession worse. ``And as the recession gets deeper, the politics
will be more difficult,'' he said.

BELLAGIO-TRAVEL (Las Vegas) - Bellagio, the most expensive hotel
ever built (for now), stands on the western edge of an 8.5-acre
artificial lake. At regular intervals throughout each evening,
lyrical sprinklers animate the water. Framed through the falling

JERSEY CITY-TRAVEL (Jersey City, N.J.) - Although travel writers
tend to wax eloquent about the big tourist destinations and travel
sections in the nation's newspapers tend to cover mainstream events
with ``what-to-see'' stories emphasizing places with giant smiling
mice or beachfront hotels, a great deal of our travel is in between
the places we actually want to be. Thus, I came to New Jersey, to
find cheap lodging for the nights while spending the days in
Manhatta. But travelers learn that sometimes there are treats where
you least expect them, that come unbidden to you while you wait for

FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Phoenix) - I dozed on the couch Monday night,
watching the wretched Giants flounder against the 49ers. My
thoughts were filled with fluttering passes and stumbling running
backs, missed field goals and blown coverages. In other words, the
National Football League. As I drifted off, I thought about how all
those bad teams had turned my fantasy league into a disaster. How

BANKS ARE RUSHING TO PREPARE FOR LAUNCH OF EURO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ The bank where Salvatore Bellu works is
strongest in Italy's dynamic northern industrial belt, filled with
mighty little multinationals, like Zanussi and Rex, washing-machine
makers in Sweden's big Electrolux appliance group. Come January,
Electrolux is shifting its business to Europe's new single
currency, the euro, and Zanussi and Rex are under orders to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sweden will be outside the euro zone, Electrolux, by
adopting the single currency, expects to reduce costs and avoid
having to hedge against currency fluctuations, all of which should
pay off in increased competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   So if Electrolux wants to pay bills in euros, or transfer funds
from one bank to another, Bellu's bank, Cariverona Banca SpA, will
be ready for it to do so. For two years the bank has been throwing
money and people at the task of getting ready for the euro, or risk
seeing lucrative customers flee to better-prepared competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Cariverona is caught in a rush that is reaching a crucial stage
as the date for introducing the new currency, Jan. 4, nears,
pitting bankers, software specialists and consultants against the
guts of a banking system that serves 290 million Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   If it works _ and major banks are reasonably sure it will _
Europe will take a further giant stride toward overcoming
traditional economic fragmentation by operating under the umbrella
of a uniform monetary policy on most of the old Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by cutting short-term interest rates simultaneously on
Thursday to a nearly uniform 3 percent, the central banks of the 11
nations that will join the euro essentially opened the door to the
new era this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 countries in the European Union, three qualify but are
staying out for now: Britain, Denmark and Sweden. Greece has not
met the requirements. The participants are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, banks in the euro countries will be required by
law to keep track of day-by-day operations _ deposits, withdrawals
and the like _ in euros as well as the local currency, and to make
all bank-to-bank transfers in the new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Regular reporting to national central banks, which will function
under the new European Central Bank somewhat as regional Federal
Reserve Banks operate in the United States, must be in euros. And
since securities markets like the stock exchanges in Paris, Milan
and Frankfurt, Germany, must operate in euros, the banks' brokerage
units will have to be equipped for euro-denominated investments.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, brokerage firms, banks and financial-service companies,
spurred in many cases by euro-prone customers, are racing to get
ready. Most will use the long weekend in early January to fine-tune
systems for the start of business on Monday, Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there will be some problems,'' said Bellu, who has
overseen his bank's drive to the euro, with a sigh of realism.
``Monday the 4th will tell us if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Noyer, deputy chairman of the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, said the central banking system appeared ready to go.
``All the systems have been tested and retested,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``The worst has been imagined, along with the
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and bills will not be introduced until the end of
2001, but starting in January the marks and francs and lire in
circulation will simply be fixed units of the new euro, the banking
system's fundamental yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   And since much commerce in Europe, as in most modern economies,
is conducted without cash, hotels, department stores and most other
consumer-oriented businesses are moving to list prices and take
payment in both euros and local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   American Express will offer credit-card and banking services in
euros and local currencies; in January it will start selling euro
traveler's checks in 21 countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early indications are that large department stores and hotel
chains are ready to price in euros and accept payment,'' said Keith
Meyrick, spokesman for the traveler's-check program in London.
</P>
<P>
   For American travelers to Europe, the advantage is clear. With
11 European currencies locked together in the euro, euro traveler's
checks will be exchangeable for all 11 currencies at a predictable
rate, reducing the need to exchange dollars into local currencies
along the way and thus the risk of losing money if the dollar-euro
exchange rate shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who sees a competitive advantage in the euro will use
euros,'' said Bruno Leresche, who heads the transition to the euro
at Paribas, the big French financial-services group.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question for bankers is the extent to which ordinary
consumers will switch to euros. Will customers want bank accounts
denominated in euros, or request monthly statements in both euros
and local currencies? Partly, that will depend on how soon, say,
employers begin transferring salaries to employees' bank accounts
in euros, or how soon landlords require that rents be paid in
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Given their druthers, many customers do not appear eager to
switch, bankers say. Recently, Paribas surveyed its private
clients, and few even bothered to reply, Leresche said. Customers
reacted, he said, as they do to a new model television set. ``When
I see my neighbor get one,'' he said in describing the common
attitude, ``I'll buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, banks that want to be competitive are striving to be
ready. They are tailoring computers and software to enable monthly
statements to be issued in euros, or in a combination of euros and
local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a bank customer who regularly receives deposits on a
French franc account in German marks and Spanish pesetas might
request that monthly statements give the total euro amounts plus a
breakdown into local currencies. Some banks are already gearing
their computer software to be able to provide such information.
</P>
<P>
   And well-prepared banks are trying to persuade customers to make
the switch to euros sooner rather than later. Paribas, Leresche
said, spent $71 million preparing. Come January, it will offer all
services in French francs, euros or a combination of currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Over two years, Cariverona invested $8 million to overhaul
30,000 software applications, said Bellu, including some that
prepare monthly statements and others for making interbank
payments, and to train personnel to explain the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2002, Deutsche Bank will have spent $295 million for
euro conversion, according to Victor Bruns, its euro project
manager. He figures the bank has burned up ``1,200 man-years'' on
the project. ``We believe we will make it, but a switchover of this
magnitude is a unique thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, the U.S. technology consultants, estimates that
Europe's total investment between 1996 and 2002 to introduce the
euro will be as much as $400 billion.

 VERONA, Italy: $400 billion.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts agree that much has already been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been mostly a people and systems challenge, and overall,
it's been very well met,'' said Keith Stock, head of A.T. Kearney's
global financial institutions group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given the costs, many banks are trying to kill two birds with
one stone, eliminating the so-called Y2K millennium bugs from
computers while preparing for the euro. Despite shortages of
consultants and software experts that have driven up the cost of
services, what makes the situation manageable, bankers say, is that
not everything must be done at once.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have concentrated efforts on absolute requirements, like
interbank payments. Paribas' Leresche said French banks had done
``virtual transfers'' on recent weekends to test transfers among
banks. The banks, he said, distinguish between fundamental snags in
the system and those that simply make it slower or less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no fundamental bugs,'' he said, reflecting a
widespread impression in other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   What troubles bankers much more, however, is the euro's impact
on their income, a problem not fixable with new software.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from foreign exchange, traditionally a lucrative source
of profit, will dry up. Italy's banking association predicts that
gross profits in the industry will drop an average 37 percent after
the euro. Cariverona says it will shed 80 percent of its
foreign-exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fiscal belt-tightening required to qualify for the
euro has led to lower interest rates, narrowing the spread between
the relatively low interest banks pay on deposits and what they
earn by reinvesting the deposited assets in high-yielding
securities, like government bonds, thus squeezing a second major
source of bank income.
</P>
<P>
   To offset this decline in traditional income sources, many banks
hope to expand investment banking. But experts agree that the
process will create many winners and losers, leading to further
bank concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In France, small rural banks with few corporate customers are
moving more slowly than banks in Paris. In Italy, banks in the
south, still struggling with losses accumulated in the early 1990s,
are far from ready. Experts say most will be able to execute
essential functions, like interbank transfers, but may not be
prepared to offer customers extra services, like dual currency
statements or other euro-denominated services.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the government-owned bank
whose executives have been getting it ready for an offering of
shares on the stock market, will be ready to meet the requirements
for the euro, but they have had little time to push a euro strategy
much beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Often small banks are under little pressure from corporate
customers to change. ``Among Italian small businesses, the degree
of preparation is very low,'' said Angelo Peretti, an economist at
Cariverona. They view the euro, he said, ``mainly as an accounting
and monetary problem, not as a strategic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, General Motors' European unit told 15,000
suppliers across Europe, many of them small and medium-sized
companies, that they should be ready by January to quote prices in
euros. Hans De Vriese, director of cost management for GM's
European purchasing, said that 95 percent replied that they were
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, big corporate customers have told Volkswagen that
they want prices in euros as soon as possible. Beginning in
January, VW will comply, and it has passed the message to its
suppliers. Brigitte Dietz, who heads VW's push to the euro, said
the company hoped to switch from dollars and German marks as its
operating currencies to the euro. Still, she said, ``We won't force
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very governments that imposed the euro are
the biggest obstacles to its wider use.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Italy said its tax-collecting and
social-security offices would not be ready to deal in euros until
2002; in Belgium and Germany, local and federal tax offices and
benefits agencies have said the same. Thus, for internal
accounting, VW will introduce the euro ``at the latest possible
date, in order to spare resources,'' Ms. Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving sooner, she said, would mean ``still having to do
everything in German marks, and that would cost two to three times
as much.''

RENO SAID TO LEAN AWAY FROM NAMING PROSECUTOR ON CLINTON ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is leaning against the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate whether
President Clinton and his aides evaded federal election laws when
they directed a multi-million dollar political advertising campaign
in the 1996 election, law enforcement officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that senior advisers to Reno, who must make a
decision by Monday, have urged her not to seek the appointment of a
special prosecutor. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the
officials reasoned that a successful criminal prosecution on the
advertisements would be unlikely because Clinton and his aides
relied extensively on lawyers' advice in planning and carrying out
the advertisements campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats funneled millions of dollars to state parties to
finance the campaign advertisements, which under the law could only
publicize generic party messages, not specific candidates. But
auditors at the Federal Election Commission concluded that the
advertisements did directly benefit the Clinton-Gore campaign with
electioneering messages on behalf of the President.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that the issue advertisements violated election laws
were among the first to reach Reno after Clinton's re-election.
Groups like Common Cause, a public interest group, said that both
Democrats and Republicans ignored the law and spent millions to
help their presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the election commission's staff said that
Democrats and Republicans each should repay millions. The auditors
Tuesday released a report concluding that the campaigns of Clinton
and Republican nominee Bob Dole had illegally benefited from issue
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The staff recommended that the Clinton campaign committee be
forced to repay the government $7 million and that the Dole
campaign repay $17.7 million. But the FEC, made up of three
Democrats and three Republicans beholden to their respective
parties, is unlikely to accept the staff findings, several
officials have said. It's also unclear whether the Justice
Department will issue a separate finding on the legality of
financing the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   To prove a crime occurred, prosecutors would have to show
``specific intent,'' meaning whether Clinton and his aides
knowingly violated the law. They said that would be an impossible
burden given the heavy input from lawyers who said that the
advertisements were legal. As a result, they said, Reno lacks a
basis to find probable wrongdoing, a requirement of requesting an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Reno would seek an outside prosecutor to
investigate the issue advertisements is the third independent
counsel matter Reno faced in recent weeks. Campaign finance lawyers
have predicted that her decisions would determine whether an
independent counsel would ever investigate how the Democrats
financed Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Reno found insufficient evidence to seek and
independent prosecutor to investigate whether Vice President Al
Gore lied about his role in campaign fund raising during the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this week Reno delayed a decision on whether former
White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes lied about his
actions in labor dispute at a California walnut processing plant in
behalf of the teamsters union. Reno obtained a 60-day extension
that could postpone her decision until late January.
</P>
<P>
   What Reno decides on the issue represents a potentially pivotal
decision because it touches on Clinton's own activities, rather
than his aides. The president managed the details of the campaign,
at times supervising the writing of scripts for the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC auditors reviewed dozens of the issue ads and found that
three of the Democratic Party's ads were the same as Clinton's ads.
The auditors found that 37 ads appeared to convey electioneering
messages in behalf of Clinton.

LINEBACKERS COULD DECIDE BIG 12 CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A broken collarbone has reduced Texas A&AMP;M
quarterback Randy McCown to the role of interested bystander during
today's Big 12 Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   But before Thursday's X-rays ruled him out as a participant,
McCown spent hours studying videotapes of the Wildcats' defense.
The more he saw, the more it reminded him of the unit he faced
every day in practice.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of both defenses, said McCown, will be the
difference-makers who will tell the tale of today's matchup between
Texas A&AMP;M (10-2), ranked 10th in The Associated Press poll, and No.
2 Kansas State (11-0) at 3:30 p.m. in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the top linebackers in the nation will be on
that field,'' McCown said. ``I think they'll determine the game.
Their defense goes like their linebackers go. If they play well,
their whole defense plays well. It's the same with our guys. The
rest of the team feeds off of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown's observation is far from classified information. Of the
seven starting linebackers in today's contest, five were chosen as
all-conference performers by Big 12 coaches.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen, who leads the league with 130 tackles, is a
finalist for the Butkus Award, given annually to the nation's top
linebacker. All three of Kansas State's starters were nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the statistics of both starting units and you've got 598
tackles, 96 of them for losses. That doesn't even include the 34.5
sacks. Or the 14 forced fumbles, 11 recoveries and six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes in the battle of Linebacker U. vs. Linebacker U.,
where the majority of big plays among the Big 12's two stingiest
defenses tend to be made by the guys who bridge the gap between the
defensive line and the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the teams are different in their approach. Kansas State
plays a 4-3 alignment, A&AMP;M a 3-4. The Wildcats blitz continually,
leaving their cornerbacks in man-to-man coverage throughout most of
the game. A&AMP;M picks its spots with its blitzes, allowing defensive
backs to vary between man and zone coverages.
</P>
<P>
   Other than aggression and talent, the common thread for both
units is experience. Kansas State's starters _ middle linebacker
Jeff Kelly and outside linebackers Mark Simoneau and Travis Ochs _
have played together for the past 24 games. A&AMP;M has two first-year
starters in its four-linebacker set (Roylin Bradley and Cornelius
Anthony), but the two standouts, Nguyen and Warrick Holdman, have
played together for the past 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for experience,'' Kansas State coach
Bill Snyder said. ``Our guys have a great understanding of our
defense. They know how to tie the back end together with the front
four. I expect our linebackers to play extremely hard and be
extremely responsible for what we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the A&AMP;M people feel the same way about their guys.
You look at them on film and they play hard. They run extremely
well. All of them are good at handling their responsibilities.
There's no weak link among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum echoes similar sentiments about the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the way K-State plays, especially at linebacker,''
Slocum said. ``They'd be very comparable to ours, and we're real
proud of ours. Of the teams we've played this year, no one's had a
better group of linebackers than Kansas State.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Nguyen, the emotional leaders of the respective units,
try to downplay comparisons. But both agree the matchup adds luster
to the game. Shane Lechler, the A&AMP;M punter, is intrigued enough
that he intends to focus most of his attention on the movements of
the linebackers rather than the movement of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm done playing football, I want to be a coach
somewhere,'' Lechler said. ``So, I like to watch the great players
on both teams to try to learn from how they play and how they
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will be a straight dogfight on defense, and the
linebackers will be at the heart of it. They've got Kelly. We've
got Dat and Warrick. There should be a lot of big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough, Lechler suggested, to produce a Big 12 version of one of
those ``NFL's Greatest Hits'' videos.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is earning a Big 12 championship. And, if
this matchup will determine today's winner, as McCown suggests, one
question remains unanswered: which group is better?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're equal,'' A&AMP;M tailback Dante Hall said. ``I just hope
our guys play better on that particular day.''

FRANCE AND BRITAIN AGREE ON NEED FOR INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN DEFENSE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Britain accepted a longstanding French proposal Friday
that calls for the 15-nation European Union to be able to conduct
military actions on its own in situations where the United States
and other NATO allies do not want to become involved.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, called historic by Prime Minister Tony Blair,
marked a shift from traditional British reluctance even to consider
any defense arrangements outside NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The British defense minister, George Robertson, said that a
stronger European defense was something the United States and other
NATO allies had long been calling for. He said the agreement
``means a strengthening of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials said the accord, reached as Britain and France
prepared for meetings of NATO foreign ministers and European Union
leaders next week in Brussels and Vienna, would not lead to the
creation of a new military power to rival the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But because it represents a substantial concession to President
Jacques Chirac of France, who failed at a European summit meeting
in Amsterdam last year to get Blair to commit Britain to a
timetable for creating a full-fledged defense arm for the European
Union separate from NATO, French officials were ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make a major step forward,'' Chirac said after
the meeting with Blair in the French port of St.-Malo Friday. The
French leader called the agreement ``an affirmation of the European
Union on the international scene.''
</P>
<P>
   In a five-point statement, the two nations asserted that ``the
European Union needs to be in a position to play its full role on
the international stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To this end,'' the statement said, ``the Union must have the
capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military
forces, the means to decide to use them and a readiness to do so,
in order to respond to international crises.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that European Union countries like France and Britain
that are also members of NATO would act only in conformity with
their obligations to NATO. It left open how any distinct European
defense capability would be built up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Union must be given appropriate structures and a capacity
for analysis of situations, sources of intelligence and a
capability for relevant strategic planning, without unnecessary
duplication,'' the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union could get those things, the agreement said,
as part of a European pillar within the NATO alliance, something
the United States and the allies have been working to strengthen
for years.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the European Union _ Ireland, Austria,
Sweden and Finland _ do not belong to NATO and are not likely to
join anytime soon. Alternatively, a European defense structure
could emerge from the 43-year-old Western European Union, a
long-dormant group awakened by the end of the Cold War, though only
10 of the 15 European Union countries belong to it and it has few
military assets.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the European Union could undertake military actions
by itself with the forces of its member states.
</P>
<P>
   But since building up an effective command structure would be
redundant and take billions of dollars, which no member state has,
the most likely course, both French and British officials privately
agree, is to use the military headquarters, communications systems,
command structures and forces that NATO already has, and put some
of them under European command during operations that the United
States prefers to stay out of.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what Britain and France called for Friday was an
idea France vetoed in 1954: a ``European Defense Community'' whose
inclusion of German armed forces was too much for the French to
accept so soon after World War II. The United States and Britain
then agreed to bring Germany into NATO instead.
</P>
<P>
   To some NATO diplomats in Brussels, the agreement Friday showed
that the United States would be making a mistake if it assumed that
Europe had no alternative except to follow Washington's lead in
finding a strategy to deal with problems like those in Bosnia,
Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a French-British declaration, not a European position,
and probably a lot of people in Bonn, Rome and elsewhere are
puzzling about just what it means,'' said a diplomat, speaking on
the condition of anonymity. ``The United States has been calling
for years for a stronger European defense capability, with budgets
to back it up and the political will to deploy it,'' the diplomat
said. ``But an `autonomous' defense capability, that is something
that will worry Washington a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, for his part, appears to have learned some sharp lessons
from Europe's performance in dealing with the crisis caused by
Serbian attacks against civilians in the province of Kosovo this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He told his fellow European leaders in Austria in October that
Europe had shown itself to be ``dithering and indecisive,'' all too
often forced to turn to the United States for help in convincing
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that he would face
devastating NATO air strikes if he did not order Serbian forces to
stop their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Balkans crisis, the Europeans followed a pattern
in which vows of unity have been splintered by disagreements,
leaving the United States to step in and take a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   European Union leaders agreed in Amsterdam in June of last year
to keep trying to achieve unity in dealing with security issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one British leader said Friday: ``I'm absolutely certain
Tony Blair would never agree to arrangements that gave Europe or
anybody else veto power over British decisions on when to use
British military force, any more than the French would agree to it
over their use of their own military decisions.''

<P>
   The world of oil may appear to be falling apart, but in oil
things are never quite as bad or as good as they seem. Huge mergers
have thrown the industry into confusion as oil prices have dipped
to historic bottoms. Yet, if history is any guide, investors who
write off energy will miss opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   True, there has been a wave of bad news: growth in demand has
been tempered by the Asian economic crisis, winters have been
exceedingly mild and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries appears hopelessly unable to rein in production.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, oil is a strategic commodity governed by some
constants. ``The oil business is a cyclical industry, where prices
will go up and down,'' said John Lichtblau, chairman of the
Petroleum Research Industry Foundation. ``But oil is also a growth
industry and an essential commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have any doubts about the growth part, just consider what
will happen when every other Chinese and Indian family begins,
sometime in the near future, to buy its own car, refrigerator and
air-conditioner. There may not be enough energy to satisfy demand
in two markets that will have more than a billion consumers each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, all the bad news _ the mild winter, the Asian crisis
and OPEC's problems _ are one-time factors,'' said Ernst von
Metzsch, a partner at Wellington Management, a Boston money
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide demand for oil is expected to rise 0.5 percent this
year, compared with an average annual rate of 2.3 percent over the
past decade. Regardless of the bad news and predictions that West
Texas Intermediate will soon trade in the middle single digits a
barrel, many OPEC experts expect oil prices to rise gradually to
$17 a barrel within a year, versus $11 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when it comes to oil, think long term. And,
don't be surprised if oil prices double in a relatively short
period.
</P>
<P>
   In the present atmosphere of excitement and confusion fostered
by the recent Exxon-Mobil merger announcement and the earlier
British Petroleum-Amoco deal, the best strategy is to keep a fair
share of your energy portfolio in huge multinationals.
Specifically, that means the big five: Exxon Mobil, Royal
Dutch/Shell, British Petroleum, Chevron and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group of big international integrated companies is the
most interesting right now,'' said Paul Ting, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Ting predicts that Exxon's shares, now at $71.50, will hit $85
in 12 to 18 months, and that Texaco, now at $56.3125, may hit $70
in that same period. For Chevron, the target price is $88, versus
$82 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you misjudge the timing with this group, there is
always another day,'' Ting said. ``All of them have over the past
year cleaned up their balance sheet, bringing debt-to-capital
ratios from 40 percent closer to 30 percent, and all are still in
an acquisition mode.''
</P>
<P>
   With the big oil stocks, investors get paid to wait for any
price rise. Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have yields of 2.29 percent,
3.20 percent and 2.98 percent, respectively, versus just 1.31
percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated structure of these companies _ production,
refining, and retailing as well as plastics businesses _ gives them
a measure of protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has a self-correcting mechanism,'' said Karl
Bandtel, a partner at Wellington Management.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition fever also provides opportunities. ARCO, for
example, which has big oil reserves in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay as well
as oil and gas in Indonesia, is one possible target. Its shares
trade at $67, but Bandtel said they could climb as high as $80 the
next 12 to 18 months even if ARCO isn't acquired.
</P>
<P>
   More risky are small independent United States exploration
companies. Many of their stock prices are off 50 percent or more
the past 12 months. It's the same for oil-service industries like
drilling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherford International, for example, has fallen from over $50
a share a year ago to $17.50 on Friday. Bandtel said, however, that
it could double in a year if demand for services picks up, as he
expects it to.
</P>
<P>
   Even now there are buys, mainly in companies largely involved in
natural gas, which has fallen less than oil. Alberta Energy, which
trades at $21.3125, could hit $26 within a year, according to von
Metzsch.
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts and managers suggest avoiding higher-cost
oil producers in North America _ there are scores of them in Texas,
Oklahoma, California, Louisiana and Alberta. They may need oil
prices of $18 a barrel to make a profit _ a level that may not be
seen for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Two events to watch: the fourth-quarter earnings announcements
of oil companies, coming in January, and the OPEC meeting in late
March. The former will show how well individual companies are
coping with low oil prices; the latter will show whether a
seriously weakened OPEC has the will to adopt a new strategy for
cutting production.
</P>
<P>
   But even if OPEC cannot discipline itself, some experts believe
industry mergers and low oil prices will help it, as small
companies exit the business of pumping oil in expensive places like
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these mergers curtail production outside the OPEC area,
they could in fact help, not hurt the whole energy industry,'' said
Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a Geneva-based energy strategist and a
former energy minister of Algeria.

NIGERIANS TO VOTE IN ELECTIONS MILITARY SAYS WILL LEAD TO
DEMOCRACY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Tens of millions of Nigerians are expected to
vote in local government elections on Saturday in the first of
three elections that the military rulers have promised will lead to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The borders will be closed during the voting hours, officials
said, to prevent candidates from paying foreigners to vote
illegally. In Lagos, the largest city, the authorities announced
that most cars would be banned from the streets and that
pedestrians would be limited to areas near voting centers.
</P>
<P>
   As dancers and musicians hired by candidates to drum up support
played their last songs Friday in the neighborhoods of Lagos the
mood seemed to vary from deep skepticism about the fairness and
relevance of the election to great hope that Nigeria, where 1 in 6
Africans live, is finally turning a new page.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, though, appeared more preoccupied with the price
of fuel, which has skyrocketed, to $4.30 a gallon from $2.60 a few
days ago. The sudden long lines at gasoline stations seemed to
symbolize the problems of the sixth-largest oil producer in the
world, but where widespread corruption has led to chronic gasoline
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I registered and will vote because I want the present system
to change,'' Faith Omozejele, 27, a shop owner, said. ``Do you like
the system we are running? No fuel, no light, no roads, no water.
Transportation is too costly.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the elections are seats in 774 municipal
governments. Nigeria will hold elections for statewide seats next
month and for the presidency in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the results from the voting on Saturday will determine which
parties qualify to run in the bigger races, and they should provide
an early glimpse into how fair the presidential elections will be
in this country of deep ethnic, religious and regional divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are being held after six months of turbulence.
Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruthlessly ruled for five years and turned
Nigeria into an international pariah, died suddenly in June. Adding
to the chaos was the sudden death in July of Moshood K.O. Abiola,
who had appeared set to win a presidential election in 1993 before
the military annulled it. Abiola was imprisoned on charges of
treason in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Discontent has been spreading in southeastern Nigeria, where the
oil is produced but which has been badly neglected by the northern
military rulers. Members of ethnic groups in the Niger River Delta
seized oil stations that belong to Western oil companies, and
members of the Ijaw group in one oil town, Warri, have threatened
to disrupt the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, pledged a
transition to a civilian government by May, released political
prisoners and undertook other changes that have earned him good
reviews in the West. Abubakar also created the Independent National
Electoral Commission, appointing as its chairman a respected judge,
Ephraim Akpata, to oversee the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Irregularities have been reported in registering voters. Almost
60 million voters' cards were issued. But the commission said it
could not account for 20 million, suggesting that some candidates
stole cards.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Ehiakhame, 32, a student, was one of many people who
said she had been unable to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made several attempts to register,'' Miss Ehiakame said.
``But each time I was told that there were no cards. I wonder why,
because sometimes I got to the voters' registration center as early
as 10 o'clock in the morning. I wonder why I have to be
disenfranchised.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Western officials who are observing the elections predicted that
difficulties might arise from logistical problems and some
corruption, though not extensive fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of 45 Nigerian monitoring groups, said he
thought that the elections would generally be fair. ``But there's
no doubt that there's some credibility problem,'' Nwankwo added.
</P>
<P>
   Segun Jegede, director of a human rights organization, the
Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, said his organization
would not participate in the elections because he believed that the
process was fundamentally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no constitution on which the election is going to be
based,'' Jegede said, voicing the common criticism that the
government has not called a national convention to settle on a
constitution and other problems. ``I think monitoring will only be
giving credibility to this fraudulent process.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring organizations and Nigerian newspapers have complained
that the candidates of the nine parties have talked little about
the issues, focusing instead on the well-known figures that head
each party. Some politicians have even acknowledged the criticism,
though typically about their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Alliance for Democracy are more concerned about
raising the fundamental issues of restructuring, because it's at
the heart of the problems of this country, while the other parties
prefer to skirt it,'' said Adeola Adefolabi, who is running for
chairmanship of a district here.
</P>
<P>
   Adefolabi's party is one of nine parties that are running
candidates. Made up of longtime opponents of military rule, the
party is considered strong support in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   That party and two others, the People's Democratic Party and the
All People's Party, have the greatest national appeal.

ANTI-SODOMY LAWS BEING CHALLENED IN MANY STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ With pink-and-white curtains and a flowered
comforter, Elena Picado's bedroom seems an unlikely place to launch
a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But because Picado sleeps there with a woman, her bedroom is
regularly the scene of a crime _ an illegal act of lovemaking and,
in effect, civil disobedience. As often as they choose, Picado and
her partner, April Armstrong, flout an Arkansas law that bans
homosexual sex.
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, a conviction on the misdemeanor charge could
cost Picado her two children and her job as a junior high school
Spanish teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law says that because I am a lesbian, the government can
simply come in and take away what is most important to me in the
world. That is a terror to me, a terror I live with every day,''
said Picado, 43, one of seven plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging
Arkansas's anti-sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is one of five states that ban sexual contact between
consenting members of the same sex. Another 13 states outlaw
consensual oral and anal sex, regardless of participants' gender or
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But those anti-sodomy statutes, which existed in all 50 states
as recently as the 1960s, are coming under unprecedented pressure
from a wave of legal and legislative attempts to repeal limits on
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Though prosecutions are rare, gay and civil rights activists say
the laws can be used as a threat by overzealous prosecutors.
Moreover, they say the laws are a jumping-off point for
discrimination in areas such as housing, child custody and
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay people living in these states have to live constantly with
the fear of enforcement and the risk that their lives could be
turned upside-down at any point by an arrest for engaging in sexual
intimacy with a loved one,'' said Suzanne B. Goldberg, a lawyer
with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is
representing Picado and the other plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups have taken note of the recent challenges and
have responded with alarm. They praise the use of anti-sodomy laws
to keep children out of homosexual households, and to discourage
behavior they say undermines traditional marriage bonds and may
increase the risk of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-sodomy laws are sound laws, designed to promote behaviors
that are profitable, beneficial and fruitful, and to discourage
behaviors that are damaging to both the society and to the
individual,'' said Steven Schwalm, senior analyst with the Family
Research Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But after long bouts of frustration and setbacks for activists _
most notably a 1986 US Supreme Court ruling that said the US
Constitution does not protect private homosexual conduct _ attempts
to repeal anti-sodomy laws have recently gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned that state's
anti-sodomy law, a ruling that was particularly notable because the
Georgia law was the subject of the US Supreme Court's 1986
decision. Although the US Supreme Court found no constititutional
protection for homosexual conduct, the Georgia Supreme Court said
the state constitution does offer such protection for private,
consensual sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia ruling followed similar decisions in Tennessee,
Kentucky and Montana, as well as actions by voters in Nevada and
the District of Columbia to repeal anti-sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Court challenges also are pending in Louisiana, Maryland and
Minnesota, and gay activists have been buoyed by what they consider
an ideal case to test the law in Texas. In September, a false
report of an armed intruder led authorities to a Houston apartment;
when a deputy sheriff walked through what he said was an unlocked
door, he saw two gay men having sex and promptly arrested them. Gay
activists say the case underscores the threat to privacy; their
challenge to the law could take several years.
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm, meanwhile, said he was suspicious that the Texas
incident was a setup designed to test the law, though he had no
evidence to back that assertion. He also decried the Georgia
ruling, noting that it was based on a case involving a man who had
oral sex with his 17-year-old niece.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Georgia court says that's fine and gay activists cheer. I
don't understand why that's a cause for celebration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all repeal efforts have succeeded, however. Previous court
challenges have failed in Texas, and a Missouri court said the
state had the right to ban oral and anal sex to protect public
health by slowing the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legislative efforts are under way in several other
states, including Massachusetts, where attempts to remove the
anti-sodomy law have failed repeatedly in the Legislature. Another
effort will be made when the new legislative session begins next
month, said Gary Buseck, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has two laws at issue: one called a ``crime
against nature'' statute carries a punishment of up to 20 years in
prison; the other is a ban on ``unnatural and lascivious acts''
punishable by up to five years in prison and fines of up to $1,000,
gay activists said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the law under challenge is a misdemeanor punishable
by up to 12 months in prison and a fine of $1,000. For the seven
plaintiffs, the immediate concern is less about prosecution than
the message the law sends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law is an attack on my very being,'' said Vernon Stokay,
38, a graphic designer. ``I am a homosexual. What other kind of sex
am I going to have? The very moment I decide to do this very
private thing, they say I am a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Robin White, 42, a technical writer, has a lease that
says she could be evicted for committing any criminal act in her
apartment; a sodomy case against her, she said, could land her on
the street. ``The message is that you are a second-class citizen,
even though you pay the same taxes, contribute to the community and
are a good person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Randy McCain, 42, a minister at a nondenominational
Christian church, said he was dismissed from a different church
several years ago when he declared his homosexuality. He said
anti-sodomy laws contribute to efforts to keep gays in the closet.
``When you have a good, wholesome, loving relationship, you want to
celebrate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A significant factor in the drive to repeal anti-sodomy laws was
a 1996 case in which the US Supreme Court said a Colorado law was
unconstitutional because it effectively categorized homosexuals as
``unequal to everyone else.'' Gay activists quickly recognized that
that language could be used to build the case against the
anti-sodomy laws in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas,
where the statutes apply only to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   That avenue is not open to activists in Massachusetts and the
other 12 states because their laws are applied regardless of sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors have defended anti-sodomy laws as a useful
secondary charge in rape and other sexual assault cases: If a
defendant admits to an allegedly forced sex act, but claims it was
consensual, he or she could still face penalties for violating the
anti-sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters of anti-sodomy laws are more blunt about their
perceived value. When the Georgia ruling was announced, the
top-ranking Republican in the state Senate told reporters: ``I
think we ought to be able to ban gay sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas case is now before the state Supreme Court, which
is being asked to rule on procedural grounds whether to allow a
trial on the issues. Arkansas officials have yet to take a public
position on the merits, said Tim Gauger, an assistant attorney
general who is handling the case.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that his office could find no instances of
prosecutions under the law for private, consensual acts in the last
70 years.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good enough for Picado and the other plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if there was a slavery law on the books that was never
implemented? Do you think any black person could sleep at night?''
Picado asked. ``I wish the people who want this law would step into
my house. I'll invite everybody into my bedroom. They would find
the same things they find in their own bedrooms. Maybe that would
help them understand.''

ISSUES OF TAIWAN'S IDENTITY AT STAKE IN TAIPEI MAYORAL RACE

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ In a country that has enjoyed democracy for
less than a decade, an epic mayoral battle is being fought here in
the capital between two rising political stars. The battle has
drawn the attention of Beijing and Washington, where officials
worry that the result could upset Taiwan's precarious standoff with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   In a dead-even race, re-election of the incumbent on Saturday
could presage a national victory in coming years for his
pro-independence party, many here believe, which would mean serious
new tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Victory by the challenger, on the other hand, could be the
salvation of the long-ruling Nationalist Party and its way of
getting along with mainland China: to operate like an independent
country but swear homage to the long-term goal of unifying.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates are both handsome, articulate and
youthful. The incumbent, Chen Shui-bian, 47, is from the upstart
Democratic Progressive Party, which is committed to the eventual
goal of Taiwan's independence. His challenger is Ma Ying-jeou, 48,
of the Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The results are expected to influence the presidential election
16 months from now, in March 2000, only the second democratic
election for president in Taiwan's history. Then voters will decide
whether to keep power in the hands of the Nationalist Party, or
Kuomintang, which has ruled Taiwan since Chiang Kai-shek fled the
mainland in 1949 but whose grip has begun to slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kuomintang wants to use this race to stop the momentum of
the Democratic Progressive Party, and especially of Chen
Shui-bian,'' said Chu Yun-han, a political expert at National
Taiwan University. ``So many people see this as a bellwether for
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei mayoral race, the most important in nationwide
elections for the legislature and city offices, has been argued
largely over platitudes and the nitty-gritty of urban planning,
with some silly costumes and mud-slinging along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface are sensitive issues of national
identity, including Taiwan's relations with a Communist mainland
that calls it renegade, and the internal cleavage between the
majority here whose ancestors moved from the mainland long ago and
the ``mainlanders,'' whose families escaped to Taiwan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party remains rich and well organized at the
local level. It still controls the presidency and is expected to
retain control of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The popular president, Lee Teng-hui, who will step down in 2000,
has skillfully carved a separate niche for Taiwan in the world. But
the party remains formally committed to eventual reunification with
the mainland, a formula that has appeased Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The rival Democratic Progressive Party, with Chen as its
brightest light, calls for Taiwan's independence. Mindful of
Beijing's threats, Chen and other leaders promise not to act rashly
if they gain power and to seek a referendum on future relations
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's success would certainly raise tensions with
Beijing, which cares deeply about even symbolic gestures on this
issue. And it would cause jitters in Washington, which fears being
drawn into any conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns seemed distant this week as the city took on a
carnival air and residents reveled in the process of elections.
Caravans blasting pleas from loudspeakers roamed streets lined with
banners promoting the multitude of candidates. Fireworks crackled
on the sidewalks, announcing candidates' frenetic hand-shaking
tours of markets and parks.
</P>
<P>
   As an incumbent and a native-born Taiwanese, credited with
improving the quality of city life by acting decisively to speed
traffic and clean up vice, Chen should be a shoo-in. He faces a
formidable challenger, though, in Ma, a former justice minister and
a Harvard Law School graduate who embodies vigor and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate is Wang Chien-shien, 60, of the New Party, a
breakaway group from the Nationalists that is more strongly
committed to reunification with the mainland. He is expected to
take no more than about 10 percent of the votes, mostly at Ma's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nationalists fear that if Chen wins this time, he would be
nearly unbeatable if he ran for president. A victory by Chen may
also throw the Nationalists into turmoil as the party struggles to
agree on a presidential candidate strong enough to take him on.
</P>
<P>
   If Ma wins in this, his first try at elective office, he will
certify himself as a future top candidate. While the Nationalists
are extremely unlikely to let someone so green run for president in
2000, if he blunts Chen he would boost the confidence of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The core question of Taiwan's identity has scarcely been
mentioned in the campaign. This is, of course, a race for mayor,
but the candidates have a stronger reason for avoiding the issue:
It could cost them votes.
</P>
<P>
   Both have large solid blocs of support, so they are dueling for
an undecided middle of nearly one in five voters. And that middle,
said John Hsieh, a political scientist at National Political
University here, is part of the large majority of residents who
prefer the status quo: to behave like an independent country but
not to rile China by formally declaring it.
</P>
<P>
   This point was illustrated by Hsieh Tsai-ze, a 44-year-old
noodle seller in the Songshan Market in Taipei, who was happy to
shake Chen's hand this week as the candidate and cameras raced by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him because he does what he thinks is right,'' Hsieh
said after the whirlwind passed. But on the question of Taiwan's
independence, he is prudent. ``It's not necessary,'' he said. ``The
current situation is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For a contest so important, the mayoral campaign has been
strangely devoid of major issues. Chen's slogan is, ``We have a
beautiful dream, let's continue on with it.'' At vibrant rallies
this week, in front of giant posters on which the Mona Lisa,
Charlie Chaplin and Sun Yat-sen were portrayed as endorsing him,
Chen asked, ``Are you better off today than you were four years
ago?'' His supporters responded with a loud ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Ma, in turn, has tried to belittle Chen's achievements. ``Taipei
needs a better mayor,'' he repeats, saying citizens feel less
secure and that future prosperity is in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, who was born in Hong Kong after his parents fled the
Communists and then moved to Taiwan when he was a year old, has had
to counter another identity problem, reflecting the fading but
still resonant cleavage between so-called mainlanders and the
majority. The native-born Taiwanese have not forgotten their brutal
subjugation by the invading Nationalists, and sometimes suspect
that mainlanders have not embraced a Taiwanese identity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how important this ethnic factor will be, but at
rallies Ma sometimes breaks into an awkward version of the
Taiwanese dialect to prove his roots. He has adopted as his
campaign slogan, ``Taiwan First, Taipei First,'' and at the
suggestion of Lee, the president, who was born here, he has started
calling himself a New Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   At Ma's final rally, Lee sought to lay to rest the ethnic issue
and some bitter memories. ``It's time to leave behind the tragedies
of the past and step into the 21st century,'' Lee shouted to a
chanting, flag-waving crowd in the tens of thousands. Some older
people in the crowd wept as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Chen himself has felt the sting of the scandal-mongering so
prevalent in election campaigns here. Known for closing down
brothels and unlicensed ``hostess bars,'' he was embarrassed when a
top aide was found to have frequented such places; the aide had to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Then a newspaper reported a totally unsupported allegation that
the mayor had often flown to Macau to consort with prostitutes and
to gamble. The charge was convincingly rebutted, but not before
Chen's wife felt she had to reassure the public that the couple has
a sex life.
</P>
<P>
   With few decisive issues, the old American advertising phrase
``Where's the beef?'' has somehow entered into the speech of many
candidates, including those for mayor, as they accuse their
opponents of lacking substantive proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A city council candidate, Chen Su-hua, has taken the concept
further, distributing a flier that looks like a restaurant ad
indicating that she can provide the beef. ``Beef Course Coupon,''
it says across the top, and below are fake coupons reading, for
example, ``Women and children's security: roast beef dinner,'' and
``Environmental protection: stewed beef parts.''
</P>
<P>
   That the plate of food pictured in the flier is actually grilled
chicken seems to have gone unnoticed.

UNOCAL WITHDRAWS FROM PIPELINE PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN LeVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Unocal Corp. has withdrawn from a
consortium that planned an $8 billion energy pipeline system
traversing war-torn Afghanistan, a company official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made under the pressure of low world oil
prices, concern about the presence of the accused terrorist Osama
bin Laden in Afghanistan, and feminist groups that assailed
Unocal's contacts with the Taliban, the fundamentalist Islamic
movement that rules the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Unocal has closed its offices in three of the four
Caspian-region republics in which it operated, making it the first
large foreign oil company in the world to retreat from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason is $12 oil,'' Scott Barber, the head of
Unocal's remaining regional office in Baku, said in a telephone
interview. ``You have to make priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves come against a backdrop of cost-cutting and huge
mergers in the oil industry as world crude prices have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal has responded to the difficult business climate by
slimming down. Last month it withdrew from another consortium that
had proposed a $2.9 billion pipeline to ship natural gas produced
in Turkmenistan to Turkey. The company has also said it will cut
capital spending next year by up to $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reassessment of activities everywhere, and
especially the Caspian,'' said Julia Nanay, a consultant at
Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington. ``At oil prices at $10 or
less, how do you make money? That is the question for this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Unocal's withdrawal from the Central Asia Gas consortium, which
has yet to be officially announced, took effect Friday. Without
Unocal, and with little prospect of another big company taking its
place, the project is probably dead, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The other consortium members are the government of Turkmenistan,
the former Soviet republic; Delta Oil Co. of Saudi Arabia; Itochu
Corp. and Inpex of Japan; Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co.
of South Korea, and Crescent Group of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   When Unocal joined the project in 1995, it was viewed by many
analysts as the most audacious gambit of the 1990s oil rush on the
Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pre-empt other companies trying to solve the
region's greatest problem _ it is landlocked _ and transport oil
and natural gas from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan.
Turkmenistan has the world's fourth-largest reserves of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   There was to have been a 1,005-mile oil pipeline and a companion
918-mile natural-gas pipeline, in addition to a tanker-loading
terminal in Pakistan's Arabian Sea port of Gwadar. At the oil
prices that prevailed until Asia's economic collapse, the company
projected annual revenue of $2 billion, or enough to recover the
cost of the entire project in five years.
</P>
<P>
   While many industry officials and analysts questioned the wisdom
of planning such a huge infrastructure project across a war-ravaged
country, Unocal opened offices in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan
and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   To help it sell the project to the many governments involved,
Unocal hired retired senior U.S. diplomats like former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger; a former ambassador to Pakistan, Robert
Oakley; and a Caucasus expert, John Maresca.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began with the Taliban's capture of the Afghan capital,
Kabul, in September 1996. Unocal initially took a positive view of
the movement's triumph, but then retreated when world attention
focused on the ruling clerics' treatment of women, who are
forbidden to work or attend school.
</P>
<P>
   The Feminist Majority Foundation, a Los Angeles group,
petitioned the state of California to revoke Unocal's charter, and
Mavis Leno, the wife of ``The Tonight Show'' host, Jay Leno,
attended a company shareholder meeting last June to complain about
its dealings with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Aug. 20, the United States fired Tomahawk missiles
into Afghanistan against bin Laden, whom it accused of
masterminding deadly explosions at U.S. embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Unocal suspended the pipeline project until the
Afghan government was recognized by the United States. Some Unocal
officials said the company feared sanctions if it was perceived as
circumventing U.S. policy by remaining active in Afghanistan while
a manhunt was on for bin Laden.

THE 747 OR THE HELICOPTER? WHAT'S A PRESIDENT TO DO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So does President Clinton arrive in the Palestinian
Authority on his big 747 or on a little helicopter? Does he balance
his visit to the Gaza Strip with one to Masada, the Alamo of
Israel? And then must he balance that with a quick tour of
Bethlehem? After all, it is the Holy Land, however disputed, and
it's Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   If the problems of the Middle East are about land and blood, the
diplomacy that tries to resolve them is often about language and
symbolism. In the case of Clinton's upcoming trip to Israel and the
Palestinian Authority, designed to promote and advance the
agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians reached in Wye,
Md., in October, it's also about airplanes and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue at the core of these questions was never settled
at Wye: will the Palestinians declare statehood unilaterally on May
4, 1999, when the Oslo peace process formally runs out, or are they
simply threatening to do it, as their best leverage on the
Israelis?
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, struggling to keep
his government together following the Wye agreement, was taken
aback by the warm reception given Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in Washington last week. Not only was Arafat showered with money at
an international donors' conference hosted by the Americans, he was
treated indulgently when he spoke frankly about his intention to
declare Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinian officials have done the same at the United
Nations and elsewhere, which the Israelis regard as a violation of
the Oslo accords and of promises at Wye not to take unilateral
steps that would foreclose negotiations between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Netanyahu says he has frozen further implementation
of the very Wye agreement Clinton is going to Israel to celebrate,
causing the Americans to criticize Netanyahu further for setting
``new conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority needs to commit itself ``unequivocally
to abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state'' and ``to conducting continuous negotiations with Israel
until an agreement is concluded'' _ and needs to publish that
intention in the Palestinian media _ for Israel to continue carry
out the Wye agreement, an Israeli Cabinet statement said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have done little to criticize Arafat or his
officials, other than to say that ``unilateral steps are not
helpful'' and that ``Palestinian statehood must be addressed in the
negotiations themselves.'' And the Americans have refused to say
what they would do or say if Arafat does declare statehood
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   One senior American official said Friday: ``There's a difference
between saying you're going to declare statehood and actually doing
it. There's a lot of posturing on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is clearly bothering Netanyahu is that the Clinton
visit will provide powerful new pictures and symbolism of a new
American-Palestinian relationship _ including the arrival of the
American president at the new Palestinian international airport
opened with great fanfare as a result of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's chief spokesman, has now formally
asked Clinton not to arrive in the Gaza Strip in his big, baby-blue
747 emblazoned with the huge seal of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Friday that they are likely to heed the
Israeli request, but on the grounds of pragmatism. The trip from
Tel Aviv to the Gaza Strip is a short one, analogous to the
distance from Washington to Baltimore, one official said, and
``chances are we wouldn't use a 747 but a helicopter.'' To use the
larger plane, the official said, would also require ``bringing in a
lot more people to upgrade the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when the Israelis suggested a presidential visit to
Masada, the Americans agreed. But now Clinton is contemplating a
stop in Bethlehem, which is controlled by the Palestinian
authority, further upsetting the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement, reached after nine days of intense
negotiations _ including nearly 90 hours of Clinton's own time, set
out a three-month timetable under which Israel would withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for specific, phased
steps by the Palestinians to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be followed immediately by intensive
negotiations on a final settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians, which would resolve fundamental questions like the
future of Jerusalem and whether the Palestinians will have a state.
Under the original Oslo timetable, that final settlement is
supposed to be complete by May 4, 1999, providing urgency to the
process.
</P>
<P>
   But final status talks have yet to get under way. One quiet
procedural meeting between Israeli and Palestinian officials, at
which no Americans were present, has not been followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and American officials concede that with all the furor
over the implementation of the Wye agreement itself, there has been
little energy to focus on the final status talks, which would offer
the best answer to Arafat's claims.
</P>
<P>
   After all, one American official said sardonically, ``May is
months away.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, American officials are worrying about the few days of
the Clinton visit, which begins Dec. 12, and what exactly is to be
celebrated in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   At Wye, Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinian National Council
formally revoke all the clauses in their charter calling for
Israel's destruction was handled with an Israeli-originated
compromise. Arafat would gather a quorum of the council, surround
them with lots of other, less radical Palestinians, and confirm the
revocation of the old charter in some form of mass vote, by hand or
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the Israelis have called for something more
formal, and an American official said: ``We want to make sure that
what happens in Gaza meets the Israeli needs.'' At the same time,
however, the Americans are nervous that Netanyahu will continue to
change his requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Yoel Marcus, writing Friday in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
described Netanyahu as ``in a panic'' to consolidate his political
position, broaden his government and act toughly ``while the
Palestinian state is being established right under his nose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu ``will not be able to halt the hurricane known as
Clinton's visit and the American recognition of a Palestinian state
that it implies,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials insist that Clinton's visit implies no such
thing. Yet as Marcus suggested, the symbolism argues otherwise.

SHUTTLE CREW TAKES OFF TO INSTALL U.S. PART OF SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The planet's most daring construction job
began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six
astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space
station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement
early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday
morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon
full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly
turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five
minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could
still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star.
</P>
<P>
   On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a
Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot
arm and attach the new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds of
miles above Earth, working methodically in the cold void, the
astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to
make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedrals look
like child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the station, which will be a research facility,
will require an estimated 160 space walks, which, for safety
reasons, will always be done by two people. When complete, the
international space station, dominated by solar power arrays, will
cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules of
interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven
astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747
jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend
a half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   The project entails high risk, because of the technical
difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving
environment of space, along with the dangers inherent in flying the
space shuttle to the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   The work is further complicated by international politics and
worries about money.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, whose participation in the partnership clinched
the post-Cold War deal five years ago, are now a wild card.
Moscow's economic and political woes have left Western officials
unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of
money and technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the station's costs are rising, and its
critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will
consume their own federal financing. The project's total cost is a
subject of debate, but the most credible estimates now put the
price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's
estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers
are to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign
partners about $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The station is intended to be a grand laboratory where, in the
environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop new
materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining
mysteries, in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for
long space flight to other worlds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday, in any case, little was heard about the project but
praise. ``Great show, Endeavour,'' mission control in Houston
radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
lauded the launching team and the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was truly, truly fantastic,'' she told the team after the
liftoff. And it was important, she added, to have so many nations
``working together on the kinds of issues that the 21st century is
going to be concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So my congratulations to all of you,'' the secretary said.
``Stupendous work.''
</P>
<P>
   The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first
U.S.-built station part. Small compared with the giants to come in
three dozen shuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet
long, weighs 13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other
modules.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the
Army, is to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the
payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the
unit from a horizontal to a vertical position.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous with the module
known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched into orbit from
Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States but built in
Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is be a kind of tugboat for the
embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well as
communication and rendezvous abilities.
</P>
<P>
   When Endeavour's payload bay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel
Currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the Russian
module into position over Unity. The mechanical arm has never
before moved anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless in
space, has 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill.
</P>
<P>
   As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col.
Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space
flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station
pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   When mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form
the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to
the tips of the solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking astronauts are to hook
up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach
antennas and install tools and handrails for future visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, and
Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space
walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   As construction goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour
will be busy making preparations to enter the new station through a
connecting tunnel and docking system.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic station for the
first time, installing portable fans and lights. Friday they will
again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major
element, the first one both built and financed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The other astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick
Sturckow of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei
Krikalev of the Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new
outpost, the crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space
Center on Dec. 15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen McClain, NASA's director in Washington for the
international space station, said in an interview here that its
overall costs were actually small for individual Americans. Over
its lifetime, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza
and a soft drink for each of the nation's 96 million taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. costs for construction, she added, were $24 billion, and
for operations through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, for a
total of $34.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts outside the agency consider this figure
ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars spent
in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle
flights, which run about $800 million apiece.

 CAPE CANAVERAL: million apiece.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a May 22 report, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, estimated the station's building
cost at $53 billion and its total including operations at $96
billion _ not including the cost of decommissioning by sending it
plummeting into the ocean, for which NASA has no estimate so far.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that are the contributions of the international
partners, such as $6.7 billion from the European Space Agency and
an amount from Russia that is still uncertain because of Moscow's
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, experts put the estimated cost at no less than $110
billion, adding, however, that it could well be higher and that
only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than the Manhattan Project but less than Apollo,''
said John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington. The Manhattan Project to
build the atom bomb cost about $20 billion in today's dollars, he
said, and the Apollo program that repeatedly put men on the Moon
about $125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pike backs the station as smart politically if it helps
stabilize Russia. But many scientists fault it as an enormous waste
of money, saying its huge costs and growing budget overruns have
already hurt NASA programs and are destined to spread pain further.
</P>
<P>
   Leif Robinson, editor of Sky and Telescope, a top astronomy
magazine, based in Cambridge, Mass., in the current issue strongly
criticized how America killed the half-built Superconducting
Supercollider, an $8 billion project meant to illuminate the
building blocks of matter, but backed the international space
station, or ISS, which he ridiculed as a ``flying fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the atom smasher's ghost, he wrote, ``will rise up and
drag the ISS down to the hell it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers hail the outpost as a foreign-policy coup and a stepping
stone to human exploration of Mars and more distant worlds, saying
its studies of human physiology are a must for learning how people
can venture far from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ever completed, that is. Some experts doubt that the
political wherewithal exists to finish its dozens of assembly
flights over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. McClain of NASA headquarters said that at least in
terms of U.S. gear, some 70 percent had already been finished and
that fabrication work was well under way on the remaining 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Private analysts say that with hundreds of tons of hardware
already in the assembly pipeline, and tens of billions of dollars
already spent, the project, though controversial, probably has the
political momentum to keep pushing ahead for many years to come.

JAGR TO BRING POWERFUL PENGUINS GAME TO BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Farm life figures into Jaromir Jagr's greatness. He
grew up in what was then Czechoslovakia, in Kladno, and the Jagrs
worked the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do that,'' Jagr said recently, ``you work every day .
. . and you work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the source of those powerful, explosive Jagr
legs, that strong back. Pitch hay. Push livestock. Work from the
moment dawn breaks and till the sun edges its nose below the tree
line. Jagr today is the National Hockey League's most exciting
performer, farm boy turned phenom, and he'll be in Boston Saturday
night with the Penguins when they take on the Bruins at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Now 26, Jagr stood tied with the Flyers' Eric Lindros Friday for
the league lead in points (33). There may be some agrument as to
who is better or more valauble to his team _ Jagr or Lindros _ but
there is no disputing that the Penguins' superstar is the most
electrifying performer in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got all those different speeds,'' said Bruins assistant
coach Bobby Francis. ``He's got that uncanny ability to freeze the
opposition with his cutbacks _ the way he changes his speeds _ and
his quick, quick hands. He's like a (Wayne) Gretzky the way he'll
cut back with the puck and look for the late man. And then he's
like a (John) LeClair, using that long reach of his to wrap around
the net. He's like a (Sergei) Samsonov with those hands. You're
talking about a lot of key components, and Jagr's got 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jagr jumps over the boards Saturday night, coach Pat Burns
will make sure he has at least one of his biggest defensemen _ Hal
Gil, Kyle McLaren, or Ray Bourque _ as part of his five-man unit.
Up front, he'll try to counter with his top scoring line, the Jason
Allison-Dmitri Khristich-Samsonov combination, or his Tim
Taylor-Rob DiMaio-P.J. Axelsson checking trio. When Jagr's on
patrol, everyone on the other side of the puck is turned into a
defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him with the puck at all,'' said Burns. ``I don't
want him with it anywhere at all, if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon joining the Penguins in the fall of 1990 at age 18, Jagr
instantly became another jewel in what already was a dazzling
lineup. The Penguins, led by Mario Lemieux, won their first Stanley
Cup in the spring of '91 and repeated the following year. In only
some 20 months on North American soil, Jagr owned two Cup rings and
already had established himself as one of the NHL's premier
game-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   There is little left of that core group. Lemieux has retired.
Ron Francis is the aging cornerstone of the Carolina Hurricanes.
Kevin Stevens wears a Ranger blueshirt. Larry Murphy lugs the puck
for the Red Wings. Other than his recent foray overseas for Team
USA, Joe Mullen is off skates. Only netminder Tom Barrasso and Jagr
remain from the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr no longer is just the long-haired, angel-faced, extravagant
ornament best known for his love of Kit Kats, video games, and fast
cars. He wears the captain's ``C'' for the first time and has
matured into a significant leader on the ice and in the dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' said Jagr, reflecting on his acceptance
of the captaincy. ``I didn't go to the coaches and say, `I want to
be the captain.' No way. ``They asked me, like, `Would you want to
be the captain?' That's what really happened. It's not something
I'd thought about, but I was here for nine years _ since 1990 _ and
I didn't know, but I figured the chances were 50-50 that it might
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are those flashes when a churlish Jagr, upset at his play
or disgruntled with the numbers on the scoreboard, could be seen
pouting at the end of the bench. For the last couple of seasons,
and especially this year, he has matured into a dependable,
consistent, and frightening force on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his strength and size, that whole combination,'' said
Bourque. ``He has such good ability and he has that reach that
helps him protect the puck really well. You play him too close, you
get too aggressive, and he'll just spin right off you and he's
gone. His speed certainly has something to do with it, but it's
everything else, too. Every time he touches the puck, he's a
threat.''

 &HT;    FAULTY TESTS PROMPT NATIONWIDE FEDERAL REVIEW OF POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS WASTE SITES
 &HT;    EDS: Reflects minor editing in lede and throughout.
 &HT;    EMBARGOED for release Sunday, Dec. 6
 &HT;    By JANET JACOBS and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The federal government is re-examining the danger
posed by hundreds of hazardous waste sites nationwide after the
discovery that two Texas labs provided thousands of incorrect test
results over a six year period.
</P>
<P>
   The labs tested for cancer-causing chemicals in the soil, water,
air and tissue. Such tests are routinely used by government and
industry to determine if toxic wastes are, for example, leaking
into drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental officials said they have opened a criminal
investigation into operations at the two labs, which were owned by
Intertek Testing Services, a British company that specializes in
various kinds of testing. Intertek discovered the faulty tests a
year ago. Both labs are now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials would not name specific sites involved in the
investigation. But Mary Adler, head of criminal enforcement for the
Environmental Protection Agency, said that the government has not
yet found any instances where the public was placed in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, an attorney for Intertek, also said that the
company's review has not turned up a single case where the faulty
test data resulted in any danger to public health. However, Kelly
acknowledged that the company has reviewed data from only about 25
percent of the affected sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite company and government assurances, the faulty test data
already has become an issue in at least one lawsuit involving the
defunct Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Texas. Because
it is considered among the most dangerous toxic waste sites in the
country, EPA says part of the cleanup costs will come from its
so-called Superfund.
</P>
<P>
   A group of people near the abandoned plant has sued the federal
government and numerous contractors in federal court in Marshall,
Texas, asserting that leaking toxic chemicals from the Longhorn
facility made them ill and killed 27 people over the last ten
years. A lawyer for the group alleged that a number of these people
died of cancer or lupus, a disease that attacks the kidneys and
liver.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says residents were repeatedly told by state and
federal officials that contamination from the plant could not have
caused these injuries. However, lawyers filing the suit argue that
because of the unreliable testing, the government doesn't know how
bad the contamination is.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly denied in an interview Thursday that the Karnack case
represented an instance where Intertek's test data missed a major
environmental threat. He said that the company's tests there, which
were performed for the Army Corps of
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, proved to be accurate and showed ``extremely high
levels of pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   This was disputed by an Army spokesperson who said tests done by
Intertek and other companies have repeatedly shown only limited
pockets of high pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Intertek and government officials face a substantial challenge
as they try to reconstruct how decisions were made, which tests
were relied upon and what risks were run in hundreds of complex
pollution cases dating back to the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of tests is in the thousands,'' said Dave Barry,
spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas. ``It
was pointed out that the (questionable test data) goes back to
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the company traced its current troubles back to one
employee who allegedly ``cut corners'' to speed up the time it took
to complete various tests.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the employee began working at the lab in the early
90's, the environmental testing service consisted of four
laboratories run by a company called Inchcape. When Intertek
purchased the Inchcape labs in December 1996, Kelly said the
company had no idea tests were not being properly performed. In
fact, Kelly said the labs were certified by several professional
organizations, as well as by some states, to do environmental
testing and were routinely audited.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the faulty testing procedures were discovered in
December 1997 by new managers from Intertek. Kelly said that
Intertek immediately notified its clients and the EPA. While the
lab never did work for EPA itself, whoever was responsible for the
cleanup would submit the lab's test results to the EPA to be used
in deciding how to deal with toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
   While Kelly said the ``shortcuts'' caused only minor variations
in the test results, Barry said the faulty data may have caused the
government to do too little or too much pollution cleanup at some
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to talk about exactly how serious the
situation might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A criminal investigation is ongoing,'' Adler said. ``The
agency would not at this point want to comment on the extent of the
data integrity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the agency is doing right now is conducting a systematic
review of its case files and action files to try to identify where
we might have relied on its (Intertek's) data and then make an
assessment of how that data
</P>
<P>
   was used.''

JOBLESS RATE CONTINUES TO DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The US economy, which most analysts had thought was
stumbling, put on another show of strength last month, creating
hundreds of thousands of new jobs and driving the unemployment rate
back down to a near-generation low of 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpectedly strong jobs growth came as the economy entered
its 93rd month of expansion, topping the 92-month Reagan-era boom
and becoming the longest period of peacetime growth on record,
according to the Cambridge-based National Bureau of Economic
Research, the official score-keeper of the nation's expansions and
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs figures offered the most powerful evidence to date that
even as the roiling global financial crises of the past year have
taken their toll on US manufacturers, they have turned out to be
good news for the American economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Falling interest rates due largely to a flood of foreign capital
seeking safe havens and tumbling food and energy prices due to
slackening foreign demand have helped fuel a consumer spending boom
that _ at least so far _ has shielded this nation from most of the
economic troubles around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's not over yet,'' said Diane C. Swonk, deputy chief
economist with Bank One Corp. in Chicago. ``The US economy is
proving very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America added 267,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in
November, the Labor Deparment said Friday. That was substantially
more than the 169,000 that most analysts had been expecting, and
helped drive the unemployment rate down two-tenths of a percentage
point to 4.4 percent, just above its 28-year low set last April and
May.
</P>
<P>
   The fraction of the American population holding jobs rose to
64.1 percent last month from 63.9 percent the preceding month to
come within a hair's breadth of its all-time high of 64.2 percent
reached earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figures show there is no cause for concern on the jobs
front,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Primark
Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took the numbers to mean there is less cause for
concern on the financial front as well, and drove stock prices up.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.46 points, or 1.5
percent, to close at 9016.14. Broader market indexes rose even more
substantially. The increases partially offset a week of declines
fueled in large par by investor worries that American consumers
might be coming to the end of their long spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that November's jobs growth may have been
partially fueled by temporary factors and may thus overstate the
economy's robustness. Among industries adding workers, for example,
was construction, where employment jumped 47,000. Analysts said
most of the gain is traceable to the peculiarly warm autumn, which
extended the construction season.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs numbers show the toll that the Asian financial
crisis and its globe-girdling aftershocks have taken on US
manufacturers. Factory employment fell by 47,000 in November,
extending a string of losses since last March that have eliminated
245,000 manufacturing jobs and reduced manufacturing's fraction of
the American work force to less than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those declines seem certain to continue as a string of major
employers signaled this week that they plan major layoffs, mostly
becuase of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., the world's biggest jetmaker, said it will slash
48,000 jobs by the end of the year 2000 because of weakening
foreign sales of its 747 aircraft. Exxon Corp, the nation's biggest
oil company, announced plans to buy its No.2 rival, Mobil, in a
move to consolidate an industry hammered by the falloff in demand
from emerging nations in Asia and elsewhere. Analysts estimate the
combined firm will cut 9,000 to perhaps 20,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturing sector is going the way of agriculture. It
is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking,'' said Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   Neverthless, the economy as a whole seems to be doing
spectacularly well, especially when measured against what most
analysts and policymakers were predicting until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts began the year saying that US growth would slow at
least moderately from its feverish pace of 1996 and 1997 because of
the impact of the Asian crisis, but it has shown almost no signs of
doing so. Growth through the first three quarters of the year has
averaged 3.7 percent, barely slowing off its 1997 rate of 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, the Federal Reserve was making the
last of three interest rate cuts aimed in part at protecting the
economy from slumping. Analysts said the new jobs figures make the
chance of further Fed rate cuts remote.
</P>
<P>
   Having topped the Reagan-era record for longevity, the current
boom's next challenge is beating the longest expansion of the
post-war period, the 106-month growth spurt of the 1960s.
Technically, the 1960s is not considered a peacetime boom because
it included the buildup for the Vietnam War. To match its record,
the economy will have to keep growing until April of 2000.

PAKISTANI CREW STRANDED OFFSHORE ON BANKRUPT SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La.)  (rl) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A crew of 22 Pakistani seamen aboard a bedraggled and
bankrupt cargo ship that fled Mexican waters without food or
drinking water has spent 10 days bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico,
three and a half miles off south Texas, while bankers, shipping
agents and Coast Guard officials try to untangle the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could take quite awhile to resolve, maybe into the new
year,'' said Harry Lall, president of Global Ship Services in New
Orleans, which has spent nearly $15,000 to send food and fuel to
the seamen, money he hopes to have reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's owner, Tristar Shipping Lines of Karachi, Pakistan,
stopped paying the seamen's wages nine months ago, and eventually
stopped paying all of the ship's bills, Lall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners have given up,'' he said. ``The banks have stepped
in. Someone must come up with some money and the men must stay out
on the ship until they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ship abandonments are not uncommon, officials said, though
they are rare in U.S. waters. Usually, they happen when
cash-strapped shipowners stretch their resources to the limit until
they can no longer afford to pay the bills their ships are
accruing, a situation that appears to be happening in this case,
said Lt. Brian Gove of the U.S. Coast Guard in Corpus Christi,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a 570-foot Panamanian freighter, the Fontini, was
held at Long Beach, Calif., in a dispute over back wages for its
crew. In March a 435-foot Romanian freighter, the Dragomiresti, was
seized in Galveston, Texas, and later auctioned in a dispute over
back wages.
</P>
<P>
   The ship in the current incident, the Delta Pride, is 738 feet
long, a bulk carrier of the Panamax class, meaning that she is
nearly 106.3 feet wide, the maximum width for a vessel to pass
through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Pride and its crew had been held at anchor in Tampico,
Mexico, for five months as local agents tried to wrest money from
the owners, Lall said, adding that the agents withheld all of the
ship's official papers, including the seamen's passports, to keep
it in Tampico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually, though, the situation became desperate,'' Lall
said. ``They ran out of food and then water, and they were forced
to drink dirty rainwater. Finally, when the men threatened to jump
into the sea and kill themselves, the captain decided to head for
U.S. waters, where he felt the authorities would respond much
better to his plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gove said the ship radioed the Coast Guard on Nov. 24 as soon as
it entered U.S. waters near Brownsville, Texas, and anchored three
and a half miles off Padre Island, just northeast of Brownsville.
By then, he said, the Delta Pride was virtually out of fuel and
unable to generate power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that some of the crew was malnourished and sick from
drinking dirty water, but not sick enough to require medical
evacuation,'' he added. ``So we worked with some local charitable
organizations to get food and water out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, who still do not have their passports, will be kept on
the ship unless there is a medical emergency, Gove said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship cannot be brought into port, he said, because the Coast
Guard is not sure that its operational systems, including steering
and maneuvering, are in working order. Bringing a dead ship that
size into port would take four tugboats, he said, ``and there
aren't four tugs in Brownsville.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gove said, the Delta Pride does not carry a certificate
of financial responsibility, so if it were brought into harbor and
began to leak, the cleanup would have to be paid by American
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a second emergency shipment, financed by Lall's
company, provided the crew with a 21-day supply of food and water.
It also provided enough fuel to start the ship's electrical system,
and the men now have lights and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in much better spirits today,'' Lieutenant Gove said.
</P>
<P>
   Lall said the situation, while serious, is not as complicated as
many involving such abandoned ships. As far as Global Ship Services
has been able to determine, the only money owed by the ship is to
the local agents in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the owners have more or less gone bankrupt, so we are
dealing now with the banks who are interested in salvaging the
ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lall said he hoped that the Allied Bank of Karachi, the chief
creditor, would pay the estimated $300,000 necessary to resolve the
Mexican debt, pay the seamen's back wages, reimburse his company
and make the ship seaworthy again.

   BOSTON _ The Boston Museum of Fine Arts Friday added a special
panel to a Monet waterlily explaining that the work has been
claimed by descendants of Paul Rosenberg, a French Jewish collector
and dealer whose art was looted by the Nazis in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, on loan from a French museum, also acknowledges
information the MFA did not disclose when its Monet exhibition
began in September _ that the painting is among about 2,000
artworks in French custody whose owners have never been found. Many
of the works, the museum now notes in the panel, ``belonged to
victims of the Holocaust and were stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the Globe reported that some Jewish leaders were
critical of that omission. The label merely reported that the
painting had been ``recovered after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Globe disclosed that Nazi art looters had likely
taken the Monet along with the rest of Rosenberg's collection just
after he fled France for New York in 1940; and that the artwork had
spent the war years in the possession of Nazi Foreign Minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop. The MFA was unaware of the painting's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The French museum system, which has had the painting for a half
century, has said it was unaware of the identity of the previous
owner, or the von Ribbentrop connection. Yet even the official 1947
French list of unrestituted artworks lists the Monet as having been
looted by the Nazis from Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Rosenberg family formally notified the French
government of its claim, even as the director of the French
national museum system, Francoise Cachin, said she was uncertain
whether the Monet had been looted or sold by Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   A Rosenberg family spokesman, however, said the family has
records showing the German looters catalogued the painting as
stolen after taking it from a Rosenberg home in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA's new panel notes that many of the estimated 2,000
``homeless'' artworks were sold on the Paris art market during the
war. Specialists in the wartime art looting have said many of those
were sold under duress, or entered the legitimate market after
being traded to dealers by Nazi looters for Old Master paintings.
The French, and other nations, have long considered any sales to
Germans during the German occupation to be void.
</P>
<P>
   French officials, including Cachin, have acknowledged that until
the existence of the artworks became a French national scandal in
1995, the French museum system had long since abandoned any real
effort to locate the owners of the artworks. In fact, the Monet in
question, ``Water Lilies 1904,'' has been in a museum in Caen in
Normandy since 1975, and on the French list of missing paintings
for all that time.
</P>
<P>
   MFA Director Malcolm Rogers said this week that seeking the
owner of a painting with a suspicious background is like looking
for a needle in a haystack. Yet specialists in looted art noted
that a photo of the painting appears in a book, ``Art as Politics
in the Third Reich,'' that details the looted art held by von
Ribbentrop.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, the historian at Loyola College in
Baltimore who wrote the book, said there was a ``red flag'' on the
Monet from Caen that should have prompted the MFA to perform some
diligent research before borrowing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accusing the MFA of malfeasance, or trying to deceive
anyone. They just wanted the piece for the exhibition and they
didn't do all their homework,'' Petropoulos said.

PRISON OFFICIALS SAY ESCAPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO CREEK TO
GET AWAY FROM DOGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE _ Murderer Martin Gurule's desperate bid to escape
the executioner's needle ended when he drowned in a turbid,
fast-flowing creek just a mile from Texas' death row, autopsy
results released Friday show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he might have been driven into the creek in an
effort to escape from the dogs,'' prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald
said. ``It appears that he wasn't a very good swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's bloated body was found late Thursday afternoon by two
off-duty prison employees who were baiting trotlines on the creek
near its confluence with the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   Only one wound was detected on the body _ a shallow,
``graze-type'' bullet injury on the back just below the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Medical Examiner Dr. Joye Carter, whose office
performed the autopsy, said the bullet wound was non-lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Gurule, 29, who was sentenced to die for the
1992 murder of two men during a Corpus Christi, Texas, robbery, met
his death just hours after escaping from the Ellis Unit early last
Friday. The body was identified through dental records.
</P>
<P>
   Six other death row inmates were captured as they attempted to
reach the double razor wire-topped fences that line the prison's
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   In a preamble to Friday's final news conference in the case,
Fitzgerald stood in front of prison system headquarters in a
driving rain and ripped to shreds a wanted poster bearing Gurule's
photo and vital data.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all have seen this,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Gurule is no
more. Our record is clear of escapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Wayne
Scott praised the hundreds of prison system employees who scoured
the dense forest that adjoins the Ellis Unit, where death row
inmates are housed, in a seven-day search of the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your collective and individual actions prove once again to me,
and to the public at large, just what a committed, dedicated and
diligent group of employees the great state of Texas has protecting
its safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesmen said the cost of the manhunt has not been
calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is relieved,'' said Sophia Piperis, a first cousin
by marriage to Mike Piperis, the Corpus Christi restaurant owner
Gurule killed. ``He had to get what he deserved and I guess he got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's daughter, Sofia Piperis, expressed pity for
Gurule's family. ``He was a person and that's no way for any person
to die,'' she told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.
</P>
<P>
   Other family members were less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he suffered,'' said Brian Piperis, a nephew of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad he's dead,'' said another nephew, Bill Piperis.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie Carey, the mother of restaurant cook Anthony Staton, who
also was killed in the robbery, expressed relief on learning of
Gurule's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if justice has been taken care of now,'' she said.
``It is all over and I can rest tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's decomposing body was found about 5:30 p.m. Thursday
floating in about 12 feet of water in Harmon Creek. The corpse
still was swaddled in several layers of clothing and armored with
sheets of cardboard and magazines held in place with elastic
bandages _ apparent protection from the razor wire-topped fences.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Smith, 41, and Mark Humphrey, 39, the off-duty employees
who found him, said the creek, filled with tangled trotlines and
brush, would be treacherous for swimmers at the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   They initially thought they were viewing a floating mannequin
until they noticed Gurule's fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a dispatcher for the Wynn Unit; Humphrey, a truck
driver.
</P>
<P>
   While Fitzgerald called the pair ``heroes of the hour,'' a
spokeswoman for Texas Gov. George W. Bush noted they will not be
eligible to claim a $5,000 Texas Crime Stoppers reward posted in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards said state law stipulates the reward is to be paid
only when information leads to an arrest. Secondly, she said, a
proper claim was not filed with the Walker County Crime Stoppers
office in Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, she later added that Bush's office is exploring
alternate ways of providing a reward. ``These men met the spirit of
the requirements for the reward,'' Edwards said. ``We're just
awaiting word from our lawyers to see what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Humphrey, who earlier expressed optimism they would
receive the reward _ ``The check's in the mail!'' one quipped _
later expressed disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a raw deal,'' said Smith on being told about the
Crime Stoppers regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, Allan Polunksy, chairman of the Texas criminal
justice board, announced the members of a fact-finding committee
appointed to investigate the escape. John McAuliffe, retired prison
intelligence chief, will head the panel, which is to report to
criminal justice Commissioner Alfred ``Mac'' Stringfellow before
the board's Jan. 4 meeting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe spent 22 years with the FBI before joining TDCJ as
head of its internal affairs division. He retired earlier this year
after holding that job five years.
</P>
<P>
   Other members are Texas Ranger L.C. Wilson of Beaumont and TDCJ
officials Gary Gomez, director of Gulf Coast area prisons; Larry
Johns, senior warden of the Michael Unit at Tennessee Colony; Steve
Mugg, facilities division; Sandy Murphy, operations review; Joe
Nesmith, internal affairs; and Ron Steffa, executive services.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Museum of Fine Arts Friday added a special
panel to a Monet waterlily explaining that the work has been
claimed by descendants of Paul Rosenberg, a French Jewish collector
and dealer whose art was looted by the Nazis in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, on loan from a French museum, also acknowledges
information the MFA did not disclose when its Monet exhibition
began in September _ that the painting is among about 2,000
artworks in French custody whose owners have never been found. Many

MEXICAN BANK AID PACT SNAGS OVER AN OFFICIAL'S ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After nine months of grueling debate, Mexican
lawmakers have reached broad agreement on measures to refinance the
government's troubled $61 billion bank bailout, but final accord
has been stymied by a high-stakes dispute over the resignation of a
top government finance official.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted discussion in the Mexican Congress over the
bailout program has compounded the uncertainties in the country's
weak banking system and worried international investors at a time
when Mexico is struggling to defend its basically strong economy
against contagion from global market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how closely the markets are watching the debate, a
spate of rumors Wednesday of an imminent resolution sent Mexican
bank stocks shooting up as much at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies from the government's Institutional Revolutionary Party
or PRI, and the National Action Party or PAN, a more conservative
opposition group, said Friday that they are in ``fundamental
agreement'' on the outlines of a new autonomous agency which will
absorb the debts now held by the bailout fund. They also agreed on
a new program to help small debtors and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to do this deal,'' said Angel Aceves Saucedo,
chairman of the committee of the lower house of Congress where the
bank package was forged. Together the PRI and the PAN have
mobilized enough votes to pass the proposal in the lower house, the
Chamber of Deputies. If the PRI supports it there, approval by the
Senate, where the PRI holds a majority, is assured.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, the two parties clashed over the role of
Guillermo Ortiz, an economist who heads the Banco de Mexico, the
central bank, and was Mexico's finance minister until early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN delegates are determined to force Ortiz to step down. An
ultimatum they have issued is one of the most direct and serious
challenges to President Ernesto Zedillo that Mexicans have seen in
their young democracy, which came to life with elections in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN argues that the original bailout, which Ortiz hammered
together in the heat of a severe economic crisis in 1995, violated
the constitution by taking on government debt without approval from
the Congress. At the time the bailout was credited with saving the
country's banking system from collapse due to soaring interest
rates and chronic mismanagement. But opposition legislators balked
at the government's proposals to refinance the bailout program,
accusing it of rescuing corrupt bankers at the expense of Mexican
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bailout was illegal,'' said Gerardo Buganza Salmeron, a
PAN deputy who helped to write the bailout proposal. ``It was done
wrong. President Clinton is facing impeachment proceedings because
of a little slip-up. Why shouldn't we demand that Guillermo Ortiz
leave if he made a mistake that cost Mexican taxpayers $61
billion?''
</P>
<P>
   PAN lawmakers wrote a special clause into their bailout proposal
which would require Ortiz to leave his central bank post, and have
said they would not support the rest of the package without that
clause.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days PRI deputies, responding to cues from Zedillo,
stepped up their defense of Ortiz. They say that the opposition
cannot legally force him to resign because the central bank enjoys
special independence.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Ortiz would be a sharp political blow for Zedillo. As
finance minister, Ortiz engineered one of the most conspicuous
achievements of Zedillo's presidency, the rapid economic recovery
which brought Mexico back from a crushing recession to more than 7
percent growth in two years. In addition, sending Ortiz to head the
central bank was part of Zedillo's plan to insure financial
stability through the transition to the next president in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In October, government officials said, Ortiz tendered his
resignation, but Zedillo rejected it. Friday, an emissary from the
executive branch met with PAN deputies to insist that Ortiz's
resignation is out of the question.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When many passionate antique collectors find a prize item, they
are likely to pay whatever it takes to clinch the deal. Not Brian
W.H. Berghuis, manager of the T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth fund. He
scours the countryside and even travels abroad looking for the best
bargains in federal-style chests, chairs and other furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back woods of Ontario, the antiques are about half the
price they are down here,'' he said from his Baltimore office.
</P>
<P>
   But that keen focus on price applies to his stock selections,
too _ an unusual trait for a growth fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Berghuis (pronounced BERG-hice) is happy to be
mining medium-capitalization stocks. ``Generally the mid-cap
universe has companies that are growing faster, significantly
faster, than large caps, and yet the valuations are significantly
cheaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding stocks with reasonable price-to-earnings multiples is
one component of his conservative approach to growth investing. But
he is also wary of earnings that climb more than 30 percent a year;
12 percent to 15 percent is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   That cautious bent has not kept Berghuis from making his name as
manager of a fund that has outperformed its peer group. Since its
inception in June 1992, Mid-Cap Growth has returned 22.4 percent,
annualized, through Nov. 27, versus 15.4 percent for the average
fund in its category, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial
publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis, who is 40, selects stocks from a universe of companies
with market capitalizations of $750 million to $5 billion. Some
funds in the mid-cap growth category have bought large-cap stocks
to compensate for the relative underperformance of mid-caps in
recent years, but Berghuis said he avoids such ``market-cap creep''
because ``you could miss out on a surge in mid-cap stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He is betting that such a surge will come, although he is loath
to say exactly when. ``I think there's a very good relative
valuation story in this sector at the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis relies heavily on what he calls ``plodders,'' companies
whose earnings ``fairly reliably grow 12 percent to 15 percent a
year in a fairly low-risk way.'' But that doesn't mean all of his
holdings are in that group. The median earnings growth rate of the
portfolio has hovered around 20 percent since the fund's inception.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Berghuis shies away from companies with much
higher rates, he said, is that such gains are hard to sustain for
long periods. He also tries to steer clear of momentum stocks,
whose prices can surge on speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while a stock that I own may become a momentum
stock,'' he said. ``I tend to err on the side of getting out early,
and sometimes when I've done that, the stocks have even doubled
again after I've sold them. But it's better than being there when
the music stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis sometimes bets on the flip side of the momentum coin,
buying after the momentum players exit and a stock's price falls.
An example is his recent purchase of shares in Whole Foods Market,
a retailer of natural foods. Whole Foods stock fell from $70.125 in
March to $32 in November. He started buying it at $35 in October;
it now trades at $48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of momentum money in that stock, and
it came out over the course of a couple of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells high-quality perishable foods in nearly 90
stores a number that Berghuis estimated could triple in a few
years, ``niching away'' at the business of mainstream supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates earnings growth at 23 percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the stock price will keep pace with
earnings growth in the years ahead,'' he said. The stock is selling
at 23 times estimated 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is CIT Group, a commercial lender with a
market capitalization of about $4.5 billion. Berghuis first bought
the stock at $27 in October; it closed on Friday at $29.0625, or
12times estimated 1999 earnings. ``If you look at where other
commercial finance companies trade, this one is at a severe
discount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis expects 12 percent to 15 percent earnings growth at CIT
over the next few years. ``Here's a perfect example of sort of the
lower end of the growth spectrum in the fund, the so-called
plodder, but I think a fairly reliable plodder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CIT's business includes equipment financing, leasing, factoring
and lending to small businesses. Many of its customers are not big
enough to show up on the radar screen of big banks, Berghuis said,
so its field becomes less competitive as banks consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   Berghuis sometimes sounds like a hard-bitten value investor. One
beaten-down stock for which he has high hopes is Romac
International, which offers outsourcing of information technology,
financial and accounting services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an out-of-favor stock in an out-of-favor sector,'' he
said. Fears of an economic slowdown, he added, have shaken
confidence in the future growth of outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Romac was selling for $32 a share. Berghuis started
buying at $20 a share in September, and last week it was down to
$16.4375, still above its low for the year, $11.75 in October.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he expects Romac earnings to grow at 30 percent in
1999, partly because of its acquisition this year of a similar
company called Source Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blue-chip company in this sector is Robert Half
International,'' he said. That stock trades for 25 times 1999
earnings. But Romac, which Berghuis said ``could be another Robert
Half in another few years,'' is trading at just 16 times 1999
earnings.

BRADLEY FORMS CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISING COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley, the former basketball star and US
senator, took a major step Friday toward seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination, forming an exploratory committee that can
raise money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by family and friends at a low-key announcement in
Newark, N.J., Bradley said: ``I want to provide the kind of
leadership that doesn't stand in the spotlight, but that calls
attention to the actions of millions of Americans who shine every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has spent the last several months touring the
country to promote his new book, ``Values of the Game,'' faces the
daunting task of challenging Vice President Al Gore. Gore already
is the favorite of many within the party and has enormous
fund-raising power at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The move also puts pressure on other potential candidates,
including Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, to make up their
minds soon. Indeed, Bradley's announcement signals that the a
pre-campaign phase known as the ``money primary'' is under way,
with potential candidates rushing to sign up supporters and raise
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called Kerry Friday to explain his intentions, and Kerry
said through a spokesman that he welcomed his former Senate
colleague as a possible candidate. ``He thinks Bradley will make a
very good contribution to the national dialogue if he runs for
president,'' Kerry spokesman Jim Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who has said he will make a decision on whether to run
for president by February, plans to discuss the matter with his
family later this month during a vacation in Sun Valley, Idaho.
Kerry also is making plans for a January visit to Iowa, which holds
the first presidential caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats who have said they are considering a
presidential bid include Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Another possible candidate, House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, is widely expected to drop out of
contention in order to concentrate on becoming speaker of the House
after the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first but very serious step. It is moving forward
from here,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   A formal declaration of candidacy could come within weeks,
especially if Bradley is successful in getting donations for his
exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former Rhodes Scholar, rose to fame as a member of
the gold-medal-winning US basketball team in 1964 and as a forward
on the New York Knicks, which won two National Basketball
Association championships when the man nicknamed ``Dollar Bill''
was on the team.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, Bradley initially played down his sports celebrity
and focused on a series of weighty issues, from tax reform to civil
rights to the environment. Considered a moderate on many issues,
Bradley sometimes displayed displeasure with his party, such as in
1981 when he was one of three Democrats who voted for the
then-President Reagan's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Bradley is a longshot, but he should be
taken seriously. For starters, the analysts said, he is well-known
and liked nationally, as evidenced by his book making many
best-seller lists. The book, which contains essays on the common
values of life and basketball, celebrates his days as an athletic
star, a time still remembered fondly by many of his fans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart said Gore is clearly the
front-runner, yet the Democratic Party has a tradition of embracing
outsiders _ not establishment figures such as a vice president. The
last two Democrats to be elected president were governors, Jimmy
Carter and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats tend to look toward the challenger, the outsider,
while Republicans tend to look to the establishment,'' Hart said.
``From that point, Bill Bradley would have a better chance of
competing against a sitting vice president on the Democratic
side.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analyst Stuart Rothenberg doubted Bradley can gain
enough support and money to beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time taking it all that seriously,'' Rothenberg
said. ``Yes, he is Mr. Clean, thoughtful and serious but I don't
see where the wedge is. I don't see in the party where he competes
with Al Gore. They are on the same side of the issues. Both are
(moderate) New Democrats, both are free traders.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday announcing the exploratory committee,
Bradley played down any comparisons with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Vice President Gore and me,'' Bradley said.
``This is about telling the country what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he might seek the nomination because he wants to
``help unleash the enormous potential of the American people. I
want to help take that energy and channel it, not only toward
further economic vitality, but also toward finishing our agenda of
obligations that we have to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley considered running for president in 1992 and 1996. He
did not seek reelection as a senator in 1996.

EX-ADELPHI CHIEF TO ASSIST BU PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Their names have been linked, for better or worse: John
Silber, former Boston University president, and Adelphi University
President Peter Diamandopoulos, were ranked one and two,
respectively, in pay among all university presidents in the nation
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Silber, who was seen as something of a mentor to Diamandopoulos,
helped set Diamandopoulos's pay as an Adelphi trustee. And he
fiercely defended it when that compensation became a bone of
contention in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're together again. This fall, the man some considered
a Silber protege landed a job at BU, where Silber remains
Chancellor. As special assistant to president Jon Westling,
Diamandopoulos is assigned to handle special projects in the
president's office, specifically in development, international
education, and educational policy.
</P>
<P>
   But BU Friday remained mum on one aspect of his new position:
His salary.
</P>
<P>
   BU spokesman David R. Lampe said the hiring was ``a personnel
matter'' and that details would remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a person with a wealth of experience in many different
aspects at the university,'' Lampe said. ``This was an opportunity
to take advantage of that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of Diamandopoulos's hiring comes just three weeks after
a $4.3 million settlement in the fracas over his Adelphi pay, which
involved the New York State attorney general's office, and over the
university trustees' failure to control Diamandopoulos'
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos and all 18 Adelphi trustees, including Silber,
were ordered to repay the university for some of his compensation
and legal fees, after the New York State Board of Regents faulted
the trustees for overpaying the president. A new board of trustees
ousted the president and sought the settlement, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos could not be reached for comment and Silber was
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Their reunion at BU was no surprise to some, who saw Silber as
one of Diamandopoulos' most strident supporters in the New York
Board of Regents hearings that emerged over the compensation
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're telling me as far as the hiring does not surprise
me at all,'' said Kathy A. Ahearn, counsel and deputy commissioner
for legal affairs for the board of regents. ``Now that a settlement
of all the lawsuits has finally been reached. . .it's kind of
interesting and fitting that they both end up at the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Margolis, an attorney representing the Committee to Save
Adelphi, a student and faculty group that opposed the compensation,
called Diamandopoulos' appointment ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what happened at Adelphi raised some incredibly
serious questions _ and actually answered them _ about his capacity
to serve in the administration of a not-for-profit institution,
much less an aceadmic one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas began when the Committee to Save Adelphi complained
that Diamandopoulos' compensation _ $523,636 in salary and bonuses
in 1994 _ was excessive. Silber was the only higher-paid university
president at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Silber, who testified at the Regents hearings, was one of the
his fiercest supporters on the board, and one of the most
instrumental in assuring his compensation, Ahearn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense was that Silber was very much a mentor to
Diamandopoulos,'' Ahearn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost got the sense from listening to the testimony that
Silber was supporting him very vigorously in the fight that was
going on because some of the similarities that existed would be a
victory for Silber,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis called Silber the trustees' ``ringleader'' setting
Diamandopoulos' pay. Indeed, Silber even testified that he weighed
his own salary when determining Diamandopoulos,' according to press
accounts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problems he faced at Adelphi were the same I faced
when I came to Boston University,'' Silber was quoted as saying at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member panel of the Board of Regents found the trustees
had neglected their duty in setting Diamandopoulous's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Before he took the helm at Adelphi, Diamandopoulos was dean of
faculty at Brandeis University, president of Sonoma State
University, and studied philosophy and the history of classical
thought at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamandopoulos became best known for his perks. By 1996, he
was earning $837,000 a year in pay and benefits. He had reportedly
received $360,000 in travel expenses for annual trips with his wife
to Greece, a Mercedes-Benz, and a Manhattan condominium worth $1.3
million _ with an option to buy it for $905,000.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that Silber was also involved in
some of the costs: When the crisis sparked a meeting of the board
of trustees, Diamandopoulos allegedly began taking out trustees and
billed Adelphi $546 for a dinner with Silber.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Diamandopoulos and the trustees were forced to
pay a settlement worth about $4.3 million to the university _
including $1.45 million from an insurance claim. Diamandopoulos was
ordered to return almost $650,000 cash and $90,000 rent for his
apartment, and he and his fellow trustees were ordered to repay
$225,000. The other trustees independently were ordered to return
$800,000 cash, Ahearn noted; a breakdown of their individual
expenses was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos was also ordered to relinquish his rights to
deferred compensation, sabbatical, and the Manhattan apartment _
claims worth $765,019.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees, including Silber, resigned in Feburary 1997, and
the new board replaced Diamandopoulos.

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON PERSONAL BUSINESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAN M. ROSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A Year-End Guide To Income Tax Savings
</P>
<P>
   Most taxpayers can find ways to pare their 1998 taxes,
especially if they act now; once the year ends, many of those
opportunities will be gone. ``There are some differences from last
year because of changes in the law,'' said Avery E. Neumark, a
principal at the New York law firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &AMP;
Co., ``as well as traditional year-end moves.'' His checklist
includes these strategies: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SECURITIES TRADES After last year's ultracomplex rules on
holding periods for long-term capital gains and losses, Congress
has simplified the rules, defining long term as anything held over
12 months. Such capital gains will have a 20 percent tax rate for
most taxpayers; up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be taken
against ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow industrials have recovered in recent weeks, many
investors still have paper losses in emerging-markets funds, for
example. If you are among them and want to reposition that holding,
recognizing the loss in December could cut your taxes. If the loss
is more than $3,000, the excess can be carried forward to a future
year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEOGH PLANS Anyone with self-employment income _ even from a
sideline like part-time consulting _ can put part of that money
into a tax-deferred Keogh retirement plan, provided that the plan
is set up by Dec. 31. The money does not have to be deposited until
the due date of the return, April 15 _ or later, with an
extension. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARITABLE GIFTS If you donate appreciated securities instead of
cash, you can deduct the market value and owe no capital-gains tax.
If you are short of cash now, you can take a 1998 deduction if the
charity charges the donation to a credit card in December. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STATE AND LOCAL TAX BILLS For most taxpayers, paying real estate
or fourth-quarter estimated state and local taxes in December will
mean a bigger 1998 deduction. But if you are subject to the
alternative minimum tax, you will lose the deduction, so it may be
worth postponing any payments until January. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESTIMATED TAXES The 1998 rules are not as tough as last year's,
but you should still do some math to make sure you do not face an
underpayment penalty. You will escape the penalty if your estimated
tax payments come within $1,000 of what is due, or if you have paid
90 percent of the current year's liability in 1998 or an amount
equal to 100 percent of your 1997 liability. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH INSURANCE The allowed deduction for self-employed people
has risen to 45 percent of health insurance premiums paid for 1998.
That gives the self-employed a bigger incentive to buy coverage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS This employer-provided benefit
reimburses expenditures for certain child-care and medical costs,
tax-free. But it is a ``use it or lose it'' benefit, so you should
tap unused funds this month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GIFTS An individual may make annual gifts of as much as $10,000
to any number of people, with no reduction of the unified gift and
estate tax credit. Wealthy people should consider making gifts
before Dec. 31 to cut the size of their taxable estates. &QL;

SCHUMER BLAMES `RADICAL RIGHT' FOR IMPEACHMENT PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ President Clinton is in bigger trouble of
impeachment than most people know, a Democratic member of the House
Judiciary Committee said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who will become a member of
the Senate in January, blamed ``radical right'' Republicans for
manipulating the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are pushing impeachment, they're letting their
hatred of Clinton exceed their love of the country or their
obligation to people of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer singled out Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, for trying
to induce impeachment votes from reluctant GOP representatives and
blamed speaker-elect Bob Livingston, R-La., for failing to control
DeLay and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston has refused thus far to assert the slightest
scintilla of leadership whatsoever,'' said Schumer, who captured a
Senate seat by defeating incumbent Republican Alfonse D'Amato.
``Tom DeLay ... he is pushing people left and right ... to vote for
at least one article of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is holding hearings to determine what
action to take against Clinton for lying under oath about his
sexual relationship with a White House intern. The committee will
make a recommendation to the full House, which must then vote on
the action. There are 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I'm truly worried,'' he told the Albany
Times Union. An impeachment trial, he said, ``would be a disaster''
tying up all three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial is going to be brought to you by the same people who
conducted these wild goose-chase hearings, the Judiciary
Committee,'' he said, describing committee Republican leaders as
``the radical right.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for DeLay said Schumer seemed to be acting as
Clinton's defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't he stand up and make a case that the president
didn't commit perjury?'' Mike Scanlon said. He added that Schumer
appeared to want it both ways: He blamed departing House Speaker
Newt Gingrich for pushing the impeachment inquiry and now blames
Livingston for staying out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find me a Republican who says they have been in any way
influenced or pressured by Tom DeLay. They don't exist. We're
totally hands-off,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said Schumer has reason to fear
an impeachment vote in the full House. But he added: ``Many
Republicans are uncomfortable with the way this has evolved ... I
think it is going to be an extremely close vote. There are upwards
of 20 Republicans who have suggested they might not be comfortable
with impeaching Bill Clinton over what they have characterized as
sexual improprieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said Clinton, who helped him raise hundreds of thousands
of dollars during his successful campaign against D'Amato, should
be censured _ a formal rebuke _ for lying under oath about his
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer will become a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee
when the new Congress convenes in January. As a member of that
panel, he would serve as a juror in a trial of the president if the
House votes for impeachment.

RELIGIONS FIND A HOME ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As should be clear to anyone who has looked into what
the Internet offers by way of religion, cyberspace has become a
comfortable and expansive home for a vast number of faith groups.
</P>
<P>
   Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and many others
have set up Web sites describing national organizations and
individual houses of worship. Such sites may seem to serve a kind
of billboard function, advertising and providing information for
the groups that sponsor them. Some Web sites can work as meeting
grounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the goal of an organization affiliated with the
Lubavitch movement, the Hasidic Jewish group, which announced this
week that it had created a site dedicated to Hanukkah, the
eight-day Jewish festival of lights, which begins on Sunday, Dec.
13, at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the American Friends of Lubavitch, said the
site _ www.chanukah98.com _ would feature broadcasts of the
lightings of menorahs in Jerusalem, Moscow, New York and Paris, all
taking place at 3:15 p.m. Eastern time on that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is be lamplighters in cyberspace,''
said Rabbi Levi Shemtov, director of the Washington office of
American Friends. The organization mounted a more modest site
during the holiday last year, and received enough encouragement to
expand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the spiritual leader of the
Lubavitch movement who died in June 1994, urged his followers to
use the tools of modern technology, including toll-free telephone
lines, radio broadcasts and fax machines, to reach out to all Jews
to encourage people at all levels of observance to increase their
commitment to the faith. The Lubavitch movement has world
headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, long before the Internet came into widespread
use, Shemtov said, his father, Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, began a
project for the Lubavitch in which menorah lightings around the
world were televised live via satellite linkup. It was undertaken
with the approval of Schneerson, the younger Shemtov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was pretty eye-opening,'' he said, adding that for
members of Lubavitch, as for many among the more rigorously
Orthodox Jews, ``television is not very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may be a different matter. It holds the
possibility of being ``a great educational tool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Internet, users could read that the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America had reported its membership to be
``stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's largest Protestant denominations suffered
heavy declines in membership in the 1970s and 1980s. But some
recent statistics indicated that the losses had moderated in this
decade, and the Lutheran report seemed to fit the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   David Alderfer, the church's director for rosters and
statistics, said membership declined by 2,308 people in 1997 (the
latest year for which figures were available), less than one half
of 1 percent of the church's 5.2 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was substantially less than that for 1996 and 1995,
when the church lost about 9,000 members each year, or for 1994,
when it lost 13,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But Alderfer, who noted that the church gained members in 1990
and 1991, said it was too early to discern a trend. ``I'd want to
see two more years of data,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They've only just begun to merge.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view of many market watchers after an extraordinary
week of corporate combinations. The 78 deals announced in the first
four days of December had a value of $89.9 billion, almost as much
as was generated during all of November.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the same economic factors driving Mobil Oil
into the arms of Exxon _ and Bankers Trust to join with Deutsche
Bank _ cut across many industries today. So more and more mergers
tomorrow are a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor is excess capacity. And it's all over the
map, affecting banks, retailers, computer makers and producers of
commodities like steel, paper and chemicals. When too many goods
chase too few consumers, combining corporate forces and turning off
some of the supply spigot is a natural response.
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity has driven merger booms before. A century ago,
price declines similar to the ones seen in this decade created a
wave of corporate consolidations that turned 1,800 companies into
about 150.
</P>
<P>
   While increased merger activity may right the supply-and-demand
scales in some industries, megamergers are not necessarily good
news for shareholders. The fact is, most mergers are bad news for
shareholders, because the merged company's stock usually
underperforms its peers long afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the findings of Mark Sirower, a professor of mergers
and acquisitions at New York University's Stern School of Business.
Sirower is the author of ``The Synergy Trap: How Companies Lose the
Acquisition Game'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Studying 168 deals among large public companies in the 1980s and
an additional 100 combinations valued at more than $500 million
apiece from the 1990s, Sirower found that roughly two-thirds lost
money for shareholders, relatively speaking. For example, a
portfolio of the 100 major acquisitions completed from 1994 to
1997, with each stock bought five days before the relevant deal was
announced and sold five days after, would have produced returns
that lagged behind other companies' in the merging entities'
industries by an average of 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   What about the longer-term performance of the merged companies?
The numbers are similar. Indeed, the loudest message from Sirower's
research is that investors' initial reaction to a merger turns out
to be uncannily prescient. ``The market is a pretty good predictor
of what we'll see a year later, or even four years out,'' Sirower
said.
</P>
<P>
   He reached this conclusion by splitting the merged companies
into two portfolios: those whose shares went up when deals were
announced and those whose stock fell. One year later, the positive
portfolio was still positive and the negative still an
underperformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's particularly interesting that those that stay positive do
even better than their industry, and negatives that stay negative
do even worse,'' he said. The mergers that the market liked from
the start rose 18.51 percent; the ones that investors disliked fell
22.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sirower hastened to add that these figures were averages, and
that some mergers that initially displease investors can and do
turn around later. But the consistency of the market's mood on
these combinations is pretty remarkable. Some 59 percent of those
merged companies whose stock began in positive territory stayed
there, while 67.3 percent of those whose stock hit the skids early
remained down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at market reactions, Sirower concluded, ``you
need to take them seriously.''

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON PEOPLE AND PERSONALITIES

<P>
   What's really behind Exxon's takeover of Mobil? ``Exxon was
insanely jealous of Mobil's sponsorship of `Masterpiece Theater'
and its lock on a part of the Times Op-Ed page,'' joked Herbert
Schmertz, former vice president for public affairs at Mobil. ``They
were willing to pay $80 billion to get their hands on it, and you
know what? It's a good deal for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmertz is referring to two of the biggest publicity coups he
engineered in his 18 years as guardian of Mobil's public image: the
company's sponsorship of public television and its use of
advertising slots on the New York Times Op-Ed page for biting
essays on public controversies that often drove oil-industry
critics crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It all helped to make Mobil seem bigger in relation to Exxon
than it really was. Now, 10 years after Schmertz left Mobil to open
his own consulting business, $11-a-barrel oil is forcing his old
company into what, culturally at least, seems to be a shotgun
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Schmertz says he is not bothered personally by the merger,
though the new name, Exxon Mobil, is ``dreadful'' and ``sounds too
much like Austro-Hungary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel sorry for the thousands of people who will lose
their jobs,'' he added. ``I'm sure most will be from Mobil.'' &QL;

   Charities are already fretting now that Mobil, an avid patron of
museums and public television, is merging with Exxon, which makes
less of a splash in philanthropy circles. Now they have another
merger to worry about. Sanford I. Weill, the co-chairman of
Citigroup, the new financial behemoth, has chosen the
charitable-giving program of his old company, Travelers Group, over
the more free-spending plan at the old Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   Weill prefers Travelers' money-for-time program, which makes
grants only to charities where employees donate their time.
Citicorp has a matching gift plan that doubles any employee's gift
to a favorite charity, to the tune of $7 million in 1997. The new
policy won't take effect until next year, and Citigroup promises to
honor any multiyear commitments made by the old Citicorp. Weill is
a big giver himself, recently pledging $100 million to Cornell
Medical School. ``But he feels strongly that people should be
involved, not just write checks,'' a Citigroup spokesman said.

   You can almost hear the bureaucrats at Japan's Ministry of Trade
and Industry gnashing their teeth: Queen Elizabeth has knighted
Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the former president and chief executive of the
Honda Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when the ministry was trying to protect Japan's auto
industry leaders, Toyota and Nissan, it discouraged bankers from
lending to Honda, then a motorcycle maker. The strategy failed, and
Honda is now a global giant, producing 150,000 vehicles a year in
Swindon, England, with plans to increase capacity by 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 31 other Japanese executives, including Soichiro
Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, have also achieved British knighthood.
</P>
<P>
   After his investiture early next year, Kawamoto will be entitled
to style himself Sir Nobuhiko and print the initials K.B.E. _ for
Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire _ on his
meishi, or business card. But, his spokesman said: ``I think he
just wants to be referred to as Kawamoto-san. And he's not
reprinting his meishi.''

   When it comes to initial public offerings, the word
``unprofitable'' seems to be excused by the word ``Internet.'' Add
Barry Diller, the media impresario, to the list of people who just
got rich _ well, in his case, richer _ from the suspension of
disbelief, which appears to fuel stock trading related to things on
line. Tossing the Diller name into the mix didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc. raised $98
million with the sale of seven million shares, with the opening
price of $14 a share tripling by the end of the day. The
ticket-sales and city-guide venture isn't expected to turn a profit
until 2002. USA Networks, of which Diller is chairman, holds a 62.5
percent stake in the online venture.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of Overpriced Stock Service, a
newsletter, called the $3.5 billion valuation for the fledgling
enterprise ``excessive.'' But unlike most other Internet
entrepreneurs, Diller hasn't nested all his eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
   He also has, among other things, his stake in USA Networks,
whose properties include the Home Shopping Network, to offset any
slide this online foray may suffer.

HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS RISING FAST, ESPECIALLY INDIVIDUAL PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Wash., Md., N.J., Texas, Conn., Calif., Fla., Ill.,
Minn., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Renee Couture earns about $21,000 a year as owner
of a struggling Domino's pizza franchise in Danville, Ky. Single,
37, the mother of a 5-year-old daughter, Ms. Couture also has
diabetes, though thanks to her health insurance from Anthem Blue
Cross and Blue Shield, she said, ``My diabetes is in the best
control it's been in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in October, Anthem notified Ms. Couture that it was more
than doubling her premium, to $498 a month _ nearly 30 percent of
her salary _ from $197, a little more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All other options, she said, are at least as expensive: ``The
clincher for me is diabetes. Once an insurance agent hears that,
it's uh-oh.''
</P>
<P>
   At more than 100 percent, the size of Ms. Couture's premium
increase may be extreme, but many others among the 16 million
people under 65 who have to buy their own health insurance are
facing increases of 40 percent or more this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed, unemployed, working for small employers who do
not offer health insurance, or retired early, often because of poor
health, these people are a step away from joining the nation's 43.4
million uninsured, too young for Medicare, the federal insurance
for the elderly, not poor enough for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums are also rising for many of the 160 million Americans
covered by employers' group policies, with increases in the next
year projected at 8 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals who buy their own insurance already pay far more
because no employer subsidizes them, and now their soaring premiums
are creating a dynamic that appears certain to send prices even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic works this way: As premiums for individual health
coverage rise, the youngest and healthiest holders of those
policies, like people just out of high school and college, decide
to do without insurance. That leaves insurance companies with a
shrunken pool of customers who are older and less healthy _ and
whose health care costs cannot be spread across the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that premiums for the people who need health
insurance most are raised higher and higher to cover the cost of
their own care.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these people have been paying about 40 percent more
for their care than the great majority of insured Americans because
they pay the full cost, said Deborah Chollet, vice president of the
Alpha Center, a nonpartisan health care research organization here.
Now the gap is widening.
</P>
<P>
   In general, state regulators report, individuals' premiums are
climbing at least twice as much as the increases in group-policy
premiums that employers face next year. Premiums for the individual
policies are even rising faster than health care costs at the start
of the 1990s, a phenomenon that stirred President Clinton's effort
to overhaul the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton proposed helping uninsured individuals with
the highest medical bills, those aged 55 to 64, buy Medicare
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president proposed the Medicare legislation,'' said his
economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, ``precisely because he has
long recognized that there is a growing and often severe access
problem for countless Americans in this age group.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of patients' advocates, many regulators and some
health care organizations, the eruption of individuals' premiums
suggests that the administration's and Congress' alternative to an
overhaul has not worked. Their alternative left the system to the
marketplace, although they did make some modest repairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No two states are alike in how they regulate the industry or in
their experience with premiums. But for all, the direction is up.
Washington state says the average rate for unsubsidized,
middle-class subscribers to a state-administered health plan rose
72 percent this year and will rise 62 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Insurance Commissioner Stephen Larsen reports increases
in the ``20-, 25-, 30-percent range'' for individuals' premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Tightly regulated New York, with increases of less than 10
percent, and New Jersey, with 14 percent, are exceptions. In Texas,
said Ana Smith-Daley, deputy commissioner for life and health
insurance, ``The range we're seeing is 7.5 percent all the way up
to 40 percent.'' Connecticut's individual premiums rose 15 percent
to 25 percent this year and will rise by the same amount next year.
</P>
<P>
   The increases, furthermore, are averages, obscuring the
experience, for example, of Ms. Couture, whose increase was much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increases in the individual or direct-pay market are
sizable and significantly more than in the group market,'' said
Scott Serota, executive vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Association, a federation of 55 insurers and health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives by Congress and the administration for incremental
intervention, with laws to help expand coverage for uninsured
children and other groups, have had little effect on individual
subscribers' costs. The two-year-old Kennedy-Kassebaum law, for
example, enables people who leave jobs and lose their employers'
health coverage to get individual policies or immediate coverage in
other jobs, but the law does not regulate premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment this year, the General Accounting Office
reported that insurers are using high premiums and other devices to
drive away applicants, especially the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the implications, Ms. Chollet says, is that many people
may continue to stay at jobs they want to leave, rather than start
their own businesses or retire, because they fear losing their
employer-subsidized insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care organizations succeeded in one respect: they
captured 85 percent of the insured work force. But their costs
still rose and most are now losing money. With the magic of managed
care still unproven, they are trying to get back in the black by
raising premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals are taking even bigger jolts. One reason, some state
regulators say, is that they offer the path of least resistance. To
raise group-coverage premiums, insurance companies must negotiate
with employers, and employers, with their own finances on the line,
drive hard bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Serota of the Blue Cross association said a more likely reason
was a sea change in how the industry grouped individual
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, health insurance companies seek the widest possible
mix of customers, young and old, sick and well. A wide mix of
thousands of subscribers permits them to spread the cost of one
subscriber's bout with cancer to the others who pay premiums but
make few demands for care.
</P>
<P>
   This system, known as community rating, is breaking down,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Most healthy working people, for example, are covered under
employer group policies, setting them apart from less healthy,
often older consumers, who typically need individual policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the cushion of legions of healthier subscribers, the
companies insuring individuals spend more for their care and
therefore must charge them more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was this development, said Kaiser Permanente, the biggest
nonprofit health maintenance organization, that forced it to take
age into account when calculating subscribers' premiums this year
and then order large increases in individuals' policies.
</P>
<P>
   In part because it stuck with community rating longer than most
organizations, Kaiser said, it lost $270 million last year and $150
million in the first half of this year. ``We're saying that
community rating is not possible,'' said Beverly Hayon, a Kaiser
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Now the demise of community rating is fueling an insidious
spiral that drives premiums still higher and throws more consumers
off the rolls. ``It's called, `Sick people in, healthy people
out,''' said Dean Rosen, senior vice president and counsel for the
Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sicker the individual subscribers are, the greater their
incentive to keep buying insurance. Healthier subscribers balk at
high premiums and drop out. Then the insurers, left with fewer and
sicker subscribers, must spend more per client for care. To avoid
losses, they raise premiums again, giving the spiral another spin
and chasing away the healthier of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, more than the federal government, are
grappling with these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Few have tried harder, and with unhappier results, than
Kentucky. To see that all individuals had access to affordable
coverage four years ago, the state prohibited insurers from taking
an applicant's health into account in calculating premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 40 insurers bailed out of the state's
direct-pay insurance market. ``Now I have two,'' said state
Insurance Commissioner George Nichols. This year, the Legislature
reversed course and, within limits, permitted the companies to use
health conditions in setting premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That is what led to Ms. Couture's notice from Anthem. ``Some
people are seeing 100 and 200 percent'' increases, Nichols said.
Lawrence Ford, Anthem's spokesman, said the company had little
choice if it wanted to avoid more losses.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states, including Connecticut, California, Florida,
Illinois, Minnesota and Washington, have found another device to
accommodate people whom insurers reject because of their health or
scare off with high premiums: high-risk insurance pools. The pools
are no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   They charge premiums that range from 25 percent to 100 percent
above those that other people pay for comparable commercial
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But because the pools' subscribers tend to be old and sick, the
cost of their care usually exceeds the higher premium, so the
states make up the difference with assessments on insurance
companies or with tax revenues.

UNMUZZLED KANSAS STATE QUARTERBACK SPEAKS OUT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Finally, he talked. About the Heisman Trophy. About
Ricky Williams. About his volatile temper.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bishop, Kansas State's mercurial quarterback, spoke to
everything except the fact that college football has three unbeaten
teams and only two national title slots.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's the case heading into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When Saturday slips into Sunday and brings to close a memorable
college football season, there's a good chance that's all anyone
will be talking about: The Bowl Championship Series rankings that
will determine which two teams get to go to the Fiesta Bowl and
play for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   At least the coaches poll's version of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what will decide the Fiesta invite. The Wildcats, 11-0
and ranked No. 1 by the coaches, versus Texas A&AMP;M, 10-2, in the Big
Twelve championship game. The Tennessee Volunteers, 11-0 and the
media poll's No. 1 team, against Mississippi State, 8-3, in the
Southeastern Conference Championship game. And UCLA, 10-0 and
everyone's No. 3, facing Miami, 7-3, in a game Hurricane Georges
cancelled earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. If all three teams win, the computer rankings _
including The New York Times _ and a formula measuring strength of
schedule will separate the fractions and decide the top two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to win. It's all we can do,'' said Bishop, who
was made available by conference call earlier in the week for the
first time since the Colorado game in October.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder, who muzzled his quarterback so
his emotional soundings wouldn't distract his team, echoed that
sentiment here Friday and summed up the state of confusion
surrounding college football's newfangled ranking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' said a befuddled Snyder of what Kansas State
needed to do to improve it's No. 3 BCS ranking. ``I do know we need
to win here to have the opportunity for the Fiesta Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Snyder's Wildcats have 6.31 BCS points
compared to the Bruins 5.03 and the Volunteers 4.99. To add
legitimacy to the title game, the coaches have agreed to award it's
final No. 1 ranking to the winner. If Kansas State is shut out of
the Fiesta, the coaches are in the odd predicament of crowning a
champion they didn't think was worthy during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Each team has much to recommend, as well as discourage those
weighing their title campaigns. Kansas State's defense allows the
second fewest yards of any team in the nation and it's offense is
ranked ninth in yardage. But it's schedule is ranked the 62nd
toughest by the BCS due to early season games with Northern
Illinois, Northeast Louisiana and Indiana State. A win over the
Aggies will improve that but probably not enough to creep forward.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's statistics, on the other hand, are solid but hardly
spectacular. They have the 23rd ranked defense, 31st ranked offense
and a schedule considered the 29th toughest by the ranking system.
Still, the Volunteers have wins against high profile teams _
Florida, Georgia, Arkansas and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is the team that most refuse to recognize as title worthy.
Their high powered offense, 12th in total yards, bails out a
defense ranked 91st.
</P>
<P>
   They've needed late-game finishes to beat lowly Stanford and
Oregon State, but have been assigned the seventh toughest schedule
because of a competitive PAC 10 schedule, beating Arizona (11-1),
as well as having the best opponents record of the three: 60-42.
</P>
<P>
   None of this statistical hair splitting, however, appears to
deter Bishop. He is 46-1 as a collegiate starter who is perhaps two
games away from completing his third perfect season _ twice he led
undefeated teams to national junior college championships at Blinn
Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knows Texas A&AMP;M ``would like to spoil our perfect
season and national title shot'' but, in the sort of statement that
makes Snyder wince, indicates that isn't going to happen. ``I don't
think we've played our best game yet. Our confidence is high,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he wasn't too concerned that his banishment to the
media sidelines have hurt his Heisman Trophy chances despite the
kind of versatile and impressive numbers that have pro scouts
moving him up the draft ladder. He has run for 13 touchdowns and
passed for 21 more and 2,503 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is not going to make me perform. I had more time to
concentrate. It helped me more than hurt me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of his penchant for initiating unnecessary hits at the end or
runs and berating himself and teammates in an animated on-field
fashion, the senior shrugged that off, too. ``Sometimes I tend to
get overexcited. I get psyched up too high. I play on sheer
emotion,'' he conceded. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it all my life. It carries me a long away.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says he is comfortable sharing the dais in New York with
the player he says should win the Heisman Trophy. ``I'd vote for
Ricky. He did some great things for his team. He broke the
record,'' he said of Williams NCAA career rushing record. ``I'll
take the opportunity to play for the national championship over the
Heisman any day.''

CANADA TO REDUCE BARRIERS AGAINST U.S. FARM PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to head off a border blockade by angry
American farmers, Canada agreed Friday to lower barriers to farm
exports from the United States but not to reduce its own shipments
of meat and grain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, reached after months of negotiations
between Canadian and U.S. trade and agriculture officials, Canada
promised to let U.S. farmers export grain by rail more easily, to
revise its health regulations on imported livestock, and to
eliminate burdensome testing requirements for a wheat disease
called karnal bunt.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Canadian currency has helped lower prices for
Canadian grain and meat that have been pouring into U.S. markets
for months, frustrating farmers in the United States who have
threatened to set up blockades at the border in the next few days.
American wheat farmers temporarily held up shipments from Canada
this summer, contending that the wheat was unfairly priced.
</P>
<P>
   As the new deal was announced, farm leaders called for an end to
the threat of a blockade. ``Given the success of these
negotiations, an imminent blockade of ports of entry is totally
unwarranted,'' said Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm
Bureau Federation. ``The last thing U.S. farmers can afford is an
irresponsible action that would shut down, even temporarily, trade
with one of our best customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
commented, ``This is a first step, but for American farmers and
ranchers it is good news in a trying year.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Minister Lyle Van Clief of Canada said, ``I think
both countries have had a victory.'' He praised American
negotiators for taking ``the path of trade enhancement and not
trade restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada and the United States are each other's largest trading
partners. American officials said that in the fiscal year that
ended on Sept. 30, the United States shipped $7 billion of
agricultural products to Canada and Canadian farmers exported $7.7
billion of goods to the United States. But in commodities such as
wheat, the imbalance was greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot easier for Canada to ship agricultural
products to the United States than it's been for the United States
to ship to Canada, which has caused great frustration among our
farmers and ranchers,'' a senior administration trade official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Hauck, chairman of the international markets committee of
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said, ``We have Canada's
attention,'' and he called for ``continued aggressive action'' from
the Clinton administration to lower Canadian trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. growers have been faced with a spate of bad news. Asian
nations, immersed in their own economic crises, can no longer
afford to buy as much food as they did before from the United
States. At home, U.S. farmers have had to contend with lower prices
and supply gluts caused in part by the Canadian imports.
</P>
<P>
   Congress increased farm aid at the insistence of the Clinton
administration, but lawmakers from the northern Plains states have
said that their constituents continue to face an economic crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It would be our hope that farmers and governors and elected
officials in this region would see that they now have a mechanism
in place to address problems, and it's not just a lot of talk,''
the senior U.S. official said in a briefing for reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But North Dakota's Sen. Byron Dorgan, a Democrat who has called
for cuts in Canadian exports, said the agreement was an
``illusion'' and that the United States should press a trade
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement did not restrict imports from Canada, it
contained several provisions meant to make it easier for the United
States to detect unfairly priced goods, especially wheat, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will begin to monitor imports of Canadian
grain more closely, requiring Canadian shippers of wheat to provide
more information to Customs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Flory, president of the U.S. National Association of Wheat
Growers, said the new data would ``lift the veil of secrecy'' that
has allowed the Canadian Wheat Board, a monopoly state trading
enterprise, to sell more wheat in the United States. U.S. farmers
have complained for years that the board has used discriminatory
pricing to penetrate U.S. markets and to undercut American grain in
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   Canada also agreed to drop immediately its requirement that hogs
shipped live from the United States be held in quarantine for 30
days. The pork industry in the United States has been plagued by
oversupply, driving prices to 18{-year lows; eliminating the
quarantine should provide something of an escape valve for the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Reifschneider, a hog producer from Illinois who is
president of the National Pork Producers Council, praised that
provision, saying that ``the choice of sending hogs north will be
very significant for certain producers, particularly in border
states.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she did not expect a significant number of hogs to
be sent north right away, and she added that about 4 million
Canadian hogs, one-fifth of Canada's production, would be exported
to the United States this year, adding to the backlog at
meat-packing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Canada also said it would expand agreements allowing cattle to
be shipped north for fattening under less burdensome regulations.

GM RETHINKS ITS VANS AND COMES UP WITH WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chrysler may have defined the minivan with its highly successful
products, but General Motors conceded a huge share of the market by
rolling out its futuristic ``Dustbuster''-looking models in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After virtually ignoring the minivan phenomenon for six years,
then coming out with such a controversial product, GM allowed
Chrysler to gain a strong position as minivan market leader.
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, the GM products _ the Chevrolet Lumina APV,
Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac TransSport _ were competent
vehicles. However, their radical styling never caught on with
consumers, and the products failed miserably in competition with
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The styling controversy is over, however, thanks to the
conventional redesign of all three products for the 1997 model
year. Anyone who buys a minivan today without giving the GM vans a
look is just not shopping very wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car this week, the 1999 Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere
edition ($31,175, including $570 transportation), is arguably the
best minivan ever built. And compared with similarly equipped
sport-utility vehicles, the Silhouette Premiere is quite a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Silhouette's annual sales have doubled since the redesign, and
the other GM minivans are doing well, too. But buyers still aren't
taking to the new GM vans the way they do Chrysler products, and
that's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Oldsmobile should have changed the name of the
Silhouette to help people forget their bad impressions of the odd
predecessor. Chevy did that with its new model, calling it the
Venture. Pontiac finally dropped the TransSport designation this
year and is calling its minivan the Montana, a name that has been
used the past two years on a highly successful sport-utilitylike
version of the TransSport.
</P>
<P>
   The Silhouette now is every bit as ``normal'' as the industry
sales leaders, with huge added measures of style, performance,
luxury and convenience that the competitors don't offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Silhouette, as well as the rest of the GM minivans, has two
sliding doors _ driver's and passenger's side _ just like the
competition. But these vans go one up on the competition with their
electrically operated passenger-side sliding door, an industry
exclusive that was introduced on the earlier Silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   That feature alone is worth buying a GM minivan, especially if
you've got kids who have a tough time closing the bulky sliding
doors found on most minivans. Those of you who have owned minivans
know how often you have had to come around the vehicle and open or
close the door for your rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can just push a button on the overhead console in front
of the driver, or by the door itself, or use the remote control,
and the side door slides open quickly and quietly. Another touch of
the button closes it just as easily. A locking switch on the
overhead console disables the electric operation, and sensors in
the door will stop it from closing if something gets in its way _
such as a child's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Silhouette Premiere edition is the top-of-the-line
long-wheelbase GLS model with a special audio-video package that
includes a pull-down color LCD video screen in the center of the
roof behind the front seats. It is linked to a videocassette player
mounted at the bottom of the center dash console
radio/heating-air-conditioning stack.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with two videotapes, so the kids enjoyed
``Monty Python'' and ``Ace Ventura'' as we cruised through traffic.
The kids can hook up the headphones and listen in private as the
front-seat passengers groove on oldies radio or a favorite compact
disc. There are outlets for six headsets, each with its own volume
control, and they can be tuned to the radio, CD player, cassette
tape deck or video player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first minivan that makes me feel like I'm in
sports car, not a domestic mom-mobile, and it makes me want to take
a long trip somewhere,'' my significant other remarked after a
couple of rides in the Silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't agree more. I was tempted to call the Olds folks and
ask them to send me the payment book; I just didn't want to give
the Silhouette up.
</P>
<P>
   All the GM minivans are powered by a peppy 3.4-liter V-6 engine,
rated at 185 horsepower and 210 foot-pounds of torque. They come
with a smooth-shifting, electronically operated four-speed
automatic transmission. The combination gives excellent pickup for
merging and passing, as well as plenty of power for high-speed
freeway driving.
</P>
<P>
   This is a vehicle made for cruising, and creature comforts
abound. The seats are as comfortable as an easy chair, and the ride
is so carlike that you'll forget you're in a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The Premiere comes with two captains' chairs up front and two
more in the middle seating row; the third seat is a bench roomy
enough for three adults. Handling is rather sporty, too _ nothing
like a minivan, more like a midsize family sedan.
</P>
<P>
   This is the extended model, so there is more luggage space in
the rear than in the standard-length vans _ 24.2 cubic feet vs.
16.3.
</P>
<P>
   There are no options on the Premiere model; everything is
included in the sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   Among the standard features are leather upholstery, automatic
air-conditioning, antilock brakes, power windows/door locks, heated
power-operated outside mirrors with fold-in feature, remote keyless
entry, 15-inch aluminum wheels, steering wheel radio controls, and
rear controls for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. Other
benefits include cruise control, rooftop luggage rack, halogen
headlights, cup holders for everyone and a touring suspension with
automatic leveling,
</P>
<P>
   There are front and side air bags for the driver and front
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy isn't bad, either. EPA ratings are 18 miles per
gallon in the city and 25 on the highway _ quite an improvement
over most comparably priced sport-utility vehicles. The tank holds
25 gallons of gasoline (extended-length model; 20 gallons in
standard length models).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a fresh wave of corporate downsizing announcements, the
government reported Friday that more Americans are working than
ever and that the overall economy continued to create jobs at a
robust clip.
</P>
<P>
   While corporate giants from Boeing to Johnson &AMP; Johnson are
planning to lay off tens of thousands of employees because of
various business difficulties, American employers expanded their
payrolls by an estimated 267,000 workers in November alone, the
Labor Department reported. Unemployment fell from 4.6 percent to
4.4 percent, coming close to the lowest jobless rate in the past
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The gain in jobs was the largest in three months and matches the
strong pace of the first half of the year. Moreover, the economy
created more new jobs in September and October than had been
previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``However many jobs were lost in November, even more were
created,'' said Thomas Nardone, who is in charge of gathering
employment figures at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A record 64.1 percent of all Americans of working age now have
jobs. And even though about 250,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs
have been lost this year, on average American workers are earning
3.7 percent more than a year ago, a strong increase at a time when
inflation has nearly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tightest labor market in decades _ the unemployment
rate has been below 5 percent for nearly a year and a half _ there
is little evidence that rising wages are starting to push up
prices.
</P>
<P>
   While economic turmoil swirls outside the United States, workers
between the ages of 35 to 54 _ the breadwinners of millions of
American families _ are enjoying the same low unemployment rate, 3
percent, as in the best of the Eisenhower years.
</P>
<P>
   The strong labor market suggests that the economy, while
expected to slow from the current brisk pace, has plenty of
momentum to keep expanding into next year. Wall Street cheered the
job gains, seeing hints that company profits may improve next year,
and sent the stock market higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.46 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,016.14. The bond market, which often fears that a
robust economy threatens to lift inflation, took the unexpectedly
strong Labor Department report largely in stride, pushing up
long-term interest rates only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The report appeared to dash any lingering hopes that the Federal
Reserve might reduce interest rates again when it meets later this
month for its final monetary policy session of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the economy has been growing at a 3.7 percent
annual rate and adding an average of 226,000 jobs a month. The
economy entered its 91st month of uninterrupted growth in December,
meaning that the current expansion will soon go on record as even
longer than the 92-month period of growth in the 1980s and could
even surpass the record 1960s expansion if growth continues for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   All is not rosy by any means. American manufacturers are
struggling and factory workers are getting the ax in large numbers.
Manufacturers shed 47,000 jobs last month after eliminating 61,000
in October. But a roughly equal number of construction jobs were
added and the service sector continued to race ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spending and construction boom and a production
bust,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   John Challenger, the chairman of Challenger, Gray and Christmas,
a consulting firm, contends that the rash of recent layoff
announcements represents a new surge. But Friday's job report shows
that the number of people who became unemployed because they lost
an existing job has remained roughly constant for the past year.
The level was 1.9 million in November.
</P>
<P>
   How can the total number of jobs grow when so many people appear
to be losing theirs? The answer lies in the process of constant job
destruction and job creation that the economist Joseph Schumpeter
termed ``creative destruction'' as long ago as 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Even a large number of layoff announcements that are expected to
exceed 600,000 this year pales in an economy that has added more
than 19 million jobs this decade and currently employs about 132
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, numbers based on newspaper reports grossly understate
the amount of job destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big layoff stories are the tip of the iceberg,'' said Steven
Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago's business
school. Roughly one job in 10 disappears in a typical year,
research by Davis and others shows. That means roughly 13 million
jobs vanished this year. Yet not only were all those jobs replaced,
but several million more were created.
</P>
<P>
   When unemployment is this low, workers to fill new jobs have to
come from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing lays off 20,000 workers, we need them,'' said
William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of
Independent Business. Nearly one-third of small businesses surveyed
last month reported having trouble filling job openings. ``These
are not hamburger flipping jobs,'' Dunkelberg added.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that he is right comes from the rapid rise in average
wages, especially in real, inflation-adjusted terms, for the last
few years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, there is plenty of pain in manufacturing, which
employs about 15 percent of the work force. American industry is
being battered by a nasty combination of slowing capital investment
at home, collapsing export markets abroad and surging imports, all
of which depress prices and profits as well as cut into sales. A
sharp 1.6 percent drop in factory orders in October portends
further pain ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Since last March, manufacturing payrolls have fallen by nearly a
quarter of a million jobs as companies cut production and struggle
to rein in costs. Not surprisingly, the cutbacks have been steepest
in those industries that are most affected by foreign trade,
including metal, transportation equipment, capital goods, clothing,
textiles and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   While manufacturing is in a slump, the rest of the economy is on
a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, gearing up for holiday sales, did lots of hiring,
adding 65,000 more workers than they normally do at this time of
year. Over the year, employment in this industry has risen by
457,000.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in housing and a surge in heavy construction projects
added 47,000 new jobs as fewer than the usual number of carpenters,
electricians and plumbers were laid off. The housing boom also
spilled over into the finance industry where most of the 10,000 new
jobs were created among mortgage brokerage firms. The insurance and
real estate industries added 5,000 and 7,000 positions,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, employment in construction has risen
310,000. ``The housing market is going to set its third consecutive
record this year,'' said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie
Mae, the nation's biggest buyer of home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   As it has month after month, the sprawling service sector
continued to power the job machine, adding 50,000 new jobs in
November, the largest increase since May. Employment in business
services rose by 55,000, including 30,000 management and
engineering consultants. Private educational services added 15,000
jobs in the month, for a total gain of 54,000 since August.
Employment in health services was up 14,000, with the largest
increase in doctors' offices and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   With labor markets this tight and job growth this robust, wages
are rising briskly, but the pace of increase slowed slightly last
month. Hourly earnings rose 3 cents in November, to $12.93.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with workers producing more per hour, those wage gains
are being largely offset by greater efficiency, easing the strains
on companies that find it difficult, if not impossible, to raise
prices.

SUHARTO SAYS HIS MILLIONS WERE EARNED, NOT STOLEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Suharto, the former president, who is being
threatened with house arrest, has defended himself with a simple
answer against charges of corruptly amassing a huge personal
fortune: He is a good saver and landlord.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, published Friday in Dharmais, a Jakarta
magazine, Suharto said $3 million found in his local bank accounts
was from his presidential earnings and rent earned from two houses.
The magazine is run by a charity that he owned until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the wealth Suharto accumulated during a 32-year
reign range up to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dharmais quoted Suharto as saying: ``That money I collected and
deposited in the banks, and every month it increased until it
reached this amount of about 22 billion rupiah'' _ or $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said Friday that the attorney general
could put Suharto under house arrest while an investigation into
his wealth continues. The attorney general, Andi Ghalib, said
Suharto could be summoned for questioning next week.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police officers and soldiers scuffled again Friday with
student protesters trying to march on Suharto's residence and the
presidential palace to press demands for his arrest and trial over
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say they consider it unlikely that Suharto will face
corruption charges. They say President B.J. Habibie, a Suharto
protege, and the country's armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, would
resist a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senior presidential advisers and the head of the governing
Golkar Party in Parliament have declared that even if Suharto is
tried and convicted on corruption charges, he will almost certainly
be granted amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with daily protests by thousands of students who have
jammed traffic in the capital, Suharto turned over to the
government last week seven charity foundations valued at $528
million, including the one that owns Dharmais.

CLINTON'S LAWYERS CLAIM THEIR DEFENSE COULD PUSH IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY INTO NEW YEAR, NEW CONGRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans prepared articles of
impeachment against President Clinton late Friday, his legal team
notified the House Judiciary Committee that three or four days,
plus several witnesses, will be needed next week to mount his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal outlined by Clinton's lawyers, who called the
committee's impeachment inquiry ``inadequate'' so far, threatens to
derail plans by Republican House leaders to complete the panel's
work late next week and put the issue before the full House at
least a week before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered to the Capitol shortly after dusk, White
House lawyers outlined plans to summon three panels of experts to
explore the constitutional standards for impeachment, standards for
prosecution and prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was delivered to the House Judiciary Committee, where
the Republican staff was preparing articles of impeachment accusing
the president of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power. The articles mirror the allegations outlined against Clinton
in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to the House on the
president's effort to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Committee GOP spokesman Paul McNulty said the White House
request to question witnesses over a three or four day period ``is
an obvious and desperate political ploy to push the inquiry into
the new Congress where the Democrats potentially have more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart scoffed at the committee's
assertion. ``If we wanted to push this back we could have asked for
a lot more time,'' Lockhart said. ``If presenting a defense is seen
by the committee as a ploy, that indicates how political they've
become.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the House has 228 Republican members, 206 Democrats
and one independent, who is expected to side with the Democrats on
impeachment. Democrats picked up five seats in last month's
elections, which means there will be a 223-211-1 division of the
House beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican-controlled committee is expected to vote
along party lines to approve at least one article of impeachment,
the issue has a less certain future in the full House, where some
moderates have expressed reservation about pushing for removal of a
president on charges growing out of a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of providing some form of punishment for Clinton's
admitted misbehavior, Democrats have begun composing various
censure resolutions they hope to debate before the committee late
next week and, failing there, on the floor of the House the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   A schedule provided by committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
has part of Tuesday set aside for the president or his lawyers to
present his case to the panel. The rest of Tuesday and all of
Wednesday would be spent listening to presentations from the
committee's GOP and Democratic investigators. The committee would
then have the next three days to deliberate the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter delivered to the House Judiciary Committee, White
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and Special Counsel Gregory B.
Craig noted that the committee has held only two public hearings
and the president's lawyers were invited to participate in only
one, and then for only an hour. ``It is our view that the
proceedings to date have been inadequate and incomplete,'' the two
lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La., has repeatedly
pressed the committee to complete its work in time for the full
House to vote before Christmas. If the full House votes to impeach
Clinton, the issue then moves to the Senate, where a trial would be
held. A two-thirds vote by the Senate would result in Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican governors, who were in Washington to meet
with GOP congressional leaders, urged a quick resolution to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want this issue to be resolved one way or the
other and to move on,'' said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, chair
of the Republican Governors Association, during a news conference
with four other GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Gov. John Rowland estimated that a half-dozen
Republican governors agree that Congress should censure Clinton _ a
proposal acceptable to the White House _ to avoid a lengthy
impeachment process so Congress can move on to other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we're not going to get back to all those
agenda items until we get this finished,'' Rowland said. &QL;

`PSYCHO': THE MAMA'S BOY, HIS MOTEL GUEST AND THAT SHOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds 1st name for Vince Vaughn, in 6th graf)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gus Van Sant's new color replica of ``Psycho'' opened without
advance screenings Friday, adopting Alfred Hitchcock's policy of
dodging reviews but neglecting some of his other, even better
marketing ideas. There was a time when no one could enter a theater
playing ``Psycho'' after the film had started. Today's audiences
can traipse freely, and at the theater I attended somebody even
made a loud cellular phone call just as the rest of us were bracing
ourselves for the shower scene. Anyway, the film's main suspense
revolved around a single question: now that room rent at the Bates
Motel is up to $36.50, what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the apparent rocks in Van Sant's head are mere
pebbles. If he isn't Hitchcock, neither is he crazy. His film is an
artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats
plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real
``Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom
diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most
brilliant blueprints. Those of us not quite ready to write off the
first film will gain little from learning that Norman keeps porn
magazines and toy soldiers in his once off-limits childhood
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   If the filmmaker is right in supposing that ``Psycho'' is most
widely remembered as that scary shower movie, here's a brief
reminder. A secretary named Marion Crane (originally Janet Leigh)
has a lover who won't marry her for financial reasons. So she
absconds with a pile of cash that has literally landed in her lap.
Eager to hide, Marion checks into a remote motel and winds up
having a powerfully disturbing effect on the proprietor. Then he
has an even more disturbing effect on her. Three other characters
(Marion's sister, lover and a private detective) begin
investigating Marion's disappearance. Norman, an amateur
taxidermist, has one scary mom watching all this from her perch
atop a hill.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' begins promisingly with bold green added to
the Saul Bass title sequence, a fuller sound to Bernard Herrmann's
unforgettable theme music (re-recorded by Danny Elfman) and Anne
Heche refreshingly cast in Marion's role. Ms. Heche, along with
Julianne Moore as her no-nonsense sister and William H. Macy as the
detective, is one of the players here who speak Joseph Stefano's
dialogue as if it were brand-new and who successfully recreate
their characters in present-day terms. (``Why?'' Ms. Heche asks
irritably, when a policeman asks to see her license and
registration.)
</P>
<P>
   This Marion is almost as demure as Ms. Leigh's, yet she's also
more headstrong and flirty. Aided this time by witty costume and
production design, she now sports orange underwear (in the opening
hotel scene), an orange paper parasol (at the car lot) and orange
nail polish to match her orange blood in the shower scene that Van
Sant has modified only slightly and ineffectually. Shots of roiling
clouds are now interjected into this famous sequence, and the stab
marks show up more.
</P>
<P>
   If this ``Psycho'' makes the most of its Marion, the same can't
be said of its Norman Bates. The absence of anything like Anthony
Perkins' sensational performance with that vitally birdlike
presence and sneaky way with a double-entendre (``A boy's best
friend is his mother'') is the new film's greatest weakness. While
Vince Vaughn gives the role its share of creepiness, his beefy
presence and mechanical recitations also throw off the material's
exquisite balance. (The intriguing physical resemblances between
the story's matched pairs of characters have been eradicated.) And
another of Van Sant's new ideas, having Norman masturbate just
before he kills Marion, would seem to dispel the very tension that
matters most to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond having weakened two principal male characters (Viggo
Mortensen seems equally miscast as Marion's love, John Saxon's old
role, though he does seem more likely to be spending his life in a
hardware store) and greatly bolstered the women, Van Sant adds
extra ambient sound and a few more insect actors. (Fly and spider
wranglers get screen credit this time.) However interesting these
modifications are, they won't make ``Psycho'' any more
``Scream''-like for viewers who like fast, easy fright. It remains
the most structurally elegant and sneakily playful of thrillers. At
least some things never change.

   NEW YORK _ Sure, it was pleasant for Kevin Kane, a 43-year-old
playwright, to stroll Central Park in a T-shirt and khaki shorts.
Who wouldn't enjoy late May warmth in early December?
</P>
<P>
   But as the temperature climbed to a record-breaking 74 degrees,
Kane could not shake the feeling that heat in December was
unnatural and possibly an ominous sign of problems like global
warming. ``It's a little scary,'' he said. ``It's strange. I worry
about my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the people walking or jogging or sunning themselves
in the park were simply luxuriating in the unseasonable spring.
After seven consecutive days, some were beginning to take the
warmth for granted, like Floridians who think that Christmas
shopping in sandals and a T-shirt is perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, it no longer seemed peculiar to go outside
without a sweater, let alone a jacket, or to enter a subway car and
feel a chilly blast from the air-conditioning. As a rider on the
No. 1 line pointed out briskly: ``It's 70 degrees outside.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, customers who had rented air-conditioning units for
their homes and procrastinated about returning them were calling to
request extensions, said Mel Parker, owner of Aabco, a Manhattan
air-conditioning repair and rental store.
</P>
<P>
   A quick scan of the crowds in midtown Manhattan indicated that
most people had dressed appropriately for the occasion. Relatively
few were carrying _ let alone wearing _ coats or jackets. And if
hot chocolate wasn't selling, ice cream definitely was. The Ben &AMP;
Jerry's at Times Square dispensed almost twice as many cones as
usual in December, said Heidy Ardon, the supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   All over Bryant Park, people on lunch breaks were lounging
outside, chewing and sipping and reading and talking. ``I haven't
brought my jacket at all this week,'' said Craig Van Steenbergen,
an architect from Fairfield, Conn., as he smoked a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Northeast, as far north as Vermont and Maine,
people were carrying their coats or leaving them at home and
treating themselves to cups of frozen yogurt and ice cream. There
were record-high temperatures in Newark, N.J., where it hit 75
degrees; Bridgeport, Conn., which reached 72 degrees, and
Providence, R.I., at 71 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, N.J., where temperatures reached 66 degrees, 2
degrees below the record, a United Parcel Service deliveryman could
be seen making his rounds in shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Fisher, a bank employee in Providence, N.J., pronounced
the weather ``absolutely fabulous,'' as she basked in the sun
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, people seem to be taking the warmth _ which
has extended along the East Coast and across the entire country _
in stride. But for weather-watchers, this out-of-season heat had
created excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets my juices going,'' said Fred Gadomski, a
meteorologist with the Pennsylvania State University weather
communication group. ``This is a truly extraordinary weather
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is rapidly nearing its end, he said. This weekend should
be brisk and considerably cooler, with temperatures in the low 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The weather _ which has been warm for a week from San Francisco
across to the Rocky Mountains, and the Midwest, and from the South
up into Maine _ has been the result of floods of temperate air
masses from the Pacific Ocean. This is contrary to the typical
pattern this time of year of air masses that move down from Canada.
The unusual air-mass movements have created the second-warmest
year, through October, for the entire country since records were
first compiled in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air over the Pacific is a heck of a lot warmer than air from
Canada,'' Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaking heat Friday in and around New York was
enhanced by winds flowing down from the Catskill Mountains, he
said. ``As the air is forced downhill from the mountains, it
compresses, which warms it,'' Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, chilly weather should return, he said. The
temperature will drop to the 40s during the day, and there may be
snow in and around northern New York.
</P>
<P>
   For some _ say, the people selling Christmas trees and the
managers of the Wollman and Rockefeller Center ice-skating rinks _
that will come as welcome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling people I should be selling palm trees
instead of balsam firs,'' said Alan Johnston, who came down from
Quebec City for the month to work at the tree stand at 94th Street
and Broadway. Sales have been very slow, he said. ``People aren't
used to buying trees in such warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Courter, the manager of a high-rise building in San Diego,
had been looking forward to ``Christmas weather.'' In anticipation,
he spent $400 on a heavy winter coat, which he left in the hotel
room. ``Needless to say, that's where it will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Williams, 30, and Jay Funderburke, 32, visiting from
Donaldsville, Ga., seemed determined to have a good time in New
York, despite the un-Christmasy heat. ``I'm still seeing the
city,'' said Williams, who was looking forward to his first
experience of snow. ``But,'' he added dolefully, ``it would really
be nicer if it was cold.''

THE REMAKE OF `PSYCHO': TOO TRUE TO BE GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few hard-core film fanatics may be miffed that the new
``Psycho'' clocks in at a few minutes less the original's running
time, comes in color and tweaks its characters to bring them up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of us, the question is why make a virtual copy
of a classic movie.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gus Van Sant's hotly debated ``remake'' of Alfred
Hitchcock's sinister 1960 horror thriller is rigidly and
unabashedly faithful to its black-and-white predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been a few ``renovations'' at the Bates
Motel. Hitchcock made ``Psycho'' for a measly $800,000, keeping
costs down by using a TV crew to shoot the film. he only place in
which he refused to pinch pennies was the shower scene. Van Sant
spent somewhere between $20million and $25million. But his copy
still has a seedy, dingy look.
</P>
<P>
   Most people know the story: Marion Crane (Anne Heche) embezzles
money from her employer in Phoenix and heads to Fairville, Calif.,
to surprise her lover, Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). She's stopped
by a Highway Patrol officer after falling asleep in her car by the
side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   She's a little nervous; he zooms in on her tenseness and follows
her. Marion trades in her car to cover her tracks and, as she
speeds toward Sam, notices the lines in the road blurring in the
heavy rain. She grows sleepy and pulls into the desolate little
Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) and his ailing
mother. And what would feel better after a rough drive than a nice,
long, hot shower?
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant toils shot-by-shot from Joseph Stefano's original 1960
screenplay adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel. Changes include a
few added zeroes in the amount of money Marion steals from her
boss; her lover, Sam, is now a dry-witted cowboy and her sister,
Lila, a no-nonsense feminist. There's even a scene where Norman
masturbates as he spies on Marion getting ready for her shower.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it's business as usual. Van Sant's version
looks as textured and weathered as old wallpaper. His colors are
drab and muted and don't change the story's tension.
</P>
<P>
   The two shown incidents of violence _ the stabbing in the shower
and the murder of investigator Arbogast (William H. Macy) _ are
identical to those that shocked audiences and earned scathing
reviews from critics in 1960. In the shower scene, we still don't
see the knife touch skin. It's all implied, although the brutality
of the act is still terrifying. But it will probably prove way too
tame for today's audiences, saturated by cartoon violence in films
and on TV. The horror of ``Psycho'' is psychological and,
unfortunately, Van Sant drops the ball in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   The film's real problem is Vaughn. He's too arch and smug to
convey the skittish paranoia and panic lurking deep inside Norman
Bates. The role will always belong to Anthony Perkins, who had the
right mix of shyness and confusion. Vaughn is menacing, strong,
full of tics and he looks ridiculous, not horrifying, in a dress.
</P>
<P>
   So, is it worth it? As long as Heche's character is alive, it's
momentarily fun. But it's a fast, dull, downhill slide from there.
The tune-up proves so negligible that the remake isn't warranted or
necessary _ especially such a reverent, merely serviceable copy
that neither enhances nor builds on a film that has managed to
transcend time.
</P>
<P>
   Psycho. Directed by Gus Van Sant. Written by Joseph Stefano.
Cast: Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, Anne Heche, Viggo Mortensen.
Universal Pictures. 105 minutes. Rated R for violence, nudity.

OBESITY INCREASING DESPITE WARNINGS, DOCTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DELORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have
done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United
States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of
children now considered obese, a top US health official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health
issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this
mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr. William H. Dietz,
director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to solving the tobacco problem. The next
major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said
Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that obesity and related health problems consume
about 6 percent of the national health care budget, as estimated by
one recent Harvard study, ``not to do anything about obesity and
physical inactivity is very expensive,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other
speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and
statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds
and the difficulty in shedding them.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of
10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a
result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being
consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz
has calculated but not yet published.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who
gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result
of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time
period. A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that
period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day,
according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex
formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana
provides about 80 calories.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent
obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first
revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years,
adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height
measurements, according to Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better
measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and
height charts.
</P>
<P>
   The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and
parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the
same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of
other children of the same age. ``That's a big deal,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income
children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras, director of Pediatric and
Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public
Health, presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts
children under the age of five in the government nutritional
program Woman, Infants, and Children.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels,
an indication of anemia, while the percentage of children who were
overweight was more than twice as high as expected, 10.5 percent.
Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary 1997 figures, to be released in the next couple of
months, suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight
children in WIC, but the numbers for low hemoglobin, short stature,
and being under weight appear to be holding steady,
Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview.

FREDDIE YOUNG, 96, OSCAR-WINNING CINEMATOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Freddie Young, one of the world's most respected
cinematographers, whose work included an elaborate series of
dissolves for the montage that opens Alfred Hitchcock's
``Blackmail,'' Britain's first talkie, and the famous three-minute
shot in David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia'' in which Omar Sharif
slowly emerges from the shimmering desert haze, died on Dec. 1, his
family said. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   In his long and distinguished career, Young had a reputation for
being a consummate professional, a craftsman who strove to recreate
the simplicity of real life on film and who believed that
filmmaking was a collaborative effort in which his job was to
serve, and enhance if possible, the director's vision.
</P>
<P>
   His talents were well recognized: He was a nominee many times
for Academy Awards for cinematography, and a winner three times:
for ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), ``Dr. Zhivago'' (1965) and
``Ryan's Daughter'' (1970), all directed by Lean.
</P>
<P>
   Young was born in London in 1902, the seventh of eight children.
His family was poor, so he left school at the age of 14 to work in
a munitions factory, helping make hand grenades. But he hated it,
and _ inspired by frequent trips to the movies with his brother
Bill _ knocked on the door at Gaumont Studios, a London studio now
defunct, and was hired to work in the film lab. He quickly advanced
to lab manager.
</P>
<P>
   When the studio closed, he joined British and Dominions, the
film company run by Herbert Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to do anything, he occasionally worked as a stuntman in
films like ``Rob Roy'' (1922), in which he plunged from a 50-foot
castle wall, and ``Triumph of the Rat'' (1926), where he was the
stunt double for the actor Ivor Novello, hurling himself through
Paris traffic. In the 1930s, he was chief cameraman for many of
Wilcox's films, including ``The Blue Danube'' (1932) and ``Goodbye
Mr. Chips'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   After spending World War II making films for the Army Film Unit,
Young became chief cameraman of MGM's British arm, working with
such directors as John Ford, King Vidor and George Cukor.
</P>
<P>
   He met Lean, beginning what would be a long and fruitful
collaboration, when the two worked together on ``Major Barbara''
(1941), the film version of Shaw's play. But the relationship
wasn't always easy: After one particularly harsh command from Lean,
Young looked at him coolly and said, ``Don't teach your grandmother
to suck eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Young tended to grumble that Lean never gave him enough
credit, some years later the director wrote flatteringly to him
about their work together. ``For the most part, I will give you a
setup, fiddle around with the props, talk to the actors and go and
have a cup of tea,'' Lean said. ``I know a bit about lenses,
consider myself rather bright about composition and, at a pinch,
make a suggestion or minor criticism about lighting, but on the
whole you're a lonely man left to your own devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Young married his first wife, Marjorie, in 1927; she died in
1963. He is survived by his second wife, Joan, and three children.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-energetic Young worked late into his life, and came out
of retirement at the age of 82 to direct ``Arthur's Hallowed
Ground'' for television.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he spent his final years painting, which he adored.
``I'm creating pictures with a paintbrush with nobody to interfere
with my work,'' he wrote in his autobiography, ``Seventy Light
Years: A Life in Movies,'' which is to be published in Britain by
Faber &AMP; Faber next year. ``It's marvelous.''

   ``In my judgment, it could have been avoided,'' Secretary Ed
Feaver said. ``That's what makes it so difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 volunteers aided law enforcement officials in
searching for Kayla McKean after her father reported her missing on
Thanksgiving. Five days later, the father confessed to fatally
beating her and led officers to the remote area where he had buried
the child.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Richard Adams, 24, of Clermont in Lake County north
of Orlando, was charged with murder after confessing he beat the
girl the night before Thanksgiving when she soiled her pants,
authorities say. His wife and the girl's stepmother, Marcie Adams,
22, has been charged with a felony count of aggravated child abuse
by neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The death was apparently the culmination of abuse that had been
documented in several reports to child welfare officials since
April 1997, but that inexplicably prompted no action to protect the
girl, Feaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the father would attribute his daughter's injuries to
accidents and she would be released back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had been given informal custody of the girl since April
1998 by her mother, Elizabeth McKean, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Feaver said the case is still under investigation but enough is
known for his department to institute changes in the handling of
child abuse investigations. He said, for instance, that
investigators will be prohibited from relying on anything but their
own examination of the child to determine whether injuries are
accidental or inflicted. He said that in Kayla's case, a child
protection team relied on a telephone consultation with emergency
room doctors to determine that her injuries were consistent with an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Feaver also said that department workers will now have to turn
over their entire case files to the court when judges are
considering whether to place the child in protective custody. That
way, he said, a judge would have enough information to assess
whether the child should be kept from the family. In Kayla's case,
a judge complained he would not have returned her to the home had
he known all the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Feaver said training will also be revamped to emphasize the
supervision of cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kayla first came to the attention of his department last
year when her school reported she had a bruise under her left ear
and was shy and withdrawn. He said the girl's family said the
injury had been caused by spider bites or anemia and a department
doctor referred the girl to medical follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   This May, after Kayla had moved in with her father and his wife
and the couple's one-year-old child, she was taken to an emergency
room with injuries that included black eyes and a fractured nose
and hand. Adams explained she had fallen off her bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Feaver said that after a telephone consultation, workers with
his department accepted the view of emergency room doctors that the
injuries were consistent with a fall. At a subsequent court
hearing, a department lawyer recommended the girl be returned to
her family.
</P>
<P>
   In October, prompted by a report from Kayla's school, child
welfare workers investigated more injuries to the girl, including a
bump on her head and black eyes again. The father said she had
fallen in the bathtub and the family's dog had stepped on her face
while she slept.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator determined a low risk of harm to the child after
Kayla herself reported she was treated well at home, Feaver said.
He said there were several other reports that met similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff should have seen that pattern,'' said Feaver, who
said disciplinary action is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that drives me crazy. Over and over again
there was just too much that happened. Our first instinct should
have been let's protect the child.''
</P>
<P>
   There are up to 300,000 reports of child abuse in Florida each
year. Seventy-five thousand reports were found to be substantiated
last year, reflecting a 10 to 15 percent increase in abuse cases
over the previous two year, children and families department
officials said. The state records about 100 child-abuse deaths a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The department has a $3.4 billion budget, $550 million of that
for child protection services.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Jeb Bush Bush has said that the system needs reform,
mostly through privatization of foster care, and more involvement
from local law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants the local sheriff's office to work hand-in-hand with
child abuse investigators,'' said Bush's spokesman, Corey Tilley.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kinat, principal of Minneola Elementary School in Lake
County north of Orlando, which Kayla had attended since last April,
said her death caused ``a lot of anger'' among adults in the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the situation was investigated it was just passed over
too lightly,'' she said of the state probe into the reports of the
girl's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinat said good may come out of the case, however, if it
serves to remind everyone involved with children of the need to be
vigilant of their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   She described the first-grader as ``fairly quiet and shy but
loving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not have a lot of interaction with the other
children,'' Ms. Kinat said. But, she added. ``It was a safe place
for her to come to school and she seemed to enjoy it.''

ENDEAVOUR IS LAUNCHED, AND THE CHASE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ As the space shuttle Endeavour blazed a
spectacular pre-dawn trail across a clear starry sky out over the
Atlantic Ocean early Friday, Boeing's space station boss Doug Stone
watched in awe from his VIP location inside the fire control
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all anxious to get this off,'' he told a reporter once
Endeavour and her crew of astronaut hardhats were safely in orbit
with a connecting node Unity, the first U.S.-made piece of the
space station. ``Now the fun starts ....''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle thundered away from Pad 39A in the early Friday
morning. Eight minutes later it was in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   So began an around-the-world game of chase with the
Russian-built Zarya space station that was passing over central
Florida as 7.5 million pounds of thrust lifted Endeavor heavenward.
If all goes well, the shuttle will rendevous with Zarya, itself
launched only two weeks ago by Russia, Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   When astronaut Nancy Currie grabs Zarya with the shuttle's
50-foot remote arm and carefully pulls it toward Unity in the open
belly of Endeavour, construction can finally begin on a project
that has been likened to the building of the Pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is sound. ... We will just have to take this one step
at a time,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Stone was half way around the world, watching an
unmanned Russian rocket blast off with Zarya from the Baiknour
launch complex on the grassy steppes of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya has been circling the Earth every 92 minutes, awaiting its
mate Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Stone had butterflies in his stomach as the
countdown entered the final launch sequence before Endeavour's
liftoff. But his stomach was not churning any more than it had at
Baiknour. Stone is the manager ultimately responsible for Boeing's
success or failure as NASA's prime contractor for the $40 billion
space station. Zarya was built by the Russians under contract for
Boeing, and Unity was built by Boeing workers at Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch at Baikonur was absolutely awe inspiring, and the
launch of Endeavour was just as exciting, not only for me but for
everyone involved in the program,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to be holding my breath for the next several
days.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman must do what
no space-walking astronauts have ever done before. During three
complex walks outside Endeavour, they must successfully connect
Unity and Zarya. Like Earth-bound workers building a home, Ross and
Newman will lay the all-important foundation for future station
construction. If something goes wrong, the international project
could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's mission will last 12 days. When the astronauts leave
the Unity-Zarya station, it will not be visited again until May,
when the shuttle Discovery will bring up supplies needed for the
next round of construction when a Russian service module, which
will provide living quarters for astronauts during the six years of
construction, will be connected to Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   The service module is scheduled to be launched on an unmanned
rocket from Baikonur in July, but that date is likely to slip. The
service module is not yet finished because Russia, on the verge of
economic collapse, didn't have the money. It's now getting funding
help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The next piece of Boeing-built hardware for the space station is
a truss section built in Huntington Beach, Calif. it will be
attached after the service module.
</P>
<P>
   But it all depends on Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go do this,'' Endeavour commander Robert Cabana said
just moments before launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' launch control replied.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first attempt to launch Endeavour early Thursday,
when a technical problem halted the countdown with just 19 seconds
to go, Friday's countdown was flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeline Albright, witnessing her first
shuttle launch, applauded he 16-nation effort and told reporters:
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long I deal with disputes on the ground, countries
that can't get along, and it's great to look at this space station
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit, who had flown to the space center
for the first try at launching Endeavour early Thursday, was unable
to stay and missed the big show. But before leaving, Condit talked
about the station project at a Thursday breakfast with Boeing and
NASA workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are climbing a mountain,'' Condit told them, noting
that the first satellite was launched into space in 1957, ``it's
worth it to stop and look back and see how far you have come ....
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are undertaking a project of amazing scope,'' Condit
said. ``When we are done, we will have created a new star. We will
have built something amazing and we will be able to go out into the
night and watch it pass overhead.''

COMMENTARY: THE PHONY RESEARCH COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's Gay Awareness Week!'' taunted one of the two men charged
with murdering Matthew Shepard just before they slammed a pistol
butt into the University of Wyoming student's head 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Police testimony at a preliminary hearing two weeks ago also
indicates that Matthew had not made a pass at his assailants, which
didn't stop them from referring to him repeatedly as ``queer'' and
``faggot.'' By the time the beating was over, Matthew's head was
entirely covered with blood except, as a sheriff's deputy
explained, ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a slaughter driven by pathological hatred or just by
robbery? (The wallet he was carrying contained $20.) The trial will
tell, we can hope. What remains as certain now as on Oct. 12, the
day Matthew died, is that this murder happened against the backdrop
of a campaign in which the far right, abetted by political leaders
like Trent Lott, was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful.
Since FBI figures show that hate crimes due to ``sexual-orientation
bias'' are rising even as the national crime rate goes down, the
most pressing question now is: Has that ugly backdrop changed?
</P>
<P>
   Not enough. In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same
groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a
furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads
demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.
Given that these are the same groups that claim the ``pro-gay''
rhetoric of an Ellen DeGeneres or Joycelyn Elders foments
homosexuality, it isn't easy for them to argue now that their own
words have no consequences. So they instead attack those who call
them on their game, hoping we might be intimidated and shut up. As
one of their apologists, Hadley Arkes, wrote in a Wall Street
Journal opinion piece, my columns on this subject are ``vibrant
with a hatred of the Family Research Council and evangelical
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice try at changing the subject, but taking a stand
against the anti-gay crusade of the political organizations of the
religious right is not a stand against Christians, evangelical or
otherwise. Most people who abhor homophobia are themselves
Christian _ and so, for that matter, are most gay Americans. As for
the Family Research Council, it is not even a quasi-religious
organization but a moneyed secular outfit whose leader, Gary Bauer,
wants to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of
gay people as subhuman. One new tack _ according to a council draft
document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much
greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks.'' And
so the plan is to inform us that more gay men die of AIDS than of
bias-related murders _ a nonsensical pairing intended to brand gay
men as diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Since gay women can't be stigmatized en masse with AIDS, the
council had to use real ingenuity to prove that they, too, are
vermin at ``much greater risk from one another'' than from
gay-bashers. The solution turned up in a ``Culture Facts''
newsletter it published only nine days after Matthew Shepard's
death and is still posted on its Web site. Titled `` `Gay' Violence
Escalates,'' it asserts that ``The University of Houston-Downtown
in a recent study found that 47.5 percent of lesbian relationships
involve some form of domestic abuse,'' compared with 0.22 percent
for married women.
</P>
<P>
   I reached the unnamed source of this ``fact'' in Houston _ Lisa
Waldner, an assistant professor of sociology. Previously unaware of
what she called the council's ``misleading'' use of her work, she
told me that this so-called ``recent study'' was a paper she
co-wrote as a student in 1992 about the lifetime experiences of a
non-random sample of gay people she knew and their circle. She said
it was wrong to ``say this is the average for all lesbians'' and
that the council's comparison of her study with another on married
women was meaningless since they used completely different
methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   But if not even Shepard's death could derail the Family Research
Council's ``loving'' crusade against homosexuality, the unmasking
of its fallaciously ``scientific'' slurs won't stop it now.
</P>
<P>
   What, you have to wonder, will?

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO CHALLENGE BASIS FOR IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton challenged the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment inquiry Friday night, opening a
counteroffensive to broaden and slow the panel's deliberations
while raising doubts in the public mind about the fairness and
scope of the proceedings, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the committee's invitation to present Clinton's
case next Tuesday, only days before the panel is to vote on
articles of impeachment, the president's lawyers asked for at least
three days to raise questions about the legal and constitutional
basis for the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening passage of a letter sent to the Judiciary
Committee on Friday evening, the two top White House lawyers
dealing with impeachment, Charles Ruff and Gregory Craig, said the
stakes involved were extraordinarily high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a declaration of war,'' they wrote, ``there is no
more significant or grave constitutional process than the
impeachment inquiry currently under way in your committee. Should
the House of Representatives approve an article of impeachment
against the president and send it to the Senate for trial, the
impact on the national government and on the American people as a
whole would be profound. For that reason alone, this process must
be deliberate, thorough, fair and expeditious.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the letter signaled an effort to present a vigorous
defense of the president against accusations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power raised by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the White House assume that the politically polarized
committee will vote along party lines to approve at least one
article of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The counter-arguments the White House hopes to present next week
appeared aimed at moderate Republicans who are still trying to
decide whether to vote for impeachment on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, did not immediately respond to the White House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision that we want to go up and demonstrate
that these proceedings have not been fair,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary. ``None of the allegations that have
been made rise to the standard of impeachment. It's that simple.
This is not a bank shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also denied that the White House proposal was a
delaying tactic. He said that the committee could still vote on
articles of impeachment by the end of the week if the president's
lawyers are allowed four days to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House letter echoes complaints that Clinton's
partisans have raised throughout the process. They believe that the
Republican-dominated committee has conducted a partisan inquiry
that has not provided Clinton adequate opportunity to defend
himself against the charges raised in Starr's impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee rapidly approaching a vote on articles of
impeachment, the White House clearly wants to slow down the process
and raise issues it believe have been given short shrift in the
panel's accelerated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it wants to present three panels of
witnesses over three to four days to discuss what constitutes an
impeachable offense, the standards for prosecution for the
accusations against Clinton raised by Starr, and prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is essential to the president's defense that we be
able to call our own witnesses and present our own arguments to
address these important questions,'' Clinton's lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed a day-long seminar on each of these
questions, but did not reveal Friday the witnesses it intended to
call to make its case. The president's lawyers said they would
present a summation of Clinton's defense at the end of the panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has contended all along that Clinton's
misleading statements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
do not constitute perjury, and therefore do not justify
impeachment. The president has steadfastly denied tampering with
witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice. He also has said that
none of his actions constitute an abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that the letter to the
Judiciary Committee reflected ``enormous frustration in this
building'' with what he called the precipitous pace and one-sided
nature of the impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know what we're charged with,'' this official
said, demanding anonymity. ``If this were a speeding ticket, at
least we'd know how much over the limit we'd gone. These charges
are completely unformed and politically motivated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As part of its defense, the White House wants to use next week's
hearing to once again showcase what it calls misconduct on the part
of Starr. When Starr appeared before the committee 10 days ago,
Clinton's lead private lawyer, David Kendall, grilled Starr for
more than an hour on what Kendall contended were leaks from his
office, intimidation of witnesses, selective presentation of
testimony and deceptive investigative techniques. Kendall did not
raise a single point in defense of the president's actions,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House says that Kendall was not given enough time
to defend the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of one hour of time provided to us for
questioning Mr. Starr at the end of his appearance before the
committee on Nov. 19, however, we have been foreclosed from playing
any role,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that we will require no more than three to four
days of the committee's time to deal with the topics identified
above, at which time counsel for the president will present a final
argument as to why, given the law, the facts and these
circumstances, this committee should not report out articles of
impeachment to the full membership of the House of
Representatives,'' the letter concluded.

<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ The reasons Mamdouh Mahmud Salim gives for
coming here a few months ago are at once prosaic and touching: he
wanted to buy a Mercedes, and find a wife.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what Salim told FBI agents who questioned him
for four days in September, when he broke into tears several times,
expressed concern about his children's report cards and asked for a
pistol so he could shoot himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of U.S. authorities, Salim is an international
terrorist who came to Germany to carry out an attack on the U.S.
consulate in Hamburg. The Americans also say he is a member of Al
Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden, who is suspected
of organizing the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Salim, 40, emphatically denies that he belongs to any terrorist
group. He says he was born in Sudan, but U.S. officials believe he
is an Iraqi who served in the army during the war with Iran. He
speaks English and has traveled to more than 20 countries in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was arrested on his arrival here three months ago, he
has been fighting extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday his lawyer, Leonard Walischewski, said Salim was
resigned to going to the United States, possibly as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really naive,'' Walischewski added. ``He can't understand
the difficult situation he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salim now believes he knows who put him there: Sidi Tayyib,
a top financial aide to bin Laden and once a close associate of
Salim.
</P>
<P>
   A federal criminal complaint against Salim charges him with
conspiracy to carry out attacks against U.S. military
installations. The accusations, including one that he tried to buy
material for nuclear weapons, come from a person identified only as
``CS-1,'' for confidential source.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have refused to identify CS-1, but court
papers quote a suspected member of Al Qaeda as expressing alarm
over reports in 1997 that another member, Tayyib, had become an
informant for Saudi Arabia and Western intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Salim did not at first believe it possible that Tayyib would
inform on bin Laden, Walischewski said; Tayyib was married to one
of bin Laden's nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Tayyib, who also went by the name Abu Fadl, was chief financial
officer for some of bin Laden's companies in Sudan, the base of bin
Laden's operations for several years. He was Salim's boss,
according to Salim, who was also a senior employee in the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of the interrogation, which was first
disclosed in the national daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, Salim said
that whenever he needed to pay a bill of more that $1,000 he had to
ask Tayyib for the money.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies of which Tayyib was director, and which
Salim managed, was Taba Investment Trading, which dealt in palm oil
and cattle, Salim told interrogators from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects in the bombing of the U.S. embassy in
Tanzania, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, set up a branch for this
company in Kenya in 1994. That was the year when an Al Qaeda cell
began to operate there. Ahmed has been indicted in connection with
the bombing of the embassy in Tanzania and is being held in prison
there.
</P>
<P>
   Salim also told the FBI that he worked for bin Laden from
1992-1994, but that he had not seen or had any contact with him
since.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities say that Salim was a major figure in bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you supposed to be building an infrastructure in Germany
that is able to carry out terrorist actions?'' one of the FBI
agents asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's laughable,'' Salim answered, in English, which was the
language the interrogation was conducted in. ``Allah is my witness.
If bin Laden wants to do something he already has people. Why would
he ask me?''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he was against the violent actions of bin
Laden. ``What believer of Mohammed would do such a thing? It is
unimaginable for me that anyone should kill innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being in Germany to carry out terrorist activities,
Salim told his interrogators, he was there to buy a Mercedes, which
he would take back to Dubai, and above all to find a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in every country for a wife,'' Salim told his
interrogators. ``My friends all know that I am looking for a
wife.'' He is reportedly already the father of six children, aged 4
to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was a prolific traveler. Between 1994 and his arrest, he
visited more than 20 countries, from Russia to the Philippines to
Canada. From Canada, he tried to enter the United States to buy
radio equipment, he said, but he could not get a visa.
</P>
<P>
   When the interrogators asked him why he had been in the
Philippines, where bin Laden reportedly supported an Islamic
guerrilla movement, Salim replied that he was looking for a wife
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he was in Russia, he said it was to look for a
wife. Salim then made some unflattering remarks about his current
wife and noted that it is no violation of the Koran to have more
than one.
</P>
<P>
   Walischewski, Salim's lawyer, who visited his client briefly on
Friday because he said he was concerned his psychological state,
said the only thing Salim was worried about was his wife and
children, who had returned from Dubai to Sudan after Salim was
arrested and were without any money. ``The only thing that hurts is
his heart,'' Walischewski said about his client.

HALLOWEEN NIGHT FIGHT WITH YOUTHS HAS HOMEOWNER FACING TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DON HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The jack-o-lanterns at David J. McGee's
Appalachian Street home had been smashed the last couple of
Halloweens and he was determined that it wasn't going to happen
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   So the aerospace engineer-turned-furniture designer watched and
waited, then chased after a group of teens he thought were
threatening his property in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities already have filed charges, deputies say
they are still trying to unravel numerous accounts of the Halloween
night incident that escalated into a series of confrontations that
has resulted in McGee facing a felony charge of assault with a
deadly weapon, in addition to four misdemeanor assault and weapons
charges. His arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right at this moment, quite frankly, I'm flabbergasted,''
McGee said Friday, after prosecutors filed the felony charge, which
could bring him four years in prison if convicted. ``Originally,
the police wanted to file this as a felony. Then the (Ventura
County district attorney) changed it to a misdemeanor. And they've
changed it back to a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're either stupid or they're bluffing,'' said McGee, 53.
</P>
<P>
   But the father of one of the teens involved in the Halloween
fracas said he is disappointed McGee is being charged with only one
felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction that they're dropping several of the charges down
to misdemeanors is it's questionable,'' said Nick Solare. ``I'm
just amazed that it's going to be one felony and the rest
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Solare said his 13-year-old daughter was trick-or-treating with
three friends when McGee, without warning, ``jumped out of the
bushes and whacked her in the abdomen with a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGee said he was not holding a hammer, but a stick, which
he grabbed when he chased after the group of teens who a neighbor
said had vandalized the pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my intention to punish anybody,'' McGee said. ``It
was my intention to catch them. ... I saw someone coming at me from
behind. In an instant, I flicked backwards and hit this person in
the breadbasket. All I saw was somebody who looked like they were
about to hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to both Solare and McGee, the girl ran to the nearby
Westlake Hills Elementary School campus, and reported the incident
to deputies stationed there.
</P>
<P>
   A group of youngsters gathered at the school then set out for
McGee's house, where a confrontation escalated into a fistfight,
both Mcgee and Solare said.
</P>
<P>
   One youngster ended up with several stitches to the back of his
head. Another reportedly suffered minor injuries to her back,
Solare said.
</P>
<P>
   As McGee retreated to his house, a small group of teens
converged on his home. One of the youths threw a can that missed
McGee, but hit his 9-year-old son, Trevor, in the neck. That set
off another fight and foot chase, McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   McGee returned home again only to see a large group of angry
youths headed his way, he said. McGee said his son called 911 at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd just had a violent confrontation with somebody and
saw 20 to 30 coming at you, what would you think?,'' said McGee.
``They weren't on a good will mission. I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing when deputies would arrive, McGee said he armed
himself with two knives and an unloaded shotgun and went outside.
The group scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, deputies arrived and handcuffed McGee.
</P>
<P>
   McGee said he was merely protecting his property when he armed
himself and stood up to the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a citizen, you have a duty to stand up to
intimidation,'' he said. ``If you relinquish your rights as a
citizen, if you relinquish your dignity, if you relinquish the
things you believe in to a roving gang of teen-agers on the street,
then where are we headed as a society?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's not the police who are going to help people.
It's people like me or anybody else who stands up and and says, No,
I'm not going to be intimidated,'' he said.

`PRATER VIOLET': AN ISHERWOOD STORY, IN HIS WORDS AND SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few novels of late have made the transition to the
stage as gracefully as ``Prater Violet,'' Christopher Isherwood's
semiautobiographical account of his exploits in the British film
industry of the 1930s. In an endearing production at the Salon
Theater, the director Will Pomerantz, who also adapted the book,
stays true to Isherwood's spirit. The result is an evening of
theater with bags of English charm.
</P>
<P>
   The play, performed by six hard-working cast members assuming a
total of 42 roles, could hardly be more faithful to the nimble work
by Isherwood, who also wrote ``Berlin Stories,'' on which
``Cabaret'' is based.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue and narration in ``Prater Violet'' are lifted
virtually verbatim from the 127-page novella, a chronicle of the
making of a silly movie musical in 1933 by a high-principled
Austrian Jew named Friedrich Bergmann, who takes on Isherwood as a
neophyte screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The author's refined command of language and clinical powers of
observation have eased Pomerantz's burden. The characters, down to
the smallest bit parts, are zesty creations that fill out the
genially ironic plot, one that initially seems as frivolous as the
sappy talkie, also called ``Prater Violet,'' that they are filming
on a back lot in London. (A prater is a town square where public
festivals occur.)
</P>
<P>
   But as the relationship deepens between Bergmann (Dylan Green),
worried about the growing power of the Nazis, and Isherwood
(Kameron Steele), worried about the well-being of his new-found
friend, so does the play. What begins as rather rarefied English
drollery ends as a contemplation on the meaning of companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz has a way with the period. Aided by Troy Hourie's sets
and Lap-Chi Chu's lighting (and a cast that also plays stage crew),
the director puts a minimum of resources to maximum advantage; the
film studio, for instance, is brought to life by a few rolling
flats, movie cameras and the hustle of the actors playing gaffers,
editors and film stars.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator for the unspectacular events of this gentle piece _
the tensest moment comes when a newspaper headline announces
turmoil in far-off Vienna, where Bergmann's wife and daughter
remain _ is Steele, a young actor whose unflappable gentility makes
him an appealing guide. As Bergmann, Green is poignantly anxious
and avuncular; there's a magnetism that goes with the bluster.
</P>
<P>
   The other actors _ Frank Dowd, Laura Kachergus, John McAdams and
Ashok Sinha _ do nicely by many of the myriad supporting roles.
McAdams is particularly good as a nihilistic film cutter on the
movie set, and it's fun to watch Ms. Kachergus quick-change her way
through a dozen roles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pomerantz could have used another actor or two, because
his players are simply unsuited to some of the parts. Ms.
Kachergus, for example, is much too young for Isherwood's mother,
and Dowd, though swell as a studio executive, is unconvincing as an
old vet of a movie actor.
</P>
<P>
   The play, too, drags in spots, especially in an overlong first
act, but this is a minor shortcoming. ``Prater Violet,'' which runs
through Sunday affords another enjoyable view from Isherwood's
perspective.
</P>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Renada Daniel-Patterson's relationship with her
father began when she was 13 years old and he called from prison,
offering her his kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Renada, born with only one kidney _ an unhealthy one _ had been
on dialysis three times a week for seven years, unable to go to
school, stay with friends or dream too far in the future. David
Patterson, serving time at California State Prison in Sacramento
for burglary, had abandoned Renada when she was a baby. ``He called
out of the blue,'' recalls Vicki Daniel, Renada's mother. But when
he turned out to be a compatible donor, all was forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Renada lived as a healthy girl for the first time
in her life. Often, she even skipped her medicine. Then her kidney
_ her father's kidney _ began to fail.
</P>
<P>
   She needs a new kidney again. Her father, who is 38 and due to
remain in prison for three more years, wants to give his daughter
the one kidney he has left.
</P>
<P>
   When Renada's doctor at the University of California San
Francisco Medical Center balked, citing the Hippocratic oath that
requires doctors to ``first, do no harm,'' Renada's mother
protested and pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Now the university's ethics committee is confronting an
unprecedented situation. Do they save the life of a 16-year-old
girl knowing that they are also sentencing her father to a painful
life of medical treatment, with his existence constantly
threatened? And how should the fact that he is a prisoner, who
would be taxing the system with his medical condition, factor into
a decision?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wade Smith, chairman of the university medical center's
bioethics committee, said that the committee would have to consider
the rules of organ donation. ``There is a question,'' he said, ``of
whether this procedure would be violating the surgeon by harming
the donor.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ethics committee weighed its decision Friday, Mrs.
Daniel, with Renada in a hospital bed, and several ministers
supporting the family, held a news conference in the medical center
lobby. She urged the public to flood the hospital's telephones,
both with offers of kidneys and, especially, with words of support
for the transplant Renada's father has offered.
</P>
<P>
   With 3,100 patients on a waiting list for a kidney in northern
California, and the average wait three and a half years, Mrs.
Daniel said that Renada should not have to wait when doctors cannot
say for sure how dire her condition is and the family has a willing
donor in Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled that the ethics committee would even consider
entering this,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as Renada, flanked by an adopted
younger sister and a friend, wept in her bed. ``This is a family
issue. We want the world to know that this man is giving himself to
his daughter. We're demanding that the State of California honor
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethics scholars seem divided over just what the ethical
implications of Patterson's offer are. Hank Greeley, chairman of
the steering committee of Stanford University's Center for
Biomedical Ethics, said that a father, in most situations, should
be allowed to make a sacrifice for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous, but I can't see any good, strong reason
to prevent this parental sacrifice,'' he said. ``Parents make all
sorts of sacrifices for their children and we don't normally see
that as unethical, even in the extreme cases when the parent gives
his life for a child. In fact, we normally see it as
praiseworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's offer poses an ethical problem in part because he is
in prison, Greeley said. ``Would there be a question if he could
pay for this himself?'' he said. ``Should the health care system
participate?'' And, ``Does it somehow taint or pollute the health
care system that it's participating in this self-sacrificing act?''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania and author of ``Am I My Brother's
Keeper? The Ethical Frontiers of Biomedicine,'' addressed the issue
bluntly: ``You don't ever want to kill a person to say you saved
another life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a live kidney transplant where someone has
gone from one to none,'' Caplan said, adding that the life of a
person on dialysis may be severely threatened. because 10 percent
of patients do not do well with the treatment. ``There's no
guarantee he could do dialysis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan was also concerned about giving another kidney to a
patient who was not diligent in taking her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only using the second kidney, but using it in a situation
where someone has gone off their medicine, who has shown themself
noncompliant, would be a gross violation of medical ethics,'' he
said. Finally, he said, letting Patterson donate his kidney would
contradict why he is in jail: to be punished. Prisoners, he said,
should not be allowed to donate organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't use prisoners as donors. One of the aspects
of punishment is a prisoner's restrictions on certain things,
including voting, running for office and donating an organ.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a question of whether Renada's body would even accept
another kidney from her father. Even though she was a compatible
recipient before, when she did not take the medicine required to
make the transplant successful _ it bloated her face, distended her
stomach, made her feel ill and hunched her back _ her body may have
decided that her father was no longer an acceptable donor. ``I
think that the fact that a person rejected an organ is germane to
the issue of receiving an organ from the same donor again,'' said
Dr. Nancy Ascher, a professor of surgery at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center. ``Whether the organ was
rejected because the medication wasn't taken, the body may have
decided that this organ is incompatible and will be so again,'' she
said. ``The person would probably have to be retested.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patterson first offered to donate his kidney to Renada, he
went through months of complicated negotiations between prison and
hospital officials and the family. That issue would most likely
arise again, since Patterson would still be in the prison system as
a dialysis patient. His original sentence of seven years was
increased by five years when he was found with heroin less than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfield, a spokesman for the California State Prison at
Sacramento, said Patterson has already spoken to doctors at the
prison and that he understands the medical implications of his
decision. The state, by law, would pay for his dialysis, which
would cost an estimated $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking with David, his heart seems to be in the right
place,'' he said. ``With respect to his daughter, I guess I can
speak for most fathers when I say I would have done the same for my
daughter. To go from a parent where you have no relationship with
your daughter to one where you're giving her your kidney is a
pretty amazing turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Patterson donated his kidney to Renada, the two have been
in constant contact, Mrs. Daniel said. They've been writing and
calling each other, and Renada has visited him. ``She loves her
father,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as Renada, in her bed, covered her face
and cried. ``But I know she wants his kidney, too.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)  
 (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What would Freud have made of the way George Soros,
the world's most famous hedge fund manager, describes the tension
brought on by having made a fortune as a speculator and then having
reinvented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I felt like a gigantic digestive tract, taking in
money at one end and pushing it out at the other,'' Soros writes
earthily in the preface to his new book, ``The Crisis of Global
Capitalism'' (Public Affairs, $26). ``But in fact a considerable
amount of thought connected the two ends.''
</P>
<P>
   And what to make of a man who has raked in billions of dollars
through lightning strikes in free-wheeling currency markets, but
now advises the world on how to clean up the messes he thinks such
strikes create?
</P>
<P>
   While Soros has been playing the multiple roles of trader,
philosopher and philanthropist for many years, the friction has
come into sharpest relief in recent months, as he has boldly
prescribed cures for a variety of the world's economic ills.
</P>
<P>
   It has been most conspicuous in Russia, where Soros, with more
than $1 billion at stake in the country, actively lobbied Russian
and American officials to accept his advice on the best way to
resolve the summer's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Soros' book includes a day-by-day account of his high-level
phone contacts and memo-writing in the weeks before and after the
August devaluation of Russia's currency, the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential conflict _ I've always taken great care
not to exploit it,'' said Soros, 68, gently tapping his eyeglasses
against a conference table in his mid-Manhattan office. ``And I
think that people, both in Russia and Washington, knew that, and
that's why they took the calls, because I think I have established
a certain record in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many observers wonder about Soros' straddling of so many
fences in the worlds of finance, economics and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a built-in conflict between making money in
public markets and improving the world,'' said James Grant, editor
of a newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, and the author of
several studies of financial markets. ``Soros is out there telling
you what he's done, what he's going to do and how he'll save the
world. I think there's a conflict because those goals seem at
cross-purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises questions about inside information when you're able
to talk to central bankers and policy makers at the same time that
you're involved in financial markets,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Soros, dapper and attentive, defended his probity
in a wide-ranging interview last week, saying he has always strived
to keep separate his roles as a hard-nosed trader placing global
bets and a financial guru able to rub elbows with the highest of
the high and mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had run-ins with American regulators in the 1970s and
80s, he has never been accused of insider trading or similar
financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to distinguish between playing by the rules and making
the rules,'' Soros said. ``Playing by the rules, one does the best
one can, irrespective of the social consequences. Whereas in making
the rules, people ought to be concerned with the social
consequences and not with their personal interests _ in other
words, not to bend the rules to their benefit or their advantage.
This is a principle which I have certainly observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Soros, who is believed to be worth about $5 billion, is
uniquely positioned to help determine how the rules are made in
some parts of the world, and he built his fortune in currency
markets where the rules were never entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian crisis mounted in August, for example, Soros
worked his Rolodex, summoning influential Russian politicians and
United States Treasury Department officials to the telephone. He
pushed for a big international bailout and a devaluation of the
ruble to bolster Russia's troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Soros had $1 billion invested in a Russian
telecommunications concern _ through a partnership with one of
Russia's powerful ``oligarchs'' _ as well as investments in Russian
stocks, bonds and the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Soros was also the overseer of a philanthropic foundation in
Moscow that generously financed a range of causes, including
education, the arts, sciences and media, through about $61 million
in annual grants.
</P>
<P>
   If Soros ruled the world, he said, he would establish an
international regulatory agency to rein in speculative excesses and
provide financing during economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it bluntly, the choice confronting us is whether we
will regulate global financial markets internationally, or leave it
to each individual state to protect its own interests,'' he wrote
in his book. ``The latter course will surely lead to the breakdown
of the gigantic circulatory system which goes under the name of
global capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That prescription reflects the fact that Soros has long harbored
a certain disdain for the profession that made him rich. Indeed,
his record is such that he _ along with Warren E. Buffett, the
Omaha financier, and perhaps Peter Lynch, the Fidelity fund guru _
is among the few investors whose names are widely recognized by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   A Hungarian-born Jew, Soros was 14 when the Nazis invaded his
homeland. He avoided the fate of many Jews by posing as the godson
of a Hungarian official overseeing the confiscation of Jewish
properties. He moved to London after the war and eventually
graduated from the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   There he came under the influence of the philosopher Karl
Popper, whose ``open societies'' credo Soros re-fashioned as his
own. Popper opposed totalitarian states; Soros believes that
participatory democracy and regulated market economies are the
vehicles for insuring individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   His academic training led to the fascination with abstract
thinking that pervades much of his writing. ``But if you get too
abstract, you have nothing to grapple with and abstraction empties
your thinking of content,'' he acknowledged last week.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, at first hard up for cash and then stymied by limited
opportunities in London, moved to New York in the late 1950s and
became a trader. He soon carved out a niche exploiting differences
between the London and New York markets, a gulch he mined through
the 60s before venturing into the new world of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds _ largely unregulated investment pools open only to
wealthy investors and big institutions _ aim to provide
consistently outsized returns on stocks, bonds, currencies or other
securities while limiting losses from market downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, an aggressive, gutsy speculator, ran one of the earliest
and most successful of these _ the Quantum Fund _ for two decades
beginning in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Basing Quantum in the loosely regulated confines of the
Caribbean island of Curacao, Soros often racked up returns in
excess of 30 percent a year and twice posted annual returns of more
than 100 percent, according to the fund's most recent quarterly
report.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the first investors to hunt down opportunities
around the world, eventually spawning a legion of imitators and
fellow enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``George opened all of our thinking to macroeconomic theory, and
he made globalists of us all by making us understand the importance
of geopolitical events on the U.S. economy,'' said Byron Wien,
chief domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
who has known Soros for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Soros gave up day-to-day management of Quantum in 1989, but he
is still consulted on major trades and is one of three supervisors
of Soros Fund Management, the New York firm that oversees Quantum
and his other funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s he has also been a ubiquitous
philanthropist, donating money to causes around the globe to
realize his vision of an open society. Last year, his foundations
gave away $428 million, with Russia the single largest recipient
and political reform in Eastern Europe one of his chief causes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Soros has become an incisive critic of the
predations of unfettered capitalism, a theme that has taken on even
greater resonance in the wake of the financial calamities in Asia
and Eastern Europe over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets basically are amoral, whereas society does need some
kind of morality _ a distinction between right and wrong,'' Soros
observed. ``And by allowing market values to become all-important,
we actually narrow the space for moral judgment and undermine
public morality. This has actually happened, and globalization has
increased this aberration, because it has actually reduced the
power of individual states to determine their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one in the markets proves the point better than
Soros himself. It was in 1992 that he became a household name, when
Quantum and related funds, largely using piles of borrowed money,
made more than $1 billion in a few weeks by betting against the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's central bank wasted its reserves in an unsuccessful
effort to defend the currency's value. The episode derailed
Britain's membership in a European initiative seeking to
rationalize exchange rates _ and it earned Soros this sobriquet:
``the man who broke the Bank of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros has also described some forms of financial derivatives _
highly volatile and complex investing products _ as the economic
equivalent of crack cocaine. Yet he has used derivatives in his own
speculating, explaining that his funds favor only the simplest
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Such inconsistencies give pause to those who might otherwise
share his views. ``It's an amusing spectacle to see a guy like him
who's made a fortune speculating now going around denouncing
newcomers to the field,'' said Doug Henwood, author of ``Wall
Street'' (Verso, $25), an examination of financial markets. ``It's
like he suddenly found religion late in life and now wants to be
Hegel in a hedge fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Closet Hegel or not, Soros is still very much a market maven,
intimately involved in his hedge funds' overall activities. That
has created some notable flare-ups in the last year, as politicians
and financiers alike grappled with understanding the causes of the
recent wave of global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, the finger has been pointed at speculators.
Developing nations that had welcomed the capital of foreign
investors when it flowed into their economies decried ``hot money''
as it whipped out.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators like Soros were blamed for destabilizing one nation
after another that lacked the financial resources to defend their
currencies when signs of economic weakness drew traders' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Soros' funds were shorting Thailand's currency,
the baht, and Malaysia's currency, the ringgit _ that is, betting
that the value of both currencies would drop.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Thailand dropped its defenses, devaluing the baht. That
set off the wave of devaluations in Malaysia and elsewhere that
marked the beginning of the current global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said that by the time of the devaluations, his funds had
become active buyers of the currencies, believing that they had
already hit bottom. But that did not shield him from withering
accusations, mainly from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in
Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this _ depress the
ringgit,'' Mahathir said in blaming Soros and other currency
traders for Malaysia's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Soros criticized Mahathir
and his policies. ``He needs to be removed from power,'' Soros
said.
</P>
<P>
   SOROS' manifold roles on the world stage became most apparent in
August, during the Russian economic meltdown, when he leaped into
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had a longstanding interest in Russia _ inspired by
his father's time there as a prisoner of war, followed by a brief
residency, during and after World War I _ Soros said he had steered
clear of investing there in the years immediately after the fall of
communism. Rather, he sank money into the country through
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abstained from investing in Russia,'' Soros wrote in his new
book, ``partly to avoid any conflict-of-interest problems but
mainly because I did not like what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   But as early as 1994, he had been in and out of Russia as an
investor. And in 1997, he plunged headlong into Russian markets
when they were among the frothiest on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Soros explains now that his concerns about the country were
allayed by his confidence in the young reformers surrounding
President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But his largest single holding in Russia _ a $1 billion stake in
Svyazinvest, a telecommunications concern _ put him into
partnership with Vladimir Potanin, the young chairman of one of
Russia's biggest banks. Potanin is a member of a powerful and
politically influential clique of Russian businessmen known as the
``oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These men deftly exploited lucrative opportunities that came
with privatization in Russia and used dubious tactics to snare
control of huge industrial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it on the thesis that robber capitalism was ready to
turn into legitimate capitalism,'' Soros said of his holding in
Svyazinvest.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition proved bumpy. In March, Soros lent the
Russian government several hundred million dollars to help it meet
overdue pension payments. By the summer, as a corrupt and
debt-ridden economy was tumbling toward insolvency, Soros was
Russia's biggest individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his investment with Potanin _ which he now describes as
the worst of his career _ he also held Russian stocks, bonds and
rubles.
</P>
<P>
   All of this hardly made Soros a disinterested observer when he
sprang into action in mid-August to try to stem the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to the account in his book, Soros contacted both
Robert E. Rubin, the American Treasury secretary, and David A.
Lipton, an under secretary who has since left the Treasury
Department. He also telephoned two influential former members of
Yeltsin's administration, Yegor T. Gaidar and Anatoly B. Chubais,
to lobby them on how to prevent an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Soros published a letter in The
Financial Times saying that the meltdown in the Russian financial
markets had ``reached the terminal phase.'' He called for immediate
action, including a devaluation and the institution of a currency
board _ a system fixing a nation's currency to the value of its
richest trading partner. Such a plan would have taken away Russian
central bankers' discretion over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter helped prompt a panic in Russian markets _ and
invited a fresh bout of suspicion about Soros' motives. Later in
the day, he issued a statement saying that he was not shorting the
ruble, adding that his own portfolio ``would be hurt by any
devaluation.'' In his book, he added that he did not trade any
Russian securities during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, Russia appeared headed for a default on its
foreign and domestic debt. In a private meeting in Russia's White
House on Sunday, Aug. 16, business leaders _ including Potanin _
persuaded members of the Yeltsin administration to add a moratorium
on debt repayment to a deep devaluation of the ruble that was to be
announced the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement caused international investors to flee Russia,
touching off a global financial panic and setting in motion the
events that would lead, a month later, to the near-collapse and
government-orchestrated bailout of another big hedge fund,
Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Soros says self-interest played no part in his financial
diplomacy during the meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, of course, I had been very involved and became more
involved at the time of the crisis,'' he said last week. ``But the
advice that I gave, which I think would have avoided the breakdown,
was not designed to benefit me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the end of August, Soros' funds announced a $2
billion loss in Russia. But it is hard to imagine that the
country's economic stabilization _ the goal of his activism _ could
have failed to bolster Svyazinvest.
</P>
<P>
   Ever philosophical, Soros acknowledges that his foray into
Russia was problematic. ``I have no regrets with regard to my
attempts to help Russia move toward an open society: They did not
succeed, but at least I tried,'' he wrote in his book. ``I have
grave regrets as an investor. It goes to show how difficult it is
to reconcile the two roles.''
</P>
<P>
   But a former American official who has crossed paths with Soros
said the speculator's many roles made it hard to weigh his advice.
``The fact that one part of him is motivated by the philanthropy
and another part by the investments makes it very difficult to deal
with him,'' said the former official, who insisted on anonymity.
``Sometimes the philanthropy dominates his motives. Sometimes
investing does. But there's that duality, and you never know.''

FINAL HONORS AT ARLINGTON FOR SEATTLE SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ John Henry Stanford, the charismatic Army
general and Seattle schools superintendent who used even his own
dying as a lesson in courage and determination, was laid to rest
Friday alongside America's heroes.
</P>
<P>
   A riderless black horse with a boot backwards in the stirrups,
the traditional symbol for a fallen soldier, walked quietly behind
the creaking horse-drawn caisson that carried Stanford's
flag-draped silver casket through Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, former Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Colin Powell and four other four-star generals joined
Stanford's widow and their sons in an hour-long funeral celebrating
Stanford's life. Several hundred mourners then walked along roads
lined with leafless trees to the plot in Section 7A where Stanford
was buried.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore met with the
Stanford family at the White House after the ceremony. ``The
president is a great admirer of John Stanford,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, 60, died Saturday after a difficult and highly
publicized eight-month battle with acute myelogenous leukemia _ a
battle Stanford fought with typical optimism and remarkable
openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inspired not just the children ... but an entire city was
spellbound by the very presence and vision of John Henry
Stanford,'' the Rev. Dr. Elbert Ransom Jr. said in a eulogy at the
memorial chapel at Fort Myer. ``John went to Seattle, Wash., with a
mission to love the children and to lead the educational flight to
victory, and that he did by dreaming the dream, framing it, and
setting it on course. The rest, my friends, is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Pennsylvania, Stanford spent 30 years in the Army,
retiring as a major general, before becoming manager of Fulton
County, Ga. In 1995, he was named superintendent of Seattle
schools, where he demanded a greater degree of courtesy to the
public, launched a citywide campaign to encourage reading, proposed
tougher graduation requirements and an end to busing.
</P>
<P>
   He was a local celebrity who enjoyed unusual adulation for a
public official. But his diagnosis with an often-fatal disease, and
the ups and downs of his treatment, touched a remarkable chord in
Seattle, provoking an outpouring of support and culminating in a
weeklong celebration of his life leading up to Friday's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's lengthy service in the military entitled him to
burial at Arlington, the burial ground for more than 240,000
people, including former Presidents John F. Kennedy and William
Howard Taft, numerous Supreme Court justices, explorers,
astronauts, and even bandleader Glenn Miller. Stanford's grave lies
near that of boxer Joe Louis, occasioning some comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who is a fighter, who symbolizes determination and grit
and heart and persistence _ that's Joe Louis and that's John
Stanford,'' said acting Seattle Schools Superintendent Joseph
Olchefske, who led a 14-member school delegation, including four
school board members.
</P>
<P>
   At the service, his friends recalled him as accomplished but
immodest, as an inspirational leader, as a devoted husband and
father. Ransom, the minister who met Stanford as a neighbor when
Stanford worked at the Pentagon, recalled how Stanford stopped by
his house one morning in a Superman costume, telling the children
he had been flying by and just though he would drop in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cherished a great childlike imagination to do the
impossible, as if he were a superman, and what a splendid superman
he was,'' Ransom said. ``If the world that John Stanford passed
through would profit from all that he tried to do, all that he
tried to change, all that he succeeded in doing ... this would be a
better place for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Scott, a retired Army brigadier general who was Atlanta
City manager when he met Stanford, recalled Stanford as ``a
crusader who used his formidable leadership skills and talents to
build up rather than to tear down ... and to get things done,
rather than to talk about getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   And a childhood friend, Fred Terrell, remembered Stanford, then
known as ``Sonny,'' as a member of ``The Backyard Gang,'' playing
basketball, swimming in the local creek, riding bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our athleticism was always competitive ... our dancing was
smooth, and our girls were fine,'' Terrell said. ``Sonny was always
the consummate player. His desire to give his at all at whatever
the undertaking would always assure him success.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's status as a two-star general entitled him to an
escort by a bright red flag with two-stars, as well as a 13-cannon
salute.
</P>
<P>
   His affiliation with the Army brought him hymns played by the
U.S. Army Band and the attendance of the Army Chief of Staff, Gen.
Dennis Reimer, who escorted Stanford's widow, Patricia, to the
gravesite and ended the funeral by presenting her with the
ceremonially folded U.S. flag that had been draped over the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Seven riflemen, silhouetted on a hilltop against an overcast
sky, fired three volleys over the grave, an historic battlefield
practice signalling that the dead have been cared for and fighting
can resume.
</P>
<P>
   A lone bugler played taps.
</P>
<P>
   Then silence fell on the funeral. The only sounds came from the
clicking of heels and clanking of swords as the red-hatted Army
Band and the black-hatted Honor Guard marched off. Mourners took
turns paying their final respects to Stanford, pausing to pray,
speak, or touch his casket, before they quietly turned and walked
away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Bill Bradley, the former New York Knicks
basketball star who represented New Jersey for three terms in the
Senate, said Friday that he planned to seek the Democratic
nomination for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as rejuvenated in the two years since he left
the Senate and now ``on top of his game,'' Bradley, 55, said he
believed he could offer the leadership needed to address the
nation's problems _ from the lack of affordable health care
insurance to childhood poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can unleash the potential of the American people,''
he said, standing in the gymnasium of a community center here. ``I
see the energy out there every day that makes the economy run,
makes the technological breakthroughs. I want to turn that energy
toward dealing with the problems in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who resisted efforts by supporters to persuade him to
run in 1988 and 1992, will most likely face a difficult fight for
the nomination. Despite his celebrity and track record raising
millions of dollars in previous campaigns, he will need to overcome
the well-financed organization that Vice President Al Gore has
built across the country over the last six years and Gore's
inherent advantage as the nation's second-highest official.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for Bradley will be finding a message that
will differentiate himself from Gore and other possible Democratic
contenders. And Friday, Bradley resisted making such a distinction.
``This is not about Vice President Gore and me,'' he said. ``This
is about telling people what I believe, going out and talking to
people, as I have been doing for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While not formally announcing his candidacy, Bradley took the
first step toward a presidential bid Friday by formally creating a
Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Committee. He will meet with
fellow Democrats in New Jersey over the weekend to begin putting
together the apparatus for a presidential campaign, which will be
based in New Jersey. Early next week, he will travel to Los Angeles
and San Francisco to meet with supporters and begin fund-raising,
his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left little doubt that he was seriously committed to the
race. Although his family did not join him at the announcement, he
noted that he had the full support of his wife, Ernestine, and his
daughter, Teresa Ann, a junior at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is training camp,'' he said. ``This is when you get your
team together. You see how you relate to each other, try to work
out some plays, and the regular season is when you form the
official campaign. I can tell you that I have never gone to
training camp without expecting that I would be playing in the
regular season.''

VROOM AT LE CIRQUE: GORDON DOES MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Gordon is accustomed to spending his time in
stock cars _ testing them, racing them to victories at an uncanny
pace. But for the past few days, the Nascar superstar has made the
news media rounds in Manhattan, spending time on television with
Matt Lauer, Regis and Kathie Lee, and Brian Williams; doing
magazine photo shoots; and dining at establishments like Le Cirque
2000, which presented him with a chocolate race car, and Le
Bernardin, where he lunched on sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   At a March of Dimes benefit, he approached Yankees Manager Joe
Torre, who was receiving an award. ``But before I did,'' Gordon
said Friday, ``he went on about the Nascar season. I said, `I
wanted to tell you we had a New York Yankees-type season,' and he
said, `No, you had a better season.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's whirl of appearances led to Friday night's annual
Nascar banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria, where he received a $2.9
million check for winning his third Winston Cup championship during
a season in which he won 13 races. Gordon's winnings totaled $9.3
million, and he earned millions more in salary, endorsements and
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives me is how to get to victory lane,'' he said during
an interview earlier Friday with editors and reporters of The New
York Times. ``If I don't win, I try to figure out how I'm going to
win next weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season, in addition to his Winston Cup schedule, he will
return to the Busch Grand National circuit, where he was rookie of
the year in 1991. He will be racing for his wife, Brooke, who owns
the race team. Ray Evernham, his Winston Cup crew chief, will also
handle the Busch races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Las Vegas, Texas, Michigan and to both
Charlotte races,'' Gordon said. ``We're using Busch to help us on
Winston Cup. We're going to Vegas because we ran so poorly there.
And we need laps at Texas. We've had a lot of interest from
sponsors and people who want to work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gordon's Winston Cup sponsors, Pepsi and Frito-Lay, will
join the Busch team. ``I like the idea of being involved at another
level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nascar doesn't mind, either. Bill France Jr., the president of
Nascar, said the Busch series, while successful, has a bit of an
identity crisis that Gordon may help remedy. ``It's the best-kept
secret in motor sports,'' France said. ``But we did a focus group
and one person said, `I'll tell you what, you ought to let Bill
France run it.' He didn't know it was connected to Nascar.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's success has made him one of America's best-paid
athletes and one of the most sought-after by corporations seeking
his endorsement. He is too careful to criticize other athletes for
complaining about multimillion-dollar contracts, but he believes he
deserves what he's getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any more money than I feel is fair,'' he said,
then added, ``Not too many people want to risk their lives in a car
every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Nascar is in a fortunate position. Its ratings are second in
sports only to the National Football League's. There is no labor
unrest because there are no unions. The racers are independent
contractors who have a symbiotic relationship with sponsors who pay
to keep their expensive cars running.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other sports have employee-employer relationships,''
France said. ``We're partners with Jeff, with the fans, the tracks,
the sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   If he owned a team in the National Basketball Association,
France said, he would use the Nascar model. ``I'd have them dress
in long pants so I can put logos all over them,'' he said. Perhaps,
he suggested, teams could reduce salaries if sponsors enriched
players directly.

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Renee Couture earns about $21,000 a year as owner
of a struggling Domino's pizza franchise in Danville, Ky. Single,
37, the mother of a 5-year-old daughter, Ms. Couture also has
diabetes, though thanks to her health insurance from Anthem Blue
Cross and Blue Shield, she said, ``My diabetes is in the best
control it's been in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in October, Anthem notified Ms. Couture that it was more
than doubling her premium, to $498 a month _ nearly 30 percent of
her salary _ from $197, a little more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All other options, she said, are at least as expensive: ``The
clincher for me is diabetes. Once an insurance agent hears that,
it's uh-oh.''
</P>
<P>
   At more than 100 percent, the size of Ms. Couture's premium
increase may be extreme, but many others among the 16 million
people under 65 who have to buy their own health insurance are
facing increases of 40 percent or more this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed, unemployed, working for small employers who do
not offer health insurance, or retired early, often because of poor
health, these people are a step away from joining the nation's 43.4
million uninsured, too young for Medicare, the federal insurance
for the elderly, not poor enough for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums are also rising for many of the 160 million Americans
covered by employers' group policies, with increases in the next
year projected at 8 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals who buy their own insurance already pay far more
because no employer subsidizes them, and now their soaring premiums
are creating a dynamic that appears certain to send prices even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic works this way: As premiums for individual health
coverage rise, the youngest and healthiest holders of those
policies, like people just out of high school and college, decide
to do without insurance. That leaves insurance companies with a
shrunken pool of customers who are older and less healthy _ and
whose health care costs cannot be spread across the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that premiums for the people who need health
insurance most are raised higher and higher to cover the cost of
their own care.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these people have been paying about 40 percent more
for their care than the great majority of insured Americans because
they pay the full cost, said Deborah Chollet, vice president of the
Alpha Center, a nonpartisan health care research organization here.
Now the gap is widening.
</P>
<P>
   In general, state regulators report, individuals' premiums are
climbing at least twice as much as the increases in group-policy
premiums that employers face next year. Premiums for the individual
policies are even rising faster than health care costs at the start
of the 1990s, a phenomenon that stirred President Clinton's effort
to overhaul the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton proposed helping uninsured individuals with
the highest medical bills, those aged 55 to 64, buy Medicare
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president proposed the Medicare legislation,'' said his
economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, ``precisely because he has
long recognized that there is a growing and often severe access
problem for countless Americans in this age group.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of patients' advocates, many regulators and some
health care organizations, the eruption of individuals' premiums
suggests that the administration's and Congress' alternative to an
overhaul has not worked. Their alternative left the system to the
marketplace, although they did make some modest repairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No two states are alike in how they regulate the industry or in
their experience with premiums. But for all, the direction is up.
Washington state says the average rate for unsubsidized,
middle-class subscribers to a state-administered health plan rose
72 percent this year and will rise 62 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Insurance Commissioner Stephen Larsen reports increases
in the ``20-, 25-, 30-percent range'' for individuals' premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Tightly regulated New York, with increases of less than 10
percent, and New Jersey, with 14 percent, are exceptions. In Texas,
said Ana Smith-Daley, deputy commissioner for life and health
insurance, ``The range we're seeing is 7.5 percent all the way up
to 40 percent.'' Connecticut's individual premiums rose 15 percent
to 25 percent this year and will rise by the same amount next year.
</P>
<P>
   The increases, furthermore, are averages, obscuring the
experience, for example, of Ms. Couture, whose increase was much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increases in the individual or direct-pay market are
sizable and significantly more than in the group market,'' said
Scott Serota, executive vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Association, a federation of 55 insurers and health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives by Congress and the administration for incremental
intervention, with laws to help expand coverage for uninsured
children and other groups, have had little effect on individual
subscribers' costs. The two-year-old Kennedy-Kassebaum law, for
example, enables people who leave jobs and lose their employers'
health coverage to get individual policies or immediate coverage in
other jobs, but the law does not regulate premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment this year, the General Accounting Office
reported that insurers are using high premiums and other devices to
drive away applicants, especially the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the implications, Ms. Chollet says, is that many people
may continue to stay at jobs they want to leave, rather than start
their own businesses or retire, because they fear losing their
employer-subsidized insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care organizations succeeded in one respect: they
captured 85 percent of the insured work force. But their costs
still rose and most are now losing money. With the magic of managed
care still unproven, they are trying to get back in the black by
raising premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals are taking even bigger jolts. One reason, some state
regulators say, is that they offer the path of least resistance. To
raise group-coverage premiums, insurance companies must negotiate
with employers, and employers, with their own finances on the line,
drive hard bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Serota of the Blue Cross association said a more likely reason
was a sea change in how the industry grouped individual
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, health insurance companies seek the widest possible
mix of customers, young and old, sick and well. A wide mix of
thousands of subscribers permits them to spread the cost of one
subscriber's bout with cancer to the others who pay premiums but
make few demands for care.
</P>
<P>
   This system, known as community rating, is breaking down,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Most healthy working people, for example, are covered under
employer group policies, setting them apart from less healthy,
often older consumers, who typically need individual policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the cushion of legions of healthier subscribers, the
companies insuring individuals spend more for their care and
therefore must charge them more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was this development, said Kaiser Permanente, the biggest
nonprofit health maintenance organization, that forced it to take
age into account when calculating subscribers' premiums this year
and then order large increases in individuals' policies.
</P>
<P>
   In part because it stuck with community rating longer than most
organizations, Kaiser said, it lost $270 million last year and $150
million in the first half of this year. ``We're saying that
community rating is not possible,'' said Beverly Hayon, a Kaiser
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Now the demise of community rating is fueling an insidious
spiral that drives premiums still higher and throws more consumers
off the rolls. ``It's called, `Sick people in, healthy people
out,''' said Dean Rosen, senior vice president and counsel for the
Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sicker the individual subscribers are, the greater their
incentive to keep buying insurance. Healthier subscribers balk at
high premiums and drop out. Then the insurers, left with fewer and
sicker subscribers, must spend more per client for care. To avoid
losses, they raise premiums again, giving the spiral another spin
and chasing away the healthier of the sick.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, more than the federal government, are
grappling with these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Few have tried harder, and with unhappier results, than
Kentucky. To see that all individuals had access to affordable
coverage four years ago, the state prohibited insurers from taking
an applicant's health into account in calculating premiums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 40 insurers bailed out of the state's
direct-pay insurance market. ``Now I have two,'' said state
Insurance Commissioner George Nichols. This year, the Legislature
reversed course and, within limits, permitted the companies to use
health conditions in setting premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That is what led to Ms. Couture's notice from Anthem. ``Some
people are seeing 100 and 200 percent'' increases, Nichols said.
Lawrence Ford, Anthem's spokesman, said the company had little
choice if it wanted to avoid more losses.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states, including Connecticut, California, Florida,
Illinois, Minnesota and Washington, have found another device to
accommodate people whom insurers reject because of their health or
scare off with high premiums: high-risk insurance pools. The pools
are no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   They charge premiums that range from 25 percent to 100 percent
above those that other people pay for comparable commercial
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But because the pools' subscribers tend to be old and sick, the
cost of their care usually exceeds the higher premium, so the
states make up the difference with assessments on insurance
companies or with tax revenues.

 &HT;    BCS: The final battleground
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee fans making plans for a trip to the Fiesta
Bowl might consider this: Even if the Volunteers beat Mississippi
State tonight in the SEC championship game to go 12-0, UT still
could get ``decimaled out'' of the national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   The top three teams in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS)
rankings _ Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State _ all play crucial
games today, but what happens on the field might not be enough to
determine which two advance to the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   If all three teams win, it will be the BCS standings _ a
complicated formula combining polls, computer rankings and strength
of schedule _ that determine who wins the trip to Tempe, Ariz., on
Jan. 4. Those final standings will be released at 3:30 p.m. Sunday
and Tennessee fans are nervous that even if the Vols win, the
numbers might not add up.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is No. 1 in the BCS rankings with a 4.99 rating,
followed by UCLA (5.03) and Kansas State (6.31).
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas State's strength-of-schedule rating would improve
dramatically with a win over 10-2 Texas A&AMP;M in today's Big 12
championship game. According to computer guru Jeff Sagarin, the
Wildcats' strength of schedule rating would improve from 62 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's and UCLA's strength of schedule would improve only
slightly with wins over Mississippi State and Miami, respectively.
Factor in additional wins by Marshall and BYU today (both played
Tennessee opponents earlier this year) and the Vols' rating would
go from 29 to 22 while UCLA's would go from 7 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   With the new strength-of-schedule ratings factored in,
Tennessee's lead of 1.41 points over Kansas State would be trimmed
to a point _ close enough for the Wildcats to overtake the Vols
with favorable changes in the computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the two key questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Can Kansas State pass Tennessee in both the Seattle Times and
New York Times computer ratings, which now have the Vols No. 2 and
Wildcats No. 3? The Seattle Times computer does not take margin of
victory into consideration, but it does count strength of schedule.
The New York Times computer factors in strength of schedule and
gives greater weight to good, late-season performances. If Kansas
State jumps over Tennessee in both ratings, that would create a
swing of 1.33 points _ enough to squeeze out Tennessee for the No.
2 spot behind UCLA. A change in just one of the computer rankings
would result in a swing of .27 points _ not enough to unseat the
Vols.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can Tennessee pass Kansas State in the USA Today/ESPN coaches'
poll? If Tennessee wins big over Mississippi State and Kansas State
struggles with Texas A&AMP;M, the Vols, now No. 2, could leapfrog the
Wildcats into the No. 1 spot. That would create a swing of a full
point _ enough to offset any change in the computer polls and keep
the Volunteers on the road to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for Tennessee tonight? Win and win big. Then hope.
``We are aware of the formula and what it means,'' Tennessee coach
Phillip Fulmer said, ``but we are also aware that the only thing
that we control is what happens on the field. We have to believe
that if we take care of business, the rest will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Volunteers led Kansas State by almost two
full points in the BCS standings. But UT's lead dwindled after a
victory over 2-9 Vanderbilt dropped its strength of schedule from
14th to 29th. Mississippi State's upset of Arkansas hurt the Vols'
rating, too _ instead of an SEC title game against a 10-1 Arkansas,
UT was left with a less-impressive matchup against 8-3 Mississippi
State.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's strength of schedule, rated as low as 79th on
Nov. 7, has climbed steadily, as the Wildcats closed out the season
against Nebraska, Missouri and now Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the top three teams loses today, of course, the
remaining two clinch berths in the Fiesta. If two or even all three
lose, the scramble to determine the top two teams would seem likely
to short-circuit microchips from here to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two Fiesta Bowl teams are figured, two other BCS bowls
_ the Sugar and Rose _ will fall into place. Under each of the
following three scenarios, the Orange Bowl matchup will be
Florida-Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee and UCLA are in the Fiesta, look for
Arizona-Wisconsin in the Rose and Kansas State-Florida State in the
Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee and Kansas State are in the Fiesta, look for
UCLA-Wisconsin in the Rose and Florida State-Ohio State in the
Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's Kansas State and UCLA in the Fiesta, look for
Arizona-Wisconsin in the Rose and Tennessee-Florida State in the
Sugar.

 &HT;    Underdog sees game as chance of lifetime
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Be honest. Tonight's SEC championship game hasn't
occupied many waking thoughts. The buzz is barely above an annoying
hum, you say. The matchup is about as sexy as a seed catalogue, you
say. Considering the two-touchdown point spread, you're expecting
this one to be as one-sided as a eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, you don't wear maroon, and the life, times and legend
of Rocky Felker is lost on you.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of this game can be dismissed only by the many
who neither know nor care about Mississippi State. Don't you know
that playing Tennessee for a conference championship can be a
life-altering experience?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just such an unusual situation,'' said the longtime
radio voice of the Bulldogs, Jack Cristil. ``(Bulldogs fans) don't
usually project championships. They say, `Give me a 7-4 or 8-3, get
in a bowl, and it's a great, great season.' They just don't think
on (the championship) level.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and ho-hum and so-what. Just not around a program that
won its one and only SEC crown 57 years ago and never has finished
a season ranked in the top 10 by media, coaches or adding machine.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Bulldogs won that lone conference title, they
couldn't capitalize. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor shortly
thereafter, which kind of took the steam out of the bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game that dares modest expectation to get jiggy.
Tennessee has a bundle riding on tonight's outcome, like the
continuation of a national championship run. But for big underdog
Mississippi State, the Roy Kramer Bowl is a brief, blinding moment.
Around the Bulldogs there is the strong odor of once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That's plenty to excite certain folk, some of them even
hereabouts. This game touches souls like Marietta's Guy McDowell, a
guard on Mississippi State's 1940 Orange Bowl team. ``(The
Bulldogs) have had their share of ups and downs. I'm sure glad to
get to see this come around,'' he said. ``Sure hope they have what
it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The other guard on that team, Hunter Corhern, is back in
Starkville feeling all young again. ``I was brought up on
Mississippi State football. It has made me feel real good, the way
they've gone this season. They've really turned over a new leaf
from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols play big ones all the time. They routinely are in line
for some title or the other. The list of great defining games in
Mississippi State history is much shorter. Where to file this one
among, say, the 1980 victory over No. 1 Alabama or the 1941 victory
over Mississippi that secured the conference championship or the
1935 conquering of Army?
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest game since '41, certainly the biggest one in my
lifetime,'' said Larry Templeton, a Starkville native who grew up
to become the Bulldogs athletics director. ``You don't get to knock
on this door often. When you do, you need to go through. Playing
for the SEC championship to us is the same as getting in the Final
Four or the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a New Year's Eve atmosphere for us in
Atlanta. Our people will be going full blast.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if you don't quite get this SEC championship game, just file
it away as a loud party to which you weren't invited.

 &HT;    Out of Starkville, into national light
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He rubbed together what he claimed to be two Razorback
tusks and leaned back in his chair with a delicious, satisfied
smile. Just moments before, Jackie Sherrill had defied the experts
once again, in a Nov. 21 triumph over SEC West darling Arkansas
that put his Mississippi State team within reach of the conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got these on a hunting trip in Texas a few years back,'' he
said, not caring whether the group of assembled reporters really
believed him. . ``You don't want to know where I shot him, but he
was running away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Sherrill-style charisma, and that is as good as it gets
for the toast of Starkville, who finally has found a home after
years of dodging the NCAA and jumping through a series of legal and
ethical hoops, all for the sake of winning games.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a decade since he resigned from probation-bound Texas
A&AMP;M and spent a two-year exile selling used cars. But Sherrill has
rebounded at much-maligned Mississippi State, where his
ugly-duckling team in many ways typifies his ``us against the
world'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 23 Bulldogs aren't being given much of a chance against
No. 1 Tennessee tonight, but predictions and public perceptions
aren't much of a concern to him. Sherrill has invigorated a
long-suffering program by finding players who agree with his
no-frills, unglamorous approach to football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats us with a lot of respect,'' center Eric Allen said.
``He's not really trying to impress anybody. He doesn't really care
what people think about him, but players love to play for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years at a program that won its only SEC crown in
1941, Sherrill has added another chapter to his colorful but
checkered 21-year college coaching career. His 49 wins are just 13
behind State's all-time coaching record, and he has taken the Dogs
to three of their nine bowl appearances. Although he doesn't offer
a hint of excitement, he also can't hide relishing another chance
to bask in the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an old coach, it's a reward,'' said Sherrill, who turned 55
last week. ``It means you've been good for a long time. When you're
young, you don't always understand what success really means.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's how Sherrill defined success _ and the lengths he went
to achieve it _ that made him one of the most scrutinized coaches
in the 1980s. He won 50 games in five years and coached Dan Marino
at Pitt before bolting for College Station in 1982. The Aggies won
three Southwest Conference titles, but it happened under a
perpetual cloud.
</P>
<P>
   George Smith, once a star high school running back from Douglas,
Ga., accused Sherrill of paying him hush money to cover up a
previous payment from the coach, then recanted. Sherrill was
confronted at Hartsfield International Airport in 1987 by a
Journal-Constitution reporter and photographer chronicling his
meeting with Atlanta sports agent Jim Abernethy, who had given
money to two A&AMP;M players. Sherrill wanted to arrange a repayment in
order to get the players eligible for the Cotton Bowl, although it
never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the NCAA found 27 rules violations and a ``lack of
institutional control.'' Sherrill, the head football coach and
athletics director, was not mentioned by name.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State had drafted a mandate that its next coach
could not have been ``directly'' implicated in any improprieties.
That was the loophole school officials needed to hire Sherrill in
1991, although he hasn't been free from controversy. The NCAA
snooped around in Starkville in 1995 and didn't find anything
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   And most infamously, there was the helpless bull Sherrill had
delivered to practice before the 1992 season opener against Texas.
The animal was castrated for what the coach called ``motivational
and educational'' reasons. State beat the Longhorns that Saturday,
but Sherrill later apologized when even some Bulldogs fans took
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been blown way out of proportion,'' said Allen, who
heard plenty about the incident as a high-school player in tiny
Water Valley, Miss. ``That happens thousands of times every day on
the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill refuses to rehash the past, denying that he gets
pleasure from confounding those who declared his career essentially
was over when he left Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has never entered my mind,'' he said. ``Those aren't the
things I talk about with my players. I stress the positives with
them. If you look at the downside, you'll never be successful. I
don't dwell on things I don't want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking, perhaps more than any other quality, has
underscored his endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a players' coach,'' defensive back Tim Nelson said.
``When you get to know him, he's a great guy. He's not for
everybody, because he likes perfection. If you're not getting it
done right, he's really on you. But that's what I like about him.

 &HT;    Going for a ride with Vols' Fulmer
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like all football coaches, Phillip Fulmer is driven.
But last Saturday night, he decided to do the driving himself.
Earlier, Fulmer had shivered in glee in the Vanderbilt Stadium
twilight when his players doused him with icy-cold Gatorade. Later,
as the first coach to lead Tennessee to an 11-0 regular season,
Fulmer celebrated by turning I-40 into memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of accompanying the Vols back to Knoxville, Fulmer drove
home with his wife, Vicky, and their daughters Courtney, 15,
Brittany, 13, and Allison, 12, all exhausted after UT's 41-0 win.
The trip promised three hours of quiet, quality family time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just kind of take a deep sigh and relax a minute,'' Vicky
said. ``Phillip and I had a good conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway between Nashville and Knoxville, the girls spied a sign
on I-40 and suggested they stop for dinner in Cookeville. Outside
of the state of Tennessee, Phillip Fulmer has a decidedly low
profile, especially for a man with the highest winning percentage
(.855, 65-11) of any active coach in college football. Many coaches
might have celebrated at a fancier joint than a Cracker Barrel
restaurant. But that's what the kids wanted.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls were much younger and Fulmer an ambitious
assistant coach at his alma mater, he took them to the Cracker
Barrel in west Knoxville every Friday for breakfast. They loved the
pancakes. They're older now and, like their father, have hectic
schedules. Fridays with Daddy are a memory. But last Saturday, in
the wake of UT's first 11-0 start in 60 years, the girls ate
pancakes again. As usual, nothing fancy for Dad. Meatloaf and
vegetables. The only toast offered? From a waitress, who served
Vicky's toast and hot cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot like the old Fridays, with two differences: The
state trooper who escorted them from Nashville and the steady
stream of well-meaning customers, UT fans who stopped by the table
to offer congratulations and say, ``Go, Vols!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very satisfied,'' Vicky said. ``Just content, very
content. But not in a mood of elation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be undefeated in the regular season, in the
conference, it just doesn't happen very often,'' Fulmer said. ``In
our case, since '56. And nobody had ever won 11 games in the
regular season at Tennessee. From a program standpoint, it's very
satisfying. And very gratifying to me personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I wanted very much. Now, you enjoy it a lot
more later than you have time to enjoy it now. Our focus _ and
we've done a very good job of this _ is, how do we beat Mississippi
State?''
</P>
<P>
   If they do in the SEC Championship Game, the top-ranked Vols
will be 12-0 for the first time in school history and a 13th win
away from their first national championship since 1951. If so,
Phillip Fulmer will have accomplished in his seventh season as head
coach what no Tennessee coach _ not

 &HT;    Special hospital for heart patients ready to open its doors
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From his office at 38th Street and North Lamar
Boulevard, Mike Zucker envisions a place where guests rave about
the food, family members can spend the night and a concierge is
open 24 hours a day to cater to his guests' special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker is not thinking of a luxury hotel for Central Austin but
a small hospital for heart patients, of which he is the president.
Monday, that hospital will open its doors on a bet that hotel-style
service and efficiency will lure physicians and patients _ and a
lot of money _ from the larger local facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the city's two largest groups of heart doctors have
invested in the new Heart Hospital of Austin, which sits just a
block from the city's biggest medical complex, Seton Medical
Center. Seton and St. David's, Austin's major hospital systems,
know those doctors will take patients and revenue from them but
won't hand over heart care in Austin quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that there's going to be a battle for the current
providers to preserve as much as they can and for the new player to
grab as much as (it) can, and the battle's going to be fierce,''
said Tom Young, who helped run Brackenridge Hospital and the Travis
County Medical Society before becoming executive administrator at
Austin Regional Clinic in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city known as a mecca for managed care, health plans
may decide the fate of the Heart Hospital. The involvement of
health maintenance organizations and other managed-care companies
will be essential to attracting patients to the Heart Hospital.
When it opens its doors, only a handful of HMOs will have signed
on, and one, Humana, has said it won't cover its 70,000 Central
Texas members there because its contract with St. David's forbids
it.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why the battle for our hearts is so fierce,
consider that cardiac care generates 25 to 40 percent of a
hospital's revenue. Americans spend $160 billion a year treating
heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, and as diagnosis and
treatment become more sophisticated, they become more expensive,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Charlotte, N.C.-based MedCath Inc. developed the first
hospital devoted to heart care and put it in McAllen. Since then,
the company has opened heart hospitals in Little Rock, Ark.,
Tucson, Ariz., and Phoenix. When the new facilities lost money,
MedCath sold out to two private investment firms last spring. The
buyout has not dampened MedCath's plans to open three more heart
hospitals across the country next year.
</P>
<P>
   In MedCath hospitals such as McAllen's, Medicare patients
account for as much as 70 percent of the business compared with
about half that at Seton and St. David's hospitals. Travis, Hays
and Williamson counties , which have younger populations _ all have
lower percentages of Medicare enrollees than Hidalgo County _ will
be a more challenging market, though executives say aging baby
boomers and retirees moving in will generate plenty of business.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, MedCath will also have to quickly win the loyalty of
health plans, which are increasingly influencing the way health
care is delivered. Nearly three of every four insured people in
Austin are covered by managed-care plans, most of which already
have relationships with the Seton and St. David's networks.
</P>
<P>
   `Focused factories'
</P>
<P>
   Zucker says the Heart Hospital's focus on efficiency was
developed with managed care's cost-cutting in mind. The health-care
industry calls MedCath's hospitals ``focused factories'' because
they treat only one part of the body. Last year, the Renaissance
Women's Center introduced the idea to Austin and quickly began
taking business from Seton and St. David's. Seton eventually bought
30 percent of the facility, which specializes in pregnancies,
births and women's health.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage both facilities enjoy is expertise. With an
emergency room and some noncardiac specialists, the Heart Hospital
will be able to care for nearly any patient who comes through its
doors, but its drive will be to serve heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   When patients arrive, they will be assigned a small team of
nurses and physicians to follow them throughout their stay. They
will stay in rooms that are only steps from the nurses stations,
come stocked with prescription drugs and are large enough to handle
intensive care equipment. So instead of moving patients from place
to place for different treatments, most of the care will come to
the patient's room. In the rooms, chairs convert into beds for
guests and everyone is encouraged to join in for meals. Heart of
Texas red corn spinach enchiladas or baked Atlantic cod are just
two of the many entrees to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cardiac hospital stay can be an incredibly stressful time
for patients and their families,'' said Melissa Paschal, the
hospital's vice president of business development. ``We'll offer a
sense of comfort and personal touches to ease the stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emphasis on patients, the physicians will play the
biggest role in encouraging patients to be seen at the Heart
Hospital, especially those 50 doctors who are limited partners in
the venture. Their ownership gives them a measure of control they
don't have in traditional full-service hospitals, plus the chance
to make a profit. And the hospital is betting that even physicians
who didn't invest will appreciate it as an alternative to hulking
general hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a certain frustration on the part of all
physicians these days,'' said James Goolsby of Austin Heart, one of
the cardiology groups that invested in the hospital. ``They do feel
a bit pushed aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby says that overcrowding of diagnostic labs and operating
rooms has also frustrated cardiologists and heart surgeons in
Austin. Often they do procedures late at night because space is
limited, he says. The Heart Hospital will cater directly to
cardiologists and cardiac surgeons rather than making them compete
with oncologists, pathologists and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   Older hospitals skeptical
</P>
<P>
   But executives at Seton and St. David's balk at the idea that
Austin's hospitals are strained by the demand for cardiac care.
With many beds empty, their strategy lately has been to develop
outpatient and short-stay facilities in areas that are underserved
instead of increasing their stock of hospital beds. They are
skeptical that Central Austin needs another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't see it adding any new technology and new
capacity,'' says Charles Barnett, Seton's chief executive, who
asked the state to reject MedCath's plans to lease land on the
state's Central Park parcel when they were first discussed. ``It's
in a location where there's already adequate capacity to provide
that kind of care.''
</P>
<P>
   The 500 physicians who have privileges to practice at the Heart
Hospital will continue to work at the other hospitals in town, but
seeing patients at the new facility will be hard to resist. In
McAllen, the Heart Hospital has already taken half of the area's
heart business away from the older hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that potential threat, Seton and St. David's are
stepping up marketing of their own cardiac-care facilities,
executives of both systems said. Already this year, Seton has
touted its 40 years of cardiac care in Austin, stretching back to
the first heart surgeries performed at Brackenridge Hospital, and
it claims the only sites in town for heart transplants and
pediatric heart catheterization. St. David's runs three sites for
open heart surgery _ St. David's Hospital, South Austin Hospital
and North Austin Medical Center _ and also offers an extensive
cardiac rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the competitive nature is going to make all places
better as well,'' says Goolsby, who calls himself ``a Seton
doctor'' even though his office will be on the third floor of the
Heart Hospital.

 &HT;    Death row escapee drowned, autopsy report reveals
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Mark Humphrey and Doug Smith were out on the
johnboat, hoping to snare some catfish on their trotlines, when
Smith saw something odd in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark, look at that,'' he said as the flat-bottomed boat glided
over the surface of Harmon Creek. Smith thought it was a mannequin
at first. He could make out a face and hands breaking the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw it had fingernails,'' Smith said Friday. ``And a
mannequin doesn't have any fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, the manhunt that started with blaring
sirens and barking hounds early Nov. 27 ended on a swampy waterway
near the Ellis Unit, when two fishing buddies who happened to work
for the prison system found the most sought-after man in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gurule, the escaped death row inmate whose body Smith and
Humphrey found Thursday, drowned, according to autopsy results
announced Friday by prison officials. Gurule also was grazed by a
bullet, the autopsy showed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a preliminary report from Harris County Medical
Examiner Joy Carter, whose office performed the autopsy, Gurule
suffered a gunshot wound to his back, but the injury was considered
superficial and not the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Carter estimated he had been dead for seven days when his body
was found, which means he probably died shortly after his escape.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report said Gurule was wearing several layers of
clothing, plus magazines bandaged to his arms with elastic. He also
had cardboard wrapped around his torso with elastic bandage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably led to the sinking of the body,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he went to the bottom and nature did its work on the
body,'' prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving day, Gurule and six other inmates cut through a
recreation yard fence, climbed to the prison roof, then sprinted
for the twin 10-foot perimeter fences, which are topped with coils
of razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's comrades surrendered under a hail of gunfire from the
tower guards. But the 29-year-old Gurule, on death row for
murdering a Corpus Christi restaurant owner during a 1992 robbery,
clambered over both fences and into the woods, launching a massive
manhunt that had dragged into its seventh day when Humphrey and
Smith decided to go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I thought he was long gone,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was, bloated and very dead, lashed to the side of
Smith's boat Thursday night. Their bosses in the prison system had
been right all along, Smith said. Gurule had never left their
17,000-acre search area. Prison officials said Garule's body was
found about a mile from the prison. But at least one map of the
area showed the distance as about 2 1/2 miles, though still well
within the search perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey is 39, a driver for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice's transportation department. Smith, is two years older and
works as a dispatcher. Like many men and women in and around
Huntsville, both have worked for the prison system most of their
adult lives. For ten years they have fished the creek together. Now
they have a fishing story no one in Huntsville can top.
</P>
<P>
   The pair almost didn't go fishing Thursday. They wanted to
launch the boat in the morning, but Smith's motor wouldn't start,
so he took it to Riverside Marine, a shop a few miles east of the
Ellis Unit. Clogged carburetor. The boat was ready in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   They hit the water sometime before 3 p.m., let a few trot lines
sink to the bottom, then ran out of weights. After heading for
shore to collect some rocks to tie to the lines, they decided to go
back and check on their first two lines.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, around 5 p.m., Humphrey was pulling out his
cellular phone and punching 911 to report that they had a body on
Harmon Creek. They pulled in Gurule _ his face unrecognizable _
with a fishing gaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unreal,'' Humphrey said, recalling his initial reaction.
``Couldn't believe it. It's a human, and he's dead. I don't care
who it is, that's a bad feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. The authorities wanted them to stay put, because
this was now a crime scene and the police needed to photograph
where Gurule was found. So they tied Gurule to the boat with
string, and tied the boat to one of the trees poking up through the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey said he almost begged the police to let him take the
body to shore: ``Let me load this guy and bring him in. It's
getting dark.''
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant full moon was rising over the pines by the time the
game warden could reach them in his boat. A day later, prison
officials were introducing them at a press conference as
``heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real proud of them, we're glad (prison) employees found
Gurule,'' prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said, before tearing up
a wanted poster of Gurule. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The searching is over, anyway. Two separate investigations into
the escape _ one directed by the prison board, another by the Texas
Rangers at the request of Gov. George W. Bush _ are just beginning
to dig into how seven murderers could breach death row. ``There's
not going to be any whitewash here, I can assure the public of
that,'' said Allan Polunsky, chairman of the state board of
prisons. ``Mistakes have been made. That's quite obvious. We just
need to identify why they were made, and what needs to be done to
remedy whatever caused the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Polunsky appointed a former prison official who also
worked 22 years for the FBI to head an eight-member panel of prison
and law enforcement officials to review the escape. Retired prison
internal affairs director John McAuliffe, who lives in Boerne, will
head the panel, whose first meeting is Monday. Many Hunstville
residents, relieved that the escaped killer has been found, are now
eagerly awaiting the results of the inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have anything like that (escape) come to a
close,'' said Jim Standefer, who owns several downtown properties
and runs a finance company. After Gurule escaped, Standefer said he
kept a pistol in his desk drawer just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``But him getting out is indicative of this William Wayne
Justice crap that went on here,'' he added, referring to the
federal judge who put the Texas prison system under federal control
during a landmark inmates rights civil case filed by a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have said that the lawsuit, known as the Ruiz
case, forced them to start the work program that Gurule and the
other six escapees participated in. The program, which was
indefinitely suspended after the escape, let inmates work in a
garment factory or do janitorial duties and gave them greater
freedom within their cellblock.

DRUG MAKER IS SAID TO FACE SUIT ON PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ark., Calif.)  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the prices of some generic drugs soaring to
record levels this year, the federal government is preparing to
accuse one of the world's largest producers of tripling its prices
after trying to corner the market on the drugs' raw materials,
lawyers involved in the anti-competition case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Mylan Laboratories Inc., has been notified that the
staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended filing a
civil lawsuit accusing the company of anti-competitive practices
after it raised the price of several generic medications, including
lorazepam, an anti-anxiety drug that is known popularly by its
brand name, Ativan.
</P>
<P>
   Generic drugs have historically been more attractive to
consumers, particularly people on fixed incomes and the elderly,
because the drugs are no-name knock-offs of more expensive brand
names. But this year, prices of many popular generic drugs have
risen dramatically, far outpacing increases in the brand-name
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Mylan has been the most aggressive of the
price raisers. In fact, the swift increases this year in the costs
of Mylan drugs have been so big and widespread _ in some cases more
than tripling _ that they largely contributed in one month to a
record increase of 10.7 percent in the prescription-drug portion of
the producer price index, an important measure of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the company plans a new round of price
increases, ranging from 44 percent to 71 percent, on 20 of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the federal government has taken steps to
encourage competition in the drug and pharmacy businesses, although
there has not been any other case where a drug maker was accused of
trying to control a supplier to increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission blocked two
proposed mergers involving four drugstore wholesalers. The
wholesalers control about 80 percent of the wholesale
prescription-drug business. Last August, the commission reached an
agreement with Merck that prevents its drug sales unit, Merck-Medco
Managed Care, from discriminating against drugs made by Merck's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The government's inquiry has focused on whether Mylan, which
fills more prescriptions than any other generic or brand-name drug
manufacturer, sought to illegally corner the market on important
raw materials supplied by an Italian company for some of its drugs,
including lorazepam, and then sharply raised prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company struck an exclusive arrangement with
Profarmica, an Italian company that is a major supplier of the
materials for lorazepam and other drugs Mylan makes. After that
deal, the supply diminished and the cost of the raw materials to
Mylan's competitors significantly increased. The company more than
tripled lorazepam's price to $122.11 for 100 2-milligram tablets,
and smaller competitors followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   These and other increases by Mylan have led to large price
increases by the company's smaller competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions on Friday, Mylan issued a brief
statement that ``no pharmaceutical company in America has a better
record of safety and compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Trade Commission has not brought a single charge
against the company, and we are certain no credible charge can be
brought,'' the statement said. ``Mylan has done nothing wrong. We
look forward to making our case before the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Mylan's lawyers are now preparing a presentation to the agency's
commissioners to urge them to reject the findings of the staff. The
company's lawyers contend that the arrangement with Profarmica was
proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements assured a source of supply which the
commission should recognize is a pro-consumer result,'' said Kevin
Arquit, one of the company's antitrust lawyers. ``The competition
that existed in this market prior to this agreement continues to
exist today.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman at the Federal Trade
Commission, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust lawyers who follow the commission say that in most
instances the commissioners follow staff recommendations and are
expected to do so in Mylan's case, an inquiry closely watched in
Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Executives at Mylan have said the price increases this year were
necessary to reverse sharp losses in many of their generic drugs.
The prices had been driven down by growing competition, as more
manufacturers have entered the market, hoping to profit by selling
generic equivalents of the growing number of brand-name drugs
losing patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, company executives say, Mylan lost money on 41 of the
97 drugs it sold. Jerry Treppel, an industry analyst at Warburg
Dillon Read, estimated that about 10 percent of the company's
earnings this year will come from the sale of lorazepam following
the price increase. In the year ending in March, Mylan reported
earnings of $100 million on revenues of $528 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Pittsburgh, is the world's No. 2 maker of
generic drugs, behind Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc., an
Israeli company. Founded in 1961, it began making generic
penicillin in 1966 and tetracycline in 1968. It is a major maker of
generics such as the ulcer medication cimetidine and atenolol for
angina.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's claim that its price increases were
essential for it to stay in the market, some consumer groups and
pharmacy groups have said the increases are inexplicable. Earlier
this year two House Democrats, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Pete
Stark of California, urged the commission to launch an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the drug companies are
systematically targeting these people, jacking up prices and
hitting the elderly the hardest,'' said Berry, a former pharmacist.
He said he had known of at least two people who died after they
stopped taking drugs they could no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacy industry has also complained to the Federal Trade
Commission about the price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could understand why the products had gone up so
precipitously,'' said Todd Dankmyer, a spokesman for the National
Community Pharmacists Association, which represents 25,000
independent pharmacists. Dankmyer said that after the association
met with Mylan representatives earlier this year to discuss the
price increases, ``the explanations were never satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dankmyer said the association was told by Mylan that the new
price rates still put their drugs at about 50 percent of the price
of their brand-name equivalent, which was probably true.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before the price increases, it was probably 5 to 10
percent,'' he said. ``Why they chose these products and why their
prices went through the roof is an interesting question.''

JETS' OFFENSE IS AS BALANCED AS CAN BE, BUT WHAT IF THEY NEED TO
CHANGE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ No matter what, Bill Parcells announced midway
through the season when his running game had faltered badly, the
Jets will continue running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And so they have, in what has become a textbook offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, with their 8-4 record and the sixth most productive
offense in the league, are the only team that has run the ball
exactly as many times as it has thrown it: 386.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite that golden blend Parcells wonders what will happen
if things do not go exactly right. Do the Jets have the wherewithal
to alter that successful mix?
</P>
<P>
   What will happen Sunday, for example, if the Jets fall two
touchdowns behind to the Seahawks in the final period? Then Vinny
Testaverde would be forced to throw and Seattle would know it. The
Seahawks have generated 45 sacks, second highest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, if we get forced into a different kind of game, I
don't know if that will work to our advantage,'' Parcells said
Friday. Then again, he is never very optimistic when he considers
potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for him he has not had to find out, as the Jets have won
six of their last seven games, and eight of 10 since dropping their
first two games. As for sacks, Testaverde claims that his
protection last week against Carolina was the finest of his career.
He was not even touched, he claimed, by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin has already produced 1,000 rushing yards. ``This
balance shows we're not a one-dimensional team,'' he said. ``I
believe we have a good package that keeps defenses off balance.
We're not seeing the defenses as aggressively stacked against the
run as they were earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Testaverde has been exploiting those defenses
with a variety of passing and receiving weapons. In one game he hit
nine different receivers, in another, eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That balance,'' suggested tight end Kyle Brady, ``keeps the
safeties thinking that any minute they're going to have to come up
to make tackles. By the end of the game the safeties are tired from
so much running.''
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Todd Burger said: ``When you're third-and-9, you're
not fooling anybody. You'll pass. But earlier in the season when
Curtis' yards-per-carry was down, he was still running 30 times a
game. The other team still had to respect it. If we had abandoned
the run, it would have taken away from our play-action, which we
use a third of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' offense, orchestrated during a game by Charlie Weis,
with increased input this year from the quarterbacks coach, Dan
Henning, has simply kept defenses off balance and tired. The Jets'
average possession time of 32 minutes 9 seconds is second highest
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said, ``We have a stack offense this year where I'll line
up with Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet alongside me, someone
goes in motion, all kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger said, ``If they bring in eight people to stack the
defense against the run, we'll go to four wide receivers to spread
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to center Kevin Mawae: ``We do what we're good at and
make them adjust to us. We don't adjust to them.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has decided that Jets Coach Bill
Parcells did not break any rules in talking to New England
quarterback Drew Bledsoe by telephone several weeks ago. The league
was investigating whether Parcells had been guilty of tampering or
had otherwise disobeyed league rules in making the call to Bledsoe
the day after the Jets defeated the Patriots on Oct. 19. A league
statement said Tagliabue accepted that the phone call was not
substantial. ``Coach Parcells said he understood the commissioner's
concerns about phone calls to opposing players during the season
and that there would be no further such calls by the Jets,'' the
statement said. After that Monday night game, Bledsoe had shaken
Parcells' hand, a gesture that impressed Parcells and prompted the
coach to call his former quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Center Kevin Mawae finally surfaced in the locker room Friday.
He had avoided exposure to the news media all week. ``I've been
studying lots of film,'' he explained. ``I want to be very prepared
for this game. I didn't want to get caught in the media blitz.''
Mawae jumped from the Seahawks in the off season as a free agent,
and the Jets made him the highest-paid center in league history:
$16.8 million over five years. This is his first meeting against
his former teammates. ``It was a very productive week. I'm very
happy I did this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keyshawn Johnson practiced at full speed all week despite
being on the injury list for a sore hamstring, according to
Parcells, who seemed miffed that anyone would even think the wide
receiver was slowed.

PERELMAN CUSTODY SUIT MUST BE PUBLIC, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Perelman, the multiply married billionaire who
has a very private office, a very private town house in Manhattan's
East 60s, a very private estate in East Hampton, and a very private
jet, will have to continue his fight for custody of his 3-year-old
daughter in a very unprivate setting: open court.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning a decision by the judge who handled Perelman's
divorce from his third wife, Patricia Duff, an appeals court ruled
Friday that the custody hearings cannot be held behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff had challenged the original ruling, by Acting State
Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten, who had agreed to take
testimony in private at Perelman's request. Lawyers for Perelman,
the owner of Revlon, had opposed open hearings, arguing that
embarrassing personal details, as well as information that might
compromise his security, should be kept private.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision upholds the principle of equal justice for
all,'' said Rita Warner, one of Ms. Duff's lawyers. ``It shows
conclusively that there's no different standard for the rich over
the poor, but rather equal justice for all that the Constitution
guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Perelman, a spokesman said he ``certainly would have
preferred that the decision not be overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to air the claims and counterclaims,'' said
the spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. ``They each have their own
arguments and he thought it was unseemly to air that all in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision in a case listed in court records as Anonymous vs.
Anonymous is the latest chapter in the 700-day Perelman-Duff
marriage, which unraveled at the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago in 1996. At the time, friends of Ms. Duff said Perelman
stormed off after an argument, leaving town early and leaving
behind Ms. Duff and their daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff, an influential Democrat who raised considerable
amounts of money for President Clinton, called the decision Friday
``a big victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning I wanted it open,'' she said, ``because I
think with a very wealthy, powerful person, it's important so that
I can be sure that it's going to be a fair process. It's not a leap
to think that some people might be intimidated in a closed
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not talking about herself, but about potential
witnesses _ and potential leaks. ``Ultimately, people will
understand the truth if they see the whole truth, not just pieces
of it that are leaked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Ms. Warner both portrayed the case in terms of a
struggle between rich and poor. When Ms. Warner was asked whether
Ms. Duff was, in fact, poor, she repeated her previous statement
that ``there's no different standard for the rich over the poor.''
Ms. Duff, in a separate interview, said reports that she had money
had been ``greatly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that I'm able to, that I have the resources that
have been attributed to me in power or wealth, to affect the
process,'' she said. ``There's no way I could compete with him.''

   JOBLESS RATE SLIPS TO 4.4 PERCENT, NEARING 3-DECADE LOW
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that 1998 still could turn out to be the decade's
worst year for layoffs, more Americans than ever are working, the
government said. U.S. employers added 267,000 workers to their
payrolls in November as the jobless rate slipped to 4.4 percent,
near a three-decade low.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest gain in payrolls in three months and matched
the pace of the year's first half, when many on Wall Street were
more fearful of an overheated economy than of a recession.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the prices of some generic drugs soaring to
record levels this year, the federal government is preparing to
accuse one of the world's largest producers of tripling its prices
after trying to corner the market on the drugs' raw materials,
lawyers involved in the anti-competition case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Mylan Laboratories Inc., has been notified that the
staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended filing a
civil lawsuit accusing the company of anti-competitive practices
after it raised the price of several generic medications, including
lorazepam, an anti-anxiety drug that is known popularly by its
brand name, Ativan.
</P>
<P>
   Generic drugs have historically been more attractive to
consumers, particularly people on fixed incomes and the elderly,
because the drugs are no-name knock-offs of more expensive brand
names. But this year, prices of many popular generic drugs have
risen dramatically, far outpacing increases in the brand-name
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Mylan has been the most aggressive of the
price raisers. In fact, the swift increases this year in the costs
of Mylan drugs have been so big and widespread _ in some cases more
than tripling _ that they largely contributed in one month to a
record increase of 10.7 percent in the prescription-drug portion of
the producer price index, an important measure of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the company plans a new round of price
increases, ranging from 44 percent to 71 percent, on 20 of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the federal government has taken steps to
encourage competition in the drug and pharmacy businesses, although
there has not been any other case where a drug maker was accused of
trying to control a supplier to increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission blocked two
proposed mergers involving four drugstore wholesalers. The
wholesalers control about 80 percent of the wholesale
prescription-drug business. Last August, the commission reached an
agreement with Merck that prevents its drug sales unit, Merck-Medco
Managed Care, from discriminating against drugs made by Merck's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The government's inquiry has focused on whether Mylan, which
fills more prescriptions than any other generic or brand-name drug
manufacturer, sought to illegally corner the market on important
raw materials supplied by an Italian company for some of its drugs,
including lorazepam, and then sharply raised prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company struck an exclusive arrangement with
Profarmica, an Italian company that is a major supplier of the
materials for lorazepam and other drugs Mylan makes. After that
deal, the supply diminished and the cost of the raw materials to
Mylan's competitors significantly increased. The company more than
tripled lorazepam's price to $122.11 for 100 2-milligram tablets,
and smaller competitors followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   These and other increases by Mylan have led to large price
increases by the company's smaller competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions on Friday, Mylan issued a brief
statement that ``no pharmaceutical company in America has a better
record of safety and compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Trade Commission has not brought a single charge
against the company, and we are certain no credible charge can be
brought,'' the statement said. ``Mylan has done nothing wrong. We
look forward to making our case before the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Mylan's lawyers are now preparing a presentation to the agency's
commissioners to urge them to reject the findings of the staff. The
company's lawyers contend that the arrangement with Profarmica was
proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements assured a source of supply which the
commission should recognize is a pro-consumer result,'' said Kevin
Arquit, one of the company's antitrust lawyers. ``The competition
that existed in this market prior to this agreement continues to
exist today.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman at the Federal Trade
Commission, declined to comment.

   But antitrust lawyers who follow the commission say that in most
instances the commissioners follow staff recommendations and are
expected to do so in Mylan's case, an inquiry closely watched in

earnings this year will come from the sale of lorazepam following
the price increase. In the year ending in March, Mylan reported
earnings of $100 million on revenues of $528 million.

TEXT OF WHITE HOUSE LETTER TO IMPEACHMENT PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of a letter signed by Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, and Gregory Craig, the special White
House counsel who is coordinating President Clinton's defense,
about plans for impeachment hearings:
</P>
<P>
   Short of a declaration of war, there is no more significant or
grave constitutional process than the impeachment inquiry currently
under way in your committee. Should the House of Representatives
approve an article of impeachment against the president and send it
to the Senate for trial, the impact on the national government and
on the American people as a whole would be profound. For that
reason alone, this process must be deliberate, thorough, fair and
expeditious.
</P>
<P>
   We realize that the full committee has conducted two public
hearings about impeachment-related issues _ one in which the
committee heard testimony from Mr. Starr, one in which the
committee heard testimony from witnesses about perjury. We also
know that the Subcommittee on the Constitution conducted a public
hearing on constitutional standards. We have been told that the
committee issued subpoenas and took deposition testimony and,
further, that the committee has held other proceedings in executive
session. With the exception of one hour of time provided to us for
questioning Mr. Starr at the end of his appearance before the
committee on Nov. 19, however, we have been foreclosed from playing
any role.
</P>
<P>
   We are grateful for the opportunity now to do so, and the
purpose of this letter is to inform you of our intention to call
witnesses to appear and testify as part of the committee's
impeachment inquiry. It is our view that the proceedings to date
have been inadequate and incomplete in their exploration of certain
important issues relating to the proposed impeachment of President
William Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, we propose to call panels of witnesses about
some of the very issues that the committee has considered. We feel
it is essential to the president's defense that we be able to call
our own witnesses and present our own arguments to address these
important questions. We plan to call witnesses to testify about the
following topics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Constitutional standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standards for prosecution for perjury, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prosecutorial misconduct and the impact of tainted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has set aside Dec. 8 for the purpose of hearing
from the president's counsel, and our request may require some
modification of the committee's plans. We take comfort, however, in
the representation that Chairman Hyde made to the full committee at
the beginning of the proceeding on Nov. 19, when he assured the
members of the committee that ``the president's counsel will have
unlimited time to present his witnesses at the end of our hearings,
when they are ready to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   We anticipate that we will require no more than three to four
days of the committee's time to deal with the topics identified
above, at which time counsel for the president will present a final
argument as to why, given the law, the facts and these
circumstances, this committee should not report out articles of
impeachment to the full membership of the House of Representatives.
We believe that, beginning on Tuesday, Dec. 8, our presentation
could be concluded by the end of the week.

RESERVOIRS IN NEED OF RAIN MEAN SHORTER SHOWERS, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in three years, city officials
Friday urged New Yorkers to start conserving water, saying the
city's reservoirs are 14 percentage points below normal levels for
this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Below-average rainfall during the fall has reduced the city's
reservoirs to 57 percent of capacity, said Joel Miele, commissioner
of the Department of Environmental Protection, who issued an
advisory Friday calling for voluntary conservation. Normally, he
said, in early December they are at 71 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   He said that unless heavier rains fall in the Northeast in the
coming weeks, the city may declare a drought watch by late January,
a more serious advisory but one that also calls only for voluntary
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the reservoirs do not dip into dangerous levels,
the commissioner urged New Yorkers to adopt water-skimping steps
like taking shorter showers, soaking in only half-filled tubs,
running washing machines and dishwashers only when full, and
flushing toilets only when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is prudent at this time to conserve water,'' Miele said,
though he stressed that the city's water supply had not yet fallen
to drought levels.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Weather Service, rainfall in New York
City for the year is actually 3.8 inches above normal right now,
but that is because the city experienced unusually heavy rains
during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The city has not had much rain since July, a spokesman said. And
throughout the region, rain has not been as abundant. Delaware, for
example, has had about 7 fewer inches of rain than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Drought watches are more typically called during the summer,
when water use is at its highest, with people filling pools,
watering gardens and washing cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Delaware River Basin Commission issued an advisory last
Wednesday that reservoirs in its region were 25 percent below
normal levels for this time of year. The Delaware River Basin
provides about half the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said, however, that the city's other water
sources, the Catskill area reservoirs and the Croton water system,
have not been as depleted by the recent dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware River Basin also serves New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Delaware. Delaware officials have not yet issued advisories to
consumers, but officials in New Jersey, where reservoir water
levels are now 24 percent below normal, last week issued
conservation warnings similar to New York City's, which stop short
of a drought watch.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pennsylvania the Department of Environmental Protection
on Thursday declared drought watches in the southern part of the
state and issued drought warnings in the northern and central
parts. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania agency, April Linton,
said that a drought watch calls for a voluntary reduction of 5
percent and a warning calls for a voluntary reduction of 10 to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linton said the next step would be a declaration of a water
emergency, which would mandate restrictions and allow suppliers to
start rationing water.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Nov. 29,
Monday about the Clinton Administration's policy report on Internet
commerce omitted a passage in an estimate by Ira Magaziner, a
presidential adviser, on how long it would take to determine
whether industry self-regulation is effective. Mr. Magaziner said
he believed it would take until the end of 1999, not the end of
1998.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Nov. 30,
about science and the movies misidentified the place where the
particle physicist Leon Lederman did his Nobel-prize winning
research. Dr. Lederman and his colleagues discovered that an
elusive subatomic particle known as the neutrino had a cousin,
dubbed the ``muon neutrino,'' during experiments in the early
1960's in Upton, N.Y., at the Brookhaven National Laboratory _ not
in Batavia, Ill., at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
known as Fermilab.

<P>
   BC-OBITUARY-DEMIKHOV-NYT (moved on Tuesday, Nov. 24)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of the pioneering Russian transplant surgeon
Vladimir P. Demikhov sent by the New York Times News Service on
Nov. 24, misstated the given name of a Case Western Reserve
professor who praised the surgeon's work. He is Dr. Robert J.
White, not Richard.
</P>
<P>
   In some copies the obituary also misstated the date of an
achievement ascribed to Dr. Demikhov by the Russian news agency
Itar-Tass. The agency said he performed a lung transplant on a dog
_ the first on an animal _ in 1947, not 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary included an incorrect reference from the agency to
the history of heart transplants on dogs. Dr. Demikhov's, in 1946,
was not the first; Dr. Alexis Carrel, at the University of Chicago,
performed the first one in 1905, according to a spokesman for the
hospitals there.

 ORIOLES SIGN DeSHIELDS AND SURHOFF  
 (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intent on keeping the New York Yankees within sight, even if
they need binoculars to do it, the Baltimore Orioles continued
scratching and clawing Friday to put together a starting lineup.
They filled two positions in a matter of hours, signing Delino
DeShields to play second base and re-signing B.J. Surhoff to play
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of relief for the Orioles, who have not had many
this off season, even though they signed Albert Belle and acquired
Charles Johnson last Tuesday. On that same day, they were shocked
to learn that Rafael Palmeiro rejected their five-year, $50 million
offer and accepted $45 million for five years from the Texas
Rangers. The next day, Robin Ventura agreed to the same offer with
the New York Mets that the Orioles had made, saying, ``I felt it
was a better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had also been negotiating with Surhoff, and their
signing of Ventura made it easier for the Orioles to keep him. The
Orioles had hoped to sign two players from the
Palmeiro-Ventura-Surhoff group.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, a 34-year-old New York native, had been offered a
guaranteed four-year contract by Pittsburgh, and the Orioles
belatedly offered to match it. But Surhoff opted to take three
guaranteed years with an option for a fourth year that will vest if
he plays in 120 games or has 372 plate appearances because the
salary for the fourth year would be higher. He is guaranteed $14
million for three years.
</P>
<P>
   With Belle more familiar with left field, Surhoff will most
likely switch from left to right, but Orioles general manager Frank
Wren said Belle has offered to play right so Surhoff could stay in
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for the manager to decide,'' Wren said by telephone
from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields, who will turn 30 next month, will replace Roberto
Alomar _ who went to Cleveland as a free agent _ at second base and
in the leadoff spot in the batting order. The Orioles lured him
from St. Louis with a three-year, $12.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed hitter batted .290 last season and had a .371
on-base percentage. He had 26 stolen bases, lowest of a nine-year
career that he has spent with Montreal, Los Angeles and the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, a versatile player defensively, achieved career highs
with the Orioles last season with 22 home runs and 92 runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   Wren said he would continue his search for a first baseman, a
starting pitcher and a right-handed reliever. Will Clark is one of
the possibilities for first.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles would like to sign Kevin Brown as the starting
pitcher they seek, but the price will be high. ``They're still
sorting through their thing for another week or so,'' Wren said of
Brown and his agent, Scott Boras.

`PSYCHO' ANALYSIS: FAITHFUL REMAKE DOESN'T CUT IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
LOS ANGELES _ Gus Van Sant's pathologically faithful remake of
Alfred Hitchcock's classic ``Psycho'' is an interesting, usually
respectful, even quite playful formal exercise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But like the academic effort it very much is, the film is mainly
good for imparting lessons succeeding generations of filmgoers
never seem to learn. Like black and white is better than color, no
one can mask abnormality as brilliantly as Tony Perkins could, and,
of course, Hitchcock still is the master of suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Van Sant fails at the one task he most wanted to
accomplish _ making ``Psycho'' accessible to today's younger,
graphic shock-weaned fright-film fans _ and succeeds better at
making something that will amuse the audience segment most dead set
against seeing it: lovers of the original who consider the remake a
sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   Even with red blood, a few extra knife thrusts and a bit more
skin, the violence here is tame compared to the mortifications and
body counts of any recent ``Halloween'' or ``Scream'' entry. Which
would probably be OK if Van Sant had managed to copy, like he does
so many memorable shots and montages, that most elusive but
essential of Hitchcockian qualities: the palpable sense of dread.
The remake just doesn't generate the kind of tension the 1960
original still does on the 20th viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant and his collaborators _ cinematographer Chris Doyle,
production designer Tom Foden and editor Amy Duddleston prime among
them _ achieve any number of small successes, though. One of the
biggest is the opening shot across Phoenix and into the cruddy
hotel room where Marion Crane and Sam Loomis (now a credible Anne
Heche and a hokily cowboy-ified Viggo Mortensen) have just finished
making love. It's now a smooth helicopter job that Hitchcock
himself regretted being unable to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   But their pillow talk already sounds a little museum-ish, a
minor problem that, perhaps unavoidably, persists throughout the
production (although references to Walkmans and such things that
weren't discussed in 1960 find their way in later). To let you know
you're in a Van Sant movie, however, there's a good shot of
Mortensen's naked butt.
</P>
<P>
   The thing gets more gussied up as it goes along. This is
especially evident in the two great murder sequences, when Marion
is stabbed to death in the shower and the private eye searching for
her gets ambushed at the top of a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock made these scenes tight masterpieces of perspective
and montage, and Van Sant more or less follows his framing and
editing plans while judiciously upping the gore factors just a
notch. Less judicious, though, was Van Sant's decision to insert
shots of passing clouds in the bathroom, and flashes of a nude
reclining and cows crossing a highway as detective Arbogast (a very
good, very '60s hard-boiled William H. Macy) falls backward.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, these personal touches do nothing to alleviate
the sequel's suspense problem.
</P>
<P>
   Making the film seem even more like Van Sant's ``Own Private
Idapsycho'' is Vince Vaughn's interpretation of everybody's
favorite mama's boy, Norman Bates. There was always something
queer, to say the least, about Norman, but Vaughn plays him more
effeminate than Perkins did (although, in the film's most 1998
moment, Norman masturbates vigorously while peeping at Marion
undressing).
</P>
<P>
   That's not fatal to Vaughn's work, although it does reveal the
ultimate secret too soon for any Martians out there who don't know
about Mother. What is almost fatal, though, is how Vaughn
telegraphs Norman's imbalance. It is, of course, wildly unfair to
compare the actor's work to one of the greatest film performances
of all time; let's just say this one makes you appreciate Perkins'
subtlety and control more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Other comparisons between ``Psychos'' are more fun. Getting into
the spirit of things, Julianne Moore does a tarter and tougher
rendition of Marion's bulldog sister than Vera Miles did. The
infamous Bates Motel and house have undergone brick makeovers.
Mother is, well, state-of-the-art. Danny Elfman's re-orchestration
of Bernard Herrmann's string-sawing score is slightly more manic
but very respectful; ditto Saul Bass' now colorized title designs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Van Sant films most of the movie as authentically as
possible, right down to the stuffed birds and the weird way drivers
exit cars through the right-side door.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing. It's more than watchable. But it's only scary
when you think about other projects these talents might have put
their efforts toward.

 COLUMN: CLOSING A RING: FATHERS, SONS AND OLD WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1968, Thomas Fleming went to France, to see
firsthand the Argonne forest where his father, Teddy Fleming,
fought alongside thousands of doughboys in the fierce battle that
helped end World War I. That clash routed the Germans and started
Teddy on a new life. He had gone over there as a sergeant, but came
home an officer after a battlefield commission. His exploits caught
the attention of Frank Hague, the mayor of his hometown, Jersey
City, who suggested the young man enter politics. He did, and by
1945 he had become sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gave him an onyx and gold ring to mark that
accomplishment. It was inscribed: ``From Mayor Frank Hague to
Sheriff Teddy Fleming 1945.'' Teddy gave it to his son in 1957
shortly before he died, and Fleming was still wearing it when he
went trooping through the Argonne. While climbing an embankment at
the site of one battle, he noticed that the ring had slipped off
his finger. Desperate, he clawed at the dirt, throwing clumps into
the air. Nothing. The very ground that had claimed the bodies of
countless young Americans had exacted its revenge on the son of a
man who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Fleming, a successful novelist and historian, got
a call at his home on the Upper East Side. Gene Scanlon, a friend
who worked for the current mayor of Jersey City, had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever lose a ring in France?'' Scanlon asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ready for a shock,'' Scanlon said. ``Some French guy found
it and he wants to give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Malmasson, a young French photographer who liked to sweep a
metal detector over old battle sites, had discovered the ring in
1985. The inscription that commemorated Teddy Fleming's rise from
wartime heroics to peacetime politics prompted Malmasson to ask
U.S. diplomats and soldiers about its owner. No luck. In October,
he finally tracked it down to Jersey City through a Web page that
mentioned Hague's tenure as mayor. Last week, Fleming returned to
the Argonne to retrieve his ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply, deeply moved,'' Fleming said. ``I had this
indelible rush of emotion that my father was in some sense in my
life again in this mystical way I didn't understand. The more I
thought about it, the more I thought there has to be some meaning
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is. On one level, Malmasson's urge to find the ring's
owner was a reaffirmation of the ties of friendship and duty that
have bound France and the United States since the Revolutionary
War. It was also a way to make a real connection to history, which
Malmasson said has always inspired his hunt for buried bits of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   All jewels get their own history, full of love and sometimes
hate, but always fully emotionally charged,'' he said in an e-mail
message. ``If I'm happy to find such treasure, it's quite
frustrating not to get any clues about the story of each object.
For me, it's just gold and stones. But for those who lost it,
sometimes it's a great part of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   He found the ring _ as he has rifles, bayonets and shell casings
_ quickly that day in 1985 when his metal detector beeped an alert.
He pried it out of the ground with a quick sweep of a pickax. When
he saw the inscription, he knew he had to find the owner. Over the
years he went to the U.S. Embassy in Paris and U.S. military
offices in Germany. Everyone was too busy to help. He clung to the
notion that he could find its owner, since it had been a gift from
one politician to another. That prompted him to search the Web in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it in my mind to locate him one day,'' Malmasson said.
``A quest is never finished when you don't have the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming can relate to that approach, especially in his
historical novels. Rather than see history as a list of dates and
great events, he recasts it as his-story, writing about how plain
people were caught in momentous times. Professional historians, he
said, have often ignored the role that memory plays in history, but
people want to have some tangible link to the past. That's why he
visited the Argonne. That's why he wore his father's ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ring has such symbolic power,'' Fleming said. ``They are put
on by popes and kings when they are crowned. It is a very powerful
symbol of connection and of blood. That was what my father was
trying to do when he gave me this ring in '57.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he and Malmasson stood on the side of the road not
far from where the ring was lost and found. Malmasson presented it
to him in a blue case decorated with a tiny sticker of the Stars
and Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a sense that my life as a historian was being
validated,'' Fleming said. ``That history, my interest in history,
Gil's interest in history, had come together in that moment and
restored a connection that I had to my father. A connection of
love.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, ``one tough Mick'' as he described him, never talked
much about love. But he never stood in his son's way when the young
man decided to become a writer rather than go into the law and get
rich through his father's political connections. The ring reminded
him of that. A few days ago, it reminded him of another battle,
too, the kind waged between fathers and sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 15 and not getting along with him,'' Fleming recalled.
``We were in the car one day and he asked, `How come I'm taking you
for a ride and you're reading a book?' I said: `What do you care?
You don't love me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His father slammed the brakes and jumped out of the car, crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said I didn't love you,'' his father said. ``You and your
brother are all I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades after that fight, Fleming's own recollection came back
haltingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get along with my mother,'' he said with a catch in
his voice. ``It was a terrible moment.'' He paused again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he finally said. ``You can see why I went to France.''
</P>
<P>
   He beheld the ring, a noble token of debts to France and
fathers. The stone was chipped, but it looked perfectly glorious on
his finger. He and Teddy had beaten the Argonne again.

   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are two kinds of home winemakers. There are
those who choose to make wine. And there are those who can't help
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Salvo is definitely one of the latter. And as a cold
November breeze whipped up his block in the Country Club section of
the east Bronx last week, Salvo was not pleased. The air was cold
enough to dull the smell of decaying leaves in his neighborhood,
cold enough to erase the scent of Neapolitan cooking that usually
emanates from its kitchens, cold enough to keep 50 gallons of his
1998 vintage from fermenting.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the driveway behind the tidy stucco home where he
and his wife raised their two children and have lived for 47 years,
Salvo pulled up the collar of his blue jacket, shook his head and
predicted a space heater vintage.
</P>
<P>
   His most significant contribution to the art of home winemaking,
he said, is his technique for providing the constant 72 degrees
that crushed grapes require to ferment. The Salvo innovation
involves swaddling the 50-gallon fermenting vats in blankets and
positioning a space heater close by when it gets cold outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine is like the woman you marry,'' Salvo said. ``You want
to make a baby, you got to stay close and get her warm. That's the
same way with the wine. You got to keep her warm or else she does
nothing but sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old retired building contractor is one of the last
of the neighborhood's old-time home winemakers. He scoffs at the
high-priced winemaking equipment and technical manuals that today's
food-obsessed, vintage-savvy younger set buy to feed their dreams
of making award-winning varietal wine.
</P>
<P>
   Salvo does things the old-fashioned way. He retools and
jury-rigs his winemaking tools. He follows his senses, not a
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   His instinctual approach to winemaking is one reason that people
like Ronnie Palumbo apprentice themselves to Salvo. Palumbo, 52, is
young and affluent enough to appreciate fine varietal wine. But he
is also old enough to worry about the passing of the vintners of
his father's generation and the wine they made from recipes handed
down from Bacchus.
</P>
<P>
   Salvo's brown-eyed, white-haired puckishness makes him almost as
difficult to resist as his thick red wine _ ``not too sweet, not
too dry, 3 cases white seedless grapes, 7 cases Alicante grapes,
that's my recipe that everybody love,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of making their own wine, neighbors who have
gotten too frail for the ritual call on Salvo to set their annual
stores. He is happy to oblige _ up to a point. ``The first ton of
grapes, I can handle,'' he said. ``After that, I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a procession of apprentices including his son
Joseph and grandson Johnny, friends and fellow retirees like Vito
Poveromo and Lochy Conlon have established themselves as the
winemaker's constant assistants. In fact, so large is the Salvo
consortium that, when he retired five years ago, Salvo moved his
center of operations from a tiny cloakroom near the front door of
his home. What he calls his new center is actually his former
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the particulars of home winemaking have become the
organizing principle of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, he scours bars for empty bottles. It takes all
afternoon to wash, sterilize and sun-dry the bottles. By Sept. 1,
Salvo has entered the grape-buying stage.
</P>
<P>
   He and his consortium pile into his light blue 1983 Chevy and
cruise the Conrail freight yards in Mount Vernon, in Westchester
County. Various vendors sell California grapes directly from
freight cars, cash only.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Bronx, the winemaker and his assistants also drop by
Jerry's Nursery &AMP; Wine Grapes Co. on Boston Road. Salvo is a big
believer in comparative shopping and Jerry's is his personal
commodity price index.
</P>
<P>
   Salvo claims that more than 65 years of winemaking, beginning
with his apprenticeship to his grandfather in Salerno, Italy,
helped him refine his blend. But his main purveyor suspects that
price is a significant factor in Salvo's formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old guys like John and my father aren't going to pay $34 a
box for merlot grapes or $35 for cabernet when they can get
Alicante for $20,'' said Carmine Cipolla, son of Jerry Cipolla,
founder and owner of Jerry's Nursery &AMP; Wine Grapes Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shopping for the best price, said Cipolla, ``the
old guys think the way they do it is the only way, because it is
the only way they ever did it and no way they're going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the old-timers tend to be immigrants who may
be loyal to their fathers, or may think that $20 for a bottle of
wine is highway robbery, or may be too wary to drink any wine they
haven't made themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, their response to autumn is to begin the
wine, quickly, instinctually and, after they have settled on the
price of the grapes, without question.
</P>
<P>
   They make hot, sturdy wine that cannot be aged and begins to
sour within a year, wines that might cause a sommelier to sniff.
But in wines like Salvo's, the contradiction between their fleeting
fragility and their full, rough body is their charm.
</P>
<P>
   The younger, more enlightened winemakers of today, said Carmine
Cipolla, aim to make fine wines, distinct wines, wines that can be
aged. ``The newcomers are full of science and social ambition,'' he
said. ``They tend to belong to wine-tasting clubs and drive their
BMWs to Jerry's to buy princely varietal grapes and designer-priced
winemaking equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Berens, the editor of Wine Maker, an annual magazine
that premiered last summer, said home winemaking is one of the
fastest-growing hobbies in America.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cipolla isn't so sure. ``When I started this business 60
years ago, I had 10 competitors within 3 blocks,'' he said. ``Now
I'm the only guy and I lose a customer every couple weeks. They
die.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't trust the youthful hobbyists with their ready cash
and vinicultural vocabulary. In an economy that runs deeper than
dollars, Jerry Cipolla knocks a couple cents off his price to Salvo
every time the winemaker loses a customer.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture is not lost on Salvo, who is uncharacteristically
specific when it comes to cost and quantity. He purchased 3,780
pounds of grapes this year, which cost about $2,160 and made
precisely 315 gallons of wine, just under the legal limit for
personal consumption. He makes wine for himself first, and then for
the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   After blanketing the fermenting vat and firing up the electric
space heater one recent afternoon, Salvo rubbed his hands together
over the glowing coils and surveyed his world.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded Chateau di Salvo is a cinderblock structure with
one glass brick window, two walls of wood shelving that accommodate
giant barrels for aging, and an eclectic assortment of vodka and
scotch bottles as well as grinders, filters and clear plastic
tubing.
</P>
<P>
   The spine of the room is a platform that is about 36 inches high
and houses two 50-gallon fermenting vats. Both of the grape presses
bolted to the concrete floor were gifts. One is a 150-year-old,
hand-cranked metal model from a neighbor who had gotten too old and
weak to turn the massive handle.
</P>
<P>
   Inhaling one of those precious moments between raw grapes and
vinegar, Salvo rocked contentedly in his running shoes. Then he
started to giggle like a madman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last June, some doctor tell me I'm going to die in one month.
I say to him he better be wrong or else he's not going to taste my
wine! Now he's calling me asking for his wine. Who else is he going
to call?''

`CHERE MAITRE': VOICES OF FLAUBERT AND SAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first few minutes ``Chere Maitre'' threatens
to be a nostalgia soak for Irene Worth fans: Here, inimitably, are
the voice that finds the head too flat a sounding board and tries
to purr and murmur directly from the diaphragm, the eyes that tell
you words cannot reach the depths of human dreams, and the slight
shifts of limb or position that suggest this woman is steadying
herself in an emotional earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But give her time to outline the new character she is creating
and all those indelible figures from the past _ from Shakespeare,
Ibsen, Chekhov, Tennessee Williams, Albee _ fade into the
background and Ms. Worth really is the French novelist George Sand,
indelibly printed on the imagination, at least until she takes on
whatever role she chooses next.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eyre, the actor who adapted this 90-minute enchantment
from the correspondence of Sand and Gustave Flaubert, calls it a
recital. Indeed, he and Ms. Worth hold large pages of the letters
throughout, like music sheets; they sit for 40 minutes and stand
for 20; then one sits and one reclines on a couch.
</P>
<P>
   But a catalog of small hand and foot movements, especially Ms.
Worth's, reveals doubts, apprehensions and passions in these
writers that their careful sentences struggle to conceal. Some
recital! Like one, perhaps, given by two great Wagnerians
accompanied by the Chicago Symphony. In the intimacy of the Flea
Theater, where the Bat Theater Company is presenting it, these
actors seem very large presences indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sand-Flaubert correspondence developed when he was in his
early 40s and she was turning 60. They had markedly different views
of literature, but they cultivated an affectionate respect for each
other that is almost palpable in the letters.
</P>
<P>
   While Flaubert mostly held himself to stating his literary
principles and perceptions, Sand was sometimes less restrained and
in one famous letter virtually told Flaubert that his obsession
with style was a kind of snobbery that prevented his fiction from
affecting people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Eyre conveys Flaubert's caution admirably, with just an
occasional flash of impatience, perhaps even irritation. In fact,
in his selection of letters he has probably made his role in this
``recital'' too subdued. Flaubert's power was intellectual, and it
was formidable. This performance would be more balanced if Eyre
gave his character's intellect more flash and fire.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he is up against terrific competition. Sand's letters
are full of fruit and flowers, children and grandchildren, actors,
singers and amusing neighbors, while Flaubert's are filled with
ideas, endless complaints and his dying mother.
</P>
<P>
   When he laments the stupidity of his countrymen and says,
``Earth is no longer habitable for us poor mandarins,'' she replies
that ``what you are complaining about is life'' and defends
stupidity as only ``a kind of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Ms. Worth is expressing all this motherly affection in
an enormous range of inflection, she knows very well how to let us
see violets peeping out of a spring snow and feel the cold as she
reaches out to touch them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She also knows how to convey Sand's steeliness, especially in
that critical letter written not long before the novelist's death
in 1876. It is impossible not to feel how shocked and even hurt
Flaubert must have been, especially since Sand had always been so
supportive when critics attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Ms. Worth's command of her character, and of
this situation, that as she speaks the lines of the letter, a
listener often finds himself trying to recall the exact phrasing of
the French original. At that point acting takes on the force of
spiritual possession, and what a pleasure it is to be possessed.

NEWS ANALYSIS: BRADLEY HASN'T ANSWERED THE `WHY' QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn., Mo., Neb.)   (With BRADLEY-POLITICS)  
(rl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Vice President Al Gore had expected that his incumbency and
financial strength would discourage serious challengers, that
assumption faded with Bill Bradley's announcement that he may seek
the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday afternoon, Bradley was among a half-dozen Democrats
who were talking about joining the presidential hunt next year.
While the field might be relatively large, with Democrats stirred
by the perception of the Republican Party in disarray, Gore
continues to be viewed by Democrats across the nation as the
overwhelming favorite. And even in announcing that he might seek to
topple Gore, Bradley served to underline the difficulty that he _
and, for that matter, any Democrat _ is going to have running
against a man so closely identified with a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey declined to offer any
criticism of Gore, or even offer any differentiation of views
between himself and Gore. He instead spoke in the broad, esoteric
style that has for a decade excited some Democrats about the
prospect of a Bradley presidential bid, but has struck more than a
few others as quirky and distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about telling people what I believe,'' Bradley said.
``Going out and talking to people, as I have been doing for 30
years. It will not be a campaign related to the past. It will be a
campaign related to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The cautious posture was in keeping with the style of a man who
has always tried to present himself as a cut above the common
politician. But many Democrats said that such a campaign, by
itself, might be less than effective against Gore, a sitting vice
president who has spent these past seven years accumulating huge
amounts of political good will and campaign contributions in
preparation for this run.
</P>
<P>
   In this kind of environment, even Bradley _ the former
basketball star and best-selling author _ is going to be under
increasing pressure to offer Democratic primary voters a reason to
discard someone who has been such a loyal soldier to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is the Roger Mudd question: Why? Why is he
running?'' said George Stephanopoulos, the former senior White
House aide who helped engineer Clinton's victory in 1992. ``All
things being equal today, Gore is in as strong as position as you
can imagine for the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   William Carrick, a California-based Democratic consultant, said
that while Bradley might have stirred interest among Democrats with
a cerebral discussion of the problems facing the nation, ``a lot of
that is on a very cosmic plane and needs to be fleshed out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have got here is a situation where it's not clear
what the rationale is, other than he wants to talk about things
like race relations, the need for community and how government and
people are connected,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   With his announcement, Bradley now becomes one of two Democrats
who have taken the step of forming an exploratory committee, the
first formal step toward joining the race. The other is Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Bradley's announcement, four other Democrats
reiterated their own interest in the contest. Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts will announce in January what he intends to do, an
aide said. Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska has invited friends to
Omaha later this month and is is expected to use the occasion to
declare he will run for president a second time. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson told reporters in Washington Friday that his son has urged
him to run again. And Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House
minority leader, is also seriously considering another run for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Such a crowded field would almost surely play to the benefit of
Gore, dividing whatever opposition to the vice president exists. On
the other hand, several Democrats predicted that Gephardt would
chose to remain in the House, where he might become speaker in
2000. That would leave Bradley as the leader in a second tier of
candidates trying to unseat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But then what? Bradley has identified himself with campaign
finance reform, an issue on which Gore, given the investigations
into the fund-raising activities of the White House, might be
vulnerable. But there is no evidence that American voters are moved
by the question of how candidates finance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has a unique position in American politics _ the Rhodes
scholar and star basketball player _ but he has yet to identify
himself with with a major proposal or theme of discontent. More
than a few Democrats wondered Friday whether that was enough to win
an election in this kind of environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what Bill Bradley's big idea is,'' said Terry
Michaels, a former communications director for the Democratic
National Committee. ``I don't think he stands for much. I don't
think you can do a personality-based campaign and knock off a
sitting vice president for the presidential nomination. I think it
has to be a real ideas based campaign, one that can really move the
rank and file and caucus participants.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years is a long time. Clinton's popularity could fade.
Democrats might decide they have had enough of this president,
particularly if the threat of impeachment passes, and Gore could
pay the price for that. The investigation into Gore's campaign
finance practices could turn for the worse. Or Gore could make the
kind of graceless mistake that front-runners so often make,
creating an opening for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that was a point Stephanopoulos made Friday, recalling
the relatively unknown field of Democrats who put themselves
forward to run against President Bush in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are kicking themselves because they thought
George Bush was unbeatable in 1992,'' Stephanopoulos said. ``Bill
Clinton didn't.''

BAD CALLS HURT FLUTIE IN THE WALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest loser in last Sunday's fiasco between Buffalo and
the Patriots will not be Bills owner Ralph Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson got flagged for $50,000 by NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue for criticizing the officials after they made two calls
at the end of the game that took a victory away from the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest loser will most likely be Doug Flutie. As we
wrote several weeks back, the Bills quarterback is playing for the
minimum base salary, which was raised from $250,000 to $300,000
when the new collective bargaining agreement became official
recently.
</P>
<P>
   His opportunity for big money is in bonuses. Flutie has picked
up about $500,000 extra for the number of plays and wins he has
been involved in to date.
</P>
<P>
   However, the big boosts come into play with win No. 9. If
Buffalo had won last week, which it should have, Flutie and the
Bills would have eight victories, with some seemingly easy pickings
left on the schedule _ Cincinnati and New Orleans on the road,
Oakland and the Jets at home.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie needs two more wins to pick up $250,000 more in bonuses.
With each additional win beyond nine, another $250,000 kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he has a clause in his contract that if the Bills make the
playoffs, he gets an additional $100,000, and if they make the
second round, he gets another $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   If he had won last week, Flutie would have four shots to make
the first $250,000. And if the Bills had prevailed here, they would
have been odds-on to win the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Plus _ and this is a huge plus _ all the bonus money this year
will be added to his base salary next year. If he makes $1 million
in bonuses this year, his base salary next year would start at $1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   One could easily say that if the Bills miss the playoffs, those
calls here last Sunday may cost Flutie at least $750,000 over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Your favorite Patsies, doormats more than dominators during
their 39-season existence, will be No. 1 soon. You can count on it.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they are going to win the Super Bowl. What is
sure to happen, if and when they are safely ensconsced in Hartford,
is that they will be the top revenue-generating team in sports. Not
just the NFL. All of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine this week tabbed the Dallas Cowboys as the top
team in the NFL financially because they take in more money than
any other, some $118 million per season. The Yankees, according to
Forbes, take in the most overall, $144 million.
</P>
<P>
   Move over, 'Boys and Yanks, there will be a new leader in the
clubhouse soon. If, as planned, our New England Patriots get to
Hartford in 2001, they will be top dog. When the stadium opens, the
Patriots will gross more than $170 million a year, and in their
fifth year, 2005, they will gross more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a football team playing about 20 games each year taking
in more money than any baseball team playing 162.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If we read it right this week when the state of Connecticut,
made public the economic feasibility study it commissioned, the
state expects to make a score starting in the 30th year of the
30-year lease with the Patriots. Someone should tell those people
that in 30 years that stadium will be outmoded. And then, instead
of cashing in, the state will have to start building another
stadium for the Patriots, if they're still in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The stadiums built in the 1960s _ RFK in Washington, Three
Rivers in Pittsburgh, Veterans in Philadelphia, and Riverfront in
Cincinnati _ are all dumps from which their teams are trying to
escape. The Redskins have moved to a new stadium they built
themselves. Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Philly are all trying to
get new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years seems to be about the life expectancy of a stadium,
and Connecticut will find that out. All the stadiums mentioned
above were built for less than $50 million. It now costs four times
as much. Hartford's will cost $280 million. Multiply that by four
and see if the state makes $3.8 million in 2031. It will never
happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of new stadiums, the Red Sox had a group of Boston
experts on the West Coast this week looking at the plans for the
stadiums to be built in San Francisco, Seattle, and San Diego, to
name a few. The Red Sox expect to have their entire stadium plan,
including the financial feasibility study, ready to present to the
public in February . . . The officiating crew that got in trouble
here last Sunday is the same one that the NFL had to apologize for
early in this season when two terrible calls they made helped San
Francisco beat Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the last NFL annual meeting in March, the return of instant
replay as an officiating tool was defeated by two votes, with 23
yeas needed for passage. Next year, with Cleveland coming in as the
31st team, 24 votes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is already on record as favoring replay. Plus,
Buffalo's Wilson and Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney, whose teams voted
against it in March, now say they are ready to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   When replay was discontinued after 1991, opponents claimed it
slowed down the game. Recent history shows how flawed that theory
is.
</P>
<P>
   Time of game with replay _ 1990: 2 hours 58 minutes 25 seconds;
1991: 3:01.40. Without replay _ 1997: 3:02.38; 1998: 3:04.50 (to
date).
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the games are taking longer now without replay
than they did with it.

   Tagliabue informed Bill Parcells recently that there was no
merit to the charges that he was tampering when he called Drew
Bledsoe for a friendly conversation following the Jets' win over
the Patriots in Foxborough. The Patriots triggered the protest . .
. Mo Money was great this week, wasn't he, talking about his
``misfortune''? I guess he was referring to his time with the Red
Sox, when he made a fortune. Look at Vaughn's life. He grew up with
nice parents, went to a fancy prep school (Trinity-Pawling in
Connecticut), attended a good college (Seton Hall), and will make
$100 million before age 40. He has sure had a lot of
``misfortune,'' hasn't he? . . . We forget about the other people
hurt by the NBA lockout, like the local chapter of the B'nai Brith.
For years, it has put on the Celtics' season-opening dinner for
charity, netting $70,000 last year, all going to good causes. This
year: no games, no team, no dinner, no money . . . As we think of
all the great high school championship games on tap, we ask this
trivia question. Can you name the high school football player who
holds the national record for kickoff returns for touchdowns in a
game? He did it four times in a game for Shanley High in Fargo,
N.D., in 1951. Ten years later, he broke Babe Ruth's home run
record by hitting 61. Roger Maris.

CALIFORNIA   BUILDING   SEES SURGE IN 1998; FUTURE LETDOWN
FORECAST
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ Construction activity in California soared 13.6
percent during the first 10 months of the year, but the next two
years are likely to see growth in the low single digits as the
economy cools, an industry tracker said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   January-October activity (excluding public buildings), measured
by permits issued through planning departments statewide, amounted
to $37.07 billion, according to the report compiled by the
Construction Industry Research Council based in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 gain includes two major office projects that received
permits in October _ Dole Food Co.'s new $31.2 million headquarters
in Westlake Village and a $32 million, 10-story office building in
Burbank for The Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that nonresidential building for the past ten
months totals $12.6 billion, up 20.8 percent from the year ago
period, and is expected to reach nearly $15 billion for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's impressive growth should continue during the last
two months and push 1998's total project value up 16 percent or 17
percent from 1997, but the gains in the next two years will likely
be a more modest 3.8 percent, according to Ben Bartolotto, the
board's research director.
</P>
<P>
   The latter figure still represents a respectable level of
building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The construction sector's rebound began in 1996, when projects'
value jumped 16percent from 1995. In 1997, it jumped 24.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the coming slowdown is being attributed to the Asian
economic turmoil and a typical business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to get a larger increase toward the beginning of the
recovery than you do toward the end,'' Bartolotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said the anticipated slowdown reflects a more
conservative stance being taken now by lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will finance if it is a good project, but if it is a
project that might look a little bit marginal, there may be a risk
premium in the interest rate and that might kill it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Los Angeles area will still see its share of
big construction projects in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the Alameda Corridor to speed shipment of goods between
port and downtown rail yards will pick up steam next year; Disney
Concert Hall construction should start; the Cathedral of our Lady
of the Angles is also planned; and Universal Studios will continue
expanding CityWalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) are spending a lot of money and there are projects
that are not going to be stopped. The construction activity will be
a support for the economy for the next couple of years,'' Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing also made significant gains between January and October
with permits issued for 105,357 units, up 11.6 percent from the
1997 period. But California currently ranks third among the states
in total new housing units, accounting for less than 8 percent of
the national total in the first ten months of 1998. Texas ranks No.
1, followed by Florida.
</P>
<P>
   California last led the nation in 1991 and 1990, when it
accounted for nearly 15 percent of the nation's total, but its
activity declined significantly during the recession. Kyser noted
that the state's new housing sector is unlikely to surge in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that new home building in Los Angeles and
Orange County is going to go anywhere because of a lack of
available sites and fiscalization. Cities would rather have retail
development as opposed to new residential development,'' he said.

CLINTON LAWYERS SAY THEY'LL NEED 3-4 DAYS BEFORE PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid growing anxiety that the House may have the
votes to send at least one article of impeachment to the Senate,
White House lawyers said Friday they will need three or four days
to present their defense of President Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   That request would interfere with the House Judiciary
Committee's plan to set aside Tuesday for Clinton's defense and
begin the debate and vote on possible articles of impeachment later
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately sought to dismiss speculation that
it was trying to delay a House impeachment vote until the next
Congress is seated in January, when Republicans will have a
majority of only six votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get this done by the end of next week, and
that should leave them plenty of time to wrap up their
proceedings,'' spokesman James Kennedy, a White House special
counsel, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's GOP spokesman, Paul McNulty, said, ``This is
an obvious and desperate political ploy to push the inquiry into
the new Congress where the Democrats potentially have more votes.''
Democrats picked up five seats in last month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers unveiled their new defense strategy on a day
when White House aides criticized Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry J. Hyde for his previous statements about perjury. At the
same time, the White House sent its strongest signal to date that
the president is willing to accept a congressional censure and
perhaps a fine rather than have the Senate conduct an impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the committee, White House lawyers Gregory B.
Craig and Charles F.C. Ruff said they plan to call witnesses to
testify about constitutional standards for impeachment; standards
for prosecution, perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power; prosecutorial misconduct; and the impact of tainted
evidence; and then present closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that we will require no more than three to four
days of the committee's time to deal with the topics...at which
time counsel for the president will present a final argument as to
why, given the law, the facts, and these circumstances, this
committee should not report out articles of impeachment,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining their request for ``some modification'' of the
committee's schedule, the laywers wrote: ``Should the House of
Representatives approve an article of impeachment against the
president and send it to the Senate for trial, the impact on the
national government and on the American people as a whole would be
profound. For that reason alone, this process must be deliberate,
thorough, fair and expeditious.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said the panel could give Clinton's lawyers four days to
present a defense and still wrap up its work by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the White House wants this wrapped up this year so
we can hit the ground running next year,'' Meehan said. ``If in
fact, the White House wanted to carry this all into the next year,
I would be very disappointed, and I would speak out against that
strategy. I think that would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, when asked about the House impeachment vote,
White House Press Secretary Joseph Lockhart said, ``We would like
that to happen today. If it can't happen today, we would like it to
happen tomorrow. If next week is the date they set, we would like
that to happen next week.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republican leaders have been counting the House votes in
favor of impeachment, the White House has been taking the
temperature of Democrats and moderate Republicans to find out where
they stand. Both legal and political aides have been involved in
that effort, as well as Cabinet members who have served in
Congress, such Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With the House vote, slated for the week of Dec. 14, too close
to call, White House aides Friday openly embraced the censure
option as part of an effort to sway about two dozen moderate
Republicans who think Clinton should be punished for lying about
his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky but not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said administration officials were ``aggressively
listening'' to congressional alternatives to impeachment the closer
the vote gets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president would be willing to pay a fine, if
part of a censure resolution, he said: ``If members in good faith
want to pursue that option and approach representatives here at the
White House with that option, we will listen and take anything they
say seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, moved to
consolidate numerous Democratic plans to advance a censure
alternative by tapping Representative Rick Boucher of Virginia, a
senior member of Judiciary Committee, to lead the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher is seen as one of the Democrats most able to reach
across party lines on the deeply divided committee. He is expected
to work closely with Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy
Democrat who last week became the first committee member to
publicly announce he would propose an alternative resolution short
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the intense friction on both sides, the
White House pounced on comments Hyde reportedly made about perjury
in 1987 during the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to me too simplistic to condemn all lying,''
Hyde was quoted as saying in a Los Angeles Times article. ``In the
murkier grayness of the real world, choices must often be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart: ``I think the chairman shows remarkable dexterity
in applying standards when it comes to the subject at hand. I think
in 1987 he made a rather impassioned and convincing argument that
circumstances allow lying.''

HYDE'S REMARKS ON PERJURY ARE DEFENDED AND ATTACKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CENSURE, IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TEXT) 
(lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Republicans investigating
President Clinton traded snide remarks on Friday over what the
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has said about perjury
and how he really feels about it.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, unwittingly set the stage for the
exchange on Tuesday, in his solemn and seemingly uncompromising
remarks about the evils of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``If citizens are allowed to lie with impunity _ or encourage
others to tell false stories or hide evidence _ judges and juries
cannot reach just results,'' said Hyde, R-Ill. ``At that point, the
courtroom becomes an arena for artful liars and the jury a mere
focus group choosing between alternative fictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's remarks about the sanctity of words given under oath were
delivered in the investigation of the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky and his attempts to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   But some people recalled what Hyde said in 1987, in Congress'
inquiry into the Iran-contra affair. Defending the Reagan
administration, Hyde said condemnation of all lying ``just seems to
me too simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the murkier grayness of the real world, choices must often
be made,'' Hyde said of the Reagan administration's covert aid to
anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Friday that Hyde ``shows
remarkable dexterity in applying standards,'' and that the
difference in his views over 11 years shows ``more about politics
than about conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Republicans on the Judiciary Committee replied Friday
night, ``Context does matter, and the facts of the Iran-contra
affair and President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky could
not be more different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one lied under oath, after swearing to tell the truth, and
no one ever lied for personal gain,'' said the Republicans'
statement, issued by their spokesman, Paul McNulty.

VITESSE   STOCK HITS   NEW HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shareholders of telecommunications specialist
Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. have enjoyed a two-month run-up that
has seen shares more than double, and analysts predict continued
strong growth for the company and its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Camarillo, Calif.-based Vitesse hit an all-time high
Thursday, when they jumped $4.34375 to $41.6975, representing a
gain of nearly 12 percent and the company's first close above $40.
Shares hit $46.375 at one point and volume topped 6.05 million, the
heaviest trading in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, shares set another record with a gain of 56.25 cents
to $42.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitesse has a very defensible franchise,'' said Shekhar
Wadekar, an analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates who has a
``buy'' rating on the stock. ``They are one of only a handful of
companies that can deliver key high-frequency solutions to the
telecom market.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Clark Westmont of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities
pointed out that demand has been soaring for products enabling
high-speed transfer of massive amounts of data over networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitesse is very well-positioned at a time we're seeing
fast-growing markets for broad-band data products,'' said Westmont,
who also has a ``buy'' rating for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Customers for Vitesse's high-speed chips include such
telecommunications network equipment heavyweights as Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems, 3Com and Alcatel, along with cellular
phone maker Ericsson AB.
</P>
<P>
   The company saw Wall Street hammer its stock in October along
with the rest of the computer sector amid concerns that slowing
economies would cool product demand.
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse shares hit a 1998 low of $18.0625 on Oct. 5 but have
sizzled since then. The stock has received eight ``buy''
recommendations from analysts since Oct. 15, when it reported
profits of $16.5 million, or 21 cents a share, for its fourth
quarter ended Sept. 30, up 65 percent over the 1997 quarter, on a
75 percent gain in revenues to $54.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, shares jumped $4 to $28.4375, and Prudential
Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann issued a price target of $45 with
the brokerage's ``single best idea'' designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitesse is a leader in its markets with a strong growth rate
and a big backlog,'' said analyst David Wong of Needham &AMP; Co., who
has a ``strong buy'' rating and a 12-month price target of $53.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other chip makers rose Thursday and Friday on optimism
that they will see improved sales and reduced costs. Altera rose
$1.3125 on Thursday and matched that gain Friday to close at
$55.6975 after Mosesmann raised his target to $65 from $50, citing
strong demand for chips used in networking devices and optimism for
sales in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip maker Micron rose 62.5cents Thursday and surged
$3.75 Friday to $50.125; Texas Instruments Inc. gained $2.375 and
$1.75 to close at $82.875; Analog Devices Inc. gained $3.125 and
93.75 cents to $28.1875; and LSI Logic Corp. rose $1.50 and 93.75
cents to $20. LSI shares have almost doubled since touching a
52-week low of $10.50 on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has seen its shares surge in the past month as
purchases of new personal computers grew, fell $4.0625 Thursday and
then jumped $6.8125 Friday to close at an all-time high of
$116.3125. &QL;

FLIGHT COMPUTERS BRING JETS TO BRINK OF CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a near
mid-air collision between a Northwest Airlines jet heading from
Detroit to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut and an Air
Ontario commuter flight flying from Providence, R.I. to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The close call Tuesday evening was caused by on-board computers
designed to prevent mid-air collisions, but in this case put two
aircraft on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   It took human intervention _ a sudden call of ``traffic!'' from
an air-traffic controller in the Boston FAA center in Nashua, N.H.
_ to avert a possible tragedy. The two planes were flying at about
22,500 feet about 30 miles southwest of Albany, N.Y., FAA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system, known as TCAS for Traffic Collision
Avoidance System, is required by the FAA to be on passenger planes
with 10 or more seats. TCAS, designed to give warnings of nearby
aircraft, is praised by pilots as a safety tool, and since its
widespread introduction, reported near collisions have dropped
dramatically even as the number of flights have increased.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said the two planes came as close as they did _
within 300 feet of vertical separation and less than a mile
horizontally _ because the on-board computer systems told one plane
to climb and the other to descend.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Jim Peters said the investigation will include
examining how TCAS worked in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The TCAS system, which was in use in both planes, gives escape
directions by issuing only vertical commands _ ``climb'' or
``descend.'' Future systems will include horizontal commands.
</P>
<P>
   William Johannes, the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association representative on TCAS issues, said the association
``certainly believes that TCAS can provide an extra margin of
safety in some circumstances. However, in this case, the safety
system nearly caused a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The near collision occurred in an area that is heavily congested
with north-south flights from the New York metropolitan area and
flights heading to and from Boston, Hartford, Conn. and Providence.
But the two planes _ and a third taking off from Albany Airport _
were safely separated until the TCAS alerts prompted course changes
by the flight crews.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when the TCAS on board the Air Ontario Flight
1445, a de Havilland Dash 8-100, flying from Providence with 21
people on board, warned the flight crew that traffic was
approaching. The traffic, officials said, was USAirways Flight 885,
a Boeing 737 traveling from Albany to Pittsburgh, that was on its
climb from the airport to a flight level of 21,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate separation between planes in that airspace is 1,000
feet vertically or five miles horizontally. Because of that, the
USAirways flight, when it leveled at 21,000 feet as directed by
controllers would have posed no hazard to the Air Ontario flight.
But the on-board computer only saw a plane climbing toward it. That
prompted the Air Ontario TCAS to issue an alert and direct the
pilot to climb.
</P>
<P>
   When TCAS issues a command, flight crews react immediately,
rather than first requesting a course deviation from air-traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where it was a busy traffic area and TCAS
advised the pilot that there was an aircraft in the area,'' said
Debra William, manager of corporate communications for Air Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines Flight 1186, an Airbus A-320 that seats about
150 people, was making its initial descent into Hartford from
Detroit and was at 23,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Peters and officials at the Boston FAA center, the
TCAS on the Northwest plane then told that plane to dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our preliminary review, it would appear the closest
proximity between the Northwest plane and the Air Ontario plane was
300 feet vertically. Air traffic control working that airspace
advised the aircraft of traffic in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The planes were so close that the targets on radar scopes in
Nashua merged into one, a controller told officials.
</P>
<P>
   Said Johannes, who is also the Boston Center local president of
the controllers association, ``The actions of controllers working
this airspace resulted in the pilot being alerted to the impending
mid-air collision and resulted in him taking corrective action
needed to prevent that collision.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Austin, a Northwest spokesman, said no report had been filed
by Flight 1186's flight crew and the airline was not aware of the
incident. Airline officials were attempting Friday to contact
members of the crew to ask them about the flight. Austin did not
have an actual passenger count, but said about 60 people were on
the flight.
</P>
<P>
   There is newer software for TCAS that can filter out air-traffic
patterns so that aircraft traveling on the same horizontal plane _
that are not on a collision course _ will not result in a cockpit
alarm going off.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA has yet to mandate that the software be installed.
It was unclear whether the upgraded TCAS would have prevented the
near collision.

 &HT;    Higher education perks top features of Constitution rewrite
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The proposed new Texas Constitution unveiled
Friday would funnel more money into the University of Texas and
Texas A&AMP;M University to help them remain nationally competitive
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the proposal, part of a longshot
effort to rewrite the state's patchwork Constitution, sounds like
it will help, but they want to hear more.
</P>
<P>
   The higher education overhaul is included in what could be the
most ambitious legislative effort of the upcoming session, which
begins Jan. 12. San Angelo Rep. Rob Junell and Mount Pleasant Sen.
Bill Ratliff, who chair the budget-writing committees, want to
throw out the 1876 Constitution and replace it was a streamlined
one packed with controversial proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would agree that times have changed, the
world has changed,'' said Ratliff, who sees the effort as a
longshot worth taking. ``Texas needs an updated constitution to
guide us into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The retooled Constitution, about a fifth as long as the current
one, was filed as a single proposed constitutional amendment. It
would take a two-thirds vote in each chamber to send it to the
ballot on Nov. 2, 1999 for voter review.
</P>
<P>
   The higher education plan would not have an immediate financial
impact on the schools but would shift colleges in two higher
education funds so that state aid to the flagships and to Prairie
View A&AMP;M would ultimately go up, said Ratliff. At the same time,
some of the other schools in the UT and Texas A&AMP;M systems that are
now being shortchanged would get more aid.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to preserve the flagships as world-class
universities and to more fairly distribute money among Texas
colleges and universities, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, it becomes a dramatic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UT-Austin President Larry Faulkner said, however, he was not
expecting a windfall but didn't know enough to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the changes pitched by Ratliff and Junell would
remove six UT academic institutions, one A&AMP;M school and six A&AMP;M
agencies from the $7.2 billion Permanent University Fund endowment.
Those entitites would be shifted to the Higher Education Assistance
Fund, which, like the PUF, helps finance construction and academic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, first discussed publicly earlier in the fall, does not
say what would happen to the six UT health-related institutions and
A&AMP;M's medical school. Ratliff said he and Junell are producing a
separate plan for financing the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Higher Education Assistance Fund, or HEAF, is made up of 23
schools, including the University of Houston, Texas Tech and
Southwest Texas State in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in the HEAF and the PUF have long been at odds with each
other over which fund provides the most support. UT System
Chancellor William Cunningham has argued that the PUF, with its
sharp spending limits, is not the cash cow that HEAF schools
believe it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said Cunningham is right. Some schools in the PUF get
half of what their counterparts in the HEAF get, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I need to learn more about the details,'' Cunningham
said, ``this proposal seems a very positive step in solving he
PUF/HEAF problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUFwould continue to pay the existing debt obligations on
construction bonds already issued. Because such bonds can 20 years
to pay back, Ratliff said the plan's financial benefits would
evolve over time.
</P>
<P>
   He expects all schools to gain money except for Tartleton State
University. Dennis McCabe, the school's president, said he was not
aware of the plan but ``would have trouble supporting something
that would hurt the students at Tarleton State.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Supple, president of Southwest Texas State, said unlike
some of his colleagues, he supports the plan. ``It's a myth that
the PUF schools get more money,'' he said. ``As long as it doesn't
do any harm to the HEAF schools, I support this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said the $175 million HEAF would be increased to $225
million under the plan, with another $25 million going toward an
endowment that is being formed for the HEAF schools. He expects the
HEAF to net $25 million more a year under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proposed new Constitution would give Texas
governors more authority and responsibility. Governors would
appoint all judges (who later would face voter review) and the
state comptroller, agriculture commissioner, land commissioner and
railroad commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Junell and Ratliff had discussed converting the 15-member State
Board of Education from an elected to appointed panel, but opted to
make no changes.
</P>
<P>
   On the judicial side, the proposal calls for combining the Texas
Supreme Court and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which now each
have nine members, into a 15-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights is untouched, but the proposed Constitution,
for the first time, defines marriages as something that only a man
and a woman can enter into. State law currently bans homosexual
marriages. Putting it into the Constitution would make it more
difficult to end the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply saddened our Constitution would be cluttered up by
discriminatory language. It's a terrible sign they might be willing
to attack minority rights,'' said Diane Hardy-Garcia, executive
director for the Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The current constitution established the concept of community
property but does not say who has the right to that provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like once and for all we need to say who it is has the
right to access that constitutional provision,'' said Ratliff.

METS TRADE BLAIR, SOUND OUT TORONTO ON CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A busy off season for the Mets became even busier
Friday when they traded right-handed pitcher Willie Blair to the
Detroit Tigers for utility infielder Joe Randa. And apparently,
Mets General Manager Steve Phillips would like to keep on dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This freed up some money for us,'' Phillips said of trading
Blair, who is scheduled to make $7.75 million over the next two
years. ``It at least gives us more flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   With some of the savings, Phillips would apparently like to sign
free-agent outfielder Rickey Henderson, which could happen next
week. Meanwhile, Phillips admitted Friday that he had spoken with
Toronto General Manager Gord Ash about possibly obtaining Roger
Clemens, who has told the Blue Jays he wants to be traded to a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to know if New York, the National League and the
Mets were even a possibility for him,'' Phillips said of his
conversation with Ash. ``In my conversation with Gord, I tried to
get a feel for it. And they're not going to let this thing drag
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Mets are interested, Phillips did not sound
as though he thought he had a good chance at landing Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how strong a player we are in this,'' Phillips
said. ``I'm not sure we have everything they're looking for. But
it's worth considering.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are obvious. With Clemens leading what is now a
decent starting staff that consists of Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby
Jones, Masato Yoshii and Hideo Nomo, the Mets would enhance their
chances of getting to the post-season for the first time in a
decade. So even though Phillips is trying to trim his budget after
signing Leiter, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura to lucrative deals,
Clemens would be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique situation, one that ownership tends to be
very open in consideration of,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a match. Phillips said that as last season was
winding down, he evaluated what Toronto was looking for. ``And I
have thought Toronto's needs were similar to ours,'' Phillips said.
``And that is why it is tough to match up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Mets lose out on Clemens, they have significantly
reduced their needs this off-season. The one glaring missing piece
is a leadoff hitter. And Henderson would fill that need, even if he
is not the hitter he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   By trading Blair, Phillips made the first of what might be
several modest moves to reduce the Mets' payroll. The Mets are
believed to be shopping Greg McMichael (possibly to Seattle) and
Butch Huskey (possibly to Milwaukee). And Phillips said Friday that
two or three teams are interested in Randa.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael will make $1.8 million next season. Both Huskey and
Randa are eligible for arbitration. Randa, 29, who could give the
Mets a right-handed bat off the bench if he is not dealt again, hit
.254 with 9 home runs and 50 runs batted in for the Tigers last
season, one year after batting .302 for Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who will turn 33 on Dec. 18, went 5-16 for the Arizona
Diamondbacks and the Mets, one year after going 16-8 for the
Tigers. He did turn in strong performances in his only two starts
for the Mets, losing by 2-0 to the Cardinals (while allowing Mark
McGwire's 50th homer) and defeating the Expos, 1-0, to keep the
Mets alive in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie was glad to go somewhere he knows he's part of the
rotation,'' Phillips said of Blair, who has pitched for eight major
league teams in his nine-year career.

CLINTON'S FATE IN HOUSE HINGES ON GROUP OF GOP MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-NYT) 
(th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Republican leaders looking unlikely to allow a
vote on censure, President Clinton's fate in the House hinges on
the decisions of a small group of Republican moderates who could
tilt an impeachment vote either way.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote along party
lines by the end of next week for at least one article of
impeachment _ on perjury _ against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is slated to vote the following week, and
Republicans and Democrats alike say the vote is too close to call.
They say it could well shift against the president if a censure
measure is not allowed on the floor as an alternative option.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, and other Republicans
who have been canvassing GOP sentiment say that censure's chance of
coming to the floor, even if impeachment fails, is now very slim.
Such a no-censure scenario would give wavering Republican
moderates, who disapprove of Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky
scandal, the unpalatable choice of impeachment or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If the House was complicating matters for the president, the
White House threw a roadblock of its own into the House on Friday
night, signaling that it wanted to put on a full defense that could
last most of next week and push the impeachment vote behind
schedule. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, had no immediate reply Friday night to the new
request.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they saw the White House move as an effort to
stall the proceedings until January, when a new Congress, with five
more Democrats, convenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a desperate last minute ploy to move the
impeachment inquiry into next year _ this after demanding from the
beginning that the inquiry be finished this year,'' said one
committee official. He added, ``They are looking at the votes, and
they don't like what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democratic strategists were surprised by the White House's
tone. One said the president's aides seemed to have forgotten that
they were no longer fighting for public opinion but ``fighting for
20 Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the plans for Clinton's defense were made public,
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said the White House was
overplaying its hand. ``Right now they're pushing people into
impeachment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the White House press secretary, Joe
Lockhart, sharply criticized the Republicans' drive toward
impeachment. ``This is perhaps the most serious thing Congress can
do,'' he said. ``This isn't a process where the House of
Representatives can throw it to the Senate and let them deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Judiciary Committee, he said, ``Their actions have been
chaotic, partisan and irresponsible, fundamentally limiting the
president's ability to present a coherent defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde replied by mocking the Democrats' constant criticisms of
his panel. ``In sum our inquiry is either too broad or too narrow,
too slow or too fast,'' he said. ``Judge Starr is either talking
too little or too much. Now that's my definition of chaos. One gets
the impression from the Democrats that the left hand doesn't know
what the far left hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   How the White House handles the next few weeks could be vitally
important because enough Republicans are on the fence, and refusing
to declare themselves, that both parties say no one can say for
sure what will happen in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can have a precise vote count right now,
because there are large numbers of undecideds and undeclareds,''
said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del. He said he was undecided on
impeachment and would like a censure option if impeachment is
defeated. ``I've spoken to a lot of people who just simply haven't
said which way they're voting, and I've talked to people clearly up
in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican moderate, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey,
said she thought that if the House was presented with a straight up
or down vote on impeachment, without the option of censure, most
moderates would vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   She said she staunchly opposed censure. ``I don't want censure
used as a dodge or escape from the direct vote on impeachment,''
she said. ``That is our constitutional obligation to have that vote
and not have a plea bargain on the floor. It will be a travesty if
any form of censure is used.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Friday that the White House was ``willing to
listen to any proposals relating to censure.'' Democrats are
working to assemble a censure proposal that could draw the support
of most of their party and some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And several Republicans have their own proposals. Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., has proposed a censure plan, which he has sent to the
White House for review, that would include a requirement that
Clinton agree to a financial penalty. That would need Clinton's
consent to clear constitutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., has sent a censure proposal
that would reduce the president's pension. And another New Jersey
Republican, Bob Franks, recently pleaded with the president in a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he was now inclined to support an article of
impeachment on perjury. ``For the sake of the nation,'' he wrote to
Clinton, ``I urge you to come forward, admit you lied under oath
and indicate that you are prepared to face the consequences of your
action.'' He said such an admission would ``create an atmosphere in
which a penalty other than impeachment could be actively
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   But King acknowledged Friday that the biggest hurdle could be
getting his censure proposal to the House floor. ``The idea is to
try to build up pressure,'' he said. ``DeLay does not want it to go
to the floor, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats say they are prepared to use parliamentary
maneuvers to get at least an indirect vote on a censure
alternative, such a move would be difficult for Republicans to
support. The current House leadership has long warned Republicans
that a vote with the Democrats on procedure is considered a
heretical stand against the party and the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate intensified, conservative groups were working to
keep Republicans from breaking ranks. The conservative weekly Human
Events, in its new issue on Monday, carries a front-page editorial
imploring Congress to impeach the president. And its editors
continued to go on talk radio shows in the districts of Republicans
who are undecided or leaning against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   King, who has become perhaps the most outspoken Republican
against impeachment, said his office began receiving 150 phone
calls an hour in favor of impeachment on Monday and Tuesday. ``We
had to shut down the phones and put on the voice mail system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for next week's debate, the Judiciary Committee
staff is now drafting three articles of impeachment charging the
president with perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
The articles closely track evidence that Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, submitted to Congress concerning the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to cover it
up.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury accusation is the one that is considered to have the
best chance of passing the full House. Republican officials said it
would cite Clinton's deposition in the sexual misconduct suit
brought by Paula Jones and it would cite the president's August
testimony before a grand jury in which he answered questions about
his remarks in the deposition.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The way some residents tell it, the area on the edge of
the Everglades National Park known as East Everglades can have all
the charm of a swamp _ flooding, mosquitoes, remoteness. But the
same residents describe the bright side of the neighborhood as
``magical'' and ``breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The privacy, the quality of the air, the low noise, the
safety, the spiritual contact with nature,'' said Jose Exposito,
38, an East Everglades resident and the owner of an orchid
business, ``it's just a way of life you don't find anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That way of life is about to end for the area, about 25 miles
west of Miami. Exposito's rural neighborhood, government officials
say, stands as one of the obstacles to a comprehensive effort to
repair the vast expanse of wetlands that is the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the South Florida Water Management District, the
agency that oversees flood protection and water supply for 16
counties, voted last month to spend about $120 million to buy out
the 1,400 landowners in the East Everglades area by the year 2002.
Those who refuse to sell will have their properties condemned,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the water management agency say plans are for most
of the area of 6,000 acres to have continuous standing water once
the residents are gone, as they try to restore the flow of water to
the Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of these crucial components'' for restoration,
said Mark Kraus, conservation director for the Everglades office of
the National Audubon Society, ``and the people living in the area
are victims of circumstance. We support the plan for buyout but we
know there's a human factor here and there ought to be fair
treatment, including relocation costs.''
</P>
<P>
   East Everglades neighbors say money does not begin to compensate
them for wiping out their homes and businesses, which started
developing in the 1950s. The area, an eclectic collection of small
farms, ranches and cement-block homes on plots of several acres,
oozes self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   There are no government services such as trash collection or
door-to-door mail delivery, and if a house should catch fire,
residents say, it would probably burn down before firefighters
could reach it on the pothole-filled dirt strips they call roads.
</P>
<P>
   But residents say all troubles are forgotten at the sight of an
Everglades sunset or with the feeling of independence that comes
with their isolation. Among the residents, most of Hispanic
descent, are breeders of birds, fish and snakes, growers of
tropical crops like mamey, papaya guava, and those who assert their
privacy with signs like, ``No Trespassing. Sniper on Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some fences also feature signs reading, ``This land and my
life are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses include Exposito's Soroa Orchids, whose motto, ``an
exquisite encounter with nature,'' is a promise he said he might
not be able to keep somewhere else. And neighbors include Berta and
Humberto Valdes, who built their 2,800-square-foot home in 1979 as
a haven to raise five sons and had planned to grow mamey trees to
support their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compensate 20 years of a lifetime,'' said Mrs.
Valdes, 48, a teacher. ``We did everything right to build our
family house, our retirement house. Our future retirement income is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Everglades, the community has become a casualty of
what Everglades preservationists call a monumental environmental
mistake _ ditching and draining that started in 1947 as a
flood-control project mandated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It resulted in the loss of about half of the Everglades' four
million acres to agricultural production and urban development and
allowed rural communities like East Everglades to spring up even
outside flood protection zones.
</P>
<P>
   The project by the Army Corps of Engineers spurred growth in
South Florida, which today encompasses the state's most populous
counties. But the project also disrupted the natural southward
water flow that nourished plants and animals in the protected
Everglades and fisheries in Florida Bay, endangering an ecosystem
unlike any other in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To try to undo the damage, federal and state officials announced
in October the comprehensive $8 billion plan, which is subject to
congressional approval. It calls for reconstructing the flood
control system and acquiring land to recapture through new
reservoirs and channels most of the fresh water that is now
channeled to the sea and to help restore the slow flow of water
that seeped across the Everglades for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For that, government officials say they need to retake more than
200,000 acres of mostly agricultural land and a few populated
tracts, prominent among them East Everglades. The buyout in East
Everglades was authorized under restoration efforts that preceded
the proposed new plan, said officials of the Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the humans' turn to pay. Except for a narrow coastal
strip and some higher areas, most of South Florida at one time
belonged to the Everglades, environmentalists say. But even today,
they note, local governments are allowing development in areas that
are needed for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development pressure is just enormous,'' said Alan Farago,
conservation chairman of the Sierra Club's Miami Group. ``The
Sierra Club considers urban sprawl the worst environmental problem
we have. We're dealing with an almost intractable local political
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many East Everglades residents and their supporters said that as
nature lovers they would understand the need to give the land back
to the Everglades in order to insure its health. But many refuse to
believe that their displacement is necessary to restore water flow
to the Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some note that the Army Corps of Engineers had proposed at one
time a less costly alternative _ building a levee around the area
to allow it to survive as more water was released into the park.
Richard Bonner, a deputy district engineer for the Army Corps in
Florida, said state officials had decided against that option for
fear that such protection would induce more population growth and
ultimately become more of a barrier to getting water to the park.
``Controlling growth is tough,'' Bonner said. ``It's hard to keep
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many neighbors are suspicious of the government's motives for
deciding to dislocate them, and some even accuse the water
management agency of manipulating levees and dikes to periodically
flood the area on purpose to get them out, an accusation that
agency officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is flooding them out,'' said John Neuharth, spokesman
for the water management agency. The South Florida Water Management
District had already been buying property from willing sellers in
recent years _ 16 parcels have been acquired _ as it grappled with
what to do about the area.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony over the current plan underscores the pain involved
in the displacement of hundreds of residents and doubts that any
sale price would ever make them whole again. Many East Everglades
homes were rebuilt or underwent major repairs after the area was
hit by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Among Cuban residents, there are
comparisons to the land confiscations they suffered under Cuba's
Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Neuharth said that the agency was getting many calls from
willing sellers. But many homeowners are also digging in their
heels. Ms. Valdes, who heads a loosely organized homeowners'
association, says most residents do not want to sell and are
consulting with lawyers. Some residents have closed their doors to
government appraisers making the rounds in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Hector and Georgina Beceiro, who moved into the area in 1975,
spending five years building their house on two and a half acres,
where they grow plantains and tangerines, say it will take a court
order to get them out. The ashes of her father, who once lived with
them, are scattered around the property according to his wishes,
the family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 67,'' said Beceiro, a retired salesman. ``Do you know what
it's like to have to start over at 67? Can the government pay me
for all the hours of work over 23 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Fortin, 48, a nurse, said she checked with state and
Miami-Dade County officials before she bought her home only four

MASSACHUSETTS WEIGHING ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF PATRIOTS MOVE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The day before Robert Kraft signed an agreement with
Connecticut to move the New England Patriots to Hartford, he met
with NFL brass in New York, and was assured that no other team
would replace the one leaving Foxborough, giving him exclusive
operating rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Kraft said publicly earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said Friday, his
office is investigating whether that promise violates state
antitrust and restraint-of-trade laws by unfairly stifling
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is researching the possibility of legal action
involving the announced relocation of the New England Patriots from
Massachusetts to Connecticut and the NFL's policies involving such
relocations,'' Harshbarger said at a press conference Friday. ``I
asked my staff to look into this matter, especially with regard to
the NFL's reported assurances to the Patriots owner that if the
team left the state the league would not allow another team to
relocate to Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a New England Patriots lawyer, the NFL, and even US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, who has filed a bill in Congress
to remove the threat of antitrust cases for the league, immediately
denounced any possible legal action by Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, the day Kraft signed the agreement with Connecticut
to move the team, he said he met with NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue in New York the day before and was told the league would
not try to block the move, nor would it put another franchise in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Such a promise would be unusual because the league generally
affords its franchises a 75-mile marketing radius. Boston, which is
99 miles from Hartford, would be considered a separate marketing
area. There are exceptions to those rules, however, and they are
subject to change by a vote of the NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Friday he is ``not aware of any
such conversation'' between Kraft and Tagliabue, ``and that is not
our policy.'' He also said the league does not have territorial
restrictions on franchises, citing the metropolitan New York area
where the Jets and Giants play in the same New Jersey stadium; and
California, where the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers play
across the bay from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any policy that would restrict another team
into going into Boston,'' Browne said. ``However, it would seem
that after nearly 40 years of different Patriots owners struggling
to get a stadium in Boston that it might be a stretch to think that
the city fathers would build one for an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' lawyer, Atty. Daniel Goldberg, said Harshbarger's
legal argument is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no basis to proceed,'' Goldberg said. ``I
think it's unfortunate that by issuing this press release he might
have created some false hope, and I think it's unfortunate that the
time, effort, and money that might be devoted to pursuing a legal
question were not devoted to moving the political process only a
matter of several months ago, to a point where the state might have
been able to keep the Patriots here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the conversation Tagliabue and Kraft reportedly had:
``What was said is that New England has a team,'' Goldberg
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Harshbarger's motives may be less than pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that, to some extent, they are designed as a
poke in the eye to the politicians who did not _ and it would be a
very long list _ do what was necessary to keep the Patriots in
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger shrugged off questions suggesting the legal threat
was a slap in the face to the man who defeated him in November's
gubernatorial race: Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did say that as attorney general, ``I feel I have
the responsibility to look at this matter and take some leadership.
But it's unfortunate it had to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said even if there were no other team waiting in the
wings to move here, the state should ``make sure this market is
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appeared caught off guard by Harshbarger's action,
first reported Friday in The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I really don't have a response,'' the governor said. ``I
think it's an uphill fight, let me put it that way. I'd have to
have my legal counsel take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, the man who will
replace Harshbarger on Jan. 20, said Harshbarger's office first
notified him Friday that he was looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be cautious until I saw legal theory that would justify
that kind of action,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anthony, who runs the Consumer Protection Division in
Harshbarger's office, said she thought a decision would be made
before he left office as to whether a suit had merits.
</P>
<P>
   Any breach of the antitrust law would be an unfair trade
practice, which would violate state consumer protection laws,
Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hatfield, an assistant district attorney in Missouri,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield was on the legal team that threatened the NFL with an
antitrust case when the league refused to let the Rams leave Los
Angeles for St. Louis, where a stadium had been built in hopes of
luring a team.
</P>
<P>
   The case never went to trial because within several months the
NFL _ worried about losing the suit and being held liable for
treble damages _ backed down, allowing the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots case ``sounds anti-competitive to me, too,''
Hatfield said. ``The NFL has a history of attempting to intimidate
communities into not pursuing these teams. And they have, at times,
backed down. They've lost cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan filed legislation last May that would remove the prospect
of antitrust liability for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the league needs three-fourths owners' approval to
allow a team to move,'' Meehan said. ``If a renegade owner
threatens suit, they back down on the antitrust case, out of fear
for treble damages.'' He said the bill would allow the league to
make decisions based on merits, not concern for being hit with huge
damages.

2 GRAND CHOICES ON MAJORCA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Majorca, the lush, mountainous island of Spain, is one of those
stunningly beautiful places that are best known for who slept
there. Its history always begins with a long list of occupiers _
Romans, Vandals, Christians, Moors, Spanish conquistadors,
Napoleonic generals.
</P>
<P>
   Majorca's modern reputation is also shaped by its celebrity
invaders. In 1838, George Sand and her lover, Frederic Chopin,
spent a winter there. (Miserably, as it turned out, but that had
more to do with their dimming romance than the sea breeze). The
English poet Robert Graves moved there in 1929, remained 50 years,
and is buried in the village of Deya.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1960s, however, Majorca became synonymous with
mass tourism, a balmy paradise despoiled by concrete forests of
high-rise hotels, tour buses and charter flights. Worried that
tourism there was being hurt by overdevelopment, the Spanish
government sought to restyle Majorca's reputation in the late 1980s
and 1990s by encouraging luxury hotels and villas and dynamiting
the more unsightly early efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Majorca's image has in fact changed, and once again a roster of
celebrities is associated with the island. The model Claudia
Schiffer recently finished a sprawling, private estate. In 1987,
Richard Branson, the English entrepreneur who created the Virgin
empire, bought La Residencia, a hotel in the town of Deya, on the
northwest coast, fashioned from a 17th-century manor house, which
now caters to business executives, the fashionable and even
royalty. (In the lobby, there is a framed, handwritten thank-you
note from the Princess of Wales, dated May 13, 1996, from
Kensington Palace, which begins, somewhat spookily, ``Safely back
in London. ...'').
</P>
<P>
   La Residencia's year-round success helped encourage another
tycoon, David Stein, an American, to convert the 17th-century
mansion he bought seven years ago, into a rival luxury retreat,
Gran Hotel Son Net, which opened in May in the little village of
Puigpunent, on the west side of the island.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the cement high-rises, not all luxury hotels in
Majorca are alike. Which is why my husband, Michael, and I found
ourselves burdened with the responsibility of trying both La
Residencia and Son Net over a single long weekend. Our assignment,
at the end of October, was to arrive incognito, and rigorously
check out the two hotels, everything from timing the help, testing
the pool temperatures and keeping on the alert for silver plate.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds easy, but luxury investigative reporting is actually
something of an art, requiring both the imperiousness of Lady
Bracknell and the small-minded snooping of a house detective in
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   No detail is too tiny. Designer soaps, for example, are usually
a better mirror of a hotel's soul than its bathroom mirrors. Son
Net, which is stately and elegant, offers Nina Ricci. La
Residencia, also elegant, is more playful. It provides Molton
Brown, the official soap of Cool Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, that first hint held up. Both are expensive,
beautifully decorated hotels with green lawns, riotous flower beds,
orange groves, gourmet restaurants and sybaritic swimming pools.
Son Net is arguably the grander. Though the location is rural
Majorca, the feeling is of an English manor house _ the cleaning
women wear long gray dresses and white ruffled aprons out of Jane
Eyre. Each room is lovely, and different, and all offer luxurious
bathrooms and huge canopy beds that look as if they were designed
for the Infanta of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The public rooms, which include a library and a dimly lighted
bar, are equally tasteful and attractive, the walls are covered in
paintings from Stein's personal collection, from Frank Stellas and
David Hockneys to a small Chagall lithograph in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The small touches, from fresh roses in the ladies room, antique
leather blotters on the writing desks, to lemons piled in glass
vases, were gratifying. Over all, however, the hushed, solemn
atmosphere, diminished by less than expert service, left us feeling
somewhat ill at ease.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we drove 2O minutes over narrow mountain roads to La
Residencia, we felt oddly exhilarated _ as if we had fled the
elegant home of stuffy older relatives in Bar Harbor, Maine, to
rejoin our own friends at their place on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Before segueing from one grand hotel to another, however, we
first had to get to Majorca. Like most people without yachts, we
flew in. We didn't need to read maps to realize that Majorca is
big, (10 times the size of Martha's Vineyard,) because its huge
white concrete international airport outside the capital of Palma
is so dauntingly vast that even the luggage carts are jumbo-sized.
</P>
<P>
   We were there in the off-season, and sighed with relief as we
passed rows of boarded-up charter tour booths, a sobering
intimation of how crowded the place becomes in the high season.
</P>
<P>
   We rented a car and rather easily bypassed Palma by taking La
Cintura, a highway that circles the city. We quickly found
ourselves on narrow, hilly roads surrounded by pine trees and olive
groves leading to Puigpunent. ``Son'' in Majorquin (a derivative of
Catalan), means ``the house off'' and we passed many Son-Something
villas before detecting the signs for Son Net), or Net's Place,
named for the original family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We made our way up a long, winding drive lined with palm trees
so short and squat they looked like pineapples, and pulled up
before a baronial stone building, thickly covered in ivy. ``It
looks like Vassar, with palm trees,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   The glass doors swooshed open, automatically and soundlessly,
and we found ourselves in a lobby of vaulted stone ceilings and
wooden beams overlooking a glassed-in courtyard that surrounds the
house's original well. At the desk, a smiling young woman proudly
informed us that our deluxe double had been upgraded to the royal
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Inwardly, we blanched, worried that our cover was blown. But,
feigning nonchalance, we accepted graciously and took a marble
elevator to the second floor, down corridors lined with eclectic
art, from 16th-century still lifes to an original Warhol portrait
of Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   The three-room suite turned out to be comfortably regal, opening
onto a small private dining room with a blue and white terra cotta
tile floor. That led into an equally charming sitting room, two
wide blue and white sofas facing each other, with thick art books
casually tossed on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom, which opens onto a vast stone terrace large enough
to entertain 15 people, was beyond regal. The four-poster blue and
white canopy bed was practically wide enough to accommodate all 15
mythical guests for a sleep-over. Instead of tile, tasteful beige
carpeting covered the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom, pinkish marble and pale blue pastel walls, seemed
designed for an insecure movie star. The lighting was softly
flattering and the full-length mirrors conveyed an almost
imperceptible lengthening effect. Closets are cedar, each drawer
lined with silky tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main requirements of a luxury hotel is a luxurious
bathroom, and even the humbler ones at Son Net amply fulfill it.
They all have separate showers with pounding water pressure,
bathtubs with Jacuzzi-style nozzles and plenty of Nina Ricci soaps,
creams and lotions. The well-stocked minibar offered two types of
Bollinger champagne, Cuvee Special and Grande Annee.
</P>
<P>
   Any fears we had that the hotel management was on to us
evaporated when we went down to dinner. We entered the vaulted
stone dining room, a converted olive oil cellar that still contains
the original olive press, and which is now an elegant restaurant,
Sa Tafona.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-empty room, we were instantly and expertly guided to a
small table in Siberia, squeezed between a view-blocking pillar and
the olive press. We waited, patiently, for 10 minutes before anyone
came over to bring a menu or offer us water. It took 25 minutes for
the waitress to take our order.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she started to write down an appetizer, then suddenly
bolted away to guide two arriving couples to their table. When she
returned, Michael rewarded her with an icy glare and a sharp rebuke
that made her almost double over in remorse.
</P>
<P>
   But the food, when it arrived, was remarkable. I had sipio, a
tiny variety of octopus, sauteed with duck foie gras, that was as
delicious as it was unusual. Michael's wrath disappeared as soon as
he tasted his salad with scampi and squid. I followed with a
succulent rack of lamb with a crust of Majorcan cheese and thyme
juice, while Michael savored a risotto of calasparra rice with
chicory, rock fish and truffle.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, we braved the uncertain service and ordered
desserts, croquettes of melted chocolate with almond ice cream for
me and croustillant of almonds with apple, saffron and lemon ice
cream for Michael. We chose at random a Spanish white wine, a 1997
Raimat chardonnay, that was excellent. The dinner took three hours,
but we both agreed that the food, prepared by a French chef,
Thierry Buffeteau, was astonishingly good.
</P>
<P>
   The next day began badly. We called down for cappuccinos, orange
juice, a fruit salad and an omelet to be brought to the terrace. I
was scolded by the man on the phone for failing to leave the
breakfast card on the door knob, which did not seem strictly
necessary in a 24-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, a maid arrived with an omelet, uncovered and
luke warm, and an apologetic shrug instead of bread (no butter or
jam, but then again, why would we need any). I asked her to set it
up on the terrace, and couldn't help noticing that she didn't pull
up chairs. We asked for more coffee, throwing the perhaps
inexperienced kitchen into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after another half-hour, and after Michael bellowed, a
waiter arrived with a pot of coffee but without the clean cups we
had requested. We were charged $36.39 for the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the morning light streaming in across the surrounding
mountains was an invitation to explore the grounds. The mansion,
set high on a hill overlooking the surrounding village and towns,
is terraced by fragrant lemon and orange groves. Its well-manicured
gardens are accented by fountains and bursting beds of pansies,
roses and peonies, even in late October.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the place is its infinity pool, an elegant
90-foot-long rectangle. On one side, green and white striped
chaises under striped umbrellas provide privacy while allowing a
discreet bit of people watching. The water, however, was unheated
and ice cold, so that the few who dove in, quickly scuttled out
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a clay tennis court, and offers to drive guests to
nearby golf courses and even the beach. The closest beaches,
however, are rocky coves 20 minutes away on narrow, winding roads,
and the hotel usually urges guests to go to the public beaches
around Palma, a 20-to-25-minute drive. It also offers bicycle tours
and massage, but the gym was not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   Our second stop, La Residencia, which is made up of two
connected buildings, which date back to the 16th century, is also
elegant, but it instantly conveys a more carefree mood. At the
reception desk, an open jeroboam of Spanish champagne sits in a
giant cooler to ease the stress of registration. The help races
around in casual polo shirts, sweat pants and sneakers, but they
are as poised as they are speedy.
</P>
<P>
   Our room wasn't ready, so we giddily raced to the terrace for a
poolside lunch, cheered by the sunlight, bougainvillea and glinting
wine buckets. We ate salads and drank a spanish rose, and promptly
took an investigative nap in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom was more prosaic here, with no full-length mirrors
and only one speed on the hair dryer, but more than adequate. There
was no minibar, but an abundant fruit basket stood on the coffee
table.
</P>
<P>
   All the rooms have the same basic luxuriant look of polished
wood and white on white _ terra cotta floors, white walls, beds and
couches. A teddy bear lay on the large white four-poster bed, a
perverse touch for a hotel that recently banned children under 10
except for summer holidays and Christmas. I woke up after the sun
had set, and found that I could swim in the heated kidney-shaped
pool by starlight.
</P>
<P>
   La Residencia, which has 46 single and double rooms, 15 junior
suites and 3 suites with private pools, has more of the textbook
hotel offerings than Son Net: a gift shop, a beauty salon with
every imaginable treatment, a small, but serviceable gym and a
casual restaurant for lunch or dinner. The hotel also offers
walking tours of Deya, group tennis lessons, and newcomers'
cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   I chose a solitary champagne cocktail in front of a pine-scented
fire in the library and felt blissfully alone in a hotel that was
fully booked. Like Son Net, La Residencia also has a well-known and
formal restaurant, El Olivo. We walked into what looked like a
forest fire: five-branch silver candelabra blazed from every table
and nook. The maitre d'hotel moved fast, seating us and snapping
his fingers to summon water, bread and unstinting attention.
</P>
<P>
   We started with a tower of salmon and scallops with caviar on a
potato pancake, and followed with leg of lamb. All the dishes,
prepared by a German chef, Joseph Sauerschell, were excellent, and
the white-glove service so deferential it almost veered into camp:
the wines were poured from ornate silver wine holders.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the free breakfast came speedily from room
service, with big pots of strong coffee, dozens of rolls, butter,
jam, toast and four-minute boiled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   I then checked out the beach, a 10-minute drive and a steep,
winding scramble down a cliff through olive grows and pine forests
to an isolated rocky cove. It was starkly romantic, but I found the
hotel pool more inviting for a swim. A quick walk through the the
ramshackle stone village of Deya revealed funky stores and charming
little cafes. But the number of cash machines on the narrow main
street also suggested that Deya could become unpleasantly crowded
in the high season.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as it works out its start-up kinks, Son Net would be the
place for those who take their luxury getaways very seriously. La
Residencia is for the lighter-hearted.

EX-UNION CHIEF SAYS VOTE-FIXING WAS RESPONSE TO FOES' FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former top official of the city's largest municipal
union has told investigators that he and other union executives
tampered with the 1996 ratification vote on the city labor contract
because they thought opponents of the pact were also committing
fraud, say lawyers and officials who have been briefed on the
investigation being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lubin, who resigned as the associate director of District
Council 37 last month after admitting that he knew about the
tampering, told investigators how union officials stuffed ballot
boxes with thousands of fraudulent votes after early returns
convinced them the contract would be rejected by city workers, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year contract, which included an unpopular wage freeze
in the first two years, was ultimately approved in February 1996,
although opponents immediately denounced the balloting as rigged.
People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors have not
found evidence of vote-tampering by opponents of the contract, as
Lubin alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin, who had been second in command at the union, is one of
the highest-ranking officials of the union to be interviewed by
investigators directing the inquiry into embezzlement and kickbacks
in the 120,000-member union. He is the third union official to tell
investigators about ballot tampering on the contract, which set the
pattern for ensuing settlements with other city unions. Those
unions, angered by the revelations of fraud, have demanded that the
mayor renegotiate their contracts, without success.
</P>
<P>
   The council's executive director, Stanley Hill, was forced to
take an unpaid leave of absence a week ago after the fraud was
revealed. The council is now being run by a representative of the
parent union. Lubin told investigators that Hill never knew about
the vote fraud scheme, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have told investigators that most of the fraudulent
ballots were cast in a local representing clerical workers, where
the official tally showed 10,002 votes for ratification and 2,265
against. The huge margin in that local cemented ratification of the
contract, which was approved 19,513 to 14,438.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said prosecutors were told by witnesses that Lubin and
others initially became concerned the ratification vote would fail
after steaming open several hundred completed mail ballots from
several locals and finding that most members were voting against
the contract. In response, the union leaders began a large-scale
effort to submit fraudulent ballots in the clerical workers union,
some in the names of workers who had not voted.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin told investigators that allies of Hill were particularly
concerned when, during the weeks of balloting, the hospital workers
union reported a huge vote against the contract, 4,402 to 34,
officials said. They said allies of Hill believed that tally may
have been rigged, and they decided to cast fraudulent ballots of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   James Butler, the leader of the hospital workers local, denied
any irregularities in the voting by his members. ``I had no reason
to fix anything,'' he said. ``My members were mad as hell. They
didn't have job security and they were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, after Lubin and his assistant, Mark Shaplo, admitted
knowing of the vote fraud, District Council 37's parent union, the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, took
control of the council, forcing Hill to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Lubin's lawyer, Pamela Hayes, a former
prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney's office, accompanied
her client to his meeting with investigators. Ms. Hayes would not
comment on whether her client had been interviewed. ``I can't tell
you if he said anything, for obvious reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayes said that Lubin, 57, was upset that he had had to
resign his union post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unfortunate,'' she said, ``because aside from this
particular instance, he has not been involved in any kickbacks or
anything like that. He's a decent guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Lubin said they thought he acted out of concern
for Hill, since rejection of the pact would have been a personal
embarrassment and a setback in his relationship with Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani. They called his role in the fraud limited, and said he
had been asked by others to go to the district council's offices on
a Saturday, when he marked some ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not the mastermind,'' said one associate.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin has not been charged with any crime. Tampering with
ballots could result in charges of falsifying business records.

MASSACHUSETTS WEIGHING ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF PATRIOTS MOVE

<P>
   BOSTON _ The day before Robert Kraft signed an agreement with
Connecticut to move the New England Patriots to Hartford, he met
with NFL brass in New York, and was assured that no other team
would replace the one leaving Foxborough, giving him exclusive
operating rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Kraft said publicly earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said Friday, his
office is investigating whether that promise violates state
antitrust and restraint-of-trade laws by unfairly stifling
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is researching the possibility of legal action
involving the announced relocation of the New England Patriots from
Massachusetts to Connecticut and the NFL's policies involving such
relocations,'' Harshbarger said at a press conference Friday. ``I
asked my staff to look into this matter, especially with regard to
the NFL's reported assurances to the Patriots owner that if the
team left the state the league would not allow another team to
relocate to Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a New England Patriots lawyer, the NFL, and even US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, who has filed a bill in Congress
to remove the threat of antitrust cases for the league, immediately
denounced any possible legal action by Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, the day Kraft signed the agreement with Connecticut
to move the team, he said he met with NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue in New York the day before and was told the league would
not try to block the move, nor would it put another franchise in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Such a promise would be unusual because the league generally
affords its franchises a 75-mile marketing radius. Boston, which is
99 miles from Hartford, would be considered a separate marketing
area. There are exceptions to those rules, however, and they are
subject to change by a vote of the NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Friday he is ``not aware of any
such conversation'' between Kraft and Tagliabue, ``and that is not
our policy.'' He also said the league does not have territorial
restrictions on franchises, citing the metropolitan New York area
where the Jets and Giants play in the same New Jersey stadium; and
California, where the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers play
across the bay from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any policy that would restrict another team
into going into Boston,'' Browne said. ``However, it would seem
that after nearly 40 years of different Patriots owners struggling
to get a stadium in Boston that it might be a stretch to think that
the city fathers would build one for an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' lawyer, Atty. Daniel Goldberg, said Harshbarger's
legal argument is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no basis to proceed,'' Goldberg said. ``I
think it's unfortunate that by issuing this press release he might
have created some false hope, and I think it's unfortunate that the
time, effort, and money that might be devoted to pursuing a legal
question were not devoted to moving the political process only a
matter of several months ago, to a point where the state might have
been able to keep the Patriots here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the conversation Tagliabue and Kraft reportedly had:
``What was said is that New England has a team,'' Goldberg
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Harshbarger's motives may be less than pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that, to some extent, they are designed as a
poke in the eye to the politicians who did not _ and it would be a
very long list _ do what was necessary to keep the Patriots in
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger shrugged off questions suggesting the legal threat
was a slap in the face to the man who defeated him in November's
gubernatorial race: Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did say that as attorney general, ``I feel I have
the responsibility to look at this matter and take some leadership.
But it's unfortunate it had to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said even if there were no other team waiting in the
wings to move here, the state should ``make sure this market is
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appeared caught off guard by Harshbarger's action,
first reported Friday in The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I really don't have a response,'' the governor said. ``I
think it's an uphill fight, let me put it that way. I'd have to
have my legal counsel take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, the man who will
replace Harshbarger on Jan. 20, said Harshbarger's office first
notified him Friday that he was looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be cautious until I saw legal theory that would justify
that kind of action,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anthony, who runs the Consumer Protection Division in
Harshbarger's office, said she thought a decision would be made
before he left office as to whether a suit had merits.
</P>
<P>
   Any breach of the antitrust law would be an unfair trade
practice, which would violate state consumer protection laws,
Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hatfield, an assistant district attorney in Missouri,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield was on the legal team that threatened the NFL with an
antitrust case when the league refused to let the Rams leave Los
Angeles for St. Louis, where a stadium had been built in hopes of
luring a team.
</P>
<P>
   The case never went to trial because within several months the
NFL _ worried about losing the suit and being held liable for
treble damages _ backed down, allowing the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots case ``sounds anti-competitive to me, too,''
Hatfield said. ``The NFL has a history of attempting to intimidate
communities into not pursuing these teams. And they have, at times,
backed down. They've lost cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan filed legislation last May that would remove the prospect
of antitrust liability for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the league needs three-fourths owners' approval to
allow a team to move,'' Meehan said. ``If a renegade owner
threatens suit, they back down on the antitrust case, out of fear
for treble damages.'' He said the bill would allow the league to
make decisions based on merits, not concern for being hit with huge
damages.

 &HT;    Fur no longer an endangered species in fashion
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not so long ago, when fashion folks spoke of ``the fur
flying,'' they were referring to the battle between mink coat
manufacturers and the anti-fur activists led by People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the fur industry is to be believed, the anti-fur
movement has PETA'd out and the only fur flying is off the retail
floor.
</P>
<P>
   During their recent trunk show at the Phipps Plaza Saks Fifth
Avenue , husband-and-wife mink merchants Andre and Lisa Bisang
seemed to have shaken off all the residue from the past decade in
which their industry was shackled with the label, ``Politically
Incorrect.'' They said, with confidence, that their segment of the
apparel market has never been more competitive. And statistics
provided by the Fur Information Council of America support their
faith in fur's future.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, according to the council, the number of major
designers who showed fur in their fall/winter collections increased
fivefold: from 42 to more than 200. Citing ``three primary factors:
the economy, weather and fashion,'' council statistics showed fur
sales in the United States increasing slowly and steadily from
$1.20 billion in 1990 to $1.27 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss-born Andre Bisang grew up in the industry, but he
graciously fielded fur-related questions from the point of view of
someone who can't easily distinguish ``faux fur'' from real.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you explain fur's fashion resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   A: It started with the couture. And when fur came back to
ready-to-wear _ as an accessory, or just as an addition to garments
_ that really brought fur back to the streets and the magazines.
Fashion is almost unthinkable without fur anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advances have taken place in fur manufacture in terms of
colors and textures?
</P>
<P>
   A: Color has never been more important that it is now. We dye
almost all furs in all the current fashion colors. Furs really dye
very well; sometimes they even look better when they're dyed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you noticed how people are less bashful about wearing
anything but fur-lined coats?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very warm to have fur on the inside, and during the
period when it maybe was not so correct to wear fur, people wore
their fur on the inside. But this has turned into an attitude of,
``Why should I hide my fur? I have a beautiful fur. I want
everybody to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you design differently depending on the type of fur you
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chinchilla is the more fancy fur. It's not for everyday. It's
more dramatic, more glamorous. Mink is more of an everyday fur. We
do a lot more with mink; dyeing it, shearing it, plucking it. We do
all kinds of things to make (mink) look different and fancy and
fun. Chinchilla we leave as is, except for maybe dyeing it in
fashion colors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How should a woman select her first fur coat?
</P>
<P>
   A: When it comes to buying her first fur coat, I think she
should buy a mink. Sheared or longhaired, dark or light, mink is
really the fur she'll probably get the most use out of.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to PETA and the anti-fur movement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Their energy died out. The press is not interested in them
anymore. They don't make news anymore, and when they do they make
bad news. And I don't think they get the financial support anymore.
People realize that we have a lot more serious issues to worry
about and devote our energy to than being against fur. Being
against fur doesn't really help anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the fur industry expanding, or is it controlled by a
select few companies such as yours?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you look at the list of designers who are using fur,
it's at least tripled over the last three years . . . a very short
period of time. I think there are 180 designers using fur now. They
start with a little trim here, some more trim there, a lining, then
an accessory piece. . . . You look to Paris and see fur handbags,
fur shoes, fur everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where in the U.S. are you most likely to see women wearing
furs?
</P>
<P>
   A: It used to be that Chicago was by far No. 1, then came New
York and so on. But now, since everybody's traveling and everybody
wants beautiful furs again, it doesn't matter where you live. We do
better in Florida than we do in New York. It's not where you live,
it's your lifestyle that matters.

 &HT;    A fall from grace, in postmodern style
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, a man named Alan Sokal lured the emperor into the
public square and, by speaking in a mysterious tongue, goaded him
into removing every stitch of clothing he had on. He stood there
buck naked, the whole world laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It's still laughing, and the emperor wonders why.
</P>
<P>
   Sokal is a physicist at New York University. Politically, he
places himself left of center. But you can be left of center
without going completely over the edge. It amused Sokal to see
postmodern literary critics masquerading as people who knew
something of science. No one likes impostors, and Sokal set out to
expose them. He submitted to the cultural studies journal Social
Text an article arguing that quantum gravitational theory and
postmodernist philosophy were a perfect fit. He titled it
``Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative
Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.'' Albert Einstein meets Jacques
Derrida, you could say.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's editors thought Sokal's piece profound, and it
appeared in the spring/summer issue of Social Text. Alas, on the
very day the issue came out, Sokal announced it as a hoax _ a
parody of the gibberish that passes for scholarship in the
humanities these days.
</P>
<P>
   Delicious malice in `Fashionable Nonsense'
</P>
<P>
   To say that the journal's editors had egg on their face doesn't
say enough. The entire culture that has grown up around
postmodernism, particularly in the humanities departments of
American universities, was dripping with yolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the genre it is meant to satirize,'' Sokal wrote in a
subsequent, nonparodic piece that the journal's editors rejected
(it didn't meet their rigorous standards), ``my article is a
melange of truths, half-truths, quarter-truths, falsehoods, non
sequiturs, and syntactically correct sentences that have no meaning
whatsoever (Sadly, there are only a handful of the latter; I tried
hard to produce them, but I found that, save for rare bursts of
inspiration, I just didn't have the knack.).''
</P>
<P>
   Writing like a modern literary critic is harder than people
think _ imagine yourself a cow standing on its hind legs and doing
the jig. Sokal is too modest; he brought it off with real panache.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Jean Bricmont, a physicist at the Universite de
Louvain in Belgium, he has reprised the ludicrous affair in
``Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of
Science'' (Picador, $23),
</P>
<P>
   setting forth more fully his complaints with pseudo-scholarship.
In an appendix, he includes the parody that has made him a kind of
Salman Rushdie of postmodernism.
</P>
<P>
   Delicious malice, but why should it matter? It matters because _
in diluted form _ this is the intellectual climate in which
American college students are being educated. The first principle
of postmodernism is that there can be no objective truth and no
hierarchy of value. One consequence is that literature has become a
part of ``cultural studies,'' with no book or author better than
another. They are merely ``different.'' Or, as Professor Houston
Baker of the University of Pennsylvania felicitously put it a few
years ago, ``It's no different from choosing between a hoagy and a
pizza.'' And then, between bites: ``I am dedicated to the day when
we have a disappearance of those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be doing cartwheels. The standards are out the window.
Sokal proved that.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile ground in Duke department
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Sokal who made fools of these pretenders. They've
made fools of themselves, appropriating words and ideas from
sciences they scarcely understand and bankrupting what intellectual
integrity they can still claim. Theorists such as Derrida, Michel
Foucault and Jacques Lacan had become departmental pinup boys,
fawned over like rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was it more hilarious than at Duke University, where the
English department became a hothouse for the newest French
fashions. For one brief shining moment, Duke was the place for
literary theory. The brightest star in the firmament was Fredric
Jameson, a comparative literature professor and Marxist critic. Red
Fred found that the more impenetrably you write, the more disciples
you attract. He has droves of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Duke that the inanities Alan Sokal parodied took
deepest root. The ground had been well fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two Saturdays ago, The New York Times reported on the
front page that Duke's once-celebrated English department had been
placed under what amounts to academic receivership, supervised by
the dean of the botany department. The gentleman may not be up on
his Derrida, but he is described as an authority on plant
respiration. The university has done what any of us would do. When
the yard's been taken over by weeds, you call in a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   It could have saved itself the trouble by spraying the first
shoots that appeared, but it cultivated them instead. It thought
they were flowers.
</P>

 &HT;    Savvy buyers look into glasses
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eyeglasses often make it on the list of holiday purchases _ not
as presents, but as a way for patients to squeeze out the last
dollars of their yearly health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As more employees participate in medical flexible spending
accounts _ a pool of tax-free funds they can use for health-related
expenses _ some discover they did not use as much money throughout
the year as they'd anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And that means they must find ways to spend it by the end of the
year, or lose it _ one of the few conditions of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an upswing in business as individuals search for ways
to use their spending accounts,'' said Dr. Peter Gordon, an
ophthalmologist with Eye Physicians and Surgeons. ``Sometimes, they
just buy the frames and wait to buy the lens.''
</P>
<P>
   Others might take the money to buy prescription sunglasses or an
extra pair to have in case they lose their contact lenses, said
Joanne Chambers, manager of Winn Way Opticians.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, patients can expect to spend at least $300 for an eye
exam and a pair of moderately priced glasses. A complete eye exam
by an ophthalmologist should cost from $80 to $100, according to
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no family history of eye disease, patients can have
an exam every year or two, he said. If there is history of problems
_ such as glaucoma _ patients should be examined annually.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that many health plans will pay for the exam,
he said, leaving patients only the price of the glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have a variety of glasses to pick from, depending on
their vision needs and their aesthetic desires:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Basic frames cost between $80 and $160.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Single plastic lens, with a scratch coating and a ultraviolet
filter, range between $150 and $200.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bifocal lenses cost between $200 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Progressive lenses, bifocals with no telltale lines, cost
between $250 and $300.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, progressive lenses are the hot item among baby
boomers. Although they are more expensive, ``everybody wants to
look younger,'' Gordon said. Typically, customers will agree to
progressive lenses, unless they have had a steady, bifocal
prescription for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said the progressive lenses are nice, but ``you don't
want to be cheap on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 50 brands,'' she said. ``But you need to
pick a good one, so you have less distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Cherniak Jr., spokesman for Aetna-US Healthcare, said
eyeglasses account for a significant number of flexible spending
claims, ``especially among people whose health plans do not offer
vision coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the insurer doesn't see the paperwork for the
purchases by the end of the year. Instead, the insurer's busiest
time is in February and March, when employees file all the needed
paperwork before the cutoff dates employers have set for
reimbursing their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeglasses aren't the only vision wear customers seek at the end
of the year. Many patients also buy contact lenses or inquire about
corrective laser surgery for far or nearsightedness, which costs
about $2,300 per eye.

 &HT;    Garden proves to be gourmet fare for wild creatures
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE _ It all started with the azalea. I had bought one
of those dwarfs that bloom red around June. Newly propagated when I
got it, the little shrub didn't have much of a root system. So I
left it in its container, nursing it through the summer and
planting it in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   By September, the plant had developed a full head of buds, which
I envisioned bursting into flower next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some other creature saw the buds as a meal; I learned this
one morning when I saw that the azalea's head had been sheared as
if by machine, cutting the plant in half, down to a 3-inch nub.
</P>
<P>
   That was in late October. Since then, I've made similar gruesome
discoveries throughout the garden. Some animal or animals _ and
I've yet to catch any in the act _ are feasting their way through
my hard-built space. As Lyn put it, ``Your garden is like a gourmet
restaurant with a view. The creatures probably stand on the hill
and tell their buds to come on in.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. Just as I was enjoying gardening in a place where
squirrels were not a problem, I get set upon by a hungrier menace.
For years, squirrels in Atlanta have unearthed small, new
plantings, occasionally chomping off pansy blooms. But, in the
mountains, I'd seen only a few squirrels cavorting in the woods,
none hanging around the garden. Rabbits are another story; I've
seen a lot of them, brown and wiry, bouncing along with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   And, at night, I've heard something that sounded much larger
turning over a metal garbage can. Possum? Coon? Bear? Is one of
them the hungry visitor? I don't think so. Could it be deer? (One
friend says he plants ``some for the deer, some for me.'') Or the
rabbit that hopped to within 10 feet before scampering away
guiltily when he saw Lyn and me sitting on rocks near the creek?
</P>
<P>
   The culprits remain a mystery, but the evidence grows.
</P>
<P>
   After the azalea, I noticed several horsetail stems cut to two
joints above ground. As time went on, more and more went down,
until nothing was left of the clump but stumps.
</P>
<P>
   With colder weather and scarcer greenery on trees and shrubs in
the woods, the feeding intensified. Pansies, of course, had their
smiling faces bitten off as soon as my back was turned. Purple
coneflower, surprising in its persistence, met its match as several
flowers got chopped off and left to rot.
</P>
<P>
   Whacked in half in rapid succession: a baby burning bush, a
4-foot butterfly weed, and a little pine with the misfortune of
having a tender top.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the favorite grazing plant was the dwarf mondo. I had
planted a new patch of it, which was spreading nicely, putting out
much new green. The other day, all of some two dozen clumps had
been chewed down to their roots. Strangely, the black mondo grows
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, new plantings of prickly pear were chomped and
even pulled out of the ground _ obviously by some mad eater
tolerant of pain.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is understandable that wild creatures feast on
these plants, many of which amount to exotic ``gourmet'' dishes
compared to what they get in the wild. Thus, the losses amount to
the price we pay for our need to mark the land with plants from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping the damage isn't permanent. Meanwhile, the mystery
continues, with rabbits and deer my prime suspects. But, knowing
their cunning history, I also keep my eyes on the squirrels.

 &HT;    Multifaceted character's life defies simple storybook portrayal,
some Bible scholars contend
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a larger-than-life figure whose biography is the stuff of
one of the best-selling books of all time, whose figure is famous
in Renaissance art, and whose image as a liberator is invoked in an
anthem of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   He's Moses, a k a ``The Prince of Egypt.'' That's the title of
an animated depiction of his life scheduled for release Dec. 18 by
DreamWorks, the studio founded by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute feature, nicknamed ``Zion King,'' stars the voice
of Val Kilmer in the Charlton Heston role of ``Ten Commandments''
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excellent. It is superb,'' says Rabbi Levi Meier, 52,
chaplain of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and one the
religious leaders invited to preview the film for theological
correctness. Meier's new book, ``Moses _ The Prince, the Prophet,''
is one of several new volumes on Moses timed to capitalize on the
DreamWorks film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to create a lot of interest internationally about
the figure of Moses and how he takes people out of hardships
despite obstacles and impediments,'' Meier says. ``It's like we
need a Moses right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Bible scholars predict that, although the film may
provide child-friendly entertainment, it is unlikely to portray
fully the complex character of the man or myth whose story takes up
more of the Hebrew Bible than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a visually beautiful work, but it's the Sunday school
version of Moses,'' says Jonathan Kirsch, 48, book columnist for
the Los Angeles Times and author of ``Moses _ A Life.'' ``It's a
bland, highly simplified version of Moses just as the ones we get
in children's books and other stories. But that's not the Moses in
the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch, a Conservative Jew, says he does not fault DreamWorks
for eliminating the more troubling portions of the life of Moses.
``After all, priests, rabbis and ministers have been doing it for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   From storybook pictures in primary colors, little children learn
about the baby whose mother fashioned a basket for him and floated
him down the river to save him from certain death. They see him,
staff in hand, beside a burning bush. They color pictures of the
Red Sea miraculously parting for his people to cross. They probably
don't hear that Moses ordered the murder of 3,000 apostate
Israelites who chose to worship a golden calf, or that he issued a
command to kill the women and children of the Midianites, the
people of a country where he once lived and where he met his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bible, the story of Moses is scattered through Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It is a remarkable tale of a
man whose relationship with God, or Yahweh, was so intimate that it
changed his very countenance, forcing him to wear a veil in the
presence of mere mortals. Although there are apparent
contradictions (three different names for his father-in-law, for
instance), Moses' resume as outlined in the Bible goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   He was born more than 3,000 years ago in the heyday of the
Egyptian empire to Amram and Jochebed, an Israelite couple of the
tribe of Levi. He had a sister, Miriam, and a brother, Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pharaoh _ possibly Ramses II _ had ordered that all
newborn Hebrew boys be thrown into the Nile River, Jochebed made a
little basket for her baby, coated it with pitch, and set him
adrift. A daughter of the Pharaoh who had come to the river to
bathe found the baby, named him Moses and took him to raise.
Miriam, who was watching, offered her mother as a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Moses grew up in the midst of royalty _ as a prince of Egypt,
but as an adult he identified with the Israelites and killed an
Egyptian for beating a Hebrew slave. When word of his action got
out, he fled to Midian where he married a woman named Zipporah,
with whom he had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer.
</P>
<P>
   While Moses was tending the fields of his father-in-law, the
Bible says, Moses saw a bush burning but not being consumed. Once
he had gotten Moses' attention, God told him to go back to Egypt
and lead his people out of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of plagues, Pharaoh let the Hebrews go. The Red
Sea parted for them to cross, then flowed back to drown the
pursuing Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 years of traveling through the wilderness, when the
Hebrews were hungry, God sustained them with manna and quails, and
when they were thirsty, he made water flow from rocks. To establish
a framework for their society, he gave Moses the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   At times when the Israelites whined and backslid, Moses
intervened on their behalf with God. At other times, he became
furious with them himself. When they made an image of a calf to
worship, he ground up the idol, put it in water and made the
Israelites drink it, then ordered many of them slaughtered. And
when the Israelites killed all the Midianite men, Moses ordered
them to go back and kill the women, too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his efforts, Moses himself was not permitted by God
to enter the Promised Land. He died at 120 years old outside
Canaan.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Kirsch sums up the figure of Moses this way:
``Moses is the most haunted and haunting figure in all of the
bible. To be sure, he is often portrayed as strong, sure and
heroic, but he is also timid and tortured with self-doubt at key
moments in his life. He is a shepherd, mild and meek, but he is
also a ruthless warrior who is capable of blood-shaking acts of
violence, a gentle teacher who is also a magician and a
wonderworker, a lawgiver whose code of justice is merciful except
when it comes to purging and punishing those who disagree with him,
an emancipator who rules his people with unforgiving authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The amplification of the biblical events of Moses life
chronicled in the midrash, a series of rabbinical commentaries
explaining biblical texts, adds even more layers to the
many-faceted Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann of Decatur's(Ga.)
Columbia Theological Seminary makes a distinction between what he
calls the ``historical Moses'' and the ``theological Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is we know almost nothing about the
historical Moses,'' says Brueggemann. ``A great deal more can be
said about the theological Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   The theological Moses, says Brueggemann, is ``the quintessential
character of faith because, on the one hand, he trusts God
completely and, on the other hand, he has this enormous chutzpah in
the face of God. There is nothing docile about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brueggemann talks in terms of two ``trajectories'' of the story
of Moses and the Israelites. One is liberation, as exemplified in
the spiritual ``Go Down, Moses'' sung by anti-segregation
protestors. The other is the obedience God expected when he handed
down laws to Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people get free of the sovreignty of pharoah, which is
oppressive, and come under the sovreignty of Yahweh,'' said
Brueggemann. ``It's very important that when you have the
liberation from Egypt, that Israel is not free simply to go off and
be free, but that Israel is liberated precisely for obedience to
Yahweh and Yahweh's commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   Each event in the story of Moses signifies something about God
and God's people, according to Brueggemann. The fate of the baby in
the basket shows God's hand at work through the women involved in
the incident and the helplessness of pharoah to counteract the will
of God. The burning bush illustrates how God's interventions
disrupt the status quo. The parting of the Red Sea shows that God
can use the forces of land and sea to bring about necessary
political liberation. And the imperfect Israelites and their leader
show that God's acts are not meted out only on behalf of those who
are somehow qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Moses's death outside Canaan is a metaphor for Israel,
Brueggemann says. ``Moses is the true definer of Israel. Israel is
characteristically a people that does not have land, but hopes for
land. It is theologically important that Moses's great enactment of
faith is an enactment of hoping but not having.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch says modern day readers can learn from Moses. ``I think
it's very refreshing to know that Moses was willing to get in God's
face and take him on,'' he said. ``I think that suggests that we
have much more freedom in the relationship between human beings and
God than is often suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   And Meier ends his books with ``central lessons'' that include:
Don't perceive yourself as a victim. Face your challenges. And,
have an ongoing dialogue with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in our own Egypt,'' he said. ``The question is how
we get out.''

 &HT;    From a Christmas fiasco, designer Christopher Radko builds an
empire _ one ornament at a time
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He's been called the Saint Nick of the '90s, the czar
of Christmas present _ the man responsible for restoring the magic
of nostalgia to a commercially corrupt holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 years, New York designer Christopher Radko has created
more than 3,000 glass ornaments that are scarfed up annually by
millions, including more than 30,000 official collectors. Elton
John's tree is trimmed with them. So are Barbra Streisand's, Whoopi
Goldberg's, Katharine Hepburn's and Arnold Schwarzenegger's.
</P>
<P>
   And in Atlanta, John Marcum's Christmas tree is laden with more
than 1,000 of the hand-painted ornaments, inspired by holiday
folklore, children's stories, nostalgic Santas and whimsical
characters. ``Once you start collecting them and like the look, you
want to see a tree full of them,'' said Marcum, 39. ``It's that Old
World beauty that makes you want to cover a tree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailing for $12 to $200 each (the average cost is $36), Radkos
are riding the wave of a huge revival in blown glass ornaments.
It's a voyage that's taken the former mailroom clerk for a New York
talent agency from a lunch-hour enterprise to a merchandising
conglomerate with $50 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   And to think it all started when the 37-year-old ruined
Christmas for his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Radko said, recalling the tragedy that's
become legendary among his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, it was his job to clean the Christmas tree stand for
his family in Scarsdale, N.Y. In 1983, Radko, then 22, decided it
was time to replace the rusted contraption with a new red and green
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the day after we put up the tree, one of the legs cracked
and the tree buckled and fell over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: The 14-footer crashed _ shattering more than half of
the 2,000 mouth-blown European ornaments his family had collected
for generations _ many from his great-grandmother's day. ``In a
sense, our tree was like a family diary, because everyone had
memories associated with their favorite ornament,'' Radko said.
``So when it crashed, we lost a connection with our heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone blamed me, and I felt really awful. So I realized I
had to make good and bring Christmas back to our family.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, though, the only ornaments Radko could find in
this country were ones made from plastic or Styrofoam _``ones
without any heart and soul,'' he said. To add to his frustration,
while visiting relatives in Poland, he discovered the workshops
that once produced the beautifully crafted ornaments had closed
decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem, Radko sketched some traditional designs
that hadn't been used since before World War II _ Victorian
icicles, umbrellas, balls, finials _ and hired a glass blower to
create several dozen ornaments from them.
</P>
<P>
   They never made it on the family tree. Friends bought them all.
After a second trip to Europe and more designs, he was bought out
again. Radko began showing his designs to Manhattan department
stores, and within a year sold $25,000 worth. By his second year,
he rang up $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,000 employees craft his designs in cottage
factories in Poland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. Each
ornament _ some made from antique molds Radko found in his travels
_ takes seven days to produce. ``There's one woman who does nothing
but paint on eyelashes,'' Radko said.
</P>
<P>
   The ornaments are sold in Radko showrooms throughout the
country, including one in Atlanta, and more than 3,000 retailers,
such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Radko attributes their appeal to one thing _ nostalgia. ``The
memories of past Christmases are held in glass ornaments,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The more popular Radko's work becomes, the greater the demand
grows for his earliest ornaments. (One, ``Partridge in a Pear
Tree,'' which originally sold for $38, recently fetched $1,000 on
the collector's market.) Their value is enhanced because every year
Radko retires one-fourth of his designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people started saying things like, `What happened to the
Santa with the purple hat?' I realized they were tracking what I
did year after year,'' Radko said.
</P>
<P>
   So several years ago he formed the Starlight Family of
Collectors. For $50 annual dues, members receive a list of dealers
and a magazine. Marcum, the Atlantan with 1,000 Radkos, is featured
in the current issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought I'd buy a few a year, but it sort of
snowballed that first year as Christmas approached,'' Marcum said.
``By then, I had a respectable treeful.''
</P>
<P>
   What Marcum admires most about the ornaments, made from stronger
Pyrex as opposed to scrap glass, is the craftsmanship. ``When you
touch the glass you immediately know the difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also realizes his investment is a far cry from the $10 he
used to balk at paying for a Hallmark ornament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get very pricey,'' said John Veazey, another collector.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sid Stafford have collected more than 500 ornaments for
their tree. But the Loring Heights residents don't buy every design
just because it's a Radko _ only the ones they like.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, storage can be a problem. So far, they've removed all
shelves from their hall and bedroom closets to make room for the
boxes. ``Next, they'll go under the bed,'' Veazey said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Stafford also collect Radko's Halloween and Thanksgiving
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween and Thanksgiving? In recent years, Radko expanded his
merchandise to include decorations for other holidays, including
Valentine's Day, Easter and July Fourth. Yet, he scoffs at
criticism that he's overextending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motto is too much of a good thing can be wonderful,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Radko's also quick to point out his work with charities. This
year, he donated a tree, valued at $50,000, to the Egleston
Children's Hospital Festival of Trees, which opens today at the
Georgia World Congress Center. (He appears in the festival's parade
at 10:30 a.m..) And for the past six years, he's raised more than
$1 million by designing ornaments sold to benefit a variety of
causes including AIDS _ a disease that took the life of one of his
sales representatives last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me to realize the spirit of Christmas is something
that transcends the holiday itself and can be shared with people
year round if we just open our hearts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the drawing board, Radko, who lives alone (``I'm still
taking resumes'') in Westchester County, decorates his own tree
with ornaments from next year's collection. He also trims one with
bird, fruit and vegetable ornaments for his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's back in the family's good graces. Just don't ask him
to clean the tree stand.

 &HT;    The shock value of Van Sant's `Psycho' experiment
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peculiar, new, shot-by-shot remake of ``Psycho'' is a good
demonstration of Norman Bates' hobby: taxidermy. It's a respectful
simulacrum, slavishly faithful to Alfred Hitchcock's storyboards
and camera movements. But despite the red stuff now splashing the
formerly black-and-white shower scene, the movie often feels
bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gus Van Sant has said he wanted to remake the 1960 film
for the same reason purists howled against the idea: because it was
a classic. His rationale is that pop songs are always being covered
by different artists.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference, though: A singer brings a new
interpretation, a different voice, an altered musical arrangement.
The only significant changes in ``Psycho'' are its skillful cast
and the color stock. Since the shots are the same, and Bernard
Herrmann's brilliant, skittery score still infuses the movie with
spidery dread, it's weird to see Van Sant's name appear in the
opening credits. The prime pleasure of the movie is the way it
reminds you of how remarkable the original was _ the way it
completely reversed audience expectations halfway through, and of
course the astonishing angles and camera movements Hitchcock chose.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but enough about Hitch. Does the remake work or not?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, absolutely. And no, of course not.
</P>
<P>
   It's suspended in a weird time warp between the repressed,
Freud-obsessed end of the '50s, and our own funky, fluid-swapping
'90s. Marion Crane (Anne Heche) and her colleagues in her Phoenix
office wear '60s-flavored clothes (including Rita Wilson in the
receptionist role originally played by Hitchcock's daughter Pat).
But, while keeping most of it verbatim, original screenwriter
Joseph Stefano tweaks his script with more contemporary references.
</P>
<P>
   The change means Marion's sister Lila (Julianne Moore) can say,
``Let me get my Walkman.'' But in the next scene, the sheriff's
wife has a switchboard operator patch a call through to the Bates
Motel in old-fashioned style.
</P>
<P>
   In the remake, the sexuality simmering beneath the original's
surface is front and center, starting with the sound of loud
lovemaking in the motel room next door to Marion and her boyfriend
Sam (Viggo Mortensen), who walks around nude. And purists, beware:
Norman (Vince Vaughn) masturbates while he spies on Marion.
</P>
<P>
   These updates don't hurt, but Van Sant never seems to decide if
his movie is unfolding in the moral landscape of the '60s or the
present. What keeps you watching is the pleasant tension of
familiar scenes, shots and lines replayed by the new actors; it's
like an odd waking dream. Of the cast members, only Moore and
Vaughn really make the roles their own. She gives Lila a tough,
compelling edge that's a far cry from Vera Miles' shrill original.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn is the best thing about the movie. Making Norman's
sexuality palpable, he also gives an endearingly goofy,
giggle-filled performance. He makes this particular monster all too
believable as a guy you might meet on a long road trip. And he puts
his own mark on famous lines (``a boy's best friend is his
mother,'' etc.) without veering into camp.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant generally follows Hitchcock's blueprint with great
self-effacement. That makes it even more shocking when he throws in
personal imprints at exactly the wrong moments. In the shower
scene, he inserts shots of swirling clouds (a fave image of his
``My Own Private Idaho''). Worse, in the staircase stabbing, he
throws in a wacko shot of a masked woman, and what appears to be a
windshield view of a large animal crossing a road.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these nearly resemble ``Monty Python''-style visual
non sequiturs, these additions take us out of the scene, exactly
when the horror of what's happening should make us feel trapped.
Van Sant also slows down the fruit-cellar revelation of Norman's
mother, depriving it of its shock.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' is lovingly made and highly watchable. That's
not exactly the same thing as being good. It's an interesting
experiment with one big problem: It doesn't know what it's
intending to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche and Julianne Moore. Directed
by Gus Van Sant. Rated R for violence and sexuality/nudity. 1 hour,
38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Slavishly faithful to Hitchcock's original shots
and storyboards, this remake is bloodless.

SYMBOLS CAST SHADOWS ON CLINTON GAZA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to recast lede, make editing changes throughout. No

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So does President Clinton arrive in the Palestinian
lands on his big 747, or on a little helicopter? Does he balance
his visit to the Gaza Strip with one to Masada, the Alamo of
Israel? And would he then balance that with a quick look at
Bethlehem? (After all, it's Christmastime.)
</P>
<P>
   If the problems of the Middle East are about land and blood, the
diplomacy is often about language and symbolism. In the case of
Clinton's trip to Israel and the Palestinian Authority, beginning
next weekend, it is also about airplanes and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is making the trip to promote the three-stage agreement
reached in October at Wye, Md., that was meant to propel the
Israelis and Palestinians toward a substantial peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But a strong undercurrent was never settled: whether the
Palestinians will declare statehood on May 4, 1999. The Oslo peace
process formally ends then, and a settlement on time is very
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The statehood issue has now broken into the open in earnest,
complicating the Clinton trip.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, struggling to keep his
government together over the Wye agreement, was taken aback by the
warm reception given last week to Yasser Arafat in Washington. Not
only was Arafat showered with money at an international donors'
conference; he was treated indulgently when he spoke frankly about
his intention to declare Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinian officials have done the same at the United
Nations and elsewhere, which the Israelis regard as a violation of
the Oslo accords and of promises at Wye not to take unilateral
steps that would foreclose negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Netanyahu has halted further steps to carry out the
very agreement that Clinton is going to Israel to celebrate,
causing the Americans to criticize the Israeli for setting ``new
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli Cabinet statement said the Palestinian Authority
needs to commit itself ``unequivocally to abandoning its intention
to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state'' and ``to conducting
continuous negotiations with Israel until an agreement is
concluded'' before Israel can carry out the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have done little to criticize Arafat or
his officials, other than to say things like ``unilateral steps are
not helpful'' and ``Palestinian statehood must be addressed in the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have refused to say what they will do or say if
Arafat does declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   One senior American official said Friday: ``There's a difference
between saying you're going to declare statehood and actually doing
it. There's a lot of posturing on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is clearly bothering Netanyahu is that Clinton's visit
will provide powerful new symbolism of a new American-Palestinian
relationship, including the arrival of the American president at a
new Palestinian airport that was opened in Gaza with great fanfare
as a result of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's chief spokesman, David Bar-Illan, has now formally
asked Clinton not to arrive in Gaza in his big baby-blue Boeing
747, with its huge seal of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Friday that they are likely to heed the
request, but on the grounds of pragmatism. The trip from Tel Aviv
to Gaza City is short, like flying from Washington to Baltimore,
and ``chances are we wouldn't use a 747 but a helicopter,'' one
official said. To use the larger plane, the official said, would
also require ``bringing in a lot more people to upgrade the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when the Israelis suggested a presidential visit to
Masada, a heroic scene of Jewish military sacrifice in Biblical
times, to balance the Gaza visit, the Americans agreed. But now
Clinton is contemplating another stop in Palestinian lands, at
Bethlehem, further upsetting the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement set a three-month timetable under which Israel
would withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in return
for specific, phased steps by the Palestinians to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be followed immediately by intensive
negotiations on a final settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians, which would resolve fundamental questions like
whether the Palestinians will have a state, and if so, what kind,
and the future of Jerusalem. Under the original Oslo timetable,
that final settlement was supposed to be complete by May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the final talks have not begun.
</P>
<P>
   One quiet procedural meeting between Israeli and Palestinian
officials, with no Americans present, has been followed by nothing
at all. Israeli and American officials concede that with all the
furor over carrying out the Wye agreement, there has been little
energy to focus on the final talks, which are the best answer to
Arafat's claims.
</P>
<P>
   After all, one American official said sardonically, ``May is
months away.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, American officials are worrying about the few days of
the Clinton visit and what exactly will be celebrated in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   At Wye, Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinian National Council
formally revoke all the clauses in their charter calling for
Israel's destruction was handled with an Israeli-originated
compromise. Arafat would gather a quorum of the council, surround
them with lots of less radical Palestinians and confirm the
revocation of the old charter in some form of mass vote, by hand or
voice.
</P>
<P>
   But since then the Israelis have called for something more
formal, and an American official said, ``We want to make sure that
what happens in Gaza meets the Israeli needs.'' At the same time,
however, the Americans are nervous that Netanyahu will continue
changing his requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Yoel Marcus, writing Friday in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
described Netanyahu as being ``in a panic'' to consolidate his
political position, broaden his government and act tough ``while
the Palestinian state is being established right under his nose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu, said Marcus, ``will not be able to halt the
hurricane known as Clinton's visit and the American recognition of
a Palestinian state that it implies.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials insist the visit implies no such thing. Yet
the symbolism argues otherwise, Marcus suggested.

STATE PANEL MAY DISAPPOINT POLICE ON PAY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, the police union here has pushed a
proposal that would allow it to take its contract disputes to a
state panel, where union leaders hope to win large raises for city
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   While Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has warned of dire consequences if
the proposal becomes law, labor experts say it may not prove as
lucrative as union leaders hope, or quite as ruinous as the mayor
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature passed the proposal this week, and union
leaders believe that Gov. George Pataki may finally sign it into
law this time, after vetoing a similar proposal in the past.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police officers have long complained that they
earn far less money than their suburban counterparts, lagging
police officers on Long Island by more than $10,000 a year in
salary, for instance. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the
union representing the city's 29,000 officers, hopes that having
the state panel settle contract disputes will give New York
officers salaries comparable to those in the state's other police
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has long maintained that giving the state the power to
award raises to police officers could bankrupt the city by starting
a chain reaction in which the city's other municipal unions would
call for similar raises in the name of parity. A 1 percent raise
for police officers would cost the city about $15 million a year,
one mayoral aide said, but a 1 percent raise across the board would
cost it $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill passed the State Legislature in 1996, only to be
undone by a stunning series of reversals of fortune. First, Pataki
vetoed the bill, and then the state Legislature took the rare step
of overriding the veto. But the law was struck down after the
Giuliani administration challenged its constitutionality and won in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki kept his intentions to himself Friday, saying that he
would not comment on whether he would sign the bill until he had
seen it. Privately, mayoral aides said they were concerned that the
governor would sign it. Publicly, Giuliani put pressure on the
governor to veto the bill, saying, ``It violates every principle
that he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing the bill could erode the cordial relations that the two
men have enjoyed in recent years, which culminated in the mayor's
endorsement of Pataki in the governor's recent re-election
campaign. And it could resonate in the future. As both men weigh
their ambitions for higher office, they are trying to consolidate
their reputations as fiscal conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But some labor experts and union leaders said that even if the
bill became law, it might not help police officers as much as some
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state law, most police departments that cannot
agree on a contract can go before the state panel, the Public
Employment Relations Board, for arbitration. New York City, whose
police union must go before the city's Officer of Collective
Bargaining to settle impasses, is one of five local jurisdictions
with its own panel. In 1997, the city's panel ruled that the police
union had to accept a contract without raises for the first two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would give the police union _ and the unions
in the other four jurisdictions _ the option of going before the
state panel, which can consider the salaries of other police
departments in the state when making its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would caution people that this does not mean that they will
be making salaries comparable with Nassau and Suffolk right away,''
said Lou Matarazzo, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association. ``But it would be unlikely that we would get double
zeroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is wide disparity among police departments around
the state, even among departments that can bring impasse talks to
the state panel. Suburban departments, which benefit from healthy
tax bases, tend to pay their officers more. Urban departments,
often struggling with dwindling tax bases and higher expenditures
for social services, pay far less.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, for instance, the starting salary for new police
officers in 1997 was $28,334 a year, according to statistics
provided by the United States Department of Justice. In
Schenectady, it was $28,433 and in Buffalo, $31,792. Suburban
departments paid more: Suffolk County had a $40,404 staring salary,
Nassau County $30,336 and Rockland County $35,915.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in New York City, by comparison, had a starting
salary of $27,838, despite the city's entrance requirements, which
are more rigorous than many departments'. They include two years of
college or military experience.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Collins, a professor at New York University who serves on
the board of the city's Office of Collective Bargaining, said that
there was no guarantee that arbitrators chosen by the state panel
would award higher salaries than arbitrators chose by the city's
panel. In fact, he noted, both panels use many of the same
arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   When arbitrating a contract dispute, the state panel can weigh
the salaries and working conditions of police officers in
comparable communities. But, by law, the panel must also consider
``the financial ability of the public employer to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the police union is counting on the state panel to
win better contracts. Matarazzo noted that securing this
legislation had consumed most of his efforts for the last three
years. The union endorsed Pataki and donated more than $160,000 to
state candidates and committees in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my crowning glory,'' said Matarazzo, who is
leaving the union presidency this year.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S DUTY IN THE PINOCHET CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been dodgy about its commitment
to unseal diplomatic and intelligence documents that may directly
connect Gen. Augusto Pinochet to crimes committed during his
17-year dictatorship over Chile. Washington must make public as
much of this information as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is in Britain, appealing extradition to Spain on
charges of torture and international terrorism. Information that
may bear on these charges is in the archives of the White House,
the State, Defense and Justice departments, U.S. intelligence
agencies and the Ford and Carter presidential libraries. U.S.
involvement with the Pinochet dictatorship was close, and
Washington kept detailed records.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before Pinochet seized power, the Nixon
administration openly encouraged a coup against Chile's elected
Socialist president, Salvador Allende, and assisted in
destabilizing the Allende government with economic pressures. After
the coup, in 1973, Washington embraced Pinochet as an
anti-Communist ally and muffled criticism of his government's
murderous repression.
</P>
<P>
   But later the United States became more outspoken, especially
after the Justice Department established that the assassination of
a prominent Chilean exile and a U.S. citizen in the streets of
Washington had been ordered and planned by high Chilean officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not been forthcoming in providing
documents in its possession on abusive practices of foreign
governments it has supported. It has moved at a glacial pace in
declassifying material requested by Honduras and Guatemala. In the
case of Pinochet, it should move with alacrity and not hide behind
technicalities. The United States can best make amends for its past
mistakes and help Chile overcome the traumas of that era by
disclosing all it knows about the crimes of the Pinochet
dictatorship.

CLINTON LAWYERS SEEKING 3 DAYS FOR HIS DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to recast lede and for editing changes throughout. No
pickup.)  (th) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House Judiciary Committee just a week away
from a scheduled vote on articles of impeachment against President
Clinton, the White House challenged the panel's inquiry Friday
night by requesting several days to present a defense that would
slow the committee's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the committee's invitation to appear next Tuesday,
the president's lawyers sought to broaden the impeachment inquiry
while raising doubts in the public mind about the proceedings'
fairness and scope. They asked for three or four days to call
witnesses and raise questions about the legal and constitutional
basis for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening passage of a letter sent to the Judiciary
Committee on Friday evening, the two top White House lawyers
dealing with impeachment, Charles Ruff and Gregory Craig, said the
stakes were extraordinarily high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a declaration of war,'' they wrote, ``there is no
more significant or grave constitutional process than the
impeachment inquiry currently under way in your committee. Should
the House of Representatives approve an article of impeachment
against the president and send it to the Senate for trial, the
impact on the national government and on the American people as a
whole would be profound. For that reason alone, this process must
be deliberate, thorough, fair and expeditious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the Judiciary
Committee, did not immediately respond to the White House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the White House letter signaled an effort to present
a vigorous defense of the president against accusations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power raised by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel. Many in the White House assume that the
politically polarized committee will vote along party lines to
approve at least one article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The counterarguments the White House hopes to present next week
appear aimed at moderate Republicans who are still trying to decide
whether to vote for impeachment on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision that we want to go up and demonstrate
that these proceedings have not been fair,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary. ``None of the allegations that have
been made rise to the standard of impeachment. It's that simple.
This is not a bank shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied that the White House proposal was a delaying
tactic. He said the committee could still vote on articles of
impeachment by the end of next week if the president's lawyers were
allowed four days to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House letter echoes complaints that Clinton's
partisans have raised throughout the process. They maintain that
the committee's Republican majority has conducted a partisan
inquiry that has not provided Clinton an adequate opportunity to
defend himself against the charges raised in Starr's referral.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee rapidly approaching a vote on impeachment,
the White House clearly wants to slow the process and raise issues
it says have been given short shrift in the panel's accelerated
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it wanted to present three panels of
witnesses over three to four days to discuss what constitutes an
impeachable offense, the standards for prosecution of the acts that
Starr has attributed to the president, and prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is essential to the president's defense that we be
able to call our own witnesses and present our own arguments to
address these important questions,'' Clinton's lawyers wrote to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed a daylong seminar on each of those
questions but did not disclose any list of witnesses it intended to
call to make its case. The president's lawyers said they would
present a summation of Clinton's defense at the end of the panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has contended all along that Clinton's
misleading statements under oath about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky do not constitute perjury, and therefore do not justify
impeachment. The president has steadfastly denied tampering with
witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice, and has also said that
nothing he did constituted abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the letter to the Judiciary
Committee reflected ``enormous frustration in this building'' with
what this official called the headlong pace and one-sided nature of
the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its defense, the White House wants to use the
hearings next week to showcase once again what it calls Starr's
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr appeared before the committee two weeks ago,
Clinton's lead private lawyer, David Kendall, grilled him for more
than an hour on what Kendall contended were leaks from the
independent counsel's office, intimidation of witnesses, selective
presentation of testimony and deceptive investigative techniques.
Kendall did not raise a single point in defense of the president's
actions, however.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says Kendall was not given enough time to defend
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of one hour of time provided to us for
questioning Mr. Starr at the end of his appearance before the
committee,'' the letter Friday evening read, the White House has
been ``foreclosed from playing any role'' in the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate,'' the letter concluded, ``that we will require
no more than three to four days of the committee's time to deal
with the topics identified above, at which time counsel for the
president will present a final argument as to why, given the law,
the facts and these circumstances, this committee should not report
out articles of impeachment to the full membership of the House of
Representatives.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Renada Daniel-Patterson's relationship with her
father began when she was 13 years old and he called from prison,
offering her his kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Renada, born with only one kidney _ an unhealthy one _ had been
on dialysis three times a week for seven years, unable to go to
school, stay with friends or dream too far in the future. David
Patterson, serving time at California State Prison in Sacramento
for burglary, had abandoned Renada when she was a baby. ``He called
out of the blue,'' recalls Vicki Daniel, Renada's mother. But when
he turned out to be a compatible donor, all was forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Renada lived as a healthy girl for the first time
in her life. Often, she even skipped her medicine. Then her kidney
_ her father's kidney _ began to fail.
</P>
<P>
   She needs a new kidney again. Her father, who is 38 and due to
remain in prison for three more years, wants to give his daughter
the one kidney he has left.
</P>
<P>
   When Renada's nephrologist at the University of California San
Francisco/Stanford Health Care Medical Center balked, citing the
Hippocratic oath that requires doctors to ``first, do no harm,''
Renada's mother protested and pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   After the family met with doctors and hospital administrators,
Renada's case was referred to the university's bioethics committee,
which is now confronting an unprecedented situation. Does it agree
to save the life of a 16-year-old girl knowing that it is also
sentencing her father to a painful life of medical treatment, with
his existence constantly threatened? And how should the fact that
he is a prisoner, who would be taxing the system with dialysis
treatment costing $40,000 a year, factor into a decision?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wade Smith, chairman of the university medical center's
bioethics committee, said that the committee would have to consider
the rules of organ donation. ``There is a question,'' he said, ``of
whether this procedure would be violating the surgeon by harming
the donor.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ethics committee weighed its decision Friday, Mrs.
Daniel, with Renada in a hospital bed, and several ministers
supporting the family, held a news conference in the medical center
lobby. She urged the public to flood the hospital's telephones,
both with offers of kidneys and, especially, with words of support
for the transplant Renada's father has offered.
</P>
<P>
   With 3,100 patients on a waiting list for a kidney in northern
California, and the average wait three and a half years, Mrs.
Daniel said that Renada should not have to wait when doctors cannot
say for sure how dire her condition is and the family has a willing
donor in Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled that the ethics committee would even consider
entering this,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as Renada, flanked by an adopted
younger sister and a friend, wept in her bed. ``This is a family
issue. We want the world to know that this man is giving himself to
his daughter. We're demanding that the State of California honor
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethics scholars seem divided over just what the ethical
implications of Patterson's offer are. Hank Greeley, chairman of
the steering committee of Stanford University's Center for
Biomedical Ethics, said that a father, in most situations, should
be allowed to make a sacrifice for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous, but I can't see any good, strong reason
to prevent this parental sacrifice,'' he said. ``Parents make all
sorts of sacrifices for their children and we don't normally see
that as unethical, even in the extreme cases when the parent gives
his life for a child. In fact, we normally see it as
praiseworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's offer poses an ethical problem in part because he is
in prison, Greeley said. ``Would there be a question if he could
pay for this himself?'' he said. ``Should the health care system
participate?'' And, ``Does it somehow taint or pollute the health
care system that it's participating in this self-sacrificing act?''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania and author of ``Am I My Brother's
Keeper? The Ethical Frontiers of Biomedicine,'' addressed the issue
bluntly: ``You don't ever want to kill a person to say you saved
another life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a live kidney transplant where someone has
gone from one to none,'' Caplan said, adding that the life of a
person on dialysis may be severely threatened. because 10 percent
of patients do not do well with the treatment. ``There's no
guarantee he could do dialysis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan was also concerned about giving another kidney to a
patient who was not diligent in taking her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only using the second kidney, but using it in a situation
where someone has gone off their medicine, who has shown themself
noncompliant, would be a gross violation of medical ethics,'' he
said. Finally, he said, letting Patterson donate his kidney would
contradict why he is in jail: to be punished. Prisoners, he said,
should not be allowed to donate organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't use prisoners as donors. One of the aspects
of punishment is a prisoner's restrictions on certain things,
including voting, running for office and donating an organ.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a question of whether Renada's body would even accept
another kidney from her father. Even though she was a compatible
recipient before, when she did not take the medicine required to
make the transplant successful _ it bloated her face, distended her
stomach, made her feel ill and hunched her back _ her body may have
decided that her father was no longer an acceptable donor. ``I
think that the fact that a person rejected an organ is germane to
the issue of receiving an organ from the same donor again,'' said
Dr. Nancy Ascher, a professor of surgery at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center. ``Whether the organ was
rejected because the medication wasn't taken, the body may have
decided that this organ is incompatible and will be so again,'' she
said. ``The person would probably have to be retested.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patterson first offered to donate his kidney to Renada, he
went through months of complicated negotiations between prison and
hospital officials and the family. That issue would most likely
arise again, since Patterson would still be in the prison system as
a dialysis patient. His original sentence of seven years was
increased by five years when he was found with heroin less than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfield, a spokesman for the California State Prison at
Sacramento, said Patterson has already spoken to doctors at the
prison and that he understands the medical implications of his
decision. The state, by law, would pay for his dialysis, which
would cost an estimated $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking with David, his heart seems to be in the right
place,'' he said. ``With respect to his daughter, I guess I can
speak for most fathers when I say I would have done the same for my
daughter. To go from a parent where you have no relationship with
your daughter to one where you're giving her your kidney is a
pretty amazing turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Patterson donated his kidney to Renada, the two have been
in constant contact, Mrs. Daniel said. They've been writing and
calling each other, and Renada has visited him. ``She loves her
father,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as Renada, in her bed, covered her face
and cried. ``But I know she wants his kidney, too.''

AUTOMAKER TO PAY ESTATE OF BOY KILLED BY AIR BAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury in Manhattan ordered DaimlerChrysler
on Friday to pay $750,000 to the estate of a 5-year-old Bronx boy
who was killed when an air bag deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been widely watched because it was the first trial
of a lawsuit involving a child's death from an air bag, lawyers and
industry critics said.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching its verdict, the jury concluded that the air bag in
the front passenger seat of the family's 1995 Dodge Caravan was
unreasonably dangerous and had caused the death of Michael Liz
Crespo, whose father was driving down a steep driveway while the
family was vacationing in Puerto Rico. The minivan was traveling 9
miles an hour when the air bag inflated.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's official award was $1.5 million. But because the boy
was not wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident, the jury
held the manufacturer, DaimlerChrysler, liable for only half that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   The award was to compensate for the minute of pain and suffering
the family's lawyers said that he experienced when the air bag
fired and struck him in the chin and neck, damaging his spinal cord
and causing suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler denounced the verdict Friday, contending that its air
bags, which are set to fire at impacts of 8 mph or more, are
designed to meet the strictest of safety standards required by law
and recommended by outside safety experts.
</P>
<P>
   Its lawyers asserted that the death could have been avoided had
the boy been wearing a seat belt, as the company advises in warning
labels placed in all of its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have obeyed the law,'' said Kenneth Gluckman, assistant
general counsel of DaimlerChrysler. ``We've met the regulations. We
have designed this properly. There's not a hint of a dispute that
the air bag didn't function as intended.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaching its verdict, Gluckman said, the jury had in effect
concluded that ``every air bag in the country is defective''
because the rest of the industry uses the same system.
</P>
<P>
   He said the jurors appeared to have ``let their emotions cloud
their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan took five days to
reach its verdict and to award damages for the boy's suffering.
Earlier, Judge Jed Rakoff had dismissed other claims by the family,
including one for punitive damages and another that asserted that
Chrysler had failed to give drivers adequate warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler said it would ask Rakoff to reverse or reduce the
verdict, while a lawyer for the family, Gary Douglas, said he would
appeal the dismissal of the other claims by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The director and general counsel of Parents for Safer Air Bags,
Robert Sanders, said the verdict was particularly important because
the victim was not belted in, which ``is the biggest defense the
automakers always throw up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, said
the verdict would also demonstrate to other plaintiff lawyers that
such a suit ``is a winnable case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other suits over children's deaths from air bags have been
settled out of court for undisclosed amounts, and still others have
been dismissed by judges before trial, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and government safety experts have generally argued
that air bags and seat belts are intended to function together, and
that if drivers and adult passengers are wearing belts, then with
few exceptions the bags are a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But for children who are not big enough to wear lap-shoulder
belts, they say, the bags can be a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which studies crash
data and conducts its own crash tests, said Friday that by Nov. 1,
73 passengers had been killed by air bags in low-speed crashes,
including 53 children between the ages of 1 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   Of those children, 43 were unbelted, and six were wearing only
the lap portion of a lap-shoulder belt.
</P>
<P>
   Only four children who were properly belted were killed,
according to the institute, which is based in Arlington, Va.

 &HT;    Flawless Endeavor takeoff makes up for delays
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla._ Nancy Currie and her five crewmates
began chasing down a Russian spacecraft Friday after an
early-morning launch that lit up the Atlantic coastline here.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour shook off weather worries and Thursday's scrubbed
countdown to lift off in the middle of a brief launch window while
its quarry, the Zarya space station module, sailed over the launch
site in its 240-mile-high orbit. Endeavour will slowly catch up
with the module to connect it with its own payload, the Unity
connecting node now stowed in Endeavour's payload bay.
</P>
<P>
   The orbital chase is the first step in an assembly process that
will span more than five years to create the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   Currie is a 1977 Troy High School graduate, and at least one
faculty member was in Florida to watch her lift off on her third
and most challenging space mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely amazing. Everything happened so quickly and
then it was gone,'' said Carl Tompkins, who received an invitation
from Currie to watch the launch from a NASA viewing area about five
miles from the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   A chemistry teacher who has won three teaching grants from the
Troy school district under an incentive program named for Currie,
Tomkins was impressed because of his science background.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got that much (more than 535,000 gallons) of
liquid oxygen and liquid oxygen (in the shuttle's external tank,)
you're basically sitting on a bomb,'' he said. ``The force pushing
the shuttle skyward must be incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   At liftoff, Endeavour's three main engines and two solid rocket
boosters were putting out about 7 million pounds of thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Launch managers said Friday's countdown and launch were nearly
flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countdown went extremely well, especially when you account
for having to turn the vehicle around in 24 hours,'' launch
director Ralph Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Endeavour's three auxiliary power units had to be shut
down when it overheated, but launch integration manager Donald
McMonagle said engineers believe the power unit's cooling system
simply iced up. He said it should clear up by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got effectively a perfect vehicle in orbit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The on-time launch ended more than a year of delays for the
mission, which was originally scheduled for December 1997. Most
delays were caused by other schedule problems in the space station
program, but Thursday's scrub resulted from a false cockpit alarm
that halted the countdown just long enough for the shuttle to run
out of launch time.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya, Russian for ``sunrise,'' will provide propulsion and
power during the initial phases of space station construction.
Unity is a connecting node for future modules.
</P>
<P>
   Once the units are connected, members of Endeavour's crew will
be able to enter them without spacesuits, but nobody will remain
aboard it when Endeavour leaves near the end of the mission.
However, Endeavour crewmember Sergei Krikalev, a Russian cosmonaut,
is scheduled to return to the station in January 2000 as part of
the first three-person crew to live on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Climate Orbiter: 1:56 p.m. Thursday, Boeing Delta 2 rocket,
Cape Canaveral. Scheduled to begin orbiting Mars in September.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Polar Lander: 3:21 p.m., Jan. 3, Delta 2 rocket, Cape
Canaveral. Scheduled to land near Mars' south pole on Dec. 3, 1999.
Payload includes two microprobes that are to smash into the Martian
surface, testing new technologies and searching for traces of
subsurface ice. Key events of mission
</P>
<P>
   While Endeavour slowly closes in on the orbiting Zarya module,
former Troy resident Nancy Currie will be busy today preparing the
orbiter's main payload _ the Unity connecting node _ for docking.
Three spacewalks and work inside the mated units are scheduled as
first orbital International Space Station assembly work. Here are
approximate times for key events coming up on the nearly 12-day
mission:
</P>
<P>
   Later today: Currie uses Endeavour's robot arm to lift Unity
from its berth and install it on the orbiter's docking system.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: Endeavour closes to within several feet of Zarya. Currie
grapples the module with the shuttle arm about 7:45 p.m.
Endeavour's jets are fired about 8:15 p.m. to dock the two units.
</P>
<P>
   Monday-Tuesday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m., first spacewalk to make
connections and mount equipment on the space station. Currie uses
the robot arm to position astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: 4 to 11 p.m., second spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: 2 to 6:30 p.m., crew members enter space station
modules and check out systems.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: 4:30 to 10:30 p.m., third spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 13: 2:30 p.m., Endeavour undocks from space station.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15: 10:56 p.m., Endeavour lands at Kennedy Space Center.

MOTHER QUERIED IN DEATH OF CHILD SHE REPORTED ABDUCTED IN SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ Homicide detectives were questioning a Brooklyn woman
and her boyfriend Friday in the death of the woman's 20-month-old
daughter, whose body was found in Gravesend Bay shortly after she
reported the toddler kidnapped, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was withheld by police, reported her
child's disappearance to officers around 8:30 a.m. Friday after
screaming about the toddler's abduction as she stood near the F
train subway station on 9th Street and Fourth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, 20, told them that her child, Victoria Maria
Santiago, had been ripped from her arms by a heavy-set Hispanic man
as she walked up the steps to reach a Manhattan-bound F train at
the Park Slope station, police said. They added that she described
the man as being 5-feet-6-inches tall, weighing more than 200
pounds, and wearing a black and white checkered shirt and new Nike
tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Officers immediately rushed to the next stop on the line at
Ninth Street and Smith Street in Red Hook to search for a suspect,
whom they expected to be carrying a toddler in a pink dress and
shiny white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But as they scoured the area, the woman's account began to vary,
as did her boyfriend's, said law enforcement officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officers at the 68th Precinct began to ask about other possible
explanations for the child's disappearance, and detectives searched
other sites, this time along Gravesend Bay, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:55 a.m., a detective called the precinct with a grisly
discovery. Out past a pier off of Bay 44th Street, a young child
lay near the shore, its feet poking out of a black garbage bag.
Next to the body, a baby carriage bobbed in the receding tide
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
believed the woman killed her child at the couple's Bay Ridge
apartment Wednesday afternoon, slapping and shaking the girl after
becoming angered.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believed the child remained in the apartment
until Thursday night, and that the couple then wrapped her diapered
corpse in a trash bag, placed it in a stroller and walked it to the
end of the pier before dumping it into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   No charges had been filed as of Friday night, and police said
they are still investigating the death.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the woman, who came to Brooklyn from
Texas only a few months ago, has no history of arrests or record
with the city's Administration for Children's Services. They added
that her Brooklyn-born boyfriend, who is not the child's father, is
on probation, though they were not certain for what sort of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors in couple's building said they knew little about the
recent arrivals, who paid $30 a night for a small room there. But
most agree with the building's superintendent, Pablo Huazhco, that
nothing had seemed amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stayed home and took care of the baby while he worked,''
said Huazhco, as he stood outside the four-story brick apartment
complex. ``They were nice people and she was nice to the baby. Of
course, all of this has come as a surprise.''

YANKEES TAKE A LOOK AT TRADING FOR CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner likes Roger Clemens, likes his
grit, likes the way he tries to intimidate hitters. Steinbrenner
acknowledges that the addition of the five-time Cy Young Award
winner would improve his team's pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But liking Roger Clemens and being willing to trade for and pay
Clemens are entirely separate issues. Unless Steinbrenner decides
to push his club's payroll in the vicinity of $90 million, logic
suggests the Yankees will not seriously pursue Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, at the All-Star Cafe on Friday for the formal
introduction of the re-signed free agent Bernie Williams, said the
team would examine the feasibility of dealing for Clemens in the
days to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might have been in a better position to trade for
and pay Clemens had they not felt compelled to sign Williams to a
seven-year, $87.5 million contract last week. Steinbrenner said
Friday that Williams turned down a greater offer to return to the
Yankees; in fact, Williams apparently rejected two more substantial
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams told others that the Boston Red Sox dangled a
seven-year contract that would have been worth a guaranteed $91.5
million, and according to a major league baseball official, the
owners' labor relations office informed the Yankees that the
Arizona Diamondbacks offered Williams an eight-year, $100 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston and Arizona offers each would have established a new
contractual benchmark, surpassing the seven-year, $91 million deal
the Mets gave Mike Piazza on Oct. 26. However, the Diamondbacks'
offer included a significant portion of deferred money, which would
have driven down the real value of the contract to less than what
the Yankees and the Red Sox were offering. Nonetheless, Williams
said Friday that in the last hours before he reached an agreement,
the possible ramifications of leaving the Yankees hit him rather
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``a lot of reasons'' why he re-signed with the
Yankees, he said. ``One of the most important was just being here
and being with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens apparently is feeling no such remorse about departing
Toronto, for he has formally asked the Blue Jays for a trade, and
Gord Ash, the Blue Jays general manager, has indicated he would
like to facilitate Clemens' wishes in the next week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, went 20-6 for the Blue Jays last season, leading
the American League in earned run average (2.65) for the second
consecutive year; there is no question he would help the Yankees.
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, told reporters Friday
that he believes he has more assets from which to form a trade than
any team in the majors _ depth on the major league roster, from
pitchers Andy Pettitte and Ramiro Mendoza to infielder Homer Bush,
and depth in the minors, including the infielders Mike Lowell and
Alfonso Soriano. A package of Pettitte, Bush and Soriano very well
could be enough to get Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens has the ability to control these trade talks like a
puppeteer. On one hand, he is forcing a trade, and the other hand,
when the Blue Jays trade Clemens, the rules of the Basic Agreement
will provide Clemens the opportunity to demand a trade from his
next team _ and this essentially will allow Clemens to renegotiate
his salary of $5.5 million in 1999 and $6.35 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: The Yankees could trade Pettitte, Bush and
Soriano for Clemens, but then Clemens could force them to give him
a contract in line with other top free agents, such as Randy
Johnson ($13.3 million per year). An executive for another team
interested in Clemens called this ``a double-whammy. First you have
to trade players for him, and then Roger will want to be paid like
a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman was presented these questions of logic:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees didn't deal for Johnson before the July 31 trade
deadline and never placed a bid on him as a free agent last month
because they didn't feel they could afford both Johnson and
Williams. Now that they have spent more than they expected on
Williams, why would they now trade players for Clemens and pay him
as much as they paid Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Yankees wanted a high-priced pitcher, why wouldn't they
pursue the free agent Kevin Brown, rather than surrender three
players for Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   Cashman nodded, smiling slightly. ``St. Thomas Aquinas
reasoning'' Cashman said, would suggest those are legitimate
questions. ``We're going to sit down and talk about some of these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman placed a call to Ash last night, but on the face of it,
it appears that unless Steinbrenner becomes personally invested in
the acquisition of Clemens, the Yankees won't become involved.
Executives with other teams believe the Houston Astros will
eventually develop into the front-runner for Clemens' services,
offering a package of outfielders Carl Everett and Derek Bell, and
pitcher Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, sporting a goatee that would not be allowed if the
season were in progress, laughed when asked if the addition of
Clemens would help the Yankees. ``I wouldn't have to face him,''
Williams said. During the post-season, the Yankees' center fielder
referred somewhat bitterly about past negotiations with the team.
But having gained perspective on how teams negotiate, Williams
seemed more at peace with the process, and unfazed by the Yankees'
courtship of Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are established, they have a lot of tradition, and
as an organization, they are just huge,'' he said. ``As long I keep
playing the game as I have been playing the past eight years, I'm
not going to have any problem with them, and that's one thing I've
got to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre encouraged Yankee officials to consider Belle,
assuring them he could deal with Belle if Williams could not be
re-signed. Williams indicated he understood Torre's role in this,
and says he ``can't see why'' it would have any bearing on their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great manager, a great guy, I love him to death,''
Williams said. ``He's a great person, he's helped me a lot _ not
only a lot in the professional level, but on the personal level,
and I've got a lot to thank Joe for.''

 &HT;    Willie Nelson receives Kennedy Center Honor
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Willie Nelson won't wear the cowboy hat and
Indian beads.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely. But you never can tell.
</P>
<P>
   When the unconventional Austin singer-songwriter accepts his
Kennedy Center Honor tonight at a black-tie dinner, hosted in
Washington, D.C., by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
becomes only the second Texan to win the arts award.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Nelson will be praised through additional word and song
from the stage of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall in another
glittering ceremony that will air on CBS-TV on Dec. 30. He will be
joined as an honoree by actor and comedian Bill Cosby, the Broadway
composer and lyricist team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, composer
and conductor Andre Previn and actress Shirley Temple Black.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few people, even those who regularly watch the televised
gala, understand the purpose and criteria for the Kennedy Center
Honors, bestowed on 110 writers, musicians and other performing
artists since they were established in 1978 by producer George
Stevens Jr. and the late television variety producer Nick Vanoff.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the gala is a fund-raiser and marketing tool for
the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the megalithic complex
of theaters built 27 years ago on the Potomac River. Christened as
a memorial to President John F. Kennedy, who championed the arts
during his years in office, the center presents more than 2,800
performances a year to 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point, in terms of ticket sales, is to raise money,'' said
Larry Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center, regarding the
honors. While a certain number of tickets will be set aside for
dignitaries, the press, honorees and their parties, the remaining
seats will go to the center's corporate sponsors. ``They can't buy
tickets if they are not donors,'' Wilker said.
</P>
<P>
   The gala raises $2 million to subsidize the center's other
functions, but the program, one of the few such events broadcast on
a commercial network, does much more. It helps draw 3 million
visitors who tour the complex each year and allows the center to
maintain a high national profile.
</P>
<P>
   The selection begins early in the year when a committee of 132
artists makes recommendations for possible honorees. This group
runs the gamut from former Librarian of Congress Daniel Barenboim
to country singer Johnny Cash, with several former winners such as
Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier included on the panel. Most members
nominate only a few artists each year, Wilker said.
</P>
<P>
   Well in advance of the ceremony, the executive committee of the
Kennedy Center chooses a minimum of five honorees from the
recommendations. Only one artist has ever refused the honor, said
Wilker, declining to name that artist. A deliberate attempt is made
to mix artists from different fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get a broad representation of the arts,'' Wilker
said. Many years, a popular actor and a representative from the
folk, rock, blues or pop fields comes up with an honor.
</P>
<P>
   The center simply defines the award as honoring ``individuals
who throughout their lifetimes have contributed significantly to
American culture through the performing arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although TV producer Stevens is on the executive committee, no
attempt is made to boost ratings by choosing marquee names, Wilker
said. ``That has never entered the discussion as long as I have
been here,'' he said, citing dancers Fayard and Harold Nicholas, a
team of brothers who never achieved broad celebrity, but were
honored in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While the younger National Medal of the Arts, conferred by the
president, has stolen a little of the glow from the honors, Wilker
believes his awards are still perceived as a prestigious national
honor.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Texan to receive the honor was the late Alvin
Ailey, the pioneer dancer and performer who was born in Rogers near
Temple. Most honorees were born in the Northeast, and many
immigrated from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at geographic representation,'' Wilker said.
``Maybe we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 65, maintains homes on Lake Travis and in the tiny town
of Abbott, where he was born. The multi-Grammy winner has released
more than 200 albums and acted in several movies. Known as a
touring road warrior with a generous heart, Nelson played a benefit
performance at Gruene Hall on Thursday night for Central Texas
flood victims before heading to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos are nothing new to Nelson, but the Kennedy award reminds
of the broad reach of his music. His fans span the musical
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Nelson's impact on American music is indelible,'' says
rock guitarist Carlos Santana. ``He stands at the crossroads of all
the sounds and colors of his country. What he reflects is true soul
and sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If America only had one voice,'' says country singer Emmylou
Harris, ``it would be Willie's.''

BRADLEY OPENS `TRAINING CAMP' FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Expanded version with minor editing changes.)  (rl) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Bill Bradley, the former New York Knicks
basketball star who represented New Jersey for three terms in the
Senate as a Democrat, took the first major step Friday toward
running for president in the year 2000 and said he could foresee
nothing that ``would derail me at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as rejuvenated in the two years since he left
office and now ``on top of my game,'' Bradley, 55, said he believed
he could offer the leadership needed to address the nation's
problems _ from the lack of affordable health care insurance to
childhood poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can unleash the potential of the American people,''
he said, standing in the gymnasium of a community center here. ``I
see the energy out there every day that makes the economy run,
makes the technological breakthroughs. I want to turn that energy
toward dealing with the problems in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who resisted efforts by supporters to persuade him to
run in 1988 and 1992, would most likely face a difficult fight for
the nomination. Despite his celebrity and track record raising
millions of dollars in previous campaigns, he would need to
overcome the well-financed organization that Vice President Al Gore
has built across the country over the last six years and the
inherent advantage Gore has as the nation's second-highest
official.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for Bradley would be in finding a message to
differentiate himself from Gore, and other possible Democratic
contenders. And Friday, Bradley resisted making such a distinction.
``This is not about Vice President Gore and me,'' he said. ``This
is about telling people what I believe, going out and talking to
people, as I have been doing for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took the first step toward a presidential bid by
formally creating a Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory
Committee. He will meet with fellow Democrats in New Jersey over
the weekend to begin putting together the apparatus for a
presidential campaign, which will be based in New Jersey. Early
next week, he will travel to Los Angeles and San Francisco to meet
with supporters and begin fund-raising, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will need to raise between $22 million and $25 million
in the next year to be able to successfully compete for the
nomination, particularly now that the presidential primary process
is likely to be front-loaded with contests in New York and
California on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left little doubt that he was seriously committed to the
race. Although his family did not join him at the announcement, he
noted that he had the full support of his wife, Ernestine, and his
daughter, Teresa Ann, a junior at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is training camp,'' he said. ``This is when you get your
team together. You see how you relate to each other, try to work
out some plays, and the regular season is when you form the
official campaign. I can tell you that I have never gone to
training camp without expecting that I would be playing in the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers said they expected he would wage an
``anti-political'' campaign with an ``outside-the-Beltway'' message
that would seek to reach voters directly and tap into voter
frustration over the recent scandals in Washington. But Bradley,
trying to paint his campaign as a positive mission, said he would
not make the president's recent troubles an issue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he spent 18 years in Washington, Bradley sought to
portray himself as an outsider. He often operated outside the
traditional party structure in the Senate as well as in New Jersey.
In the Senate, Bradley focused most of his efforts on overhauling
the tax system, and on Third World debt, race relations, the
environment, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Senate two years ago, Bradley declared that the
political system was broken. He said Friday that his complaints
then were about the amount of money in politics, the sensationalism
of the news media, and about politicians who did not believe in
core convictions. ``I am not sure that it has been proven what I
said,'' he said. ``But I think it is important to try to make
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he left open the possiblity of running for the
presidency. He had thought about it in 1988 and 1992, but both
times, he said in a recent interview, he had decided he was not
ready. In one of his books, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' he wrote
that he was partly concerned about privacy for his family, as well
as a fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently made up his mind to run because he had the
full support of his family and because he truly believed that he
was prepared this time. He described reaching a certain level of
peace within himself. He said he intended to tell the American
voters ``what I believe and take my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bradley left the Senate two years ago, he has played
various roles from professor to best-selling author. He taught at
Notre Dame, Stanford University and the University of Maryland. He
has also appeared on national television as an essayist for the CBS
Evening News.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also spent much of his time cultivating a network of
friends and supporters whom he will now try to rely on for money
and organizational help. Although Gore presents stiff opposition,
some political analysts said that Bradley's celebrity should assist
him and he would probrably lead other possible contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats considering making a bid include Sens. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Kerrey of Nebraksa and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota, and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultants who represent Gore and other
possible contenders said they welcomed Bradley into the race.
``I've always thought it's going to be a big field,'' said Bob
Squier, a Democratic political consultant who is handling Gore's
campiagn. ``It's a prize worth fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Mr. Gore is such a prohibitive favorite that it is
difficult to imagine any of the other candidates justifying a race
at the moment,'' said Larry Sabato, director of the University of
Virginia's Center for Governmental Studies. ``That can change
quickly. And Bradley is a genuine celebrity in the age of celebrity
of all sorts, real and phony. He has established his credentials in
the field of politics, and outside of it. He has a good issue base
that ranges from campaign finance to economic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   A former star basketball player at Princeton, Bradley went on to
win an Olympic gold medal. He was also a Rhodes scholar before
joining the New York Knicks. He played for the team from 1967 to
1977, helping them win two championships in 1970 and 1973 and
earning a reputation for his integrity by refusing to endorse
products.

 &HT;    GOP calls White House request of 4 days to craft Clinton defense
a stall tactic
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House angered House Judiciary Committee
Republicans on Friday by requesting most of next week to mount its
defense of President Clinton against possible articles of
impeachment and seeking to call witnesses that cover ground the
panel has already examined.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said he would
consider the request and respond as early as today. Hyde had set
aside Tuesday for the White House to present its case and planned
for a committee vote on articles of impeachment at the close of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans widely viewed the White House request as a stalling
tactic because the Republican majority over Democrats will shrink
to six when the new Congress convenes in January, offering a better
chance to defeat an impeachment vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a desperate political play to push the
impeachment inquiry into the next Congress where the Democrats hope
to pick up a few more votes,'' said committee spokesman Paul
McNulty.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, noting that Hyde said when hearings began
last month that they could have ``unlimited time'' to present a
defense of the president, wrote a letter to the committee seeking
three to four days of hearings to cover the constitutional
standards for impeachment; standards for prosection of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power; and prosecutorial
misconduct of tainted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has already held hearings in each of those areas,
but White House Counsel Larry Craig and Charles Ruff state in a
letter delivered to the committee Friday evening that they have
been ``foreclosed from playing any role'' in those proceedings. The
White House said it was essential to the president's defense to
call several panels of witnesses, none of whom have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a declaration of war, there is no more significant or
grave constitutional process than the impeachment inquiry,'' Craig
and Ruff wrote. ``This process must be deliberate, fair and
expeditious.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans indicated a reluctance to allow the White
House more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just stall tactics,'' said Georgia Republican Rep. Bob
Barr, a member of the committee. ``There is no way we will spend an
entire week listening to the White House attack Ken Starr and
raising vague legal theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House must have taken a vote count on the likelihood
of impeachment in the House and not liked the results, said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get closer and closer to a floor vote they recognize
they are in serious trouble and they will do everything they can to
delay and avoid an impeachment vote,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House contended it was requesting the hearings because
the committee has treated Clinton unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our view that the proceedings to date have been
inadequate and incomplete in their exploration of certain important
issues relating to the proposed impeachment of President William
Jefferson Clinton,'' the attorneys' letter states. ``We feel it is
essential to the president's defense that we be able to call our
own witnesses and present our own arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee will meet with
committee staff Monday to discuss the wording of three articles of
impeachment. At this point, those articles allege that the
president committed perjury, obstructed justice and abused his
presidential powers in an attempt to conceal his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is widely expected to approve at least one article
of impeachment along party lines and forward it to the full House
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   That would require House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to call
members back to Capitol Hill for a vote. Committee officials are
planning for that vote the week of Dec. 14, but it may be postponed
if Hyde gives the White House the time it has requested.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves any articles of impeachment, the Senate
would immediately convene to hold a trial. Under its rules, the
Senate would have to convene at 1 p.m. the day after receiving
articles of impeachment from the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the White House is in the desperate mode,'' Barr said.
``They can spin the vote on impeachment all they want. But the fact
is he will go down as the second president to face impeachment in
the House and that's staring them into the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal came at the end of a week of bitter
partisan feuding over the prospect of impeachment. The chances that
the full House would approve articles of impeachment appeared too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Vote counters predicted that the Republicans were gaining
momentum for impeachment after the way Clinton responded last week
to 81 questions from the committee. Moderate Republicans who had
been wavering said they were upset by Clinton's legalistic and
evasive answers.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Democrats believed they had enough votes from
moderate Republicans to stop the impeachment train in the House and
avoid a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20 Republicans had indicated they were seriously
considering not voting for impeachment. A smaller number of
Democrats were considered possible votes in favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But censure motions that were being floated did not seem to
catch hold this week. And by Friday, even Democratic Rep. Charles
Schumer of New York, a staunch Clinton advocate, was saying in
interviews that it was no more than an even bet that Clinton could
avoid impeachment by the full House.

If your loved ones are hankering for ``Jerry Springer Trailer
Trash'' T-shirts this holiday season, the Internet is the place for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Along with standard fare such as books and toys, the Web is a
treasure trove of off-beat merchandise such as Loch Ness monster
salt-and-pepper shakers and a freeze-dried ice cream sampler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventuresome shoppers can find a lot of unique products
available from smaller merchants on the Net,'' said Vernon Keenan,
a principal at Keenan Vision, an Internet research firm in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The low cost of getting on the Web _ putting up a site can cost
as little as $15 a month _ gives small, niche businesses a national
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is somebody with a passion selling to others
with a passion,'' said James Roche, chief executive of Fort Point
Partners, an e-commerce consulting firm. ``When you pile all of
these people together _ which you can do on the Web _ you can
create critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the specialty sites don't advertise, and many don't show
up in online shopping guides provided by Yahoo, Excite and other
Internet portals. But if you're looking for a specific item, it
will probably turn up in a general online search. If you just want
to be surprised, do what we did _ ask a few frequent Web surfers to
point you to some of their favorite sites for off-the-wall stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to dazzle a stargazer? At  &LR; www.moonshop.com &LR; , you can
snag some of ``the cheapest real estate in the universe'' _ a chunk
of lunar property for $15.99.
</P>
<P>
   Is your mate an Aussie (or Aussie aficionado)? Try
 &LR; www.coop-bookshop.com.au  &LR; for a tome you probably won't find at
Barnes and Noble: ``The Aboriginal Naming Book _ Australian Guide
to Naming Your House or Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to spice up that relationship? A bottle of Rigor Mortis
hot sauce, along with dozens of other fiery tongue-tinglers, can be
had at  &LR; www.hothothot.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Folks shopping for Hanukkah presents are unlikely to find many
menorahs at the mall. But at  &LR; www.jewishmall.com &LR; , you can choose
from a selection of traditional menorahs as well as one sporting
the colorful image of Curious George the monkey and another shaped
like a racing car.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Rugrats' Book of Chanukah'' (and companion video), go
to  &LR; www.jewishstore.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a space fan? Check out &LR;  st1.yahoo.com/nasa &LR; , for
freeze-dried ice cream (like the astronauts eat), a mini-space
shuttle that talks or a Kennedy Space Center cap.
</P>
<P>
   For the revolutionary on your list, there's
 &LR; www.unamerican.com &LR; , where two San Franciscans sell ``We're
Doomed'' stickers, ``Drug Me'' mugs and ``Wage Slave'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to do good this holiday season, United Way of
the Bay Area has  &LR; www.helpakid.com &LR; , where you can grant gift
wishes for disadvantaged Bay Area kids. Toys for Tots, together
with Visa and eToys, has a similar program on a national scale at
 &LR; www.etoys.com/html/et(UNDERSCORE)promo135et.shtml. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Feeling adventuresome? You might explore  &LR; www.biganimals.com &LR; ,
where a San Francisco photographer offers adventure trips to
far-flung spots to photograph great white sharks, killer whales and
other predators. You'd better be feeling flush, too: Prices range
from $950 to $5,200 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for something unique for that pal who has everything?
How about Commuter Voodoo, a soft doll and a collection of pins for
those road rage days. The site,  &LR; www.mcphee.com &LR; , also offers
Nunzilla, the fire-breathing wind-up nun, the Loch Ness
salt-and-pepper shakers, a plastic hopping pig head and lots of
other silly stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our product is perfect for the Web because you can't get it in
stores,'' said Sherrie Holdridge of Archie McPhee &AMP; Co., which has
a traditional store in Seattle. McPhee, which has been in business
for 19 years, set up its Web site three years ago. This year,
Holdridge said, is the company's biggest on the Web so far.
</P>
<P>
   Not all specialty sites are small businesses. That Jerry
Springer T-shirt, along with Rosie O'Donnell's biography, a South
Park Dead Kenny beanie and an Andy Griffith Show Trivia Game can be
had at the E Entertainment Television site,  &LR; www.eonline.com &LR; .

 BofA to Try Spin Tactics  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl will
meet with state and local officials next month in an attempt to
mend fences amid a growing furor over the North Carolina bank's
treatment of California communities and female employees.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the bank announced it will eliminate 300 brokerage
jobs nationwide _ one of the first big job cuts &UR;  &LR; since McColl's
NationsBank's acquired BankAmerica and took its name in September.
The bank has said it ultimately will cut 7,000 to 8,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McColl plans to meet with California Assembly Banking and
Finance Committee Chairman Louis Papan, D-Millbrae, and other
legislators during a previously scheduled trip to the state, BofA
spokesman John Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   The new BofA chief is also trying to arrange meetings with local
elected officials in California, Keane said, including possibly San
Francisco supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with state lawmakers ``will give us an opportunity
to assure local legislators that our commitment to the state is
steadfast and that we will conduct ourselves as a community-minded
bank, as BofA and NationsBank always did,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   In other efforts to make peace, BofA officials met with
representatives of California advocacy groups this week, including
San Francisco's Greenlining Coalition and California Reinvestment
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's conciliatory gestures come as Papan's committee
threatens action that could lead the state to withdraw business
from BofA.
</P>
<P>
   The committee early next week will send letters to the state
treasurer and state comptroller asking for a list of all state
contracts, investments and deposits held by BofA, Papan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a big customer of BofA,'' Papan said. ``It could get to
the point where BofA begins to worry about doing business with the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco supervisors may push for similar action at the
municipal level, Supervisor Michael Yaki said in an interview
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Moves to sanction BofA come on the heels of complaints by
activist groups that the bank won't negotiate formal agreements
governing its community lending and charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   California officials are also angered by a Chronicle report that
all 10 of the old BofA's top female executives were demoted or
resigned after the new bank offered them lower-ranking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   BofA has countered by stressing its pledge to earmark $350
million for community development nationwide over the next 10 years
and increase its charitable donations in California.
</P>
<P>
   To defuse criticism about the departures of female executives,
McColl yesterday sent a memo to employees emphasizing his
commitment to promoting women at the bank and describing reports on
the subject as ``inaccurate and inflammatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout my career, I have made it a personal commitment to
coach and mentor women officers,'' said the memo, copies of which
were made available to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bank said the 300 brokerage job cuts it announced
represent 28 percent of its total brokerage workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The bank made the move because of a slowdown in business and to
eliminate overlapping operations as it combines the brokerage units
of the old BofA and NationsBank, spokesman Chris Schildz said.
</P>
<P>
   Positions will be eliminated in San Francisco, Charlotte, N.C.,
and other locations, Schildz said, though he declined to specify
how many employees would get pink slips in the Bay Area. The bank
will complete the cutbacks by the end of March.

 Ad Campaign By Pacific Bell Attacks AT&AMP;T  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Just days after being told it had not sufficiently opened
California's telephone market to competition, Pacific Bell is
waging an attack against AT&AMP;T Corp., saying the long-distance giant
is stifling competition in the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   In an ad campaign that begins Saturday, Pacific Bell accuses
AT&AMP;T of thwarting competition by funding a California consumer
group that lobbies against Pac Bell. Pac Bell said the group wants
to prevent competition in order to protect AT&AMP;T's long-distance
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell and AT&AMP;T have been sparring during the past three years
as each company has tried to move onto the other's turf. Pac Bell
wants to enter the lucrative long-distance business, and AT&AMP;T wants
to get a slice of the local market. Both companies have accused
each other of thwarting competition and denying customers a choice.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a state Public Utilities Commission judge said Pac
Bell had not sufficiently opened the local market to competition
and should not be allowed into long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the company from placing blame on AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will run on TV and in newspapers, say if AT&AMP;T
supported competition, ``they would not hide behind `grass roots'
groups to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads refer to Californians for Telecommunications Choice, a
statewide, nonprofit group that pitches itself as ``dedicated to
giving Californians true freedom of choice when it comes to
deciding which phone company they want to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of CTC's money comes from AT&AMP;T and other Pac Bell
competitors. The group is one of Pac Bell's harshest critics and is
lobbying against several Pac Bell initiatives, including its
attempt to provide long-distance service in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that California's consumers deserve to know the truth
about who is trying to influence them,'' said John Britton, a
spokesman for Pac Bell. ``The purpose of CTC and AT&AMP;T is to limit
consumer choice and keep Pac Bell out of long-distance for as long
as possible because AT&AMP;T knows that Pac Bell will be a formidable
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads challenge AT&AMP;T to ``stop playing name games and focus on
what we're focused on: open, honest competition.'' They will run on
TV in the Bay Area and Sacramento beginning today and in print ads
across the state on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Oram, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, said the ads are an attempt
to divert attention from the fact that Pac Bell has not opened its
local market to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that they're still a monopoly and that they
haven't opened the market to competition,'' Oram said. ``This is
not about AT&AMP;T versus Pac Bell. It's about what state regulators
have said _ that Pac Bell has not opened the market to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the judge's proposed ruling on Pac Bell's
long-distance application had nothing to do with the company's
decision to run the ads. He said the company wants to shed light on
CTC and its backers.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst with The Utility
Reform Network, said Pac Bell is the company that's thwarting
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like the classic example of the pot calling
the kettle black,'' Costa said. ``Pacific is saying we're committed
to open and honest competition and the commission has just ruled
that ... they didn't comply with federal law and have been
operating in ways that would ensure we don't have a choice.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR WILLIAMS, A DECISION FOR TIME AND LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waleska Williams watched her husband field questions
Friday from the back of a huge room at the All-Star Cafe in midtown
Manhattan. The news conference had been put off until this week as
Bernie Williams, his agent, Scott Boras, and the Yankees finalized
a whopping deal that presumably will keep Williams a Yankee for the
rest of his career. The deal: 7 years, $87.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams spoke with typical understatement and mostly
relief, Waleska said Friday was a day of triumph not simply for her
husband, but for the family: Her and her husband of eight years;
their 8-year-old son, Bernie Alexander, and two daughters, Beatrice
Noemi, 4, and Bianca, 3. She recalled the day before Thanksgiving
when Williams returned from Tampa after a meeting in which the
Yankees said they would not match Boston's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the pain in his eyes when he came back,'' she recalled.
``That's the saddest I've seen this man in eight years. So I see
this as a victory because he has worked very, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Waleska recalled the birth of their youngest child on Sept. 14,
1995, the day after Williams' birthday. The Yankees strongly
suggested that Williams stay with the team for something extra, and
because of that and a hurricane, Williams did not reach his family
in Puerto Rico until 10 days after the birth. ``I was very hurt and
I told him, `You were there for them but not for me,''' she said.
``But I know that's the kind of commitment he had for the Yankees
and he expected that same type of commitment from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Waleska, this contract was a triumph that went
beyond money to the strengthening of a marriage which, like so many
sports unions, had been tested by time, by distance, by living
arrangements that had Williams living away from the family
beginning in spring training. Every season, Waleska remained in
Puerto Rico with the children. The long-term security of this
contract will allow the Williamses to move to New York, to live
under the same roof for the first time in Williams' Yankee career.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me going back to Puerto Rico, those family ties and
family connections are strained,'' she said. ``He could just put us
behind: `I have to go to spring training. I'll see you in December.
I'll see you in two weeks.' It's hard for him to stay connected.
This was a very big decision for us because it was not only where
he was going to play, but where we are going to live for the next
seven years. There's no more going back and forth to Puerto Rico;
we're settling here, raising our kids here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spouses often carry the burdens _ and joys _ of maintaining the
household while the athletes indulge a fragile, fantasy-land
existence of work and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This life is either going to break you up as soon as possible,
or you can pretend nothing is going on and say, `Oh, well, I'll
just enjoy it while it lasts,''' she said. ``Or you can really
work, and that's the most challenging. A lot of things have
happened, but I believe that God put me here for a reason and God
gave me this partner for a reason and gave me to him for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time through the eight years that we've been
married, I was the one who stayed behind, was taken for granted. I
told him once, `If it was just for the money, I could be gone and
I'm already set for life.' But I'm here because I love this man,
and when baseball is over I want to have the best relationship
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon finally wound down, the questions all raised
and answered, Bernie and Waleska Williams left the large room at
the All-Star Cafe and walked into a new, challenging life. Waleska
recalled a piece of advice a former Yankee had given her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time Reggie Jackson told Bernie: `Baseball is going to be
over and all your friends are going to be gone, but this is the one
person that's going to be with you after. So remember her through
the years.' Those were the wisest words I've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has apparently heard them, too. ``My kids aren't used
to having a full-time daddy,'' Williams said. ``That's the most
important aspect of this whole situation. I was tired of packing,
not having an opportunity to see my kids grow and having this
family life that I really longed for. You don't want to live out of
a suitcase, then coming back, seeing your kids and trying to win
them again. It was hard; it was taking a toll on the family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Player gets money. Team gets player. Children get their father.
Husband and wife get each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's what you call a good deal.

BOTH SIDES SEE NBA SEASON AS EVER MORE REMOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Commissioner David Stern wore a look of resignation,
saying he had accepted the idea there may not be a basketball
season. Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, rambled
on about not accepting a bad deal until he ran out of breath
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 1 a.m. Friday, and the two principals in the
National Basketball Association's five-month-old labor war were
wrapping up their respective news conferences after 11 futile hours
of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Day 157 of the lockout had come and gone with barely a trace of
progress. Never had the two principals discussed so openly the
possibility of losing the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may not be a solution, and we accept that,'' Stern said.
``I now recognize the possibility, or the likelihood, that the
season will expire.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hunter said: ``Our players have decided that if
push comes to shove, and they compel us to miss a season, we'll
miss a season. Our membership is definitely prepared for that
possibility. And we're not blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks of the season has been lost. Even a surprise
settlement next week would mean about a 50-game season, a figure
thought to be close to a cutoff for having a representative season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're within striking distance, but there are pretty
significant issues that separate us right now,'' Hunter said.
``Unless they soften their stances on those issues, we're not going
to have a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's view, Stern and Hunter are either crying wolf
before they reach an 11th-hour compromise or are the culprits in
what could become the most costly labor debacle in professional
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Stern, Hunter and their respective bargaining teams
are running out of time to make a deal and resuscitate the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know everyone agrees on two things,'' Stern said Friday
on Day 158 of the lockout. ``If we made a deal tomorrow, the season
couldn't start until January at the earliest. And we're not even
negotiating. So we're not going to be making a deal anytime soon.
In that sense, we both agree the season is at risk.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hunter said Friday that he planned to telephone Stern over the
weekend and painted a slightly rosier outlook _ if anything can be
rosy about the projected loss of $400 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The union's negotiating committee met Friday morning to reaffirm
its solidarity and contemplate its next move.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players to speak Friday was the loquacious Karl
Malone, who dared Stern to cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do the deal, let's do it right now,'' said
Malone, who last attended a bargaining session in August. ``If not,
cancel it. Stop teasing the fans. Stop stringing people along. I'm
willing to sit out the whole year to get what's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take the season away, that's Commissioner Stern's
call. But if you're going to take it away, take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern continues to refuse to announce a cancellation date. Last
month he said a settlement would be necessary by mid-December to
salvage the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has a deadline in mind. ``With 200 guys waiting to sign
free-agent contracts, it would have to be by Jan. 1,'' he said.
``I'm convinced there's going to be a season and a deal. I don't
think David and the owners can afford for there not to be a season.
There's too much at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the $1.1 billion in player salaries lost, an
additional $300 million to $400 million would be lost if the entire
82-game schedule and postseason were terminated. An announcement is
expected next week on the cancellation of the All-Star Game in
Philadelphia on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   There was minor progress on several economic issues on Thursday
night, with the owners showing flexibility on phasing in timing
rules in order to address the players' concerns about free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The players made concessions on the rookie salary scale. Under
their proposal, an owner after three years would choose one of
these two options:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a player at scale for a fourth year, or
</P>
<P>
   _ Invoke the right of first refusal.
</P>
<P>
   The players also made an escrow tax proposal. But there are
several factors still keeping the two sides apart, including
agreed-upon percentages for revenue distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the so-called intransigent and greedy owners that are
blocking the deal,'' Stern said. ``It's no one that's blocking the
deal. It's just two sides that cannot agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning after the meeting, Stern used a multicolored
chart illustrating the owners' proposal in an effort to show the
news media what he has been trying to show the players: that the
salary structure proposed by the owners would help the players.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter shot it down. He even used the phrase ``hard cap,''
two words that have polarized the talks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter added: ``I'm not pessimistic. Obviously things are
somewhat acute. It's no joke. We're moving into the extreme zone.
But I feel something will happen.''

BRUINS KNOW STAKES ARE HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ UCLA practiced in the rain Tuesday for the first time
this season. The balls were wet and heavy. Part of Spaulding Field
looked like a tractor-pull surface, and players were caked in mud.
</P>
<P>
   When the coaches gathered that evening to review video, they
expected to see slop _ and sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pouring rain, and we looked at practice and thought,
`Oh, gosh,''' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``But they blocked the
right guys and they didn't drop the ball. They were doing things
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed focus. They know what's at stake. They've got
great leadership. I can't feel any better than I do now.''
</P>
<P>
   How will he feel this morning before kickoff against Miami, when
the weight of history descends? How will the Bruins feel when they
enter the storied Orange Bowl? Six times in the venerable stadium _
and seven times overall _ the Hurricanes have stopped winning
streaks of 10 games or more. UCLA's stands at 20.
</P>
<P>
   And how will the Bruins feel at kickoff, with an undefeated
season and probable berth in the Fiesta Bowl at stake _ not to
mention $6 million for the Pacific-10, a Rose Bowl bid for Arizona,
a Holiday Bowl invite for Oregon and immeasurable prestige and
exposure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we play better when the stakes are high,'' captain
Larry Atkins said. ``When there's more on the line and there's more
to lose, we play with a sense of urgency. We concentrate harder,
because we can't afford to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington game was a chance to clinch the Rose Bowl. USC
game was our rival and a chance to go through the conference
undefeated. This time, our motivation is to play in the Fiesta
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins prepared 2{ weeks for this game, their first visit to
Florida in 57 years. They practiced one week in September, before
Hurricane Georges caused the cancellation. They worked out three
days last week, before Thanksgiving break. Add this week, and
they've prepared more for Miami than they do for bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the stakes and the opponent, the time was justified.
The Hurricanes are talented and unpredictable. Will they play like
the improving young team that was 7-2 before Thanksgiving, or like
a team devastated by a 66-13 loss to Syracuse Nov. 28 _ the
second-worst loss in school history?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their talent _ senior quarterback Scott Covington (a
Laguna Hills native), powerful tailback Edgerrin James, swift
receiver Santana Moss and standout defensive end Derrick Ham _ the
Hurricanes will test UCLA's emotional resolve.
</P>
<P>
   They will come fast and they will come hard, with a defense as
athletic as USC's. They will posture and they will insult. They'll
taunt UCLA like it hasn't been taunted before. Probation or no
probation, rebuilding or no rebuilding, the Hurricanes have not
lost all of their South Florida swagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see how we react,'' said injured UCLA
receiver Freddie Mitchell, a Lakeland, Fla., native. ``It'll test
our mental state and our heart. Miami's going to talk some noise.
They're fast, and they know they're good. If we come in with our
minds in a certain place, we can easily be upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already talked to (tailbacks) Jermaine (Lewis) and DeShaun
(Foster). I told them to get ready to get hit hard, and don't go
thinking it's an automatic win.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Toledo, 52, is negotiating a new contract that will make
him one of the highest-paid coaches in the Pac-10 and keep him at
UCLA for the rest of his career, athletic department sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's current salary ($453,000 per season) will rank ninth in
the league if Arizona coach Dick Tomey's new $500,000-per-year deal
is approved next month. USC's Paul Hackett is the league's
highest-paid coach, reportedly making $640,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo and athletic director Peter Dalis met with administration
officials Nov. 25 and hope to have the contract completed this
month, one source said.

COWBOYS' SANDERS LIKELY WON'T PLAY AGAINST SAINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders did not
practice yesterday, all but assuring he will not play against the
New Orleans Saints tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who earlier in the week said Sanders
would not play if he couldn't practice on the sprained toe by
yesterday, said he intends to follow through with his plans to hold
Sanders out a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never, but it looks like he's not going to play,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sanders has shown improvement and walks without a limp,
Gailey said the Cowboys would rather play it conservatively and let
the injury heal fully, rather than chance a recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gray area,'' Gailey said. ``There are several factors.
Do we want him to get closer to 100 percent? Yes, we do. Can he
play? Probably, but will he be set back again?''
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Smith also sidelined with a strained back, the
Cowboys will go with Charlie Williams and Kevin Mathis as starting
cornerbacks. Larry Brown, signed Wednesday, will be the primary
backup and serve as a nickel cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who has missed the past three games with a fractured
right forearm, said he's excited to get back on the field and
doesn't anticipate having any problems playing with a cast on his
right arm.
Offense to lend a hand
</P>
<P>
   Gailey understands his defensive patchwork will be a weakness
against the Saints, but he'd rather concentrate on the Cowboys'
strength _ their offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense is ranked fourth in the league and has
scored at least 30 points in four of the past five games. The
Saints' defense ranks 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense has been playing well,'' Gailey said. ``If we can
continue the things we are doing, we can help the defense.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Recently signed Tyrone Hughes is expected to return kickoffs and
punts against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren will miss tomorrow's game with a
strained groin. Sherman Williams will step in as the third-down
running back.

STEWART IMPRESSES WILDCATS' COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said he has spent
most of the past 24 hours watching videotapes of Texas A&AMP;M's
victories against Oklahoma State and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last games in which A&AMP;M quarterback Branndon
Stewart, an emergency replacement for the injured Randy McCown
(broken collarbone), competed. Stewart, a fifth-year senior from
Stephenville who will start in today's Big 12 championship game,
was 18-of-28 for 292 yards and three touchdowns in those games and
didn't throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw exceedingly well,'' Snyder said of Stewart, who was
elevated to the starting role when McCown was scratched Thursday
night. ``I personally don't sense any difference in their two
quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's last snap came on Nov. 7, when he played the entire
game in a 29-0 victory against Oklahoma. A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said
he is confident that Stewart, who has a career mark of 19-10 as the
Aggies' starting quarterback, will not be affected by his prolonged
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branndon is relaxed. He's reached a point in his career where
he doesn't let a bunch of outside distractions keep him from doing
what he's trying to get done,'' Slocum said. ``He's looking forward
to the game, and I think he'll play well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Slocum said he is comfortable placing the pressure on
Stewart and the offense, which ranks 95th nationally among 112
teams in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a chance in this game if everything comes down
to defense,'' Slocum said. ``We've got to maintain possession of
the football, make some first downs and do something on offense.''
TWO WILDCATS RETURN Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said yesterday
that two players considered doubtful earlier this week will start
today. Tailback Eric Hickson, the team's leading rusher (888 yards,
nine touchdowns), and cornerback Gerald Neasman (one interception,
five pass breakups) made enough progress during practice to regain
their starting jobs. Both players sat out the team's Nov. 21 game
against Missouri because of injuries. COUNTING ON EXPERIENCE
Although his team was swamped by Nebraska, 54-15, in last season's
Big 12 title game, Slocum said the experience should prove
beneficial today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the game against Nebraska, we were all eyes,''
Slocum said. ``That won't happen again. Kansas State may win, it
won't be because our guys are in awe of Kansas State. Having played
in this game last year gives us an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that has an impact on our players and this
program,'' said Snyder, whose team will be playing for Kansas
State's first conference championship since 1934. ``When you get
between the lines, it all seems to even out.'' EXTRA POINTS Snyder
said he would meet with Mike Stoops, the Wildcats' defensive
coordinator, after today's game and discuss Stoops' interest in
joining staff of his brother, Bob, who was named the coach at
Oklahoma Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, on having an extra week to prepare for this game than
A&AMP;M: ``You never know about open dates. We had an open date before
our game against Colorado \Ra 16-9 victory\S and played our worst
game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Solcum on A&AMP;M's season: ``This could've been a 6-5 team if not
for the character of the players. We had plenty of chances early to
get separated. Just playing on ability, this team is not going to
win 10 games, The chemistry is as solid on this team as any we've
had in a long time.''

JANET LEWIS, 99, A POET OF SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Wis.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her first writings to reach print ran shoulder to shoulder with
Ernest Hemingway's. For her first published poetry she was grouped
with William Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore. She made it to
Paris ahead of both Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   She was a leader of the University of Chicago school of imagist
poets, and if hers is not a household name, by the time she died on
Monday at the age of 99 in the house in Los Altos, Calif., that she
had occupied for two-thirds of a century, Janet Lewis had the
satisfaction of knowing she had written poetry throughout the 20th
century and seen it published and praised in every decade since the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Her reputation has seemingly been eclipsed by that of her late
husband, Yvor Winters, the poet, professor and critic who wrestled
Hart Crane's ``Bridge'' into print and made Stanford _ and Los
Altos _ a magnet for three generations of poets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many who will assure you that when the literary
history of the second millennium is written at the end of the
third, in the category of dazzling American short fiction her
``Wife of Martin Guerre'' will be regarded as the 20th century's
``Billy Budd'' and Janet Lewis will be ranked with Herman Melville.
(Though, to be fair, her prose is more often likened to
Stendhal's.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes her accomplishments even more impressive is that over
the course of a career in which she wrote hundreds of poems, a
single collection of short stories, a couple of children's books, a
handful of novels, the words to five operas and one acclaimed
masterpiece, Miss Lewis pursued a literary life in which the focus
was on the life, and the life was one of such placid equilibrium
and domestic bliss that she had to reach deep down in her psyche _
and far back in the annals of criminal law _ to find the wellspring
of tension that produced some of the 20th century's most vividly
imagined and finely wrought literature.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to find the time.
</P>
<P>
   As she once observed, women of prodigious literary output, like
Willa Cather and Edith Wharton, tended not to have children. As the
mother of two, Miss Lewis willingly put her work aside when her
children were young and cheerfully accepted other duties as well.
``It's a question of what you want to do with your life,'' she once
said. ``You might also want to take care of your husband.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The daughter of a poetry-spouting English professor, Miss Lewis
was born in Chicago and grew up in Oak Park where she and her 1899
contemporary, Ernest Hemingway, contributed their first works to
the same high school literary magazines, she deriving inspiration
by summering even deeper in the north woods than he and finding a
lifelong fascination with nature and the natural flow of life.
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiments were expressed in a 1922 poetry collection, ``The
Indians in the Woods,'' in a series of stories later included in a
1946 collection, ``Good-Bye, Son and Other Stories,'' and in a 1932
narrative, as she called it, ``The Invasion,'' the
multigenerational account of a Scotch-Irish-Indian family.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at a junior college, Miss Lewis completed her
education at the University of Chicago, majoring in French while
joining the famous Poetry Club and meeting Winters, who had spent
time at a tuberculosis sanitarium in Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stay in Paris after graduation in 1920, Miss Lewis
returned to Chicago but soon contracted tuberculosis herself and
spent five years at the same sanitarium, engaging in a passionate
correspondence with Winters and eventually marrying him and
following him to California, where she threw herself into a
satisfying domestic life that included tending to her husband's
registered Airedales, harvesting the fruit from the adjacent
orchard and serving as a sort of serene den mother to an extended,
animated family of her husband's awed acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first and by far the fiercest and most controversial
of the New Critics and a man of cocksure opinions, for all his
fabled influence on 20th-century American poetry, Winters may have
made his greatest contribution to literature when his wife, whose
life was virtually without drama, complained that she had trouble
finding suitable plots and he gave her a chance copy of a
19th-century compilation of famous old legal cases.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she had finished it, Miss Lewis had all but
abandoned poetry and embarked on what turned out to be three short
historical novels, ``The Wife of Martin Guerre'' (1941), ``The
Trial of Soren Qvist'' (1947) and ``The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron''
(1959), all based on actual cases and so compellingly imagined and
told that she inspired the 1956 ``Wife of Martin Guerre'' opera by
William Bergsman, who asked her to write the libretto. The composer
Alva Henderson was so impressed that he got her to write the
libretto for his 1976 opera, ``The Last of the Mohicans,'' and two
others.
</P>
<P>
   The historical novels, Miss Lewis said later, represented the
``heavy thinking'' of a literary career that did not include her
poetry. Her poems, she said, were always personal, a quiet corner
of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by her husband's death in 1968, Miss Lewis, who never
took his name off the mailbox and maintained his writing shed as a
shrine, sought to deal with her grief by revisiting the Southwest,
rediscovering her fascination with the local Indians and producing
a series of memorable poems.
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Lewis, who is survived by a daughter, Joanna Thomson of
Madison, Wis.; a son, Daniel Winters of Davis, Calif., and three
grandchildren, her family was always more important than her work,
and her life is well reflected in her final collection, ``The Dear
Past'' (1994), with poems covering most of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Under the influence of her husband, she had done her share of
experimenting, but the woman who had begun her career by taking
part in the imagist revolution that sought to strip poetry of its
former artifice, ended it the same way, using spare, lyrical
language to describe and celebrate the simplest scenes of nature.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman who charmed generations of troubled poets and other
literary figures with her almost otherworldly serenity, looking
back over the domestic scenes of a long, literary life, it would be
hard to find a more compelling image of Miss Lewis _ or one more
evocative of the flesh-and-blood life beneath the surface of
20th-century literature _ than one of the many at the family's
house after a warm, rollicking meal with the couple's dearest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to close your eyes to conjure up the sight, but
there they are forever, two 1899 contemporaries standing side by
side at the kitchen sink, Janet Lewis washing, Vladimir Nabokov
drying.

JUNIOR COLLEGE RIVALRY REACHES BOWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CALAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Two of the top football teams in the National
Junior College Athletic Association will renew their rivalry today
in the second annual Red River Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern Oklahoma A&AMP;M College (8-3), ranked 12th in the
final regular-season NJCAA poll, meets Coffeyville (Kan.) Community
College (6-3) at 1 p.m. today at Pennington Field in Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup has tradition and a history of rivalry.
Northeastern, from Miami, Okla., and Coffeyville have combined to
win nine NJCAA national titles, and they are located within 50
miles of one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not playing for a national championship, this is the
next best thing,'' Northeastern coach Dale Patterson said. ``This
is a renewal of the Coffeyville rivalry. Even though we haven't
played in awhile, there is a rivalry still there because the
schools are so close and you want to win for recruiting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win this game and finish the year 9-3. It sounds a
lot better than 8-4. Any time you go out and play a game, it is a
matter of pride. We want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the series dates to 1925, the game today marks their
first meeting in a bowl game and their first meeting since 1995.
They were chosen for the bowl as at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern, which has six national titles, owns a 23-9-2
advantage in the all-time series.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern has won six consecutive games and is led by a
balanced offense. Tailback Josh Scobey has 1,067 yards rushing and
quarterback Sherad Poteet has passed for 1,680 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Coffeyville freshman Thad Ward leads the Red Ravens' I-formation
offense. He has rushed for 871 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. Ward
is one of 10 freshman starters for Coffeyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for the kids,'' Coffeyville coach
Skip Foster said. ``I have heard Bedford does a great job with the
Red River Bowl. I know the kids are looking forward to going down
there and playing. Most important, it gives the kids a chance to
play in one of the postseason bowl games.''

EDITORIAL: BRADLEY ENTERS THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the next presidential campaign has already
gone on for so long that some citizens may be surprised to learn
that Vice President Gore and Gov. George Bush of Texas are not
already nominated. But although both men would probably like to be
selected by pre-emption, there are plenty of other Democrats and
Republicans of their generation who are not yet willing to give up
their own Oval Office dreams. After two years of rumination, Bill
Bradley, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, has formed
an exploratory committee. The hills of New Hampshire are teeming
with Republicans. Lamar Alexander apparently never left.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bradley, some high-ranking Democrats may feel they are
running out of time to wait in line. The House minority leader,
Richard Gephardt, is dining with Hollywood contributors and says he
will make his decision by January. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska
plans to announce his plans later this month. For this group of
middle-aged pols, 2000 has a now-or-never feel.
</P>
<P>
   This premature politicking is also being driven in great part by
the schedule of the next set of presidential primaries. It includes
so many important contests during the first part of March that
candidates who cannot raise enormous sums of money and establish
themselves as household names in 1999 might just as well stay home.
Experts say Bradley, who has raised about $20 million over a long
political career, will have to raise just as much over the next 12
months to be a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's entry into the presidential field is a welcome sign
that Democratic voters will have some options, at least for a
while. He comes into the race with his own set of advantages and
disadvantages. The fact that he is a former star of the New York
Knicks will get him some publicity, but it also probably means he
is too tall to be anybody's vice president. The public may like his
seriousness, and his interest in issues like tax simplification.
But is his reputation for soporific speeches formidable enough to
match up one on one with Gore's? We have no information yet on
Bradley's ability to do the macarena.

TRIO HOPING FOR PLACE IN FINAL PUZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Think of today's college football games as
the final pieces of a puzzle. Now, imagine those pieces could
change in size and shape. Puzzling, huh?
</P>
<P>
   There are three significant games whose results will complete
the national championship and bowl lineups.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, No. 2 Kansas State (11-0) plays No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M
(10-2) in the Big 12 Conference championship game. The winner is
assured a berth in the Bowl Championship Series. If that winner is
Kansas State, the game could vault the Wildcats into the national
championship game in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, No. 1 Tennessee (11-0) faces No. 23 Mississippi
State (8-3) in the Southeastern Conference championship game. The
winner goes to a BCS bowl. The Volunteers hope if they win, that
means a trip to the desert and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that is extra incentive,'' Mississippi State
center Eric Allen said of his team's position as spoiler. ``It's a
big game for them as far as their steps to a national championship,
but just playing for the SEC championship is enough motivation for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, No. 3 UCLA (10-0) faces the Hurricanes (7-3), who are
coming off a 66-13 shellacking at Syracuse. This game was postponed
from Sept. 26 because of Hurricane Georges. A UCLA victory would
keep the Bruins in the national-title picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get excited about the chance to spoil their
hopes for the national championship,'' Miami linebacker Dan Morgan
said. ``I think everyone's feeling real good about the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA all win, there will be
considerable drama Sunday afternoon when the final BCS rankings are
announced. The three teams were separated by 1.32 points in this
week's rankings. The top two teams in the final listings will play
in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no upsets today, it will be up to the 142 voters in
the media and coaches polls, plus the computer programs to decide
the top two teams. At least two of the coaches involved felt the
need to lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to understand it's a one-game tournament now for
us,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``If we lose, we're out. It would
be a real shame to get this far and not take advantage of it. I
think our players will be real focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very, very disappointed if we go undefeated and don't
play in the Fiesta Bowl. I honestly, truly believe we should be one
of the top two teams playing in the Fiesta Bowl if we win
\Rtoday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer also felt the urge to campaign
for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten four of the Top 25 \RFlorida, Georgia, Arkansas
and Syracuse\S, and three of those teams were in the Top 10 when we
played them,'' he said. ``But more than that, I just think that if
you're the SEC champion and you're 12-0, you have got to be in the
big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap today: The Western Athletic Conference championship
game and the annual Army-Navy clash. The WAC game will be the last
title game in the short lifespan of the 16-team conference.
However, the BYU-Air Force contest in Las Vegas will do no more
than determine a champion; both teams have accepted bowl bids (Air
Force to one of the Hawaii games, BYU to the Liberty).
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 bowl games, seven have their teams set. The other 15
will find out their matchups tomorrow based on the results in St.
Louis, Atlanta and Miami.

TEXAS A&AMP;M WIN WOULD AVOID WASTED YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In Aggieland, where tradition marches to its own
drum, the old dogs are barking again _ and we don't mean Reveille.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up, math majors. Take one golden season, multiply it by a
seven-point beating of mighty Nebraska, then divide nearly
everything by a two-point loss to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's once-glittery season has lost its luster. And even
before his Aggies face a Kansas State team brimming with purpose
today, coach R.C. Slocum has heard his name taken in vain again.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Wildcats today would leave the Aggies on a
two-game losing streak going into a bowl game. Worse, it would
remind Slocum detractors of a tired, old statistic _ the one about
R.C.'s record against teams in the Top 10. One win in 10 seasons,
if you're keeping score at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about that,'' Slocum barked back, as A&AMP;M
prepared for its date in the Big 12 Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won a bunch of games that you could classify as big
games. If somebody wants to take this game and write about it that
way, I could care less. I'll take our record and put it up against
anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-2 record, granted, is nothing to launch a witch hunt over.
Slocum's problem is that the second loss came at the hooves of the
dreaded Longhorns. All that bonfire wood wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Losing to Florida State in August is one thing. But losing to
Texas on Thanksgiving weekend remains an Aggie's worst stomach
ache.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still won 10 in a row,'' said injured quarterback Randy
McCown. ``It's been a good year. We beat Nebraska. We got into the
Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``But around here, you always remember when you lose to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern at A&AMP;M is that those memories haven't followed the
Aggies to the banks of the Mississippi. Tight end Dan Campbell of
Glen Rose confessed that after the loss to Texas, he and his
brother drove back to College Station in complete silence. Campbell
locked himself in his apartment for two days, before finally
emerging for last Sunday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M team, therefore, that answers the roll call against
undefeated Kansas State today could be filled with either
square-jawed resolve or untimely self-pity. You wonder if the
confidence has run dry since beating Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we can't win big games,'' Slocum answered, ``the logic
in that statement is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is another big one, in a manner of speaking. Only
three years in existence, the Big 12 championship showdown has yet
to be embraced as the football Armageddon it was once hyped to be.
The Trans World Dome is expected to sport ample elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State needs to win _ and, likely, to win impressively.
The Wildcats need to send signals to pollsters and computers that
they are every bit as No. 1-worthy as the two teams that presently
``rank'' ahead of them, Tennessee and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M, in essence, is playing today in hopes of rekindling their
season's flame. K-State, on the other hand, wants to win by a
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating Kansas State can salvage the season,'' McCown said.
</P>
<P>
   The words still ring from last season, when the Aggies dropped
their final two games, to Nebraska in the Big 12 title game and to
UCLA in the Cotton Bowl, and star linebacker Dat Nguyen called it
``a wasted year.''
</P>
<P>
   Great teams are defined by the big games they win. The losers
find other adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great season,'' Slocum said. ``We're 10-2. We're
happy to have another game to play. We're playing a team that one
poll has ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there are a bunch of motivating factors here.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of another ``wasted year'' hangs like a khaki cloud
over Slocum's team. Whether he has convinced his McCown-less team
otherwise will be one of the things worth watching today.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the Fiesta Bowl, but for the Aggies, it's worth trying
to light another fire with.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of rekindling his team prompted Slocum to search
for a country comparison this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the old earthworm,'' Slocum said. ``He's
digging around in the dirt all day, and it's not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it beats the heck out of going fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's digging starts at 3:30 p.m.

(10-2) in the Big 12 Conference championship game. The winner is
assured a berth in the Bowl Championship Series. If that winner is
Kansas State, the game could vault the Wildcats into the national
championship game in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, No. 1 Tennessee (11-0) faces No. 23 Mississippi
State (8-3) in the Southeastern Conference championship game. The
winner goes to a BCS bowl. The Volunteers hope if they win, that
means a trip to the desert and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that is extra incentive,'' Mississippi State
center Eric Allen said of his team's position as spoiler. ``It's a
big game for them as far as their steps to a national championship,
but just playing for the SEC championship is enough motivation for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, No. 3 UCLA (10-0) faces the Hurricanes (7-3), who are
coming off a 66-13 shellacking at Syracuse. This game was postponed
from Sept. 26 because of Hurricane Georges. A UCLA victory would
keep the Bruins in the national-title picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get excited about the chance to spoil their
hopes for the national championship,'' Miami linebacker Dan Morgan
said. ``I think everyone's feeling real good about the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA all win, there will be
considerable drama Sunday afternoon when the final BCS rankings are
announced. The three teams were separated by 1.32 points in this
week's rankings. The top two teams in the final listings will play
in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no upsets today, it will be up to the 142 voters in
the media and coaches polls, plus the computer programs to decide
the top two teams. At least two of the coaches involved felt the
need to lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to understand it's a one-game tournament now for
us,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``If we lose, we're out. It would
be a real shame to get this far and not take advantage of it. I
think our players will be real focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very, very disappointed if we go undefeated and don't
play in the Fiesta Bowl. I honestly, truly believe we should be one
of the top two teams playing in the Fiesta Bowl if we win
\Rtoday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer also felt the urge to campaign
for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten four of the Top 25 \RFlorida, Georgia, Arkansas
and Syracuse\S, and three of those teams were in the Top 10 when we
played them,'' he said. ``But more than that, I just think that if
you're the SEC champion and you're 12-0, you have got to be in the
big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap today: The Western Athletic Conference championship
game and the annual Army-Navy clash. The WAC game will be the last
title game in the short lifespan of the 16-team conference.
However, the BYU-Air Force contest in Las Vegas will do no more
than determine a champion; both teams have accepted bowl bids (Air
Force to one of the Hawaii games, BYU to the Liberty).
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 bowl games, seven have their teams set. The other 15
will find out their matchups tomorrow based on the results in St.
Louis, Atlanta and Miami.

STEWART IMPRESSES WILDCATS' COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said he has spent
most of the past 24 hours watching videotapes of Texas A&AMP;M's
victories against Oklahoma State and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last games in which A&AMP;M quarterback Branndon
Stewart, an emergency replacement for the injured Randy McCown
(broken collarbone), competed. Stewart, a fifth-year senior from
Stephenville who will start in today's Big 12 championship game,
was 18-of-28 for 292 yards and three touchdowns in those games and
didn't throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw exceedingly well,'' Snyder said of Stewart, who was
elevated to the starting role when McCown was scratched Thursday
night. ``I personally don't sense any difference in their two
quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's last snap came on Nov. 7, when he played the entire
game in a 29-0 victory against Oklahoma. A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said
he is confident that Stewart, who has a career mark of 19-10 as the
Aggies' starting quarterback, will not be affected by his prolonged
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branndon is relaxed. He's reached a point in his career where
he doesn't let a bunch of outside distractions keep him from doing
what he's trying to get done,'' Slocum said. ``He's looking forward
to the game, and I think he'll play well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Slocum said he is comfortable placing the pressure on
Stewart and the offense, which ranks 95th nationally among 112
teams in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a chance in this game if everything comes down
to defense,'' Slocum said. ``We've got to maintain possession of
the football, make some first downs and do something on offense.''
TWO WILDCATS RETURN Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said yesterday
that two players considered doubtful earlier this week will start
today. Tailback Eric Hickson, the team's leading rusher (888 yards,
nine touchdowns), and cornerback Gerald Neasman (one interception,
five pass breakups) made enough progress during practice to regain
their starting jobs. Both players sat out the team's Nov. 21 game
against Missouri because of injuries. COUNTING ON EXPERIENCE
Although his team was swamped by Nebraska, 54-15, in last season's
Big 12 title game, Slocum said the experience should prove
beneficial today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the game against Nebraska, we were all eyes,''
Slocum said. ``That won't happen again. Kansas State may win, it
won't be because our guys are in awe of Kansas State. Having played
in this game last year gives us an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that has an impact on our players and this
program,'' said Snyder, whose team will be playing for Kansas
State's first conference championship since 1934. ``When you get
between the lines, it all seems to even out.'' EXTRA POINTS Snyder
said he would meet with Mike Stoops, the Wildcats' defensive
coordinator, after today's game and discuss Stoops' interest in
joining staff of his brother, Bob, who was named the coach at
Oklahoma Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, on having an extra week to prepare for this game than
A&AMP;M: ``You never know about open dates. We had an open date before
our game against Colorado \Ra 16-9 victory\S and played our worst
game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Solcum on A&AMP;M's season: ``This could've been a 6-5 team if not
for the character of the players. We had plenty of chances early to
get separated. Just playing on ability, this team is not going to
win 10 games, The chemistry is as solid on this team as any we've
had in a long time.''

SANDERS LIKELY OUT FOR SAINTS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders did not
practice yesterday, all but assuring he will not play against the
New Orleans Saints tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who earlier in the week said Sanders
would not play if he couldn't practice on the sprained toe by
yesterday, said he intends to follow through with his plans to hold
Sanders out a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never, but it looks like he's not going to play,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sanders has shown improvement and walks without a limp,
Gailey said the Cowboys would rather play it conservatively and let
the injury heal fully, rather than chance a recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gray area,'' Gailey said. ``There are several factors.
Do we want him to get closer to 100 percent? Yes, we do. Can he
play? Probably, but will he be set back again?''
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Smith also sidelined with a strained back, the
Cowboys will go with Charlie Williams and Kevin Mathis as starting
cornerbacks. Larry Brown, signed Wednesday, will be the primary
backup and serve as a nickel cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who has missed the past three games with a fractured
right forearm, said he's excited to get back on the field and
doesn't anticipate having any problems playing with a cast on his
right arm. Offense to lend a hand
</P>
<P>
   Gailey understands his defensive patchwork will be a weakness
against the Saints, but he'd rather concentrate on the Cowboys'
strength _ their offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense is ranked fourth in the league and has
scored at least 30 points in four of the past five games. The
Saints' defense ranks 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense has been playing well,'' Gailey said. ``If we can
continue the things we are doing, we can help the defense.''
Briefly Recently signed Tyrone Hughes is expected to return
kickoffs and punts against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren will miss tomorrow's game with a
strained groin. Sherman Williams will step in as the third-down
running back.

JUNIOR COLLEGE RIVALRY REACHES BOWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CALAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Two of the top football teams in the National
Junior College Athletic Association will renew their rivalry today
in the second annual Red River Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern Oklahoma A&AMP;M College (8-3), ranked 12th in the
final regular-season NJCAA poll, meets Coffeyville (Kan.) Community
College (6-3) at 1 p.m. today at Pennington Field in Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup has tradition and a history of rivalry.
Northeastern, from Miami, Okla., and Coffeyville have combined to
win nine NJCAA national titles, and they are located within 50
miles of one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not playing for a national championship, this is the
next best thing,'' Northeastern coach Dale Patterson said. ``This
is a renewal of the Coffeyville rivalry. Even though we haven't
played in awhile, there is a rivalry still there because the
schools are so close and you want to win for recruiting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win this game and finish the year 9-3. It sounds a
lot better than 8-4. Any time you go out and play a game, it is a
matter of pride. We want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the series dates to 1925, the game today marks their
first meeting in a bowl game and their first meeting since 1995.
They were chosen for the bowl as at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern, which has six national titles, owns a 23-9-2
advantage in the all-time series.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern has won six consecutive games and is led by a
balanced offense. Tailback Josh Scobey has 1,067 yards rushing and
quarterback Sherad Poteet has passed for 1,680 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Coffeyville freshman Thad Ward leads the Red Ravens' I-formation
offense. He has rushed for 871 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. Ward
is one of 10 freshman starters for Coffeyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for the kids,'' Coffeyville coach
Skip Foster said. ``I have heard Bedford does a great job with the
Red River Bowl. I know the kids are looking forward to going down
there and playing. Most important, it gives the kids a chance to
play in one of the postseason bowl games.''

EDITORIAL: TAKING OUT THE CITY'S TRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 5:
</P>
<P>
   When New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, heard this week
that New York City was planning to unload a sizable chunk of its
garbage on her state in a few years, she did what any politician
would do in such a case _ she went ballistic. It was a feeling some
New Yorkers understood well.
</P>
<P>
   After months of waiting to see how New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani would make good on his promise to close the Fresh Kills
landfill in Staten Island, the world's largest, city residents were
also learning this week which neighborhoods could be next in New
York's big garbage lottery.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor and his staff were busily apologizing to Whitman
and explaining that New Jersey would not suffer any environmental
problems from two new transfer stations for New York's garbage,
residents of Brooklyn were hyperventilating about how a third
transfer station there could foul their air as well.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have come primarily from residents of the Red Hook
section who see the proposed new station as an added insult to an
area that already has hundreds of noisy, smelly commercial garbage
trucks lumbering through its streets.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that the mayor could have aired his plans
earlier, this proposal offers a positive first step. It begins what
should be an evolutionary process allowing the city to refine its
plan for disposing of the yearly equivalent of 76 Titanics full of
garbage, as Douglas Martin, a New York Times reporter, described it
last month. With hearings and environmental studies looming, the
public will have a chance to raise the disturbing questions about
this huge shift in waste policy.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposal moves toward using the existing city-owned
waterfront stations to ship garbage by barge to the two transfer
stations in New Jersey and one in Brooklyn where it would be
pressed into containers and sent on to privately owned landfills in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The garbage shipments have been criticized as a threat to New
Jersey's beaches and to the revival of downtown Newark, although
Giuliani says the transfer sites are already used or designated for
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether New York should add an expensive
new transfer step for all of the city's trash. Instead, planners
might consider more creative ways of retrofitting and expanding at
least some of these existing waterfront stations to put garbage in
airtight containers before it is shipped out of the city to its
final destination.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan is set to go into effect at about the time he
leaves office, or perhaps even later. In the meantime, the city is
planning to begin rerouting garbage away from Staten Island's
landfill on an ``interim'' basis. This plan is provoking far more
alarm in communities affected by it, because ``interim'' often
turns into decades in the dumping business. The best approach now
might be to stall the interim plan and focus on completing the
final plan before the deadline to close Fresh Kills.

COLLEGES DECLINE TO TAKE AD-VANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If I'd been the NCAA, before this hoops season
began I'd have taken out a big newspaper ad: ``Hey, NBA, we've got
your basketball right here!''
</P>
<P>
   If I'd been UCLA, before this hoops season began I'd have taken
out a big newspaper ad: ``If you really love this game, come watch
us play it!''
</P>
<P>
   If I'd been USC, before this hoops season began I'd have taken
out a big newspaper ad: ``We might win more basketball games than
the Lakers this year!''
</P>
<P>
   If I'd been Cal State Northridge, before this hoops season began
I'd have taken out a big newspaper ad: ``We don't have Shaquille
O'Neal. But we're in action and he isn't!''
</P>
<P>
   If I had anything to do with college basketball, I'd milk this
NBA nonsense for all it's worth, not so politely inviting NBA fans
to get their fix from me.
</P>
<P>
   Shows you what I know.
</P>
<P>
   The people who actually run college-basketball marketing have
taken a decidedly cooler approach to cashing in on the NBA's
absence. And they might be onto something.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are small so far, and the reasons might go beyond
the NBA situation, but interest in college basketball is on the
rise this season, according to the biggest national measuring
stick:
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for college basketball telecasts are up a whopping
12 percent on ESPN and a megawhopping 32 percent on ESPN2 compared
to last year, a spokesman for the cable networks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, college basketball ratings were down, so
it's reasonable to assume the NBA lockout is the difference. Also,
NHL ratings are about the same this year as last, so it's
reasonable to assume college basketball is the chief beneficiary of
the NBA's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of crossover on the fan base,'' ESPN's Dean
Diltz said of the NBA and colleges. ``Also, we've tried to
capitalize on it with increased marketing of our basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, more commercials. But nice commercials _
cartoons, with the slogan, ``Happy Action, Fun Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't have to beat basketball fans over the head with
anti-NBA slogans. We've made up our own minds:
</P>
<P>
   We're tired of waiting for the rich players and richer owners to
come back to us. We're going on with our lives and going to see the
college guys, on TV or in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA itself hasn't indulged in any NBA-baiting. And if any
universities around the country have put out blatant anti-NBA ads,
they've been ``pretty subtle,'' an NCAA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the NCAA's local members, their approach has been, well,
restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, in a brainstorming session in the USC
athletic-marketing department, somebody suggested a padlocks
giveaway at the Sports Arena; it's a lockout, get it? Somebody in a
position of authority thought better of that, though.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, one idea for a season-opening ad went something
like, ``UCLA basketball _ we're not going on strike.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said UCLA athletics marketing director Scott Mitchell, ``We
decided not to go that direction, and push our positives rather
than getting in the NBA's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a greed factor and a selfishness factor (in the NBA)
that you don't see in college sports,'' Mitchell said. ``But I
think UCLA, in its current position, is better off pushing our team
and the benefits of college basketball (than going negative).''
</P>
<P>
   As for Northridge, it never considered going after the NBA
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel like we compete with the schools or the pro
teams over the hill,'' said Brooke Michelle, who's in charge of
athletics marketing for the Matadors. ``We target the (San
Fernando) Valley. Our ticket prices are so low, we're competing
more with the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge basketball attendance at the 2,000-seat Matador Gym
is up slightly in the season's first month, but that could be
attributed to an improved home team.
</P>
<P>
   USC _ which could fit most of its crowds in a 2,000-seat gym _
has seen no increase, although marketing director Mark Ryan said
the NBA void has resulted in higher ad sales for Trojans radio
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's numbers have been mixed. It's early.
</P>
<P>
   We might discover, in the end, that the NBA and college crowds
are substantially different _ that, as USC coach Henry Bibby said,
``You have people who want to see young guys play, and you have
people who want to Shaquille O'Neal play.'' In which case the
lockout effect will be slight.
</P>
<P>
   Or we might find out that the longer Shaq remains shackled, the
more his undergraduate counterparts will win over the fans.
</P>
<P>
   This much can be said with absolute assurance: Enjoy today's
Wooden Classic at the Pond _ Pepperdine vs. seventh-ranked Kansas,
followed by 18th-ranked UCLA vs. 11th-ranked Oklahoma State. It
will be the best basketball we'll see around here until 1999 and
maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Which might just be the kind of slogan college basketball needs
this year. Direct but polite.
</P>
<P>
   No need to get nasty about it and try to steal the NBA's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, said USC's Ryan, ``I wish I had a copy of the
Lakers' mailing list.''

ARE ANNUAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT NFL REFEREES WORTH A FLIP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some officials' calls in the NFL are by
nature so close that they come down to ``a flip of a coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but shouldn't NFL referees be able to keep the actual
flips of the coins straight?
</P>
<P>
   The quality of NFL officiating is the centerpiece of an annual
debate that's raged ``since the beginning of football time,'' NFL
scouting guru Gil Brandt said. Therefore, accusations from league
executives, players and observers suggesting that officiating is at
an all-time low is definitely not new and probably not accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring example of NFL refereeing being all too human
came on Thanksgiving Day in the Pittsburgh-at-Detroit meeting. The
two clubs were tied after regulation, so a coin toss was needed to
determine which team would get the ball first in overtime. Detroit
was given the ball _ and, in the minds of the Steelers, given the
game _ because of an apparently mishandled toss of the coin.
</P>
<P>
   That call was one of a handful in the Detroit-Pittsburgh game
that TV cameras showed to be questionable. The presence of the
media might be one reason officiating seems worse than it was in
previous eras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had that coin-flip thing happened in a Colts-Bengals game,
nobody might've noticed,'' Brandt said. ``But you've got cameras
everywhere, you've got technology everywhere. I still say it's a
shame we can't harness the available technology to help officiate
the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt remains a champion of the use of replay, a measure of
reviewing controversial calls after the fact that continues to be
voted down by NFL owners. Some calls, such as pass interference,
weren't subject to review when instant replay was in effect. But
how much would replay cameras help gauge pass interference, the
most commonly disputed call in the NFL today?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest judgment call there is,'' Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``And not specific to any call made
for or against us, it's tough because nobody is really sure what
constitutes interference.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules, purposeful contact on the part of a
defender after the receiver has gone 5 yards beyond the line of
scrimmage, and before the ball has been touched by the receiver, is
illegal. But the line is fine between purposeful contact and
incidental contact, and both receivers and defenders have learned
how to gain subtle advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it's not just the cornerbacks who initiate
contact,'' said Cowboys defensive backs coach Mike Zimmer. ``It can
become a wrestling match.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brandt: ``Because the game is so much faster,
well-conditioned officials find themselves unable to catch up.
Watch closely, and you'll even see the umpire used on purpose as a
pick \Rreceivers running their defenders into the official, hoping
to `pick off' the defender\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent NFL rule changes seemed to have given the advantages to
the offense, including allowing blockers to extend their arms on
blocks and the no-contact-beyond-5-yards rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to clutch, you've got to grab, you've got to gain
any edge you can against these receivers, who are now the
thoroughbreds of the sport,'' Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green
said. ``I don't think it's a matter of poor officiating; I think
it's a matter of some teams not taking advantage of the edges
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills would disagree. They lost, 25-21, on Sunday to
New England because of what they call a ``phantom'' interference
call. The trailing Patriots tossed a ``Hail Mary'' pass into the
end zone on the game's final play, the pass caromed off receiver
Terry Glenn's chest, and the Bills began to celebrate. But while
replays seem to indicate incidental contact at worst, officials
ruled that Bills safety Henry Jones nudged Glenn and called pass
interference. New England then scored the game-winning TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if the NFL fines me,'' said Bills owner Ralph
Wilson, usually a good and quiet NFL soldier. ``This was the worst
officiating I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL did fine Wilson $50,000, but Wilson said the NFL then
apologized, admitting the officials made a mistake by calling Jones
for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs the question of how to improve the
officiating.
</P>
<P>
   NFL watchers will notice that there are no heavyweight NFL
officials; a strict conditioning program prevents that. That NFL
officials are not full time has long been a point of contention,
but most NFL executives see no advantage to changing the present
structure.
</P>
<P>
   And the league doesn't take its responsibility here lightly. On
Sunday nights, a staff of experts collects in the league offices in
New York to review the work of the NFL's 112 striped shirts. The
league demands the officiating teams make the correct call at least
90 percent of the time. Their studies indicate that the officials
make an average of three poor calls per game.
</P>
<P>
   And the coin-toss dispute has resulted in a change: The player
will now call ``heads'' or ``tails'' before the flip, rather than
while the coin is in the air. And two other officials will join the
referee in observing the process.
</P>
<P>
   NFL senior director of officiating Jerry Seeman has a motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make Super Bowl decisions,'' Seeman said, ``not Woolworth's
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, from coin tosses to pass interference, some NFL teams
seem to feel like the officiating is causing them to get
nickel-and-dimed.

TEACHER IN BOOK DISPUTE STARTS NEW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A white third-grade teacher who was threatened by two
black parents after she used the book ``Nappy Hair'' in her
Brooklyn classroom started a new assignment in a Queens school on
Friday, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Ruth Sherman, began teaching a second-grade class
at Public School 131 in Jamaica, in Community School District 29, a
school of mostly black and Hispanic middle-class students that is
close to her home in Nassau County, Long Island, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she feared for her safety, Ms. Sherman refused to return
to her job on Monday at PS 75 in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.
Two parents had threatened Ms. Sherman and called her racist at a
community meeting at the school, for using ``Nappy Hair,'' a
critically acclaimed book. They said they found the book offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It was written by a black author and scholar, Carolivia Herron,
and has been recommended by the Teachers College of Columbia
University for classroom use.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a coming-of-age story about a black girl's
appreciation of her hair; ``nappy'' refers to the kinky texture of
some black people's hair. The book was created to engender pride
and self-esteem, and Ms. Sherman said this was also her intention
in reading it to her mostly black and Hispanic students at PS 75.
</P>
<P>
   Since the uproar over her use of the book, Ms. Sherman and the
author have met and now plan to work together on a study guide to
accompany the book, the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be closer to home only because I'll feel safer,''
Ms. Sherman said Friday morning as she dashed to her car from her
two-story red-brick home and headed for her new school. ``God
forbid, if anything happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord
Pentecostal Church in downtown Brooklyn, met Friday with at least
one of the parents who lodged a complaint against Ms. Sherman, to
urge her to come forward and explain what troubles her about the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Daughtry, who was called in as a mediator by the parent after
the meeting, said the original concerns have been lost in the news
media coverage of the incident. Though he refused to disclose the
parent's name or say whether she was one of the people who
threatened Ms. Sherman, he said that she had a child in Ms.
Sherman's class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original question was: Did Ms. Sherman have the
principal's permission to use this book?'' Daughtry said. ``The
answer was no. The next question was: Was it appropriate? Now,
that's up for debate. I don't know anything about any threats over
this. I don't know who's involved in that. All I know is that this
parent's concerns have gotten lost in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman was transferred from PS 75 after two parents,
including one with a child in Ms. Sherman's class, threatened her
at a public meeting, officials said. Felix Vazquez, the
superintendent of District 32, removed Ms. Sherman from the school,
he said, for safety reasons while he determined whether the book
was appropriate for classroom use.
</P>
<P>
   He later supported Ms. Sherman but said she should have sought
permission to read the book from the principal of PS 75, Felicita
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Daughtry, who is black, said anything having to do with blacks
and their hair is potentially explosive because of stereotypes that
date back to slavery. That, he said, was the mother's concern.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is explosive stuff,'' he said. ``Those in the black
community know what I mean. Anything dealing with hair, skin color,
features and all that stuff is a tinderbox of emotions. Did she
have the sensitivity while teaching it?''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Worley, 8, who was a student in Ms. Sherman's class at
P.S. 75, said Friday that he enjoyed the book. ``I don't feel
right, because she taught me a lot of stuff,'' Antonio said. ``She
taught me how to speak right. And `Nappy Hair' was funny because
the grandfather was saying all that stuff about his granddaughter's
hair and the people were like, uh-huh. I'm so sad I don't feel like
going to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Flores, whose 8-year-old daughter, Jennifer, was a student
in Ms. Sherman's class, said it was time to move on, though the
teacher would be missed. The class, she said, is being taught by
substitute teachers until a replacement can be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that this had to happen,'' Mrs. Flores said.
``Jennifer doesn't like having the substitutes, but I've told her
she has to get used to whoever comes in after Ms. Sherman. She's
not coming back.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHERE LIFE KNOWS NO SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The urge to quarter the year into seasons is nearly
irresistible, whether the impulse is astronomical, agricultural,
liturgical or fiscal. Instead of inhabiting the undivided plain of
time, humans prefer to live in the rooms the seasons make. There is
something gratifying about seeing fall, winter, spring and summer,
the very idea of seasonality, represented, no matter how _ in a
Herrick poem or a Boucher painting or in the stiff vellum pages of
a medieval illuminated manuscript. The pleasure is so strong it
must be adaptive, a way of preparing a biological affinity in us
for what the calendar inevitably holds in store.
</P>
<P>
   But portraits of the seasons, like Keats' ode ``To Autumn'' or
Botticelli's ``La Primavera,'' give a tight, iconic view of nature.
Winter doesn't howl into the last stanza of Keats' autumn, stunning
the gnats and swallows, nor does it frostbite the naked toes of
Botticelli's vernal nymphs. Reality is less discrete. There is no
secular hymn to a day of unseasonable warmth on the cusp of winter
shortly after heavy rain in an otherwise dry autumn, though days
like that do come along. The only season Boucher never painted was
the one called mud. We live in fact in a world of margins _ every
hour an occasion of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I've been waiting for the big arctic blow to
begin, and while waiting I've been visiting the plants that
surround the house. They divide into two camps. Some insist on fall
and winter, like buckthorn, hung with nearly black berries, and
eastern wahoo, a tree whose small lobed fruits are a mordant pink.
But most of the plants I stopped to quiz _ climbing roses,
elderberry, lilacs, azaleas, rhododendron, blueberries, wisteria, a
lone magnolia _ were looking patiently toward spring. Dormant buds,
covered in bud scales, had already formed in axils and on twigs.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought of this time of year as a slow patch of
death, or stasis, in the plant world. That is the sort of thing you
believe when you take the idea of season too literally. The mild
fall may have swollen the buds a little more than usual, but what
it really did was drive me outdoors to notice them. There, at the
end of autumn, stood the whole shape of spring, held back only by
the still-dwindling daylight, by a keen, continuous apprehension of
time.

SCOTTISH POWER AND PACIFICORP SAID TO DISCUSS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottish Power PLC, which has been seeking an electric utility
in the United States, is in discussions to acquire Pacificorp, a
major provider of power in the Northwest, people close to the talks
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They said executives from the two companies were discussing a
possible combination over the weekend, and while those discussions
could fall apart at any time, it was expected that a deal could be
announced as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a deal, it would be the first purchase of an entire
U.S. utility by a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the transaction under discussion was not known. But
two British newspapers, The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph
of London, first reported last month that Scottish Power was
interested in buying Pacificorp for $6.6 billion. Both companies
have declined to comment on any possible discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, supplies electricity
to about 5 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland. It also
has operations in telecommunications, water and waste services.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been interested in expanding into the U.S.
electricity market, which is opening to competition. It was
reported to have discussed possible purchases of Florida Progress
Corp. and Cinergy Corp., a Midwest utility based in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   A takeover of Pacificorp would complete a big reversal for the
company, which was viewed as a potential buyer of a British utility
earlier this year. It lost a bidding war for Energy Group PLC of
Britain to Texas Utilities Co. in August.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Pacificorp's stock has fallen sharply and the company
has become the subject of considerable takeover speculation. Its
shares closed Friday at $20.75, up $1.3125, and the highest in
nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to grow through acquisition, Pacificorp has said
it will focus attention on its 1.4 million customers in the Pacific
Northwest. Its subsidiaries, Pacific Power and Light and Utah Power
and Light, operate in nine Western states. The company also owns an
Australian utility, Powercor.
</P>
<P>
   A purchase of Pacificorp by Scottish Power would require
approval of U.S. energy regulators and the shareholders of both
companies.

CAPITALS SCORE FOUR IN FINAL PERIOD TO BREAK SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were the kind of routine shots Tommy Salo
allowed into the Islanders' net with frequency last season. Three
shots, all of which appeared to be stoppable, got through Salo in
the third period Friday night, and that was more than enough for
the Washington Capitals to beat the Islanders, 5-1, at the MCI
Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was Salo's worst performance of the season, and it could not
have come at a worse time. The loss was the fourth straight for the
Islanders, who are at the bottom of the Atlantic Division and
sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Salo, who faced 28 shots, allowed four goals in the third
period, three in the span of 1 minute 39 seconds. The first two
were scored on weak shots by Calle Johansson, giving the Capitals
leads of 2-1 and 3-1. Salo, whose solid play through the first two
months of the season elicited considerable praise from coaches and
opposing players, was not screened on either of those goals.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Eastern Conference champion Capitals, who were
playing without their captain, Adam Oates, also got goals from
Peter Bondra and Steve Konowalchuk in the third period. Oates was
sidelined with a nagging groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had lost three straight before Friday night, and in
an attempt to shake his team and its struggling goaltender Olaf
Kolzig out of their slump, Capitals Coach Ron Wilson benched
Kolzig. Kolzig, whose record has dipped to 6-10-1 with a 2.99 goals
against average and an .885 save percentage, was ranked 37th among
the 41 goalies who have played a minimum of 360 minutes. He was
replaced by Rick Tabaracci, who, in his fourth start of the season,
made 22 stops.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaracci's most impressive save came late in the first period
when he stopped the flashy Mariusz Czerkawski on a penalty shot.
Czerkawski, the Islanders' best stick handler, was awarded the shot
after he was pulled down by Joe Reekie on a breakaway with 39.8
seconds left in the period. Crzerkawksi faked left, right, then
left again on the penalty shot, but the elastic Tabaracci stopped a
backhand attempt and kept the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams scored once in a fast-paced and exciting second
period. Robert Reichel gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead at 4:39 when
he deflected a shot from the point by defenseman Zdeno Chara. Ken
Klee scored for the Capitals at 14:48 by beating a screened Salo
over the glove from the middle of right circle.

COUNTY'S GOP DEBATES FUTURE OF ACCUSED CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOHEMIA, N.Y. _ Faced with a leadership crisis, Suffolk County
Republicans closed ranks Friday as they privately debated the
future of their party chairman, John Powell, after his arrest on
Thursday on federal bribery and truck-theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   While party officials expressed shock and dismay at Powell's
legal problems, there was a notable absence of praise from those he
had helped put in office.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who once credited Powell with delivering the
votes from Suffolk County that won him the governor's mansion, said
Friday: ``Obviously, it was very shocking. Beyond that, the process
will have to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who was in Washington meeting with congressional
leaders and other Republican governors, was asked whether he
thought Powell should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these charges are pending,'' Pataki said, ``it's going
to be very difficult for him to exercise any real leadership role
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before his arrest, Powell was criticized by some state and
local Republican leaders for failing to produce the same hefty
voter turnout in the November election as he had in the past and
was blamed by some for losses, including the apparent defeat of the
Republican state attorney general, Dennis Vacco. Republicans
outnumber Democrats 2-to-1 in Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   While stressing that Powell was innocent until proved otherwise,
political insiders here and in Albany said the county party needed
to quickly find a new leader who could oversee the selection of
candidates for several important elections in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that the federal case against Powell, which was
based on a yearlong investigation that spanned three states and
involved wiretaps by numerous informers, appeared to be too strong
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the dust to settle before we make our next
move,'' said one highly placed Republican official at county
government offices in Hauppauge. ``It's all anyone has been talking
about all day. The phones are ringing and the wires are hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders said they were surprised to learn that agents of
the FBI showed up at Powell's home in Medford at dawn on Thursday
and led him away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to give me back my reputation?'' Powell asked as
the agents later escorted him into U.S. District Court in
Uniondale.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 38, who dismissed the charges as ``a joke,'' was back at
home Friday morning, having posted a $100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   He told friends that he was stunned by the arrest and, as a
political realist who became one of the youngest top Republican
leaders in the country when he took charge of the county
organization in 1995, was questioning his chances for survival.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned on charges including trading in stolen trucks
and taking bribes to allow illegal landfill dumping in Brookhaven,
the largest town in Suffolk County and the base of Powell's
political power where he once worked as a payload operator in the
Department of Public Works.
</P>
<P>
   As Powell reviewed the 76-page federal complaint filed against
him with his lawyer, Raymond Perini, Friday morning, workers at
party headquarters were trying to carry on as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought in a half a gallon of milk for our coffee and we're
hanging out doing what we usually do, figuring out how to win
elections,'' said Alan Eysen, the chief spokesman for the party and
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Powell planned to finish his current two-year term
as party chairman, which runs through next September.
</P>
<P>
   Eysen issued a brief statement signed by the party's executives,
including its vice chairman, Frank Volz, and treasurer, Marietta
Seaman, saying that while Powell ``is now accused of a variety of
allegations, none has been put to the legal test.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added: ``The presumption of innocence is a basic
tenet of our democratic society, and this applies to Powell. He,
therefore, will continue to carry out his duties as party chairman
into the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How long that foreseeable future lasts rests with top Republican
elected officials, including the Suffolk County executive, Robert
Gaffney, who spent much of the day discussing the matter privately
with party members on Long Island and in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, he issued a brief statement saying, ``Obviously, I am
shocked and dismayed by the charges, which, if true, constitute
serious violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, a former agent of the FBI, noted that the charges
against Powell had been brought jointly by the U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District, the FBI and the Suffolk County Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   After a careful reading of the complaint, several political
insiders said the demands of preparing a legal defense would leave
Powell with little time for party business.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of the party's effectiveness will come next month
during a special election in Suffolk's 5th Legislative District,
recently made vacant by the departure of a popular Democrat, Nora
Bredes. Candidates remain to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fallout is bound to affect the race in the 5th District,''
said legislator Steve Levy, a Democrat. ``You won't even have to
raise the subject of John Powell. It will just be there, an
undercurrent that the voters won't ignore.''

ITALIAN HURT; SWEDEN TAKES COMMANDING LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MILAN, Italy _ The Davis Cup has long made a habit of transforming
mundane encounters into memorable ones, and that habit was not
broken Friday night, which ended with Sweden leading Italy by 2-0
in the Davis Cup final. The nearly five-hour opening match came to
a close abruptly and prematurely with Andrea Gaudenzi in great pain
and Magnus Norman in great spirits after a 6-7 (9-11), 7-6 (7-0),
4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0) victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudenzi, Italy's top player, had rallied from a 4-0 deficit in
the fifth set with a lot of help from the nervous Norman to take a
6-5 lead. But on the final point of that 11th game, Gaudenzi hit a
serve and felt a tendon crack in his fragile right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   As Norman's return missed, Gaudenzi hunched over at midcourt and
clenched his fists. At first, it appeared he was merely expressing
emotion, but it soon became clear that he was hurting. Gaudenzi has
undergone two operations on his right shoulder, most recently on
Oct. 1 when he had arthroscopic surgery to clean out the joint and
to alleviate the pain that had forced him to take cortisone
injections during Italy's semifinal victory over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even lift a cup on the changeover,'' he said.

   Gaudenzi lifted himself out of his chair and returned to the
court but not for long. Norman held at love to even the match at
6-6. Gaudenzi then gamely attempted to serve. He lost the first
point when Norman greeted his soft second serve with a huge
forehand return winner. In the middle of the next exchange, the
Italian stopped playing, shook his head and trudged toward the net
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with the pain for five hours, and I couldn't stand it
anymore; at that stage the pain was just too big,'' Gaudenzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman had prevailed, and Sweden's excellent chances of
capturing this final only got better when Magnus Gustafsson crushed
Davide Sanguinetti, 6-1, 6-4, 6-0, in the second singles match.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes now need only one victory in the final three matches
to defend their title and earn their seventh Davis Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, who are seeking their first title since 1976, will
have to rely on Sanguinetti to play with Diego Nargiso against the
fine Swedish doubles team of Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis that Norman and Gaudenzi played was not always pretty
_ there were unforced errors and missed opportunities aplenty _ but
it was always earnest. When Norman met Gaudenzi at the net, the two
baseliners with streaks of clay across their shirts embraced and
exchanged compliments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very, very sorry for Andrea because he was playing an
unbelievable match,'' Norman said.

 CAPE CANAVERAL: million apiece.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a May 22 report, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, estimated the station's building
cost at $53 billion and its total including operations at $96
billion _ not including the cost of decommissioning by sending it
plummeting into the ocean, for which NASA has no estimate so far.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that are the contributions of the international
partners, such as $6.7 billion from the European Space Agency and
an amount from Russia that is still uncertain because of Moscow's
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, experts put the estimated cost at no less than $110
billion, adding, however, that it could well be higher and that
only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than the Manhattan Project but less than Apollo,''
said John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington. The Manhattan Project to
build the atom bomb cost about $20 billion in today's dollars, he
said, and the Apollo program that repeatedly put men on the Moon
about $125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pike backs the station as smart politically if it helps
stabilize Russia. But many scientists fault it as an enormous waste
of money, saying its huge costs and growing budget overruns have
already hurt NASA programs and are destined to spread pain further.
</P>
<P>
   Leif Robinson, editor of Sky and Telescope, a top astronomy
magazine, based in Cambridge, Mass., in the current issue strongly
criticized how America killed the half-built Superconducting
Supercollider, an $8 billion project meant to illuminate the
building blocks of matter, but backed the international space
station, or ISS, which he ridiculed as a ``flying fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the atom smasher's ghost, he wrote, ``will rise up and
drag the ISS down to the hell it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers hail the outpost as a foreign-policy coup and a stepping
stone to human exploration of Mars and more distant worlds, saying
its studies of human physiology are a must for learning how people
can venture far from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ever completed, that is. Some experts doubt that the
political wherewithal exists to finish its dozens of assembly
flights over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. McClain of NASA headquarters said that at least in
terms of U.S. gear, some 70 percent had already been finished and
that fabrication work was well under way on the remaining 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Private analysts say that with hundreds of tons of hardware
already in the assembly pipeline, and tens of billions of dollars
already spent, the project, though controversial, probably has the
political momentum to keep pushing ahead for many years to come.

OFFICERS CLEARED IN SHOOTING OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two police officers who shot and critically wounded a
teen-ager who was carrying a water pistol last August acted
appropriately, since they mistook the toy for a gun, the Brooklyn
district attorney said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, Michael Jones, 16, was hit by six of the 16 shots
fired at him during an Aug. 23 encounter on a Bedford-Stuyvesant
street about 2:30 a.m. The officers, Sgt. Michael Jacobellis and
Officer David Gross, who were working in plain clothes, had
confronted the teen-ager after they were alerted to a report of a
gun-brandishing bicyclist.
</P>
<P>
   Michael was hospitalized for two months and is still unable to
walk, a spokesman for his family said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was one in a series of incidents in which
teen-agers and younger children were shot by police officers who
said they mistook toy guns for real ones. It led to renewed
arguments that highly realistic toy guns were still easy to buy
despite laws banning their sale and possession.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, Charles Hynes, said an investigation by
his office of the shooting strongly upheld the officers' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sequence of events initiated by Michael Jones created a
volatile and dangerous condition causing these officers to take
appropriate police action,'' Hynes said, referring to a report that
the youth, who had no criminal record, had been pointing what
appeared to be a type of particularly lethal semiautomatic handgun
at passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said the water pistol ``closely resembled a real weapon''
and he also cited Gross' statement that when he shouted, ``Police,
freeze!'' Michael ``pointed the gun at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding and the methods of Hynes' investigation _ evidence
was not presented to a grand jury _ were immediately denounced by
the spokesman for the Jones family, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who said
the finding was political.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you have a situation with 16 shots and it doesn't
warrant a grand jury investigation?'' Sharpton asked, adding that
such an investigation would have been more effective in getting at
the truth. Hynes' reasoning ``does not make sense to me,'' Sharpton
said, because ``I don't know how he justifies the 16 shots,'' 15 of
which investigators said Gross fired.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also said he did not believe the officer's statement
that Michael pointed the gun at him. ``Why would you brandish a gun
at the police when you know it's not a real gun?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that he would ask the U.S. Justice Department to
review the case and that the Jones family planned to file a lawsuit
against the city.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hynes, Patrick Clark, said the case was not
presented to a grand jury, because the district attorney ``reviewed
the evidence and determined it did not warrant presentation.'' As
for Sharpton's contention that Hynes had made a ``political''
finding, Clark said his conclusion was based ``solely on the
evidence and the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The teen-ager told investigators that he had heard the officer
shout ``Freeze,'' but that ``before he could respond there were a
hail of bullets,'' Hynes said. The youth also said that while he
was on the ground, wounded, one of the officers approached and
fired twice more into his legs, Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   But ballistic and other forensic evidence and the account of a
civilian witness indicated that this was not the case, Hynes said.
``The overwhelming evidence is that it did not happen,'' he said.

ROLE REVERSALS FOR TEAMS AND QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ When the Giants met the Arizona Cardinals on
Oct. 12, 1997, Kent Graham was the starting quarterback for the
Cardinals and Danny Kanell was making his first start as the
Giants' quarterback, substituting for the injured Dave Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, the Giants have returned to
Arizona and now Graham is their starter and Kanell has been demoted
after an unceremonious disintegration this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer is a rising star of the Cardinals, perhaps of the
league. Brown is his backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of irony in this game,'' Graham said this week.
``It's all over the place. Now let's not have the ultimate irony
and I get hurt in this game like I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was forced from the game in 1997 with an ankle injury,
and the Giants won easily. He never got his starting job back
because his absence opened the door for Plummer, who won the job
with an unorthodox yet efficient and exciting style.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crossroads game for the Giants, too. Kanell played well
in his first start that day, the first of seven victories in 10
games he orchestrated. Kanell played well again later in the season
against the Cardinals, and that ultimately made Brown expendable.
</P>
<P>
   In the off season, each team decided that it had a young
quarterback worth building around. Each team also decided it wanted
Graham as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals offered more money, but Graham, who had been
drafted by New York and played there between 1992 and 1994, chose
the Giants. Graham may have also determined that the Giants would
give him a better chance to play in the long run, although he will
not admit that this was any part of his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Graham guessed that Kanell was on shakier ground than
Plummer. If so, then he guessed right. Graham is making his third
consecutive start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had few options other than signing with Arizona, has
played only once this year as Plummer's backup _ against the Giants
in October in a 34-17 rout by the Giants. Brown came in during
mop-up time to a chorus of boos from the Giants Stadium fans.
</P>
<P>
   As Brown said after the game: ``The Giants fans got what they
wanted today. I got to play and the Cardinals lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have done more than just switch quarterbacks in a
year's time. They have nearly switched roles. Last year, when the
Giants defeated the Cardinals they were on their way to a playoff
appearance. The Cardinals would finish 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the 6-6 Cardinals are trying to solidify their
tenuous hold on the final wild-card spot in the National Football
Conference. The 5-8 Giants are trying to avoid double digits in
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder sometimes how so much can change in a year,''
Graham said. ``But this game picks you up one day and humbles you
the next. Or vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   And Graham did acknowledge that playing well this Sunday would
have extra meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it means a lot to me,'' he said. ``Having the
opportunity to go back to a place you left just a year later is
unique and you want to make a good memory for yourself in that
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that they didn't want me, because they made a
nice offer to keep me; it's that you're playing against guys you
know well and coaches you know well. You want to show that you're
doing a good job. And it means a lot because I really want to win
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham then stated the obvious, given the recent history of
these two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how our quarterback situation is going to
play out,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I'm pretty sure this is true: If we win, I get
to keep the job. So I want to win.''

 ARTHUR GREEN, PSYCHIATRIST WORKED WITH ABUSED CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Arthur Henry Green, a psychiatrist noted for his
expertise in working with abused children, died on Nov. 25 at his
home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was melanoma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In two decades on the Columbia University faculty, Green
established an international reputation with his research and
treatment of physically and sexually abused children. His work
influenced the ways such abuse is treated in the United States, and
the programs he designed served as models in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Green was the founding director of the Family Center at Babies
Hospital in the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, where he
played Santa Claus for his patients. He was also a senior
psychiatrist at Presbyterian Hospital and a professor of clinical
psychiatry in pediatrics at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He was also associated with the Child Development Center of the
Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, and in 1975, as a
clinical associate professor at Downstate Medical Center, he
founded the Brooklyn Family Center for the treatment of abuse
victims and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Green was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens. He graduated
from the University of Rochester in 1951 and earned his medical
degree at the University of Amsterdam in 1955. He trained in
psychiatry at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and at Roosevelt
Hospital in Manhattan; he trained in adult and child psychoanalysis
at Columbia University , where he also began his first teaching
assignment in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was a frequent guest speaker at European conferences on
mental health and appeared on television and radio programs in
Europe and the United States. Green was the author of two textbooks
on the mistreatment of children, one written with Dr. Diane
Schetky, that remain in print. At his death he was finishing a book
about his experience with Bosnian refugee children.
</P>
<P>
   Green is survived by his wife, Carol Breitman Green; a daughter,
Susanna Green, and a son, Jonathan, both of Manhattan.

RON ARTEST: ALWAYS AT WORK AND READY TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Queensbridge, the section of Long Island City
where Ron Artest grew up, not being tough means being run over. Not
depending on others can mean not surviving, and the easy road
almost always ends in disaster. Through fistfights and athletic
competition, those lessons were embedded into Artest's mentality.
So excuse him if he expects nothing less than the ultimate effort
from himself and his St. John's teammates on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I came from, and the way I grew up, made me tough,''
said Artest, the sophomore forward who will lead the 25th-ranked
Red Storm into its Big East season opener Saturday at Boston
College (2-3). ``Fighting all the time, every day. That's how I got
to be like I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a fiery, uncompromising teammate like Artest can often
lead to tense moments. But it can also make a squad aggressive,
confident and unyielding. In winning five of its first seven games,
coach Mike Jarvis' Red Storm has seen both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after a second straight late-game collapse cost St.
John's a victory over 14th-ranked Purdue in the Chase Preseason
National Invitation Tournament, Artest loudly vented his
frustration in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked about trying to stay mentally tough,'' Artest
said of the incident. ``It was all positive, nothing negative. But
it got pretty emotional. I was yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   In its next two games, though, the Red Storm righted itself,
running away from St. Francis of Brooklyn and Hofstra without
looking back. Doing the same against Boston College, an opponent on
its level, will serve as proof that Artest's declamation got
through.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who in his first season at St. John's seems to have
developed a great rapport with his players, likes Artest's
willingness to step forward and lead. But like his predecessor,
Fran Fraschilla, he is trying to get Artest to be more tactful when
trying to get the best out of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to help him further develop his leadership skills
by doing a better job of leading by example and not leading so much
in a vocal manner,'' Jarvis said. ``Because emotions can sometimes
get the best of you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Artest does not provide a fine example
for his teammates to follow. The muscular 6-foot-7-inch, 246-pound
small forward is a study in confident, hard-nosed play. Constantly
in motion in the Red Storm's hectic and fast-paced style, Artest
sprints up and down the floor, plays near the rim, and pounds
bodies with opponents until the whistle blows.
</P>
<P>
   And though he was only a second-team all-Big East preseason
selection, he considers no opponent to be better than he is. Fully
convinced that he could excel against Stanford's big and ballyhooed
front line, he scored 15 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in the
heart-wrenching 55-53 loss to the Cardinal last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go home and have people saying, `You played soft,'''
said Artest, explaining the reason for his ruggedness on the court.
``When I go home and talk to everybody, I want them to say, `Yeah,
you represented.' I try to represent where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just in games when the cameras are rolling, but in practice
as well. Jarvis, who has coached high school and college basketball
since 1968, said he has had only two players with a work ethic
equal to that of Artest _ Patrick Ewing and Rumeal Robinson, both
of whom played for Jarvis at Rindge and Latin High School in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronny would certainly fit in their class,'' Jarvis said.
``They worked hard in every drill and that's what made them
special. He doesn't work hard occasionally or once in a while; he
works hard every day, all of the time. That's why Ronny has a
chance for greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Artest's tremendous potential has not been disputed since his
days at Manhattan's LaSalle Academy, where he earned all-America
status as a senior. Though only a part-time starter last season, he
showed that he could one day become one of the nation's top
players.
</P>
<P>
   In his first career start, he scored 24 points and tied a school
record with five 3-pointers in a victory over American University
of Puerto Rico. He also torched Boston College for a career-high 26
points and became perhaps more of an inspirational leader than the
seniors Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton during a late-season
winning streak that helped the Red Storm advance to its first
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 14.8 points and 6 rebounds this year, Artest would
probably score more on a lesser team. But the Red Storm has five
players averaging double figures in points, a fact that excites
Artest more than having the team's highest-scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident on Wednesday, when the freshman Erick
Barkley stole the spotlight by sinking five 3-pointers and scoring
25 points against Hofstra. Far from being upset about not leading
the club in scoring, Artest was raising his hands every time
Barkley hit a jumper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the toughness, the confidence and the work ethic, the
unselfishness comes from his experiences in Queensbridge.
``Everything happens for a reason, and I guess fighting for my
friends all of the time made me a team player,'' Artest said. ``I
just don't want to be selfish. I put the team first, way ahead of
individual statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   A byproduct of Artest's unselfishness is his versatility.
Because he wants to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to help
the team win, he has not left any part of his game undeveloped. His
strength and leaping ability enable him to rebound and score
inside, and he handles the ball well enough to lead the fast break
and penetrate against halfcourt defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Though his build makes him look like a low-post player, he leads
the Red Storm with 15 3-point makes in 33 attempts. And, as he did
in limited duty last season, he leads the team in blocked shots and
is second to Barkley in assists (4.1) and steals (2.3).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an unbelievably versatile game,'' Jarvis said. ``In a
year or so, he will legitimately vie for college basketball's
player of the year award if he continues to grow and develop and
keeps the same work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Being from Queensbridge, he probably will. After all, anything
less would not be representing.

EX-UNION CHIEF SAYS VOTE-FIXING WAS RESPONSE TO FOES' FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs first 3 grafs to alter lede; adds 2 grafs at end;
tightening and polishing throughout.)  (bl/js) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former municipal union executive has told
prosecutors that he and others tampered with a 1996 contract
ratification vote because they thought opponents were doing the
same, lawyers and officials who have been briefed on the
prosecutors' investigation say.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Martin Lubin, resigned last month as the
associate director of District Council 37, the city's largest
municipal union, after admitting that he knew about the tampering.
Officials say Lubin has told investigators how union officials
stuffed ballot boxes with thousands of fraudulent votes after early
returns convinced them that city workers would reject the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year contract, which included an unpopular wage freeze
in the first two years, was ultimately approved in February 1996,
although opponents of the contract immediately denounced the
balloting as rigged. People familiar with the investigation said
prosecutors have not found evidence of vote-tampering by opponents
of the contract, as Lubin alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin, who had been second in command at the union, is one of
the highest-ranking officials of the union to be interviewed by
investigators directing the inquiry into embezzlement and kickbacks
in the 120,000-member union. He is the third union official to tell
investigators about ballot tampering on the contract, which set the
pattern for ensuing settlements with other city unions. Those
unions, angered by the revelations of fraud, have demanded that the
mayor renegotiate their contracts, without success.
</P>
<P>
   The district council's executive director, Stanley Hill, was
forced to take an unpaid leave of absence a week ago after the
fraud was revealed. It is now being run by a representative of the
parent union. Lubin told investigators that Hill never knew about
the vote fraud scheme, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have told investigators that most of the fraudulent
ballots were cast in a local representing clerical workers, where
the official tally showed 10,002 votes for ratification and 2,265
against. The huge margin of victory in that local cemented
ratification of the contract, which was approved 19,513 to 14,438.

   The lawyers and officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said prosecutors were told by witnesses that Lubin and
others initially became concerned the ratification vote would fail
after steaming open several hundred completed mail ballots from
several locals and finding that most members were voting against
the contract. In response, the union leaders began a large-scale
effort to submit fraudulent ballots in the clerical workers union,
some in the names of workers who had not voted.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin told investigators that allies of Hill were particularly
concerned when, during the weeks of balloting, the hospital workers
local reported a huge vote against the contract, 4,402 to 34,
officials said. They said allies of Hill believed that that tally
might have been rigged, and they decided to cast fraudulent ballots
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   James Butler, the leader of the hospital workers local, denied
any irregularities in the voting by his members. ``I had no reason
to fix anything,'' he said. ``My members were mad as hell. They
didn't have job security and they were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, after Lubin and an assistant, Mark Shaplo, admitted
knowing of the vote fraud, District Council 37's parent union, the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, took
control of the district council, forcing Hill to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Lubin's lawyer, Pamela Hayes, a former
prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney's office, accompanied
her client to his meeting with investigators. Ms. Hayes would not
comment on whether her client had been interviewed. ``I can't tell
you if he said anything, for obvious reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayes said that Lubin, 57, was upset that he had had to
resign his union post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unfortunate,'' she said, ``because aside from this
particular instance, he has not been involved in any kickbacks or
anything like that. He's a decent guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Lubin said they thought he acted out of concern
for Hill, since rejection of the pact would have been a personal
embarrassment and a setback in his relationship with Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani. They called his role in the fraud limited, and said he
had been asked by others to go to the district council's offices on
a Saturday, when he marked some ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not the mastermind,'' said one associate.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin has not been charged with any crime. Tampering with
ballots could result in charges of falsifying business records.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenthal, president of the motor vehicle operators' local
and a harsh critic of the union leadership, said that in recent
days, officials of other locals have agreed to talk to
investigators. ``I am told that there are a lot of people coming in
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Castleman, chief of investigations for the Manhattan
district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, declined to comment. ``Lots
of rumors are flying around, and people would be well advised not
to believe all of what they are hearing,'' he said.
