PENALTY SINKS AMERICAONE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After losing a major battle with the
gales of Hauraki Gulf Friday, Paul Cayard brought AmericaOne back
in street-fighting form Saturday, going to the wire against Italy's
Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   But with 250 yards to the finish, an extremely controversial
penalty call gave Luna Rossa a win, taking the Italian team to 3-1
in the best-of-nine competition.
</P>
<P>
   With the spinnakers billowing in a 16-knot breeze down the last
leg, Luna Rossa to the left and AmericaOne to the right, Cayard
gybed just ahead of the Prada team and was penalized for failing to
keep clear of an overlapped boat.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's tactician Torben Grael called for the penalty flag, and
after conferring, the two jury boats agreed that AmericaOne was
guilty of a foul. With no time left to do a penalty turn, Luna
Rossa won the race by a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a BS call,'' said Cayard. ``He came from behind me. He
didn't have an overlap.'' Later, Cayard said, ``I'm not sure what
the call was. I thought we sailed clear ahead, but the ump took the
race away from us. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the umpires were firm on their ruling that Cayard had gybed
too close and below proper course. As the silver boat crossed the
line behind AmericaOne, the committee boat threw up the large
yellow flag signaling a win for Prada and the 600-boat spectator
fleet erupted in horn-blowing mayhem. It was one of the greatest
America's Cup races in memory.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's loss to Prada in gale winds, Cayard's dark gray
boat from San Francisco limped home broken and beaten, having
withdrawn from Race 3 with a badly damaged mast, sails and gear
broken, one man in the hospital, and one with a bruised back.
</P>
<P>
   So few expected Cayard's street fight that allowed AmericaOne to
take control of the race early, and for the next five legs. First
off the start line, AmericaOne locked up on a long left-hand drag
race that proved little speed difference between the two boats.
Positioned better, with starboard rights, AmericaOne beat Luna
Rossa around the mark by 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But downwind on Leg 2, as Italian skipper Francesco de Angelis
forced his bow in on the windward side of AmericaOne, Cayard
responded with a luffing move. But it didn't pay off until
AmericaOne suffered another split spinnaker _ the eighth one of 44
races since October.
</P>
<P>
   With the spinnaker billowing like a huge lime-green pennant
flag, Cayard now could spin his bow at Prada with a nasty luff. In
fact, freed from the encumbrance of the spinnaker, Cayard was able
to turn Prada so far upwind, it lost control of its own spinnaker,
crash-gybed, and ended heading back toward the upwind mark.
</P>
<P>
   As they controlled the mayhem on board, the Italian boat spun
back to the leeward mark, but now trailed AmericaOne by 39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the next two legs, Grael and de Angelis probed
the lead of AmericaOne, and made a gain as AmericaOne lost its jib
sheet halfway up Leg 3.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard and tactician John Kostecki managed to play the
steady west wind to maintain the cardinal match-rule _ staying
between the trailing boat and the next mark. In and out of a heavy
rain squall, the two boats thrashed through the seas, but when the
sun suddenly swelled back over the gulf, AmericaOne was still five
lengths ahead, and appeared to be cruising to a win that would even
the score at two wins.
</P>
<P>
   But just after the fifth mark, as they started the run for the
finish three miles away, AmericaOne made what now seems the fatal
mistake. Prada instituted a gybing duel early in the leg, then set
up to the left on starboard from AmericaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than gybe a final time with Prada, AmericaOne allowed de
Angelis to steer away and get some separation for a possible
passing lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thought the race was over,'' said Grael. ``We were
just lucky to have it (the separation) and once and we were very
happy to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the earlier luffing match, Grael said: ``For a boat without a
spinnaker to luff a boat with a full spinnaker going 10 knots . . .
it's just uncivilized.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Leg 6 developed, Cayard's problems led to the Italian
payback. AmericaOne's headsail was not right for the lightening
conditions, and as Cayard and Kostecki tried to decide whether to
make a gybe peel, it was clear that Prada was closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Getting near the finish, Cayard drove at Prada to try and gybe
in front and force de Angelis and Grael to gybe away to the left
again.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap had closed so much by that point, AmericaOne's gybe,
made beyond the bow line of Luna Rossa, was judged gybing too
close, or failing to stay clear of an overlapped boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard rode back in on a quiet boat. With four races to win in
the next five, Cayard pointed out that he has sailed with his back
to the wall before _ most notably when he was down, 3-1, in the
1992 challenger finals and beat New Zealand at the helm of Italy's
Il Moro.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do now,'' said Cayard, ``is go out and win some
races.''
</P>
<P>
   To our readers: Because New Zealand is 18 hours ahead of US East
Coast time, all action takes place a day ahead (i.e. a Sunday noon
race there is taking place Saturday evening here). To avoid
confusion, all time references in America's Cup stories will
reflect when the events took place according to Eastern Standard
Time.

MCCAIN WALKS A TIGHTROPE IN N.H. PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER AND KRIS MAYES 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   break primary, John McCain is in the delicate position of
needing to attract many of the state's 275,000 independent voters
without alienating the core GOP conservatives who could be critical
to his later success.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky dance step.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's standing as a ``reform candidate'' has appeal for
voters of all parties, and that's fine in New Hampshire, where
undeclared primary voters will be permitted to cast either
Republican or Democratic ballots Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the McCain campaign believes its candidate's popularity
outside the Republican Party would make him the most electable of
the five GOP presidential contenders in November.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain risks jeopardizing his conservative credentials if he
appears to move too far to the center _ on abortion, for example _
for the sake of winning over New Hampshire's independents.
</P>
<P>
   From New Hampshire, McCain moves to conservative South Carolina,
where he will campaign nearly non-stop until that state's Feb. 19
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be treading a fine line,'' said GOP consultant
Lyn Nofziger, who was an aide to Ronald Reagan when he was
president. ``If he does well in New Hampshire, he doesn't want to
go down to South Carolina and look like he's flip-flopping on the
issues. And you can bet the (George W.) Bush and (Steve) Forbes
people will be nailing him on any flip-flops down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign insists it's neither abandoning party
principles nor gearing its New Hampshire strategy just toward the
``undeclareds,'' who make up a whopping 37 percent of the state's
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't cede conservative territory to anybody,'' said John
Weaver, McCain's national political director. ``We'll do very well
among Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   It's shaping up as a tight race in New Hampshire, targeted by
McCain long ago as his ``Ground Zero.'' He skipped campaigning in
the Iowa caucuses and instead has wagered almost everything on New
Hampshire, South Carolina and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is 9 points up in some statewide polls, McCain
officials won't venture beyond predicting a close one-two finish
with Bush, the Texas governor who leads in the national polls and
in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with starting at zero and Bush having $75 million,
anything that comes close, whether it's 1 point down or 1 point up,
is a victory for us,'' McCain's New Hampshire director, Mike
Dennehy, said. ``It just proves that he's not the inevitable
nominee that he said he was going to be. He has the entire
Republican establishment on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a success story. Is the success story a win?'' said
Weaver, the political director. ``That will be up to the pundits.
But the fact that we start with 3 percent, with no organization
driving a van around the state _ yeah, I would consider that a
success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of McCain's backers say they don't identify with either
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am never going to be a Republican; I am never going to be a
Democrat,'' said Steve Barba, 53, of tiny Dixville Notch, which is
home to 29 voters in the northern part of the state. Its residents
traditionally gather at the old Balsams resort and cast the
primary's first votes, at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Barba selected McCain partly because he believes his leadership
transcends party membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, I was looking for a leader, a person
willing to stand up and move in a direction that he could bring
followers to him. I have that assessment of both McCain and
(Democratic candidate Bill) Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain is pleased to have Barba's support _ he ac
tively courted the 29 Dixville voters _ he is also eager to wave
the Republican flag, lest he be perceived as somehow disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud conservative Republican. I have a 17-year record
of conservatism,'' McCain told a recent gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-abortion activists questioned McCain's conservative
credentials when he said in August that he would not support ``in
the short term, or even the long term,'' the repeal of ``Roe vs.
Wade,'' the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. Then
he said last week that it would be a family decision if his teenage
daughter got pregnant and wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a Senate record in opposition to abortion,
partial-birth abortion and federal funding of abortion. He has said
the attacks on him are in retaliation for his proposal to reform
the campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, among other interest
groups, believes McCain's proposed overhaul would stifle political
speech.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's call to limit the influence of special-interest groups
is a major reason for his appeal to independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one New Hampshire pollster believes the Arizonan's
independent support is shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Recent tracking polls by pollster Dick Bennett's American
Research Group indicate that independents, who were once planning
to enter the GOP race, may now be eyeing the Democratic primary
instead.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bennett, about 7 percent of New Hampshire voters
are independent, socially moderate women who were once looking to
vote for McCain in order to defeat Bush but who now may want to
weigh in in behalf of Bradley against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were with McCain because they thought it would do the
most good; there is some softening there,'' Bennett said. ``A lot
now depends on what Bradley does.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's support among older Republican women, a key group of
largely undecided voters, may also be dwindling, according to
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the weaknesses of the McCain campaign has been that it
hasn't targeted older Republican women,'' Bennett said. ``The
veterans' appeal doesn't translate to women. They are more
party-loyal and think Bush can win, and they don't see anything
wrong with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still a lot of voter movement, the final days
of the primary campaign have been remarkably docile, according to
those who faced off in 1996. Steve Forbes, who carpet-bombed the
state with negative ads four years ago, has largely held his fire
this year. And the skirmishing between McCain and Bush that began
several weeks ago over taxes has died down as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different environment this year,'' said Bill Dal Col,
Forbes' campaign manager during both elections. ``There are
different candidates and different issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the other candidates, McCain's strategy finally will
rest on organization.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign plans to post volunteers at every polling site to
check in identified McCain supporters. If one does not show up at a
poll by midafternoon, the voter will get a reminder call from the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the other campaigns have the organization we
have here,'' Dennehy said. &QL;

GOING STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have it on very good authority the Rams are going to run away
with Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   My celestial source said so.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Tammy and she's a kindred spirit of Georgia
Frontiere, the St. Louis Rams owner who is such a firm believer in
the stars she once had her players' astronomical charts done.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy is an astrologer and tarot card reader who confessed to
knowing nothing about football. When you're clairvoyant you don't
need to have heard of Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, Tennessee's otherworldly rookie left defensive end,
turned Rams right tackle Fred Miller into Don Knotts in the
regular-season meeting between the two teams. Trying to contain
Kearse made Miller so edgy, so spasmodic, he was flagged for six
false starts in the Rams' 24-21 loss in Week 7.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was through with Miller, Kearse had two sacks, a
forced fumble and an honorary membership in the Rams' backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, it's going to be Miller time.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Miller that Tammy needed to know, she learned
from his birthdate, Feb. 6, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``My god, there is a lot of psychic energy around this man,''
she purred after a pregnant pause. ``It's so strong, it's like this
inner knowing that taps into his confidence, his rhythm, his
chutzpah, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's containment of Kearse will give Rams quarterback Kurt
Warner enough time to pick apart a Titans secondary that is
suspect, what with Marcus Robertson sidelined with a broken ankle
and Blaine Bishop enamored of hitting people instead of tackling
them.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, the NFL's top-rated passer and hands-down best story,
will get the ball early and often to Isaac Bruce, Az-Zahir Hakim
and Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   With their deep post patterns the Rams receivers will turn the
Super Bowl into the most-watched track meet in Atlanta since the
1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing Warner's position or personal saga, only his
birthdate (June 22, 1971), Tammy said, ``He most certainly is going
to be a star (today). When I look at his energy field, it's like
the Fourth of July with all the fireworks going off in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope she wasn't having a flashback to the Centennial Park
bombing during the 1996 Olympics. Richard Jewell, who was suspected
of being behind the attack, eventually was vindicated, just as Rams
placekicker Jeff Wilkins will be today.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oct. 31 meeting between the teams, Wilkins got spooked
and missed a field goal with 22 seconds left that would have tied
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Daniel Day Lewis has one person's left foot drawn so
many crowds. Wilkins has been encircled the past few days by
reporters wondering if that missed field goal and the two
medium-ranged field goals he has missed in the postseason were the
result of the chronic tendinitis he has in his left kneecap or a
temporary constricting in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-year veteran out of Youngstown State will answer his
critics today. Redemption will be Super for Wilkins, who was born
on April 19, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel a lot of sunshine hitting him,'' Tammy said. ``I
feel tremendous energy surrounding him.''
</P>
<P>
   At $3.99 per minute, this telephone call was sapping my savings,
if not my energy. It was time to let Tammy go, but before I did, I
wanted to know what today holds for the Rams' amateur psychic,
Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   In the grandiloquent tradition of Joe Namath and Ray Buchanan,
the second-year receiver and punt returner out of San Diego State
boldly predicted a Rams victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how I feel,'' Hakim said in the ensuing days,
staunchly sticking to his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Hakim, he has the stars aligned behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I feel around him is a bulldog, literally,''
Tammy said of the Gemini, born June 3, 1977. ``He has tremendous
physical strength (today). He's like a bulldog; he'll pull anything
that gets into his path with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy paused. ``I'm going to tell you,'' she said, ``just with
the energy I feel around him, I really feel his team is going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   So Frontiere need not bother rubbing the uniforms of her players
with crystals today for good luck, as she has done before. The
force field is with her Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm picking up from their energy field I would say
it's not going to be a real close game,'' Tammy concluded with such
breathless conviction I was tempted to make my next telephone call
to a bookie. ``I don't know how they keep score in football, but I
see this team getting out front and staying out front.''
</P>
<P>
   Who am I to counteract cosmic karma? Rams 30, Titans 20.

LEARNING 1 WORD AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, the children &UR; couldn't say the English words for
hardly any of the 20 objects their teacher pulled from a bag _
butterfly, whistle, boat, frog, key.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they missed only two: X-ray and lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are learning so fast,'' says Ana Maria Quilantan Hawley, a
bilingual first-grade &UR; teacher at Frank School in Guadalupe. ``I'm
very proud of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of migrant workers, &UR; Hawley was about 11 when her
family settled &UR; in Idaho. She couldn't read in English.
</P>
<P>
   All these years later, she feels the sting &UR; of a teacher asking,
``Why are you so stupid?''
</P>
<P>
   So, when little Tanya Acosta, who has been here from Mexico
since November, shakes her head at one of Hawley's questions,
Hawley tells the girl they will work on it later, just the two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher for 22 years, Hawley has taught bilingual classes for
all but four.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the school year, all 12 of &UR; her students who read
in English were below grade level. Now, all but one are above.
</P>
<P>
   They pull books from a shelf marked ````Libros predilectos'''' _
Hawley's ``favorite books.''
</P>
<P>
   Her other nine students read only in Spanish _ one at the
third-grade level. Roberto Valenzuela and Yadira Paredez have been
here for only two weeks. Yet, even they know the words for the
things in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grueso'' is ``thick'' in English. ``Kazoo'' is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual classes at Frank end in fourth grade. That's all right
for the first-graders in Hawley's class _ they'll likely be reading
and writing English four years from now. But the cut-off is a
problem for their older siblings who came to America as &UR; third- and
fourth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley tells each new child that it is hard to learn English but
she will help. She tells them not only to listen to what she says _
first in English, then in Spanish _ but to watch the other children
and do as they do.
</P>
<P>
   She puts kids who speak only Spanish next to children who speak
both and doesn't &UR; chide them for whispered explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they learning a whole new language, but about a
whole new world. She takes them outside to show them ``lawn,'' a
patch of green in their books. ``Pasto.'' Grass. &QL;

HALL OF FAME'S HEART GOES TO SAN FRANCISCO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2000 is colored
red and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers have three of the five honorees
announced yesterday. First-year candidates Joe Montana and Ronnie
Lott and seniors selectee Dave Wilcox will be inducted on the steps
of the Hall of Fame on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney and Los Angeles/Oakland
Raiders defensive lineman Howie Long give the Hall of Fame, in
Canton, Ohio, an enrollment of 204.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Swann, a receiver on four Pittsburgh Super Bowl champions,
and defensive end Jack Youngblood of the Los Angeles Rams, finished
in the final six, but did not get the 80 percent approval required
for election.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was one of the easiest selections ever for the selection
committee of 38 writers and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   In his four Super Bowl victories, Montana threw 122 passes
without an interception. He finished his career as the fourth
passer in history to top 40,000 yards. His 3,409 completions ranked
third all-time, and his career passer rating of 92.3 ranks second
all-time behind former 49ers teammate Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   He directed 31 fourth-quarter comebacks, including the 92-yard,
game-winning drive in Super Bowl XXIII against Cincinnati, and
``The Catch,'' that Dwight Clark caught to beat the Cowboys in the
NFC Championship Game on Jan. 10, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle lived in Canton,'' Montana said. ``I drove by the
Hall of Fame I can't tell you how many countless times. ... And it
was the furthest thing from my mind, maybe because it was an ending
point. With a tremendous honor also comes a little dirt on the
grave that it's truly over. There's no going back now, Ronnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott was an eight-time All-Pro at cornerback, strong safety and
free safety. He holds the NFL postseason record with nine
interceptions, and he had 100-plus tackles five times in a 14-year
career that also included stints with the Los Angeles Raiders and
the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in there \Rto the Hall of Fame\S, it's like you
want to get on your knees and bow to some of the people,'' said
Lott, who twice shed tears. ``\RHall of Famer Ray\S Nitschke said
to me one time, `You know, you could play with me.' That's what the
Hall of Fame is about.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott and Montana were automatics, Wilcox had to wait 21
years before being honored as the old-timer candidate. Although he
earned seven Pro Bowl invitations in 11 seasons with the 49ers,
Wilcox was bypassed in his 20 years of eligibility as a modern era
candidate.

<P>
   ``I understand,'' said Wilcox, who played from 1964-74. ``We
played in an era back when the Hall of Fame was just starting. The
21 years, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Long's first season of eligibility was last year, when he was a
finalist. This year he was rewarded for his 84 career sacks, eight
Pro Bowls and three All-Pro selections in his 13 seasons with the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put into words what goes through your mind when
they say your name,'' Long said. ``Last year I knew what it was
like when they don't say your name. It's a tremendous
disappointment and leaves a pretty hollow feeling. You feel kind of
complete now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney's family has owned the Steelers since the team was
founded. His father, Art, is already in the Hall of Fame, and they
join Tim Mara and Wellington Mara of the New York Giants as the
only father-son honorees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite surprised,'' Rooney said. ``I didn't think I'd make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Harry Carson, tight end Dave Casper, defensive end
Carl Eller, wide receiver James Lofton, guard Mike Munchak,
offensive tackle Ron Yary and coach Marv Levy did not make the list
of finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Players must be retired five years to be eligible for the Hall
of Fame. Coaches become eligible upon retirement, and active
administrators can be considered. Old-timer nominees must have
completed 70 percent of their careers by 1975 and automatically
advance to the final seven candidates.

BUHL PATROLS TRAFFIC, WINS IRL OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Indy Racing League veteran Robbie Buhl
says there is no such thing as ``strategy'' when racing in a pack
in the final laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to see what's presented there,'' Buhl said at the
Walt Disney World Speedway yesterday afternoon, ``and be in
position to take advantage of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff of Buhl's victory in the season-opening Delphi Indy
200 proved to be some late-race traffic _ backmarkers, as they are
called _ who also just happened to be rookies. Locked in a
single-file freight train with fellow veterans Buddy Lazier and
Eddie Cheever Jr., Buhl played off the inexperience of rookies Sam
Hornish Jr. and Doug Didero to move from third and into first in
the span of eight frenetic laps.
</P>
<P>
   Buhl's final move _ past the frustrated Cheever on Lap 199 of
the scheduled 200 _ gave the IRL's newest owner/driver his second
series victory and first since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all three of us were running there, we were all fairly
equal,'' said Buhl, referring to himself, Lazier and Cheever. ``And
what was going to shake things up was traffic. Sure enough, that's
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl, Cheever and Lazier had been in each other's mirrors since
Lap 150 around the tight, 1-mile trioval. Lazier led Cheever by
0.630-seconds after 190 laps, with Buhl in third, when Hornish
slowed Lazier's momentum heading into Turn 1 at over 153 mph. That
set up Cheever for a pass on Lazier on the inside of Turn 2 on Lap
191. Buhl also capitalized a lap later, when he motored his Team
Purex Dreyer &AMP; Reinbold Racing G Force/Aurora around Lazier in Turn
1 and into second place.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, a two-time winner of this event and the defending
champion, led Buhl by 0.477-seconds when the two approached traffic
at the conclusion of Lap 197. Cheever held the point until he
reeled in the car of Didero, whom Cheever charged with blocking him
high and low, allowing Buhl to take the lead on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy got hung up a little bit, and both Eddie and I got by
him,'' said Buhl, who started 22nd in the 26-car field. ``Then
Eddie and I were running fairly equal. I was a little bit better in
Turn 1 than him, but I couldn't do anything with him. So, it was a
matter of waiting for traffic. He got bogged down, and we got a
great shot by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reigning IRL champion Greg Ray of Plano was relegated to a
17th-place finish _ 20 laps off the winning pace _ after the
sequential-shift gearbox in his Dallara/Aurora failed during a pit
stop. And two-time Indy 500 champion Al Unser Jr.'s IRL debut
produced a 25th-place finish after his Aurora engine blew after 64
laps.
</P>
<P>
   Lazier, winless in the IRL since 1997, said he deserved ``a
piece of the racetrack'' heading to the finish with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the field has spotters and knows the leaders are
coming,'' said Lazier, who like Cheever was attempting to give the
American-made Riley &AMP; Scott chassis its first IRL victory. ``I
mean, I just about ripped the front of my car off on this guy
\RHornish\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, who in addition to campaigning a Riley &AMP; Scott chassis
also was attempting to give the Nissan Infiniti Indy V-8 its first
series victory, blamed himself for trusting a rookie to move it on
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two laps to go I went down to get around the blue car
\Rof Didero\S, and he moved down,'' Cheever said. ``I tried to go
on the outside. His car drifted up, pushing me into the marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   And into a third-place finish. Buhl's margin of victory over
Lazier was 3.165 seconds in a race that produced eight caution
flags for 65 laps, and plenty of postrace whining.

STARS' BEST DEFENSE IS AN IMPROVING DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If someone had told the Stars a month or so ago
that defenseman Shawn Chambers' knee injury might cause him to miss
the entire season, the screams probably could've been heard in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Their fifth, sixth and seventh defensemen were that suspect.
</P>
<P>
   So the silence said a lot when Chambers said a couple of days
ago that he might not return this season. The silence said those
defensemen have improved a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone to emerge from that group, and I
think all of the guys have emerged quite a bit,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the Stars don't need Chambers, who had surgery
Oct. 12 to remove and repair cartilage in his right knee, but the
panic level has been significantly decreased.
</P>
<P>
   The last month or so has seen the addition of defenseman Kevin
Dean, a Chambers-like player from New Jersey's system, and marked
improvement from defensemen Jamie Pushor, Brad Lukowich and Richard
Jackman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all thought that we had to get the job done or else
they'd get someone else to do it,'' Lukowich said. ``Just from
then, saying we weren't getting the job done, to now, we've all
come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, the biggest improvement has come from Pushor.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled early. He started playing less. He started
struggling more. Finally, he was struggling so much that Hitchcock
talked to him and benched him for a couple of games.
</P>
<P>
   The Pushor who came back was better than the Pushor who left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the first 20, even 30, games,'' Pushor said. ``I just
had to struggle to find my niche. We talked about it with the
coaches, and I was just trying to do what they want me to do out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   What the coaches wanted from Pushor, Lukowich, Jackman and now
Dean is not to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, the best way to describe it is when you bring in so
many new players on defense through necessity, what you want to do
is have them play the game error free as much as possible,''
Hitchcock said. ``And I think as the season moved along, all four
guys have started to eliminate mistakes in their game and gotten
better and better in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, Hitchcock said, can be found in the little
details.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the pucks that get dumped into the Stars' zone are
getting pushed out a lot faster. Whether it's Pushor or Sergei
Zubov, Lukowich or Richard Matvichuk, the pucks are being handled
with a lot more composure. They come in. They go out. They're
passed to the right places. The plays are made with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started to, I guess you can say, fit in a little bit more
and understand our game a little bit more,'' Pushor said. ``There
has been a little more opportunity to play a little more, and there
have been some games where I have definitely started to play better
than others.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars have better been able to absorb the loss of
captain Derian Hatcher and Chambers. The extra minutes Hitchcock
has been able to entrust Lukowich and Pushor with have taken
pressure off Zubov, Darryl Sydor and Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the bulk of the responsibility still falls to that trio but
the other four have been taking on more responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like at the end of the game, when you don't notice
them, things have gone really well,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Silence, indeed, is golden.

TITANS, NEAL HAVE BECOME DESTINY'S DARLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the Music City Miracle, Tennessee Titans
fullback Lorenzo Neal was an unknown. Just like his team.
</P>
<P>
   Then, destiny dropped into Neal's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two days later, the Titans find themselves playing for
the Super Bowl championship. Fate is a funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that happened, it felt like we had lost,'' Neal said.
``Guys had their heads down, crying, and then, new life. We tasted
defeat in that second, so we know what it feels like to lose in the
playoffs. I think that's what keeps us going.''
</P>
<P>
   With Buffalo leading 16-15 with 16 seconds remaining in an AFC
wild-card playoff game, Bills kicker Steve Christie popped the
kickoff to Neal, who began one of the greatest plays in NFL
history. As everyone knows by now, Neal pitched the ball to tight
end Frank Wycheck, who threw a lateral to Kevin Dyson, who went 75
yards for the game-winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Their 13 seconds of fame will last a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known more for that play than probably anything in my
whole career,'' Neal said. ``It's real cool. They're comparing it
to the Immaculate Reception by Franco Harris, and it is exciting.
But honestly, I'll trade it all for a Super Bowl win.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal left Fresno State as the school's second-leading career
rusher with 2,405 yards. He ran right into the NFL without
stopping, gaining a league-leading 175 yards on 21 carries in seven
quarters of his rookie season with the New Orleans Saints. But a
shattered left ankle in the third quarter of the second game
changed the course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In the six seasons since _ three with the Saints, one with the
New York Jets, one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and one with the
Titans _ Neal has gained 207 yards on 73 carries. That's a great
rushing day for Titans running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, hard road, but it's all worth it now,'' Neal
said. ``I guess I wouldn't savor it as much as if I just went my
first year. I know this opportunity doesn't happen often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans know that as well as any team in the NFL. It has
taken them 35 years, three cities, six stadiums, a name change and
many heartbreaks to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which has played in four stadiums the past four
seasons, has no business being here. But in three postseason games,
the Titans received a miracle, a requiem via instant replay and a
third matchup against a team that can't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Some things can't be explained. Some things just happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were meant to be here. They are a team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, one wild play is the difference in us being in this
game,'' George said. ``If that wouldn't have happened, we wouldn't
be here right now. I guess it is destined for us to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone willing to bet against fate today?

Mature beyond his years, Lakers' Bryant developing uniquely
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Kobe's here.
</P>
<P>
   And, like other wildly popular first-name-only players before
him, no last name is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all that's really needed to identify Los Angeles Lakers
guard Kobe Bryant, who visits Compaq Center for today's matinee
game against the Rockets, is the given name that was borrowed from
a cattle-raising area of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   Just that name is all that's needed to stir images of graceful
athleticism, on-a-leash ball-handling and eye-popping dunks that
define Bryant's high-voltage game. Image after image flash by,
somewhat ironic given the ``Image Is Nothing'' tag line on his
Sprite commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to Bryant's cool, self-assured manner and his polite,
personable way with people and it's a safe bet to assume he one day
will achieve the level of popularity enjoyed by Michael _ and you
know which Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows which Michael, a point that was made by former
Lakers coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me put it this way,'' Harris said. ``When he broke
into the league, he was Michael Jordan. Then after a while, it was
MJ. Then it was Michael. Then he became Mike. Pretty soon, all
you'll need to say is `M,' and people will still know who you're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant isn't there, but he has reached the point where he, too,
is on a first-name basis with the rest of the basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Wilt, Oscar and Julius. And just like Magic and
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Among those first-name-brand greats, Bryant seems to be the most
like Jordan _ at least a lot of people would like him to be. He has
the charisma, the photogenic looks and the game _ you have to have
the game _ that make comparisons to Jordan inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   And his marketing portfolio _ Adidas, Sprite, Spalding, Mattel
and Nintendo so far _ might one day rival Jordan's as well. Give
him time, though, since he's only 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dedicated and he's competitive,'' said new Lakers coach
Phil Jackson. ``He reminds me a lot of Michael Jordan, and there's
not too many players who have ever done that.''
</P>
<P>
   See?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who honed his fatherly basketball-guru chops on Jordan
during his nine-year stint with the Bulls, is trying to put a
damper on much of the hype surrounding Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 21-year-old kid who's carrying the weight of the NBA on
his shoulders on some level, or the hopes of the NBA in his own
mind,'' Jackson said. ``And I'd like to see him really enjoy the
space he has and the potential that he has to grow to reach that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tentacles are out there, but he hasn't really developed
the roots _ and that's going to come. That's going to be the
interesting part of us watching his game. So, hopefully, he'll let
that happen and not try and force it, but let that kind of happen
and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub in Bryant's game.
</P>
<P>
   His motto is, ``Time is precious,'' so sitting back and waiting
for something to happen, even allowing a play to develop, seems to
go against Bryant's nature.
</P>
<P>
   But that's understandable. After all, Bryant, the son of former
NBA player Joe Bryant, went from resident stud at Lower Merion
(Pa.) High School, where he was named National High School Player
of the Year by USA Today and Gatorade, to the NBA without interning
on the college level.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is working to temper Bryant's impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great _ way more mature than I could ever imagine a
21-year-old kid could be,'' Jackson said. ``A lot of times, Kobe
will take his own lead out there and I understand that. Sometimes
you don't want to misuse your own judgment as a player. And I
understand that; he's got to be able to read on his own and that's
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are times Bryant appears to force things simply
because he believes he can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say we've experienced times where he's amazed us and
we've been proud of him,'' said teammate Rick Fox. ``(But) you get
frustrated. You wouldn't give your 10-year-old the keys to drive
the whole bus to school. So it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Like two weeks ago, when Bryant went solo and lost his dribble
to the Cavaliers' Bob Sura in the fourth quarter, leading to a
Cleveland score at the other end. Jackson called timeout and began
ripping into Bryant before the seat of his shorts could even make
contact with the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, I try to make a play sometimes, and I know it
doesn't come out or doesn't happen the right way sometimes, but I'm
out there, trying my heart out.''' Bryant said. ``And (Jackson)
said that it's cool, to just put it behind you _ just move on to
the next play, buckle down and win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant wasn't happy about the vocal flogging, but understands
Jackson uses him as his verbal cat-scratch post. Why? Because
Jackson knows Bryant can take it without the danger of a psychic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care,'' Bryant said. ``I've had coaches who
because of their personality like getting up in your face and stuff
like that. That's fine by me. I played with a coach my first two or
three years (Harris) who didn't say a word. It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson usually employs more low-key ways of putting Bryant in
his place. During practices, Jackson will often wave Bryant off the
court at critical times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be like game point, and he'll take me out of the dang
practice,'' Bryant said. ``Just because. Just because he knows I
hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his age, it would be easy to dismiss such a response as
childish impertinence. Bryant, then 18, was taken by Charlotte with
the 13th pick in the 1996 draft, and a draft-day deal sent him to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later the Lakers signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal
to a blockbuster $120 million deal, and suddenly the Lakers, who
were in the process of rebuilding after the Showtime heyday of the
1980s, had their Kareem and Magic _ again, first names only _ of
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaq and Kobe haven't always gotten along, mainly because of
their contrasting personalities. O'Neal's staggering physical
dimensions are dwarfed by his enormous personality, always looking
for fun no matter where the team is playing. But Bryant prefers his
hotel room, writing poetry or nourishing his growing musical
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go hang out just to be hanging out,'' Bryant
said. ``That's a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is another sign of Bryant's relative inexperience.
Sometimes hanging out with teammates just for the sake of hanging
out is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's moving toward the intimidation factor,'' Fox said
early this year. ``Maybe he has a game plan in his mind he's
putting to work. I just think that it's going to be a long 20 years
in this league if he continues to isolate and not reach out or let
people in.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a point Jerry West, the Lakers' executive vice president
of basketball operations, intends to impress on the precocious
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really broached that, but I think it's something
that's really, really important for him to understand,'' West said.
``I feel it's important for people to understand the dynamics of a
locker room. I've always felt, be who you are, be yourself. But I
do think you have to embrace your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he embraces the game. Not content to simply let his
talent slide him through the league, Bryant constantly works to
hammer out the dings in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that people wouldn't believe is how hard he
works,'' said former teammate Derek Harper. ``The kid is gifted and
obviously he's very, very talented as a young basketball player.
But the reason he'll be great one day is because of his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply works harder than anybody I know. He's the first guy
there (to practice), the last guy to leave a lot of times. He
studies the game and takes it very, very seriously, and that, for a
young player, was a little bit surprising for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him to be a really super player if we're going to win
a championship,'' Jackson said. ``And it might not happen in one
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then caught himself and smiled, recalling Bryant's
famous impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might take two months.''

PEPPERDINE WINS EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE GAME

By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The alarm clock went off with precisely fifteen
minutes and thirty-nine seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Pepperdine rose out of bed and went to work. The
alarm didn't come in the form of a nagging buzzer, nor was it
soothing music. Rather, it was a jump shot by Darrell Teat to give
Santa Clara a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   At stake were the Waves' seven-game winning streak, first place
in the West Coast Conference and their perfect record in the WCC.
</P>
<P>
   But off to work Pepperdine went, starting with Craig Lewis'
3-pointer to ignite 10-0 run that Tommie Prince, capped off with a
tough 3-pointer with the shot clock winding down and a hand in his
face.
</P>
<P>
   In less then three mintues the Waves had awakened from their
slumber, seized the lead and taken command of the game, which they
went on to win 67-59 before 1,872 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for Pepperdine (16-5, 6-0), which extended its
winning streak to eight games and remained in first place heading
into a critical showdown next Thursday at Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play particularly well tonight but I thought we
gutted out a victory,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said.
``Some games are going to be where you shoot really well and play
really well, and other games you might struggle. But if you can
find a way to win when you don't play very well, then I think
you've got a pretty special team.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly these Waves are showing the characteristics of being a
special team, piecing together wins on off-nights, while playing on
the road and in games when they were pushed to the limit the night
before. Pepperdine rallied Friday night to beat San Francisco while
Santa Clara breezed to an easy win over Loyola Marymont. That might
explain why the Broncos (12-9, 3-3), who got 16 points each from
Brian Jones and Teat, seemed fresher in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Waves settled down in the second, thanks to a better
effort defensively and on the glass _ they forced 10 turnovers and
outrebounded the Broncos by nine in the half _ and the play of
Tezale Archie (18 points, five assists), Armstrong (11 points) and
Kelvin Gibbs (nine points, eight rebounds.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Waves outscored Santa Clara 24-7 to take a
57-49 lead. The Broncos never got closer then four points after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got into the flow and we started to execute the
plays,'' Armstrong said. ``It just came down to where we were all
feeling it at the same time and we started hitting big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Friday night against San Francisco, the Waves trailed
by one at halftime, 33-32. Unlike the previous night, the problem
wasn't just turnovers. This time it was defensive lapses and cold
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine let Santa Clara's Jones roam free on the perimeter,
and the junior guard from Carson took advantage with 13 points
while connecting on 3 of 6 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos shot just 43 percent from the field, but they were 5
of 12 on 3-pointers and committed just four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' frigid shooting compounded the problem. They were a
miserable 36 percent from the field, although they heated up late
in the half, getting 3-pointers from Archie, Armstrong and Gibbs to
keep it close.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine shook off the Broncos' quick start to open the
second, rallying back from a 42-33 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we have an experienced team, that we can be down
but still have the character to come back and win the ball game,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong doesn't want to keep testing that character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're going to try and work on the first half.''
Armstrong said. ``We've got the second half down. We just have to
work on the first half.''

PEPPERDINE WINS EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE GAME

ATTN: Brown

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The alarm clock went off with precisely fifteen
minutes and thirty-nine seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Pepperdine rose out of bed and went to work. The
alarm didn't come in the form of a nagging buzzer, nor was it
soothing music. Rather, it was a jump shot by Darrell Teat to give
Santa Clara a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   At stake were the Waves' seven-game winning streak, first place
in the West Coast Conference and their perfect record in the WCC.
</P>
<P>
   But off to work Pepperdine went, starting with Craig Lewis'
3-pointer to ignite 10-0 run that Tommie Prince, capped off with a
tough 3-pointer with the shot clock winding down and a hand in his
face.
</P>
<P>
   In less then three mintues the Waves had awakened from their
slumber, seized the lead and taken command of the game, which they
went on to win 67-59 before 1,872 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for Pepperdine (16-5, 6-0), which extended its
winning streak to eight games and remained in first place heading
into a critical showdown next Thursday at Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play particularly well tonight but I thought we
gutted out a victory,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said.
``Some games are going to be where you shoot really well and play
really well, and other games you might struggle. But if you can

UCLA ROUTED   BY OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Ancient and creaky, McArthur stands across the
street from a cemetary. Its gray concrete walls rise higher than
Oregon pine. There are two levels of green and yellow balcony seats
that deflect noise onto the court. There is not an inch of excess
space; it's a most unforgiving place.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has had its share of Mac Court meltdowns. In 1995, Jim
Harrick lost his cool and was ejected in the final minutes of a
close game. In 1997, the Bruins broke down in the final minutes of
a 16-point defeat . Even mild-mannered players like Tyus Edney and
Bob Myers have exchanged words with the league's rudest students.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been anything like this _ a collapse so
complete, so sudden that it left the Bruins shaken and sullen. With
one exception, the lockerroom was quieter than it's been all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the final score. (Oregon won 73-58.) These are the
numbers that matter:
</P>
<P>
   - Leading 40-39 midway through the second half, the Bruins were
outscored 18-0.
</P>
<P>
   -During that stretch, UCLA went scoreless for 6:37. That's a
third of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dominated us in every phase,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't talking about Duke or Kentucky or Stanford or
Arizona. This was Oregon, a well-coached team with a roster full of
junior college transfers and second-tier recruits. Yet the Ducks
overwhelmed UCLA in a manner usually saved for teams with lottery
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half,'' Oregon forward A.D. Smith said, ``I
think we won most of the individual battles.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance so disgusted UCLA senior Sean Farnham that he
scolded his teammates in a tirade not heard since Ed O'Bannon
blasted the Bruins at halftime of the 1994 first-round loss to
Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going down like this!'' Farnham screamed, pounding his
right fist against the lockerroom wall. ``I'm not going to the
NIT!''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, calm and throughful, Farnham elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we needed a win, we needed a sweep,''
he said. ``We had it in our grasp, and we let it slip away. It's
disappointing because we had a breakthrough in the second half at
Oregon State , and we played well for 15 minutes tonight, and we
couldn't sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute our offense. We had a lot of turnovers. Ther
e were a lot of similarities to the Arizona game, and that's
frustrating .''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, it seems, is UCLA lacks the fundamentals and the
structure to execute its offense for 40 minutes against elite
defenses. It does not have the patience and the discipline to stay
calm when opponents surge.
</P>
<P>
   The better the foe, the smaller the margin for error, yet the
Bruins play the same way against everyone. They can overcome
mistakes against Arizona State and Oregon State, but not against
Arizona and Oregon and Stanford. Those teams too good; they pounce
on every mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, UCLA opened the second half with five consecutive
turnovers, enabling Oregon to snatch a 35-31 lead. Although the
Bruins stayed close for several minutes, the Ducks had found their
groove. Each basket boosted their confidence and energized the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Mac Court engulfed the Bruins. They began passing and
shooting a split-second quick. Billy Knight and Ray Young missed
ill-timed jumpers. Dan Gadzuric mishandled a pass. Young shot a
3-pointer off the side of the backboard, then clanked a leaner. The
ball movement and patience they showed in the first half vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mental,'' point guard Earl Watson said. ``We lacked
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Smith walked by the UCLA lockerro om as Farnham
berated his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested that a scolding might be just what the Bruins
need. Smith just smiled and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more than that, guys,'' he said. ``It takes a lot
more than that.''

USC SETS RECORD IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. -- The way USC was shooting Saturday night, its
motto seemed to be ``three-peat after me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans put on an incredible shooting display against Oregon
State, hitting a Pacific-10 Conference record 20 3-pointers in an
82-69 victory over the Beavers at Gill Coliseum before 6,099.
</P>
<P>
   USC smashed its school record for 3-pointers (15) early in the
second half and broke the Pacific-10 Conference record of 18 when
Nate Hair hit a 3- pointer with 8:32 remaining. Washington State
set the old record against Seattle-Pacific in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the 3-pointer but tonight they made me
believe in the 3-point shot,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``It was
just one of those nights. Guys got really good looks and didn't
force anything. We know we have guys that can shoot the
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were nearly unconscious in the second half. They hit
their first 11 shots and nine of those were 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Every Trojan starter hit at least three 3-pointers, and they did
it with out a single substitution until 57.2 seconds were left in
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, USC finished 20 of 29 on 3-point shots. For good
measure, Orego n State was 10 for 24.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Granville led USC with 21 points, and five 3-pointers.
David Bluthenthal (five 3-pointers) and Jeff Trepagnier (three
3-pointers) each had 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hair scored a career-high 14 points and made 4 of 5 of his
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   USC's first miss of the second half didn't occur until Granville
missed a 3-pointer with 9:42 left. By that time, the Oregon State
fans were chanting ``miss, miss, miss'' each time the Trojans had
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Trojans (13-6, 6-1) remained in a tie for
first-place in the Pacific-10 Conference with Arizona, Stanford and
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, the Trojans are putting some room
between themselves and the next tier of conference teams in their
drive to earn an NCAA Tournament bid. The next closest teams
(Arizona State, UCLA) are currently three games behind USC.
</P>
<P>
   But inside Gill Coliseum, all anyone was thinking about was the
shooting display put on by the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC hit its first eight 3-point attempts of the second half and
made 18 of their first 23 attempts to open a 70-44 advantage with
11:48 left when Bluthenthal hit his fourth 3-pointer of the game.
Forward Brian Scalabrine converted his first three 3-pointers of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   USC led 39-32 at halftime solely because of their outside
shooting. USC made 9 of 14 3-point shots, and Granville made four
3-pointers and had 12 points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Hair, inserted into the starting lineup in place of center
Kostas Charissis, scored eight points and made two 3-pointers in he
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier also rebounded from a poor performance at Oregon with
11 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat ironic that the Trojans led by seven,
considering their leading scorer, Scalabrine, scored just two
points in the first half. Bluthenthal, another of the Trojans'
mainstays, had just six.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State stayed within striking distance with its own hot
shooting. The Beavers hit 5 of 11 3-pointers in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (2-5, 10-8) remained winless at home in Pac-10 play
with an 0-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans return home this week and host California on
Thursday night at 7 at the Sports Arena.

TITANS HAVE A SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Titans were forced to hold interviews this week in an
underheated tent outside their Atlanta hotel - while the Rams and
reporters following them enjoyed the comforts of a hotel ballroom -
Tennessee players saw it as evidence NFL officials were playing
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another example of us being considered a second-rate team,'' a
Titans defensive lineman complained, presumably through chattering
teeth, to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like somebody has been playing the
we-don't-get-no-respect card in the motivation game that precedes
Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before Tennessee faced Jacksonville for the AFC
championship, the Titans were shown a videotape of some of the
opposing players performing a song and dance to be shown at a
charity event, with lyrics suggesting the Jaguars were already on
their way to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like somebody has been playing the
we-don't-get-no-respect card for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is Jeff Fisher, the Titans' 41-year-old head coach, a
product of USC and, before that, Taft High in Woodland Hills. The
man whose ingenuity - and whose staff of assistants - holds
Tennessee's hope for an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, applauded for his motivational skills, obviously has
been trying to evoke the emotion that's available only to
underdogs, that feeling that it's them against the world and the
world hasn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   On paper - the tissue paper upon expectations have been written
this season - the Titans have good reason to feel like the
second-rate team in the Georgia Dome today, whether or not they've
been treated like B-list guests all week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams are the flashier team, the better
rags-to-riches story. The Rams, not the Titans, are the natural
choice if there were to be a darling of the league and media.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams outranked the Titans on offense (rushing and passing)
and defense (against the rush and the pass) during the regular
season. To find a Titans statistical edge, you have to look at
categories like ``gross punting average.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams met little resistance on their rise to the top of the
NFC until the conference title game against the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. The Titans needed a once-in-a-lifetime finish just to
get past the Buffalo Bills in the wild-card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   And there's this item, which blows the circuits of everybody who
thinks the comparisons above are out of whack because of the Rams'
weak regular-season schedule:
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Rams' and Titans' performances against common
opponents, in the cases where even the venue was the same, home or
road. The Rams did better than the Titans in !ital!all six!off! of
those games - by at least 13 points in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Titans overcome all of that? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Titans played most of those common opponents
early in the season, and they're a better team now, having exceeded
the oddsmakers' expectations seven weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Also: The Titans' stock in trade is their ability to rise up
against the NFL's best teams. They're 6-0 against Indianapolis,
Buffalo (both in the playoffs), Jacksonville (twice in the regular
season, once in the playoffs) and St. Louis (in their midseason
meeting).
</P>
<P>
   That 24-21 victory over the Rams, which should give the Titans
confidence today, was no more convincing than the score indicates.
It was played in Nashville, on a grass field, not artificial turf
like the Georgia Dome's. It was played after a Titans bye week. And
although that was Titans quarterback Steve McNair's first game back
from a back injury, that might have been an advantage for them,
because the Rams had practiced for Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   But that game might provide enough of a blueprint for Fisher. He
figured out Jacksonville, handing the Jaguars all three of their
defeats, holding them to three of their six sub-20-point games.
</P>
<P>
   Can he do it to the Rams? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Titans can win:
</P>
<P>
   By getting the lead early, as they did against the Rams on Oct.
31, blunting 1,300-yard ballcarrier Marshall Faulk's impact.
</P>
<P>
   By holding onto the ball, defying a Rams defense that scored
eight touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   By putting pressure on Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, whom they
sacked six times in the earlier meeting, and who seemed flustered
by the Tampa Bay pressure.
</P>
<P>
   By counting on McNair to run away from the Rams' pass rushers,
confounding them with his improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   By coming up with a big play - from McNair? from Eddie George?
from the kickoff-return team? - to score the pivotal points.
</P>
<P>
   Doing all of that won't be easy. But Fisher has shown this year
that he can figure out how, and lead the Titans out of the cold.

USC SETS RECORD IN WIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. -- The way USC was shooting Saturday night, its
motto seemed to be ``three-peat after me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Granville made a 3-pointer. Brian Scalabrine hit two
straight. David Bluthenthal got one. Scalabrine sank two more. Then
Bluthenthal again. Jeff Trepagnier added another. Finally, Nate
Hair capped it off.
</P>
<P>
   And this was just to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just shake your head and say, `It's one of those games,'
'' Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans put on an incredible shooting display against Oregon
State, hitting a Pacific-10 Conference record 20 3-pointers in an
82-69 victory over the Beavers at Gill Coliseum before 6,099.
</P>
<P>
   USC smashed its school record for 3-pointers (15) early in the
second half and broke the Pac-10 record of 18 when Hair hit a
3-pointer with 8:32 remaining. Washington State set the old record
against Seattle-Pacific in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the 3-pointer but tonight they made me
believe in the 3-point shot,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``Guys
got really good looks and didn't force anything. We know we have
guys that can shoot the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby just didn't know they could shoot like this. Overall, USC
converted 20 of 29 3-pointers, and hit its first nine in the second
half. The Trojans made their first 11 field-goals of the second
half to break the game open.
</P>
<P>
   They led 39-32 at halftime, and by the time Hair hit the
Trojans' ninth straight 3-pointer, USC had a 67-44 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is within five or six points, and all of a sudden I
look up and we're up 16 or more,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Every Trojan starter hit at least three 3-pointers, and none
made less than 50 percent of their attempts. And the Trojans almost
did it without a single substitution. Bibby put in his first
replacements with 57.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   USC (13-6, 6-1) realized it was on a roll during its 9 for 9
streak when Scalabrine leaned forward and tried to draw a foul by
throwing up an awkward shot that found its way into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something funny going on when Brian hit his
3-pointer,'' Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Granville led USC with 21 points, five 3-pointers and 11
assists. David Bluthenthal (five 3-pointers) and Jeff Trepagnier
(three 3-pointers) each had 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hair scored a career-high 14 points and made 4 of 5 of his
3-pointers along with seven assists. Scalabrine made three shots
from 3-point range and finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Gill Coliseum, fans were beginning to wonder if the
Trojans would miss after they hit those first 11 shots after
halftime. USC's first miscue of the second half didn't occur until
Granville missed a 3-pointer with 9:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Oregon State fans were chanting ``miss, miss,
miss'' each time the Trojans had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best extra-pass movement we've had since
we've been playing,'' Bibby said. ``I was just hoping we wouldn't
miss tonight .''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Trojans moved into a four-way tie for
first-place in the Pac-10 with Arizona, Stanford and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important, USC is putting some distance between
itself and the next tier of conference teams in its drive to earn
an NCAA Tournament bid. The next closest teams (Arizona State,
UCLA) are currently three games behind USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important because it's a road win and we needed a split
up here,' ' Bibby said. ``We're fighting for first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (10-8, 2-5) has lost all five home games in Pac-10
play, and the game was not nearly as close as the score indicated.
USC led 80-54 before being outscored 15-2 over the final 4:37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any of you have seen anything like that but I
haven't, '' Oregon State coach Eddie Payne said. ``I've been at
this for about 25 ye ars and I've never seen a performance like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans return home this week and host California on
Thursday night at 7 at the Sports Arena.

AGASSI RULES IN AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ The Cold War is well over, but Andre Agassi kept it
hot for a Russian named Kafelnikov for almost 2 1/2 hours Saturday
in his continuing campaign to rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   Victory in the Australian Open assured Agassi of hanging onto
No. 1, in which he girded himself at the close of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the slim and limber sweet-swinging
25-year-old from the shore of the Black Sea, who came to town
wearing the crown of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But he left bare-headed, with his mood matching the black
stripes on his shirt and shorts, deposed by Agassi in four sets,
3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi completed the American double that Lindsay Davenport
launched Friday with her championship. They are the first
home-grown Yanks to win the Australian since Californians Don Budge
and Dodo Bundy in 1938. The last two US citizens to do it were
Chris Evert and Johan Kriek in 1982. The South African-born Kriek
had been recently naturalized.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Agassi and Kafelnikov went at each other
ferociously in a battle of wills and deep groundstrokes to see who
would bend first.
</P>
<P>
   It was Agassi, the champion of this island once before, in 1995,
who was dented quickly. In 14 minutes, he found himself in the
rear, 0-4, as Kafelnikov was out-Agassi-ing Agassi, allowing balls
to barely bounce before he crushed them, sending the American
scurrying from corner to corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yevgeny had to come out fast and he did,'' Agassi said. ``I
felt there was much more of a chance for me to run away with the
match than for him to. But it quickly turned into a physical match
and I liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering, Agassi stormed back to 3-4, but Kafelnikov wouldn't
let him go any further and slugged away dead even with the American
through seven games of the second. There, Kafelnikov began to
falter while Agassi, magnificent all the way, maintained his blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov double-faulted twice to open the eighth game, and his
second serves thwacking into the net seemed to signal his demise,
although he fought gamely to the end in trying to retain the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi finally sealed his fate with three aces in the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi sensed blood with Kafelnikov's serving sins, and was all
over him. Before the Russian could recover his stability, he had
been flattened in a seven-game procession that gave Agassi the set
and a 4-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, the 6-foot-3-inch blond, resisted mightily as Agassi
drew even by serving out the second, 6-3, through three deuces. He
nailed it shut with his heaviest serve of the afternoon to that
point, a 112 miles per hour service winner.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi wanted a hot day and was disappointed by the 70-degree
temperature, which was moderate for a Melbourne summer that has
been unusually chilly and kept most of the crowd of 15,000
sweatered up in Rod Laver Arena.
</P>
<P>
   So, Agassi supplied his own heat, burning up the court with his
sneakers and racket, running so swiftly and banging so
relentlessly, with few mistakes, that Kafelnikov was trying to play
catch-up from deep in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's hitting his stride right now,'' Agassi's coach,
Brad Gilbert, said. ``Ultimately he wants to keep improving. There
are a lot more titles for him to win. He has three or four more
good years left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, winning his sixth major and second straight (following
the US Open), arrived in Melbourne at No. 1, Kafelnikov No. 2 _
those rankings based on a system discarded this year. Under the new
formula, the rankings run from week to week, as a race, and the
12-month cumulative method was abandoned. Thus Agassi and
Kafelnikov were playing for first place in the young season. Agassi
gave himself a shot by eliminating No. 3 Pete Sampras in a five-set
wowzer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov said, ``I'm amazed at how Andre recovered from losing
the first set and kept raising his level. My legs began to tire at
the end of the third, and he realized it, and raised his level
again. I had been controlling the match, but his belief in himself
is incredible. He just kept competing harder and took over
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching, lunging, battering, leaping, Agassi reinforced his
late-blooming greatness by taking away all but the optimum shots of
his foe and belting them back with added muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got another gear I can always shift into,'' said Agassi,
who made but 35 errors to Kafelnikov's 61. ``And if that's not
enough, the other guy deserves to win. I wanted to keep executing
because Yevgeny's a guy who is too good and can come back. But I
was sure I had the other gear ready if he did.''
</P>
<P>
   With no time to bask in success, Agassi flies to Africa Monday
to spearhead the US Davis Cup first-round effort against the
Zimbabwean Black brothers Wayne and Byron, who defeated Australia
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another A to Z voyage in the life of the world ruler.

CLIPPERS END LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Look out NBA. Eric Murdock is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the sentiment the Clippers' journeyman hinted
at Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock had season highs with 16 points, 11 rebounds and 7
assists to help end a 10-game losing streak and boost the Clippers
over the visiting New Jersey Nets, 98-93, before 13,769 at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm healthy, I play pretty good,'' said Murdock, who's
had an array of minor leg problems. ``It's been frustrating for me
because I haven't been healthy all year. This is the best I've felt
since training camp, to be honest with you. Hopefully, I can
continue to get my legs stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Alhough the Clippers' point guard had his best night of the
season, New Jersey's Stephon Marbury had a chance to tie it with a
3-pointer at 95 in the last 16 seconds. Guarded by Lamar Odom,
Marbury turned the ball over to Tyrone Nesby, who dunked to end the
game after a fast break with Odom.
</P>
<P>
   It only could have been a more fitting exclamation point if
Murdock were involved. Murdock's task was especially hard because
his counter point guard was Marbury, who was coming off a
career-high 42 points Thursday at Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Murdock) did an outstanding job for us, offensively and
defensively,'' Clippers coach Chris Ford said. ``He ran the offense
just as we needed him to. If we continue to stick to the offensive
plan, we will continue to have good chances to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Murdock, who is on his seventh NBA team in nine seasons,
the Clippers weren't just a one-man show. Maurice Taylor scored a
team-high 23 points and had eight rebounds. Odom had 21 points and
10 rebounds, and Derek Anderson had 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the Nets (17-27), Kerry Kittles had a game-high 24 points,
and Marbury had 23 points and seven assists. Keith Van Horn had an
off night by shooting 5 of 18 for 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (11-32) took the lead, 82-81, with 4:45 left on a
free throw by Taylor and never relinquished it. The Nets stayed
closed and tied it twice in the following minutes, but the Clippers
finally sealed the victory when Marbury turned over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the third quarter, Odom nearly led the Clippers
far past the Nets. Odom scored the Clippers' first 10 points in the
quarter and had 12 points and eight rebounds in the third quarter.
With 4:40 left in the third, Taylor scored off a pass from Odom to
give the Clippers' their biggest lead, 61-53.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marbury had four points and an assist in a 9-0 run to
reclaim the lead for New Jersey. By the end of the third quarter,
the Clippers bounced back to lead, 69-66.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers led, 43-42, at the half, after Murdock had his
strongest half this season. The game became a triple-double watch
as Murdock had 11 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists in the first
half. Starting in just his fourth consecutive game over Troy
Hudson, Murdock also had a season high with 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the stats,'' said Murdock, who added he wasn't
aware of his proximity to the triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and his fellow Clippers were relieved to stop their
10-game funk. However, the players downplayed the dubious streak's
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about streaks,'' Anderson said. ''It's about playing
together. More or less, we finally came together for four quarters.
We weren't turning the ball over as much.''

   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ On the last Sunday in January, millions of
Americans anxiously gather around their television sets. Surrounded
by beer and snacks, including an estimated 8 million pounds (3.6
million kg) of guacamole, they watch a football game whose winner
is usually obvious by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Super Bowl audience has expanded beyond
America's borders, and 800 million people across the world will
watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?
</P>
<P>
   A more balanced league lowers ratings in the short run. The Rams
and Titans, this year's Super Bowl teams, play in the country's
21st and 30th largest television markets, which no doubt worries
advertisers who paid on average $2.2 million for a 30-second Super
Bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Scully, who wrote a book called ``The Market Structure of
Sports'' (University of Chicago Press), points out that taxing
winners and compensating losers reduces the incentive to win. But
it does not eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have other sources of revenue, such as promotion.
Moreover, revenue sharing also tends to create evenly matched
competitors, which may in the long run boost the popularity of the
sport. By helping to keep football teams in profit, the NFL
buttresses a national fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Fort, an economist at Washington State University, thinks
the NFL's evenhandedness is hard to value, yet it may prove the
league's most important asset should other American sports continue
to face battles between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   A franchise for a new football team in Houston was recently sold
for a record $700 million. This must reassure owners that dividing
the pie equally can still leave an enormous piece for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   As Art Modell, the owner of the Baltimore Ravens, once said of
the then 28 football-team owners: ``We're 28 Republicans, who all
vote socialist.'' &QL;

   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ On the last Sunday in January, millions of
Americans anxiously gather around their television sets. Surrounded
by beer and snacks, including an estimated 8 million pounds (3.6
million kg) of guacamole, they watch a football game whose winner
is usually obvious by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Super Bowl audience has expanded beyond
America's borders, and 800 million people across the world will
watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?
</P>
<P>
   A more balanced league lowers ratings in the short run. The Rams
and Titans, this year's Super Bowl teams, play in the country's
21st and 30th largest television markets, which no doubt worries
advertisers who paid on average $2.2 million for a 30-second Super
Bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Scully, who wrote a book called ``The Market Structure of
Sports'' (University of Chicago Press), points out that taxing
winners and compensating losers reduces the incentive to win. But
it does not eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have other sources of revenue, such as promotion.
Moreover, revenue sharing also tends to create evenly matched
competitors, which may in the long run boost the popularity of the
sport. By helping to keep football teams in profit, the NFL
buttresses a national fan base.

WIFE DENIES KILLING HUSBAND, ADMITS DUMPING TORSO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JIM WALSH AND CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Scottsdale beauty salon owner told police she put her
husband's torso into her blue Jaguar and dumped it into a trash bin
four days after finding him dead because she feared she would be
accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, one day after being arrested at her upscale salon, a
shaken Valerie Pape, 47, was led into a Mesa court wrapped in a
blue blanket.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked the petite blonde if she was responsible
for killing Ira Pomerantz, 60, her husband of five years, she said,
``No, I am not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape, described as a ``gentle soul,'' was estranged from her
husband, the former owner of two East Valley bars. The two had a
stormy relationship that drew police to their Scottsdale home a
half-dozen times and caused her to seek an order of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, neighbors said, had been jealous of a male friend
of his wife who dwelled in the couple's home and was part owner of
the Valerie Pape Beauty Gallery at 4200 N. Marshall Way in downtown
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said she found her husband's clothed body lying face up in
a pool of blood in the kitchen of her Scottsdale home Monday
morning. A gun lay nearby. Her husband had been fatally shot in the
back with a medium- to large-caliber gun, police said.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted cleaning up the blood. She hid the weapon under the
rear seat of her car, she said. And she admitted tossing her
husband's legless, armless naked torso behind the Bashas' at
McDowell and Power roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she did not tell us how the body was dismembered,'' Mesa
Detective Butch Gates wrote in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear what she did with the body for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Earle Lloyd, a Mesa police spokesman, said he believed Pape
may have needed help with the slaying because she is petite.
</P>
<P>
   Court records reveal Pomerantz's body was cut apart with an
electric cutting tool. Police have searched her $372,000 home and
her beauty parlor. They have not reported whether they found the
missing body parts. Police seized both the weapon and the car
Jaguar itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She claimed that she did not report this to police because she
thought she would be blamed,'' the court records said.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends and neighbors Saturday recalled the couple's
wedding reception in the back yard of their 2,918-square foot home.
The pair had met in New York, where Pape was caring for Pomerantz's
father, friends said. They moved to the Scottsdale residence in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Bua, whose bakery adjoins the beauty salon, sold Pape her
wedding cake. Bua also was a frequent client in the salon that
charges $48 for a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard her say an unkind thing about anybody,'' Bua
said. ``She's very gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape was described as sweet, happy, athletic and meticulous in
her appearance. She jogged through the neighborhood almost every
morning and frequently hiked Camelback Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   She has a teenage daughter who was born in France but lives in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very sensitive, very sweet,'' one woman said. ``She
has a gentle soul. She wouldn't hurt a fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Vega, manager of nearby Bronco Billy's Night Club in
Chandler, described Pomerantz as ``a good old man, very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pomerantz had a drinking problem, said Vega and Lynn Waters,
35, a waitress who once worked in one of Pomerantz's bars, Rhythm
and Cues at 140 W. Warner Road in Chandler. Both said he would pass
out while his bar was still open.
</P>
<P>
   His record includes a 1998 arrest for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a good businessman,'' Waters said. ``He didn't pay
his employees, he cheated his patrons, he watered down the booze
and served after hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Vega said Pomerantz got into trouble with state liquor
authorities because he served underage customers at Rhythm and
Cues.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Pomerantz gave Pape money from the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz was wounded below the waist in the Vietnam War,
according to neighbor Lynn Hartman, 58. He had a daughter; it could
not be determined whether he had more children.
</P>
<P>
   According to bankruptcy and other records, Pomerantz appeared to
be a troubled businessman. He lost to bankruptcy both the
well-known Norton's Country Corner Western bar at Gilbert and
Chandler roads and his Rhythm and Cues bar.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that several years ago, Michel Sauvage, a friend
of Pape's from France, moved in with the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed a place to stay, and he was their house guest,''
Hartman said. ``Ira set up her hair salon, and gave him a piece of
it so he could stay in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartman said Pomerantz told him that Pomerantz had become
suspicious of Sauvage's relationship with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started to smell a rat,'' Hartman said. ``He was really
distraught, but he said his two big Dobermans were his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a whole big soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage works in the salon, and was listed as the real estate
agent on the ``for sale'' sign on the couple's home. Pape named
Sauvage as a friend in police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sauvage was at work at the salon, answering phones. He
would not comment on the case. He has been questioned and released.
</P>
<P>
   Pape and Pomerantz fought constantly. Police would not release
reports from their visits to the home, but said they included
burglary, aggravated assault and a violation of an order of
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a deliveryman told Mesa police that he had spotted
Pape driving to the dumpster behind Bashas' in her 1997 Jaguar.
Another witness identified her from a composite drawing, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Pape on Friday at the posh parlor. She made her
initial appearance on suspicion of first-degree murder in West Mesa
Justice Court on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before her court hearing, police and lab
technicians combed the couple's elegant McCormick Ranch home and
remained throughout the day. They sought body parts and evidence
that the slaying took place in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The salon, in downtown Scottsdale's arts and shopping district
west of Scottsdale Road, the city's main drag, was open. Customers
trailed in, and a woman employee sat on a bench, smoking a
cigarette and cradling her head in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Pape is ``pretty shell-shocked,'' said James Belanger, her
attorney. ``She doesn't even understand what goes on in the
American legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, Judge Clayton Hamblen ordered her held without bail
and set a Feb. 4 hearing date at which she would be expected to
enter a plea. &QL;

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Monday, Jan. 31:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-MAVERICK (Mount Gerlitzen, Austria) _ To many Austrians,
Joerg Haider is that southern governor with the odd blend of
liberal spending plans and anti-immigrant sentiments they might
quietly agree with but that they know look bad to the European
Union. To foreigners, he is that Austrian who said those pro-Nazi
things. Israel has threatened to break diplomatic relations if
Haider joins the government, and France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden
and Italy have all expressed concern. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DAVOS-CLINTON (Davos, Switzerland) _ After seven years of
pushing harder than any post-War president to expand trade between
the United States and the rest of the world, President Clinton told
global leaders here this weekend that the American people have had
enough. Congress and society at large have less enthusiasm for
exchanging goods and services with the world than they did when he
first took office, Clinton said. If new trade deals are going to
get done, he said, the world needs to reinvent the way it thinks
about trade and globalization to accommodate this American
political reality. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-HACKERS (Tokyo) _ In what has become almost a daily
ritual, Internet hackers posted messages on the web site of Japan's
postal service criticizing this country's wartime role in China in
the 1930s. At least 11 government agencies here have been attacked
by the Internet hackers. In each incident, the hackers have
denounced Japan's involvement in the murderous 1937 sacking of
Nanjing by Imperial Japanese troops. The security breeches have
deeply embarrassed the Japanese government, which has rushed to
create a special task force to catch the intruders. By Howard W.
French.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CONGO (Undated) _ When an unusual meeting of African
leaders and the Security Council ended last week, there was general
agreement that the United Nations will have to be given a major
role in bringing peace to Congo. But when, and in what form, are
still open questions that are expected to dominate council
discussions in coming days. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-BOMB (Jerusalem) _ Guerrillas in Lebanon detonate a
roadside bomb in southern Lebanon, killing a senior official in the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-EGYPT (Cairo, Egypt) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel meets with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA (Beijing) _ Taiwan's main opposition candidate said
that if elected President he would not push for formal independence

 &HT;     McCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH'S EXPERIENCE AS TEXAN RALLIES FAMILY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL

<P>
   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, pressing his
differences over Texas Gov. George W. Bush three days before New
Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, declared Saturday that
he does not need ``on-the-job training'' to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain touted his populist campaign at three question-and-answer
sessions as Bush canvassed southern New Hampshire with his famous
family in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush
joined their 52-year-old son on the campaign trail, as did former
Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole, who dropped her own quest for the
Republican presidential nomination last fall and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy, this son of ours is not going to let you down,'' the
former president told more than 1,000 cheering, placard-waving
supporters gathered for a country music concert staged by the Bush
campaign at an indoor tennis complex in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who lost his re-election bid in 1992 to
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, told the crowd his son is ``going
to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke for barely one minute to the crowd,
including families who had been waiting for up to two hours to hear
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel something in the air; we're on our way because of
you,'' Bush said as he introduced his parents. Following brief
remarks by his mother and father, Bush added: ``Thank you all for
coming. Work hard. Knock on those doors. Shake those hands. And
we're going to love Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary, the first of the 2000 campaign, is
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief remarks left at least one member of the audience
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that was anti-climactic,'' complained Ron Pieterse, 40, a
dump truck driver from Peterborough who attended the rally with his
five-year-old daughter Sabina. ``I came to learn something. I guess
I'll have to go on the Internet to find out his positions on things
I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse said he planned to vote for Bush on Tuesday because of
his enduring loyalty to the former president. ``I've got that
bumper sticker, `Don't blame me, I voted for Bush,''' Pieterse said
as he walked to his car with his daughter, who was holding her doll
Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign issued a statement that cited the benefits of
his proposed tax cut. Bush said his plan would help ``those who
live on the outskirts of poverty'' as well as ``knock down the
tollbooth to the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain's more modest tax cut included a provision to
tax the benefits paid employees by their companies. Bush said in
the statement: ``That's going to hurt working people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spoke to voters in Windham several hours earlier,
cited Bush's use of his legendary family during the final weekend
of the hard-fought New Hampshire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrities that I'm interested in are the people in this
room and the people of New Hampshire,'' McCain told several hundred
people packed into the auditorium at a junior high school in
Windham, home of the ``Windham Wildcats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added, at his 109th town hall meeting n the campaign:
``You are the celebrities that are important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three public opinion surveys released on Saturday showed McCain
leading Bush. The margin ranged from one percentage point in a
CNN-USA Today survey, 36 percent to 35 percent, to eight percentage
points in a University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox survey that showed
McCain leading Bush 41 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a pollster based in Utica, N.Y., said the Republican
race could be ``very tight,'' adding: ``Bush may have the superior
organization to get out the vote and that could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush appealed for supporters to help turn out
the vote in a GOP field that includes three other candidates who
have not won elective office before _ magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, talk show host Alan Keyes, and former Reagan administration
official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain devoted 25 minutes of remarks to his audience in Windham
to highlighting differences with Bush over the size of their
proposed tax cuts, action to close corporate tax loopholes, the
breadth of their backgrounds, steps to protect the fiscal soundness
of Social Security and proposals to overhaul the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush was relying too heavily on support from the
wealthy to wage his campaign _ which has raised some $74 million _
while he was fighting to ``get big money out of Washington and give
the government back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``Governor Bush is out there raising money. I'm
going to be out there raising hell.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he would not wage a negative campaign
against Bush, who is a ``good man.'' But the senator sought to
emphasize his experience over Bush, who first won elective office
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the life experiences; I have the legislative
experiences; I have knowledge of the grass roots issues,'' said
McCain, 63. ``I want you to know that I am fully prepared to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan served 22 years in the Navy, including five years
as a prisoner of North Vietnam, and has served 17 years in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any on-the-job training. I am fully prepared to
handle these responsibilities,'' McCain said.

<P>
   Scott Johnson, 32, a farmer whose family owns one of the last
two farms in Windham, near the Massachusetts state line, said he
initially planned to vote for Bush but now intends to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Bush talks in sound bites. He doesn't seem to think on
his feet. McCain gives you a straight answer. For me, that is the
No. 1 absolute minimum requirement.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``WORD COURT'' &QL; 
By Barbara Wallraff (Harcourt, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wallraff, who was born and raised in Tucson, now lives in
Massachusetts, where she is a senior editor at ``The Atlantic
Monthly.'' In addition to reading nearly every word that goes into
nearly every issue of the magazine, she writes ``The Atlantic's''
``Word Court'' column, a clearinghouse, of sorts, for questions
about grammar, punctuation, word usage and the general health of
the English language. Her new book is based primarily on
reader-submitted questions, which she answers with an appealing mix
of common sense, research, wit and an occasional foray into
improvisation (although she would not emphasize this _ most of her
``rulings'' are based on solid advice from her dictionaries). She
also includes a ``Grammarian's Dozen,'' in which she addresses
recurring troubles such as the split infinitive or a preposition
left at the end of a clause. This is an engaging book for people
who love language and want to see it treated, if not with
reverence, at least with a little common courtesy.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MY GOODNESS'' &QL; 
By Joe Queenan (Hyperion, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``curmudgeon'' has been used to describe Joe Queenan
(``Red Lobster, White Trash''), but we think it is too kind. More
appropriate, perhaps, would be ``curmudgeon with fangs,'' or
``curmudgeon with occasional bouts of virulent malice.'' Either
way, he's a funny guy, except, we are sorry to say, in this book,
where he makes a tedious show of stifling his mean streak and
embracing goodness. He tries to make his newfound virtue
entertaining, but we'll bare our own fangs and say we didn't laugh
much. Far funnier is the paperback ``Confessions of a Cineplex
Heckler'' (Hyperion, $12.95), a collection of previously published
essays in which Queenan, among other exploits, shouts comments in a
dark movie theater just to see how other patrons will react, or
jumps fully clothed into the Atlantic to prove that Leonardo
DiCaprio could not have lived as long or talked as much as he did
at the end of ``Titanic.''Queenan might be hostile, but which book
do you want to read? &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ON THE REZ'' &QL; 
By Ian Frazier (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's something edgy _ dangerous, even _ about the premise of
this book: A middle-age, middle-class White man with a ponytail and
no particular leg to stand on writes about Indians, specifically
the Oglala Sioux of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
Indeed, Frazier begins by announcing his affinity for things
Indian, by confessing his admiration for historic Indian leaders
and wishing something ``Indian'' for himself, something traditional
``but harder to pin down.'' It's enough to make you squirm, were it
not for the immediate, disarming quality of Frazier's voice. By the
third page, you know you are not in for worshipful romance, but for
a story _ many stories _ told in a scattered but engaging way,
devoid of judgment or condescension, attentive to virtues but
unflinching in the face of trouble, all of it lifted by Frazier's
descriptive style (in winter, he says, cottonwood trees look ``as
if they had decided never to grow leaves again and were tormented
by the decision''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE TOP 10 OF EVERYTHING 2000'' &QL; 
By Russell Ash (DK, $17.95)
</P>
<P>
   Every year, we swear we will not do this, every year we resolve
to banish Russell Ash from our thoughts, and every year we find
ourselves sitting for an irrational amount of time with his new
book of trivia clutched in our hot little hands. This time, we
learned that the pope who served the shortest term was Urban VII
(12 days in 1590). That the first American singer to have a No. 1
hit single in the United Kingdom was Al Martino. That the longest
word in the English language is the name of an enzyme and has no
less than 1,909 letters (this sounded familiar, giving rise to the
suspicion that Ash is cribbing from his earlier books, but we
refuse to go back and check). That the world's greatest population
of pigs can be found, thankfully, in China. That the country with
the highest life expectancy for males and females is Japan (the
United States is not in the Top 10). None of this information has
staying power, of course. By the time you read it, we will have
moved on. See you next year. &QL;

`CHAOS THEORY': APPEALING COMPANIONSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a long way from the Hardy Boys mysteries in Gary Krist's
new thriller, ``Chaos Theory,'' about political corruption in the
city government of Washington. Still, an appealing atmosphere of
adolescent companionability lingers on, as Jason Rourke and Dennis
Monroe, juniors at Robert F. Kennedy High School, try to unravel
why their attempt to buy a couple of joints in the Northeast
section of the city has gone so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jason and Dennis are both bright and mildly troubled. Jason
still feels the aftereffects of the suicide of his mother, who
suffered from clinical depression. He lives uneasily with his
father, Graham, who feels guilty about overprotecting him. Dennis
is considered an ``Afro-Saxon'' by the other blacks in his class,
``a brother hanging with the white kids'' like Jason, ``playing at
being white.'' Yet ``he understood that copping ghetto attitude was
a loser's game _ something that would get him absolutely nowhere in
this world.''
</P>
<P>
   So it seems plausible enough that after suffering a classmate's
``sedate, alcohol-free birthday celebration'' that included a
prayer of thanksgiving, they decide to cut out and buy some grass.
The problem is that when they do, their dealer starts shouting
about being betrayed, pulls a gun on them, sticks it in the window
of their car and tells them to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jason grabs the man's wrist and tells Dennis to drive
away. The dealer, after being dragged along the street and firing a
harmless shot into the car, collides with the back of a parked car
and falls to the ground. The next day Jason and Dennis read the
newspaper headline ``Undercover cop slain in brutal Northeast
attack.'' The article explains that Detective Ramon Harcourt was
found dead with two gunshot wounds in him, lying near a weapon that
had been discharged three times.
</P>
<P>
   But later, when the newspaper runs a photo of Harcourt, Jason
and Dennis realize he isn't the man who attacked them. And of
course they soon become the focus of a threatening police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Krist _ whose previous books include two noted collections of
stories, ``The Garden State'' and ``Bone by Bone,'' and a novel,
``Bad Chemistry'' _ does several things well while untangling this
mystery. He gives us striking snapshots of Washington scenery:
``Across a quiet stretch of the Tidal Basin, the Jefferson Memorial
floated: a big white jellyfish, the pillars hanging down like
tentacles. He could just make out the statue of the president
inside, about to be swallowed.''
</P>
<P>
   He paints a complex picture of what Jason's father refers to as
``the great racial divide'' that ``no D.C. resident could ever
forget, living in a center of white power that just happened to
have a population that was over 60 percent black.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, what lies behind Jason's and Dennis' problems is
a good deal easier to figure out and considerably less shocking
than Krist counts on it being. So his plot can't bear the weight of
an analysis that sees Washington as a city emasculated because it
can't ``tax the real estate of its major tenant or the income of
its commuting workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the hard money to run the city still had to come as a
handout from the federal government,'' the analysis continues,
``paternalism was practically built into District affairs.'' But in
truth the corruption that Jason and Dennis get caught up in could
occur in any metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the truth is the remark of one of the story's
villains: ``They're all talking about accountability now _
openness, order. Responsible, accountable government. But you ask
any businessman, he'll tell you about accountability. Why do you
think they're all running to Russia and Eastern Europe nowadays?
It's the chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaos is just another word for opportunity,'' the villain
continues. ``The weak person's crisis...is the strong person's
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the Hardy Boys element of companionship that makes
``Chaos Theory'' appealing: Jason and Dennis reaching across the
racial divide to help each other out of a pickle, as Graham Rourke
continues his musings about race in Washington: ``Could people like
Graham and the Monroes ever hope to harmonize their interests, or
even remotely  &UR; understand &LR;  each other's interests? It was a big,
unanswerable question, relevant in every American city but
especially in the District of Columbia ... Would it take new dogs _
puppies like Jason and Dennis, maybe _ to learn this new trick?''
</P>
<P>
   Krist's novel, while somewhat flawed as a thriller, holds out
the pleasant hope that puppies like Jason and Dennis will learn
this new trick.

<P>
   The proliferation of writers' workshops in this country raises
that old question: Can creative writing be taught? The best answer
I've ever heard is Wallace Stegner's two-parter: ``1. It can be
done. 2. It can't be done to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose he meant that only genuine talent can be nurtured and
developed in the right atmosphere. But in my experience just a
handful of workshop students ever exhibit such talent, and we all
know of gifted writers who work well without the benefit of
organized groups or individual mentors. It must also be said that
talent can be inhibited, if not destroyed, under the wrong
circumstances. So do we actually need all those workshops?
</P>
<P>
   Writing fiction is a solitary occupation but not really a lonely
one. The writer's head is mobbed with characters, images and
language, making the creative process something like eavesdropping
at a party for which you've had the fun of drawing up the guest
list. Loneliness usually doesn't set in until the work is finished,
and all the partygoers and their imagined universe have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt tends to creep in then, too. Is this story finished? Is it
any good? How can I tell? Most writers' hearts are divided by
ambition and self-doubt. Even Virginia Woolf pondered, about her
manuscript of ``To the Lighthouse,'' ``Is it nonsense, is it
brilliance?'' Of course she might have asked one of her famous
Bloomsbury bunch for an informed opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But most neophytes aren't so well connected, and seeking help
with your work from nonwriter spouses and friends can be
disastrous. People who love you tend to love whatever you produce
because it's yours. (Didn't your mother proudly display your early
artistic efforts on her refrigerator?) And those with hidden
agendas of competitiveness or downright envy might try to sabotage
your confidence and your burgeoning career.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Gore Vidal's candidly mean-spirited observation:
``Whenever a friend succeeds a little, something in me dies.'' And
my grandmother's: ``With friends like that, you don't need
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing one's work home, so to speak, can be very bad for
personal relationships. Another member of your household may be put
into the untenable position of live-in critic, and watch out: he
may be planning to show you something he's written, counting on
reciprocal love. A fairly safe comment in those circumstances is:
``This is terrific, sweetheart. I couldn't put it down.'' How would
anybody dare to put it down with you standing right there, wringing
your hands and silently moving your lips during the reading?
</P>
<P>
   You must ask yourself if you really want an honest opinion from
a loved one. The soon-to-be ex-wife of a popular novelist once
complained about his habit of asking her to read a chapter of his
work in progress at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say I like it,'' she said, sighing, ``he wants to know
how much, and, in minute detail, exactly why. And if I don't like
it, he's so disappointed I have to cheer him up. In either case we
don't get to sleep for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   She had my sympathy, but so did he. When I recount last night's
dream for my psychologist husband at breakfast, I secretly want him
to admire it, not analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   I remember completing a draft of my first short story and
wondering if it worked, if it was, in fact, a bona fide story.
Reading it over and over again didn't resolve my uncertainty. I
desperately needed some feedback, but I didn't have a community of
peers to turn to; I didn't know any other writers at all.
</P>
<P>
   I was a typical '60s housewife then, deeply involved in the
minutiae of daily household life. Most of my creative energy was
spent in homemaking. I never made a simple tuna salad sandwich for
my children. Those poor kids got to cannibalize tuna fish men with
carrot-stick limbs and bulging olive eyes. Birthday cakes _ made
from scratch of course _ were decorated to the point of collapse,
and my Jell-O molds were famous for their originality and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   As a late-blooming writer I'm sometimes asked if my husband and
children felt abandoned or betrayed by my sudden new career.
Frankly, I think the whole family was relieved when I began to
direct all my energy and inspiration elsewhere. Still, I didn't
know where that first story came from (although the opening line,
``Today a woman went mad in the supermarket,'' might have given me
a clue) or what in the world to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So I asked my husband what he thought, and wisely he suggested I
seek professional advice, which led to my taking a writing workshop
at the New School. There, for the first time, I found the company
of other writers. Stanley couldn't have been any happier to have
found Livingston. But my joy wasn't immediate.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop I joined was led by Anatole Broyard, a writer who
would later become a daily book reviewer for The New York Times.
I'd submitted a short story, as required, and several days later
received a card inviting me to show up at a designated classroom at
6 p.m. on the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The room was packed that first evening (hadn't they turned
anyone down?), and I sat in one of the few available seats in the
back, wondering what I was doing there and why it had seemed like
such a terrific idea when my husband suggested it. Anatole made a
few opening remarks and then, after consulting a list, called on me
to come up front and read my story aloud to the class. Caught off
guard, I had to spit out my gum and stumble forward, dropping a few
pages along the way. I was so nervous I almost hyperventilated, and
I read with the dramatic expression usually reserved for the
laundry list or the eye chart.
</P>
<P>
   When Anatole asked the class to respond to my story, a man in
the back promptly pronounced it the most boring thing he'd ever
heard. That was about all I cared to hear. I was ready to pack it
in, to go home and just make Jell-O molds and tuna fish men for the
rest of my life
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anatole slipped me a note, even as he told my detractor that he
had every right to dislike my story, but that he had to say why he
had found it boring and what I might do to make it better. And
wasn't there anything in it he had liked? The last thing I wanted
at that moment was detailed negative criticism, or even being
thrown a belated bone of praise, but I half-listened anyway, as I
surreptitiously opened the note, which I still have and still look
at occasionally for reassurance. It said: ``The story is fine.
Congratulations. See me later.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words tempered the sting of the harsh ones my classmate
was still blithely offering, and in that moment I learned the most
important thing about teaching writing: There must be a balance of
honesty and charity in the workshop. Everyone must be aware of a
fellow human being behind the work being discussed, and criticism
has to be useful, not just derogatory or laudatory.
</P>
<P>
   When I spoke to Anatole after class that first, fateful night,
he suggested that I join his advanced workshop, a much smaller
group that met weekly in a conference room at the advertising
agency where he worked during the day. I was so relieved and
flattered. I went home with buoyed self-confidence, and the
following week I read the same story aloud again, with a lot more
expression this time, not to mention much higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   To my disappointment several members of the advanced group
didn't like it much either. But at least their comments were
balanced and constructive, and I was able to listen more calmly and
extract what I needed to improve the story.
</P>
<P>
   I learned a lot of other things over the years I stayed in that
group: that the workshop isn't group therapy; that character
prevails in fiction just as it does in life; that the common
workshop goal is revision, not suicide; that work should never be
submitted anonymously (unless you're in the federal witness
protection program); and that there's really no defense of a
manuscript that doesn't work for the reader. Best of all, I
gradually came to realize that I'd joined a staunch fellowship of
writers who would support me through difficult projects, spells of
writer's block, and those inevitable rejections.
</P>
<P>
   I've taught fiction writing on and off for a number of years now
myself, and those basic principles of honesty and charity are still
at the core of my workshops, just as the company of other writers
continues to sustain and inspire me and my students. Every story
presented gets a fair shake, even (and this once really happened)
when it's told from the point of view of a brain-dead person.
Credibility and empathy, as you can imagine, were big issues during
that session.
</P>
<P>
   I still agree with Wallace Stegner that talent is a prerequisite
for the future professional. But there's a place in the classroom
for other interested parties who, in their ardent analysis of one
another's writing, become much better readers. And God knows we can
always use more of them.

`NIXON'S CHINA GAME': THE STEALTH CAMPAIGN TO OPEN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Program notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New
York area. Check local listings.)

 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a dollop of Eric Ambler, add a whiff of the Marx Brothers,
stir wildly, and you have ``Nixon's China Game,'' Monday night's
zesty account of the huggermugger surrounding President Richard
Nixon's celebrated ``opening to China.'' The supersecrecy that kept
Secretary of State William Rogers in the dark and put Henry
Kissinger in disguise are laid out by an international cast of
players who served the Nixonian geopolitical strategy to transform
relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday nights' ``American Experience'' on PBS, which combines
newsreels and interviews, the former president stars as diplomatic
tactician: daring, devious and remarkably farsighted. When
intelligence operatives detected a breach between China and the
Soviet Union early in his presidency, Nixon, the impeccable
anti-communist, put into effect a plan to repair relations with
China as a way of putting pressure on the Soviets, and vice versa.
It had to be done in secret, lest Republican right-wingers get wind
of the plot and cry, ``Soft on Communism!''
</P>
<P>
   So began an international feeling-out process that included a
fashion show at the Yugoslav Embassy in Warsaw, where, a member of
the Chinese delegation reports, the U.S. ambassador ran after the
Chinese, shouting: ``I saw President Nixon in Washington! He wants
to establish relations with China!'' When State Department
officials expressed reservations about the initiative, Nixon cut
them out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Yahya Khan, the Pakistani leader, served as middleman
between Nixon and Zhou Enlai, China's prime minister. As relations
showed signs of warming, Kissinger, the national security adviser,
was given the job of arranging a presidential visit to China, code
named Marco Polo. The emissary, in a big black raincoat, a big
black hat and dark glasses, was spirited into China's once
forbidden city.
</P>
<P>
   The asides add flavor to the hour. A Pakistani official couldn't
find his car keys. Kissinger forgot to take an extra shirt, which
gave one of his assistants, Winston Lord, a chance to crack,
``Before you even sit down and talk with them, you've lost your
shirt!''
</P>
<P>
   One immediate effect of the Chinese-American enterprise, it is
reported here, was to goad the Kremlin into proceeding with stalled
arms talks. As Nixon said, ``So the Russian game made the Chinese
game work, and the Chinese game made the Russian game work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the election year of 1972 Nixon gathered several score
television journalists to come along on his momentous trip. As
Stanley Karnow, one close observer who contributes to the hour,
notes, ``This was going to be a television show.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever touchy subject of Taiwan brought what Nixon called
``some very spirited discussions between Rogers and Kissinger.''
Finally Zhou himself helped to smooth matters, and at the closing
banquet the president is described as getting happily tipsy from
all the toasts.
</P>
<P>
   The program is an entertaining peek behind the negotiation wall,
illuminating an episode whose ramifications continue to be felt in
the current complicated relations with the Chinese. By the 1980s,
the narrator reminds us, a new Nixonian slogan appeared in Beijing:
``To get rich is glorious!''

ARIZONA'S `IRON LADY' ANSWERS HER CRITICS WITH WIT _ AND VETOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's a scene straight out of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   A young mother looks out over the barren high desert, her three
small children huddled behind her skirts. Horses graze out front as
a wagon rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hull, you're not in Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Arizona's present governor was a 26-year-old
schoolteacher who left a comfortable Kansas City suburb and moved
to Chinle, a remote town on the Navajo Reservation in northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real culture shock,'' Hull recalled. ``We were there
in the days when the wagons pulled up for commodities at the
boarding school.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Terry, a doctor, had been assigned to Chinle by the
U.S. Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   There was no theater, no library; only a few trading posts.
There was no supermarket, so Hull did her shopping in Albuquerque,
planning family meals six weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, there was no TV . . . we had to make our own
fun,'' Hull said. ``We had more time to really enjoy each other, I
think, than I ever had, before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's time in Chinle offers a striking image of the governor as
a gritty frontier woman. But it doesn't square with the portrait
being painted by some detractors in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, they say that Hull is out of touch and over her head,
and being led around by her staff. As evidence, they point to an
excessive number of vetoes (21) last session and a breakdown in
communication with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As Hull, 64, begins her third year as governor, lawmakers are
grumbling that the real power is held by Hull's chief of staff,
Rick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got sick last year . . . you saw a change,'' said
state Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north central Phoenix. ``Rick did gain
more power, and she did become more isolated. It became harder for
us to talk to her independent of Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the capitol, the whispers have started. Has the Iron Lady
started to rust?
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her staff laugh off such claims. She says Collins takes
most of the flak, because that's his role as chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually too involved in too many things,'' Hull said. ``I
micromanage around here more than we would like. Everybody blames
it on Rick. It's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the office, Hull doesn't stand on ceremony. She sometimes
answers her own phone and gets her own coffee and is still
embarrassed when staff members rise when she enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   She's not much of a public speaker, actually more of a public
reader, as evidenced by her recent State of the State speech, which
was described by one catty observer as ``almost lifelike.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Hull was speaking to a somewhat hostile
Legislature, including people who want to teach gun safety in
public schools, but don't care whether kids fall out of the back of
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull tried to entertain them a little, with a tame joke
or two. The speech's solitary attempt at statesmanship _ a Latin
phrase _ fell flat when Hull mangled it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the spotlight, Hull is quick-witted and engaging. She
reminds one of former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
whose singular wit never translated in big rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Hull met with the media after her state
address, she ribbed one reporter for appearing to sleep through the
speech. &QL; 
A parent's patience Hull also exhibits the patience of someone who
has raised four children and taught thousands more. After 21 years
in public office, she boasts, ``I usually can get along with
everybody and anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor gently notes that she has turned the emphasis back
to helping people. She's proud of programs such as KidsCare, which
provides health insurance for the children of the working poor, and
Students FIRST, a plan to fix dilapidated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull has another advantage over her predecessor, Fife
Symington. Her staff members aren't preoccupied with keeping their
boss out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   As for her dust-ups with the Legislature and House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, R-Mesa, Hull is puzzled. She spent 14 years in the House,
including two terms as speaker, so she knows how the Legislature
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem understanding why they just don't pick up the
phone and call me, at night or at home or whatever,'' Hull said.
``Because I've known a lot of them for a long time. And some of
them have said, `But you understand, you're now the governor, and
we can't do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull remains immersed in affairs of state,
attending meetings, taking work home, even e-mailing staffers in
the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does her homework,'' said Collins, waving a handful of
bureaucratic minutiae that Hull will inevitably want to see. ``I
guess that's the schoolteacher in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the governor and Collins acknowledge that Hull's
hospital stay in March started tongues wagging. Was Hull gravely
ill? Could she still govern? Would she serve out her term?
</P>
<P>
   The illness gave an opening to Hull's enemies to undermine her
in a way that goes far beyond making fun of the governor's big hair
or knocking her for talking about curlers.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that at one point, Collins was denying rumors that
Hull had a fatal liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she is sick _ sick of hearing about the issue. To
muzzle the gossip, Hull granted a reporter an interview with her
physician, Dr. Anita Murcko.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said Hull was hospitalized with a serious kidney
infection. It started in the urinary tract and reached Hull's
bloodstream, but it did not advance to the more serious condition
of toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Hull fashion, she tried not to create a fuss, walking
the short distance from her doctor's office to Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked over because she didn't want to alarm her security
guards,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was treated with intravenous antibiotics and suffers no
lasting effects. She takes medication for arthritis and a thyroid
condition, and Murcko describes her as very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors, Hull cracked, ``I keep saying they're jealous
because I've lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   They also might be jealous of Hull's knack for always being in
the right place at the right time. Hull never has to run that hard.
The ball always comes right to her.
</P>
<P>
   She's the Silver Surfer of Arizona politics, riding a wave of
serendipity to the top of state government.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1979, Hull made headlines in 1982 by
suggesting that the state could save money by allowing the swamp
coolers at the Perryville prison to fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the swamp coolers will break down,'' she said. ``That
might get rid of some of our prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   As majority whip in 1987-88, Hull became the de facto majority
leader, filling in for an ailing Jim Ratliff. In 1989, she landed
in the speaker's chair after Joe Lane was ousted by voters angry
over Lane's role in the impeachment of former Gov. Evan Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was known as a no-nonsense speaker who kept her fellow
Republicans in line, never hesitating to bonk a fews heads if need
be. While speaker, she earned two nicknames _ ``Iron Lady'' from
her supporters and ``Dragon Lady'' from her enemies _ and weathered
the AzScam public corruption scandal, which led to criminal charges
against several legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hull inherited the Governor's Office from Symington,
who was forced out after being convicted of bank fraud. Symington's
conviction has since been overturned. Hull ran for re-election in
1998 and won by a wide margin. &QL; 
Shaky public relations
</P>
<P>
   Despite her long experience in state government, Hull is off to
a shaky start, at least as far as public relations go.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked last year that the state was ordering a
14-year-old to have an abortion, Hull appeared to waffle.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said there was little the state could do. But as
public pressure mounted, Hull reversed field, calling on state
Attorney General Janet Napolitano to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull took a bum rap in that case, which would be
clear when the records are made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going this path until a document was set down in front
of her face, from a psychiatrist, that was contradictory to the
route she was going,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also got some bad press for her push to install cable
barriers on Valley freeways. After several people were killed in
head-on collisions, Hull told the state Department of
Transportation to study the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   After a friend, former state legislator Polly Getzwiller, was
seriously injured in a similar crash, Hull cut the study short and
ordered the department to install the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said her decision was not linked to the accident involving
Getzwiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice lady, and I know her . . . and some day we have
to find out if she's ever gotten out of the hospital,'' Hull said. &QL; 
Power struggleWhether Hull blows with the wind or not, one thing is
certain: She faces a Legislature that borders on insurrection. Some
lawmakers are upset because they didn't see Hull's vetoes coming
last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of it, a reporter called me,'' said Sen. Tom
Freestone, R-Mesa, an amiable ex-wrestler and fixture in Maricopa
County politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guess what, Freestone. Your bill just got
slaughtered' . . . I was caught flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone, whose open-meetings bill should survive this session,
said he understands why legislators bristled at the vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like working through the whole season raising
crops, then you find out you had a tornado come through and destroy
everything,'' Freestone said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, lawmakers may take the fight with Hull a step
further. In a move that smacks of bravado, they have hinted about a
``veto session'' _ reconvening to revive any bill struck down by
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about power, says Groscost, who believes Hull vetoed a
number of bills to re-establish control of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of it was aimed at making sure she sent a
message to legislators who disagreed with her,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her mind, she tried to show that she was in charge and in
fact people better listen to what she had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, said Hull had
good reasons behind her vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she vetoed bills for fun,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull says the vetoes were all about policy, not
payback. Most of them involved bills that called for spending
beyond the current budget, or bills that cut into the power of
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hull's disagreements have been with Groscost, who
clearly loves stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hail from the same party, Hull and Groscost
couldn't be more different. Hull is a member of the old guard, a
moderate, a grandmother and a Catholic. Groscost is a young turk, a
staunch conservative and a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost sometimes sports the demeanor of a used car salesman,
but he's no dummy. He understands how to consolidate power and hold
it, and he lives for political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the rift, Hull chose to back Texas Gov. George W. Bush
for president, while Groscost and most other state Republicans are
pushing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Groscost has baited Hull at every turn. He invited
National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston to address the
House, despite the governor's moderate position on guns.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he held a downtown fund-raiser featuring skits
lampooning Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to understatement, Hull said she was
``disappointed'' in the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you respect the governor or not, respect the office,''
Hull said. ``The fund-raiser and the singing, those things are not
a respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has also taken criticism for letting her various policy
experts lobby the Legislature, meaning her office doesn't speak
with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problem is, all of her staff people are real technocrats . . .
they don't know politics,'' Gerard said. ``Because Rick (Collins)
is so authoritarian or totalitarian, they can come down and talk to
us, but they have no authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Gerard and Collins stopped playing nice and
started kicking sand in each other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the session, Gerard sent Collins a box of
chocolates as a make-up present. Collins sent it back. So there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had accused me of not being truthful and questioning my
integrity . . . that's the kind of thing that happens in the heat
of battle,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little out of line in sending it back.''
</P>
<P>
   This session, Hull has taken steps to open the lines of
communication between her office and the Legislature, in part by
naming aide Jaime Molera as chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor smiles when legislators say they want a
return to the Symington administration, when one lobbyist, Barry
Aarons, did most of the governor's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want Barry Aarons back . . . every one of those
people had said, `Get Barry Aarons out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she takes a different tack with lawmakers than
Symington did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that style of having one person go down there and
twist their arms, twist their necks,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also ran into trouble with the Legislature during
December's special session to replace the dilapidated state mental
hospital. Hull called the session, only to watch her proposal die
in a committee. &QL; 
A new session
</P>
<P>
   But things improved when the regular session started. One of the
first acts was passage of a bill to provide $80 million for a new
state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hull's legislative troubles have to do with term limits
and the current leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In another environment, Senate President Brenda Burns,
R-Glendale, might be able to play peacemaker between Groscost and
Hull, but Burns has troubles of her own.
</P>
<P>
   For one, she faces the challenge of running the Senate with a
one-seat (16-14) Republican majority. On top of that, she may not
be able to hold on to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Due to term limits, Groscost must leave the House next year and
probably will run for the Senate, where he and pal Rusty Bowers, a
Republican senator from Mesa, could form a cabal to oust Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hubbub, Hull probably will find a way to
survive, just as she did in Chinle years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Allen, a Navajo registered nurse who befriended the Hulls,
said there's just something about Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very resourceful to find things to do, and get
acquainted,'' Allen said. ``That's what Jane did . . . She was a
very easygoing person, very outgoing. She doesn't just sit back and
wait for people to come to her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hull will not write off the Legislature. She will not give
up. She'll crack her jokes, make her phone calls, do her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to me is that I leave a legacy that
says the state of Arizona is better for my five years of being
governor,'' Hull said. &QL;

   NH-GOP (Hudson, N.H.) _ Texas Gov. George Bush tries to corral
the stubborn insurgency of Arizona Sen. John McCain by disparaging
his Republican challenger's modest tax cut plan as the kind of
scheme offered by the Clinton-Gore administration. But McCain
continues his attacks on Bush. He demands that the Texas governor
persuade New York authorities to let him on the March 7 primary
ballot in that state. And McCain insists that he will be a stronger
GOP candidate against Vice President Al Gore because he alone has
rejected the questionable fund-raising practices used by the
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign in 1996. By STEWART M. POWELL.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The proliferation of writers' workshops in this country raises
that old question: Can creative writing be taught? The best answer
I've ever heard is Wallace Stegner's two-parter: ``1. It can be
done. 2. It can't be done to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose he meant that only genuine talent can be nurtured and
developed in the right atmosphere. But in my experience just a
handful of workshop students ever exhibit such talent, and we all
know of gifted writers who work well without the benefit of
organized groups or individual mentors. It must also be said that
talent can be inhibited, if not destroyed, under the wrong
circumstances. So do we actually need all those workshops?
</P>
<P>
   Writing fiction is a solitary occupation but not really a lonely
one. The writer's head is mobbed with characters, images and
language, making the creative process something like eavesdropping
at a party for which you've had the fun of drawing up the guest
list. Loneliness usually doesn't set in until the work is finished,
and all the partygoers and their imagined universe have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt tends to creep in then, too. Is this story finished? Is it
any good? How can I tell? Most writers' hearts are divided by
ambition and self-doubt. Even Virginia Woolf pondered, about her
manuscript of ``To the Lighthouse,'' ``Is it nonsense, is it
brilliance?'' Of course she might have asked one of her famous
Bloomsbury bunch for an informed opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But most neophytes aren't so well connected, and seeking help
with your work from nonwriter spouses and friends can be
disastrous. People who love you tend to love whatever you produce
because it's yours. (Didn't your mother proudly display your early
artistic efforts on her refrigerator?) And those with hidden
agendas of competitiveness or downright envy might try to sabotage
your confidence and your burgeoning career.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Gore Vidal's candidly mean-spirited observation:
``Whenever a friend succeeds a little, something in me dies.'' And
my grandmother's: ``With friends like that, you don't need
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing one's work home, so to speak, can be very bad for
personal relationships. Another member of your household may be put
into the untenable position of live-in critic, and watch out: he
may be planning to show you something he's written, counting on
reciprocal love. A fairly safe comment in those circumstances is:
``This is terrific, sweetheart. I couldn't put it down.'' How would
anybody dare to put it down with you standing right there, wringing
your hands and silently moving your lips during the reading?
</P>
<P>
   You must ask yourself if you really want an honest opinion from
a loved one. The soon-to-be ex-wife of a popular novelist once
complained about his habit of asking her to read a chapter of his
work in progress at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say I like it,'' she said, sighing, ``he wants to know
how much, and, in minute detail, exactly why. And if I don't like
it, he's so disappointed I have to cheer him up. In either case we
don't get to sleep for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   She had my sympathy, but so did he. When I recount last night's
dream for my psychologist husband at breakfast, I secretly want him
to admire it, not analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   I remember completing a draft of my first short story and
wondering if it worked, if it was, in fact, a bona fide story.
Reading it over and over again didn't resolve my uncertainty. I
desperately needed some feedback, but I didn't have a community of
peers to turn to; I didn't know any other writers at all.
</P>
<P>
   I was a typical '60s housewife then, deeply involved in the
minutiae of daily household life. Most of my creative energy was
spent in homemaking. I never made a simple tuna salad sandwich for
my children. Those poor kids got to cannibalize tuna fish men with
carrot-stick limbs and bulging olive eyes. Birthday cakes _ made
from scratch of course _ were decorated to the point of collapse,
and my Jell-O molds were famous for their originality and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   As a late-blooming writer I'm sometimes asked if my husband and
children felt abandoned or betrayed by my sudden new career.
Frankly, I think the whole family was relieved when I began to
direct all my energy and inspiration elsewhere. Still, I didn't
know where that first story came from (although the opening line,
``Today a woman went mad in the supermarket,'' might have given me
a clue) or what in the world to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So I asked my husband what he thought, and wisely he suggested I
seek professional advice, which led to my taking a writing workshop
at the New School. There, for the first time, I found the company
of other writers. Stanley couldn't have been any happier to have
found Livingston. But my joy wasn't immediate.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop I joined was led by Anatole Broyard, a writer who
would later become a daily book reviewer for The New York Times.
I'd submitted a short story, as required, and several days later
received a card inviting me to show up at a designated classroom at
6 p.m. on the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The room was packed that first evening (hadn't they turned
anyone down?), and I sat in one of the few available seats in the
back, wondering what I was doing there and why it had seemed like
such a terrific idea when my husband suggested it. Anatole made a
few opening remarks and then, after consulting a list, called on me
to come up front and read my story aloud to the class. Caught off
guard, I had to spit out my gum and stumble forward, dropping a few
pages along the way. I was so nervous I almost hyperventilated, and
I read with the dramatic expression usually reserved for the
laundry list or the eye chart.
</P>
<P>
   When Anatole asked the class to respond to my story, a man in
the back promptly pronounced it the most boring thing he'd ever
heard. That was about all I cared to hear. I was ready to pack it
in, to go home and just make Jell-O molds and tuna fish men for the
rest of my life
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anatole slipped me a note, even as he told my detractor that he
had every right to dislike my story, but that he had to say why he
had found it boring and what I might do to make it better. And
wasn't there anything in it he had liked? The last thing I wanted
at that moment was detailed negative criticism, or even being
thrown a belated bone of praise, but I half-listened anyway, as I
surreptitiously opened the note, which I still have and still look
at occasionally for reassurance. It said: ``The story is fine.
Congratulations. See me later.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words tempered the sting of the harsh ones my classmate
was still blithely offering, and in that moment I learned the most
important thing about teaching writing: There must be a balance of
honesty and charity in the workshop. Everyone must be aware of a
fellow human being behind the work being discussed, and criticism
has to be useful, not just derogatory or laudatory.
</P>
<P>
   When I spoke to Anatole after class that first, fateful night,
he suggested that I join his advanced workshop, a much smaller
group that met weekly in a conference room at the advertising
agency where he worked during the day. I was so relieved and
flattered. I went home with buoyed self-confidence, and the
following week I read the same story aloud again, with a lot more
expression this time, not to mention much higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   To my disappointment several members of the advanced group
didn't like it much either. But at least their comments were
balanced and constructive, and I was able to listen more calmly and
extract what I needed to improve the story.
</P>
<P>
   I learned a lot of other things over the years I stayed in that
group: that the workshop isn't group therapy; that character
prevails in fiction just as it does in life; that the common
workshop goal is revision, not suicide; that work should never be
submitted anonymously (unless you're in the federal witness
protection program); and that there's really no defense of a
manuscript that doesn't work for the reader. Best of all, I
gradually came to realize that I'd joined a staunch fellowship of
writers who would support me through difficult projects, spells of
writer's block, and those inevitable rejections.
</P>
<P>
   I've taught fiction writing on and off for a number of years now
myself, and those basic principles of honesty and charity are still
at the core of my workshops, just as the company of other writers
continues to sustain and inspire me and my students. Every story
presented gets a fair shake, even (and this once really happened)
when it's told from the point of view of a brain-dead person.
Credibility and empathy, as you can imagine, were big issues during
that session.
</P>
<P>
   I still agree with Wallace Stegner that talent is a prerequisite
for the future professional. But there's a place in the classroom
for other interested parties who, in their ardent analysis of one
another's writing, become much better readers. And God knows we can
always use more of them.

facts until they are as bedraggled as his rain hat, whose brim has
all but parted company with the hat itself.

<P>
   Levitt, who is 57, began looking into the police investigation
of the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, a 15-year-old Greenwich,
Conn., girl, as a freelancer in 1983. Levitt said he undertook the
project at the request of Ken Brief, then editor of both The
Greenwich Time and The Stamford Advocate, which are sibling papers
owned by Times Mirror Co. He submitted a draft of an article in
1984, and several drafts subsequently, but year after year it
remained unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   But Levitt, who later joined another Times Mirror paper,
Newsday, as a police reporter and columnist, kept in touch with
Martha's mother, Dorthy, telling her the article would be printed
someday.
</P>
<P>
   When the Moxley case came back into the news in 1991, Levitt was
quoted in The New York Post about the article that had never run.
Within days, The Time and The Advocate both published the piece _
seven years after Levitt's first draft.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what made the difference. Brief, now a professor
at Columbia Journalism School, declined comment. Steven L.
Isenberg, the former publisher of the newspaper, said the draft he
had reviewed in the mid-1980s had legal and journalistic
shortcomings; he did not know what happened afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were legitimate questions,'' said Kevin Donovan, who
began collaborating with Levitt months after the project began.
``It was a sensitive story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rewritten,'' Donovan added, ``but the heart of the
story did not really change.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the story involved the police behavior toward
Thomas and Michael Skakel, two teen-age neighbors of Ms. Moxley's.
The story detailed the failure of the police to search the Skakel
house, though the golf club used in the murder matched other clubs
found in a bag in the Skakel home.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Skakel, now 39, was arrested in connection with Ms.
Moxley's death this month, men with bigger names _ like the former
detective Mark Fuhrman _ were widely interviewed. But none of them
had gnawed at the case as relentlessly as Levitt. Nobody gnaws at
police commissioners like him either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go through brick walls,'' said Don Forst, a former
Newsday editor who is now editor of The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, a former deputy police commissioner for public
information, said: ``Whatever he covered, he immediately alienated
the mainstream sources, the leadership, and thus ingratiated
himself with the disenfranchised and the unhappy. They are much
better sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt says straightforwardly, ``I'm a great reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   His detractors agree he is relentless, but say he lacks
proportion. Marilyn Mode, Miller's successor, said, ``He is a very
petty little man.'' Referring to a recent item in Levitt's Newsday
column, she added, ``For the record, my dog has not bitten
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Lennie Levitt has.

   First `Cosmopolitan Girl' Reveals a Secret
</P>
<P>
   Helen Gurley Brown, the 76-year-old former editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan magazine, has come clean in her new memoir, ``I'm Wild
Again: Snippets from My Life and a Few Brazen Thoughts'' (St.
Martin's Press). In a chapter titled ``The Year of Being Kept (But
Not Very Well),'' she reveals for the first time that she had a
financial arrangement when she was 24 with an older, married man
who, in exchange for rent and a nominal secretarial job, had a
sexual relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   According to her book, the unnamed paramour _ a movie studio
executive _ limped, was totally bald and old (he was 43).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she decided to write about the arrangement
because her readers think of her as a confidante and this was a
piece of her life she had not yet disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any shame about it, really,'' Ms. Brown said in
an interview. ``It was the right thing at the time. I was trying to
get enough money together to send to my mother and my sister, who
had polio. This was just something I never wrote about before. I
was just doing the best I could do for 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown wrote that she was never ``guilt crazy'' about the
arrangement, rather she was ``using this golden opportunity to
stash enough money to take care of Mother and Mary and me the rest
of our lives.'' She described the situation as ``freedom from
hunger and want, bye-bye pinchies and scrimpies, farewell fiscal
fright.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said that although she would not even characterize the
relationship as an affair (``an affair is sexier,'' she wrote), the
man was not utterly revolting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, he wasn't that awful,'' Ms. Brown said. ``He wasn't a
gargoyle. And believe me, I have never, ever in my grown-up life
believed that you only go to bed with men that you are in love
with.''

   Show Business Dailies Brawl at Sundance
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The competition between Daily Variety and The
Hollywood Reporter moved last week to the slopes of Park City,
Utah, site of the Sundance festival.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter, which is owned by the
Billboard Publications unit of VNU, published an article about the
arrest of Daily Variety's national columnist, Dan Cox, at a party
at Park City's Snow Park Lodge. According to the newspaper, about
1,000 people showed up at the party on Tuesday night, given by the
Creative Artists Agency. But only 300 were invited.
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived to turn people away, turmoil ensued. Cox
was the only one arrested. He was booked for disorderly conduct and
released on bail a short time later, The Hollywood Reporter said.
``The crowd control at Sundance is ridiculous,'' Cox was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Then came tit for tat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Friday, Daily Variety, which is owned by the
Cahners division of Reed Elsevier, reported that The Hollywood
Reporter's chief film critic, Kirk Honeycutt, and the actress
Courtney Love ``squared off'' Wednesday night at the Lakota
restaurant in Park City, at the height of the film festival's
activities. The newspaper reported that Honeycutt's wife, Mira,
tried to take a picture of Ms. Love, who apparently lost her temper
and threw the camera on the ground. Honeycutt ``butted in and,
insiders say, clenched his fist in preparation to hit the
actress,'' Variety said. Later, Honeycutt and Ms. Love made up.
</P>
<P>
   The Variety article was written by two reporters. One was
Charles Lyons. The other was Dan Cox. Cox did not respond to a
phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Honeycutt said the Variety account was ``mostly fiction'' and
that he had not threatened to punch Ms. Love. ``It's a reflection
of the editorial integrity of Daily Variety that they permitted a
reporter, Dan Cox, who clearly had an ax to grind, to report and
write that story,'' he said.

INCREASING THE PRIVACY OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft would not be proud to admit it, but the software
behemoth has done more to spur the growth of the e-mail security
industry in the past two years than perhaps any other company.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen blanched at the notion that Bill Gates, of all
people, could be forced to answer questions in court about e-mail
messages that he had sent years before _ supposedly in confidence.
Meanwhile, consumers took note last summer when hackers broke into
Microsoft's Hotmail site and made public some highly embarrassing
personal correspondence by its users.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft was not the first to encounter e-mail
security issues, but its experiences pointed out the extreme
vulnerability of this type of communication. The common analogy
among industry executives and analysts is that e-mail is as secure
as a postcard, but even that may be giving e-mail too much credit.
</P>
<P>
   When a message is sent, it can make a dozen or more stops along
the Internet as it travels to the recipient's desktop. At each of
those stops, it is typically copied, with the duplicate message
stored on a server _ the technological engine that runs any
Internet operation.
</P>
<P>
   Once a duplicate e-mail message is stored, it is subject to
security breaches or mishandling by the employees of the company or
organization that operates the server. Furthermore, the courts can
force Internet service providers to retrieve messages if they are
deemed relevant to a case.
</P>
<P>
   More menacing than the courts, many employees have found, are
the system administrators hired by corporations to screen offensive
or sensitive e-mail in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The creativity of hackers and corporate sleuths in their e-mail
surveillance, however, has been matched in recent months by
services meant to make e-mail as private as a confession booth.
``This is becoming a very big category,'' said Steven Robins, an
analyst with the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm. ``As
more and more business goes onto the Internet, people want the same
safeguards as they get in any other medium.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, the number of e-mail messages
sent per day in the United States will grow to 1.5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to see opportunity in this category was
Tumbleweed Communications Inc., which was founded in 1993 and went
public last fall. Tumbleweed's technology allows a user to send
e-mail and inform recipients that they have received a document or
a message that has been encrypted and stored on the sender's server
computer. When a recipient clicks on a link inside the e-mail
message, she is sent to that server site, where the encrypted
document can be viewed on or retrieved from a secure Web page to
which she alone has access.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Datek, which licenses Tumbleweed's service, offers
users the opportunity to receive confirmation of stock trades by
e-mail. Because the correspondence is secure and documented, it
meets requirements set by the Securities and Exchange Commission
for the transmittal of trading information _ and spares Datek and
its customers the expense and hassle of handling paper confirmation
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dunn, a Datek spokesman, declined to say how much the
company has saved in mailing costs. But he said 30 percent of the
firm's confirmations were now handled electronically. ``The cost
savings are significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that license Tumbleweed's service typically pay in the
``mid-six figures'' upfront and between 3 cents and 50 cents per
e-mail message sent, according to Mark Pastore, Tumbleweed's vice
president of corporate development.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbleweed ``is the leader right now,'' according to Alan
Weintraub, research director of the Gartner Group, a consulting
firm. ``But they won't be alone for long. There's a lot of activity
in this space.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that activity focuses on other ways to secure and
control e-mail. For instance, the e-mail security company QVtech
has developed Interosa, a service whose technology enables a user
to send an e-mail message and control several aspects of how it is
used, including to whom it can be forwarded and whether or not it
can be printed, edited or copied. Notably, the message can be
erased from the Interosa server after a certain date _ the digital
equivalent of paper shredding.
</P>
<P>
   After a user types the e-mail message, he sets the rules for how
it can be used. The message is then encrypted before it is sent.
When the recipient clicks on the e-mail message to open it, a
message travels from the user's desktop to a Web site using
Interosa's technology, which then verifies the recipient's identity
and decrypts the message.
</P>
<P>
   According to a company spokesman, QVtech is trying to sell
Interosa to companies like Mail.com and MessageMedia, which handle
e-mail direct marketing on behalf of Yahoo and ETrade, among others
_ companies that want to be able to track whether and how their
mailings are handled by the intended recipients.
</P>
<P>
   QVtech has not completed agreements with such firms, the
spokesman said, but the company intends to charge about a penny for
each e-mail message sent using its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Authentica, which sells document security software, said it will
release an e-mail security product in April that would compete with
Interosa and others. Lance Urbas, Authentica's chief executive,
said the service could be particularly valuable for companies that
want to send valuable or sensitive documents via e-mail without
worrying that customers might forward them to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a consulting firm that issued a report on a Friday,
and by midday Monday, the author of the report had gotten a dozen
calls about statements in the report from people who hadn't
purchased it,'' Urbas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports like that cost a lot,'' he added. ``That's the kind of
thing we'll prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are not the only target of so-called secure e-mail
companies, of course. According to Jon Gilliam, president of
Hush.com, consumers have already begun to migrate toward secure
e-mail services, with nearly 150,000 users having signed up for
Hushmail since May.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with Hotmail, Hushmail requires the user to visit
the site to read and send mail. The difference, Gilliam said, is
that even Hushmail employees cannot open the e-mail messages stored
on its server _ not only because they are encrypted on the server,
but because the key that unscrambles the messages is tied to a pass
phrase that only the user knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know the pass phrase. If someone forgets their
pass phrase, we can't help them,'' Gilliam said. Likewise, he said,
``if we get a subpoena like we did today for e-mail records, we
have to give the courts an encrypted message. There's nothing we
can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam said Hushmail would soon begin offering to license its
service to companies that want to offer it to their customers. He
said that law firms and health care companies might want to use the
service rather than send confidential briefs or medical notes
through regular e-mail. ``There's a huge demand, because a lot of
sites can't afford to send that information via regular e-mail,''
he said. ``It's just too valuable.''

 &HT;    Electronic filing may prove to be a quick, easy solution to
what's taxing you
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Under the best of circumstances, filing income
tax returns is an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the worst circumstances _ you owe lots of money, your tax
situation is complicated, you don't have all the forms and records
you need, etc. _ filing your taxes can be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer technology to file your taxes can cut down on
some of the headaches and can even get you your refund a little
faster than paper filing. But unless your tax situation is among
the simplest, you'll probably pay a bit extra for the convenience
of electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic filing covers five methods of submitting income tax
forms to the government without filling in the traditional paper
income tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The methods are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Professional tax preparation services who specialize in
filling out tax forms for people who can't or don't want to fill
out their forms on their own. These services will file the returns
they complete electronically for a fee. Or you can fill out your
forms yourself and take them to a tax preparation service for
electronic filing, but the fees are quite high. You'll probably pay
two to four times as much to have a tax service file your return
electronically than you would pay an online service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Volunteer tax preparation services. Senior citizen service
providers and some social service agencies provide tax assistance
to certain groups, typically the elderly and the poor. The services
are usually free or carry only a nominal fee. Not every community
has volunteer tax preparers, and not all services are the same. So
you may have to call a couple senior citizen centers and other
agencies to see what might be available close to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Telefile, a free service provided by the Internal Revenue
Service that lets unmarried taxpayers of moderate income file using
a touch-tone phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home-based electronic filing using software programs. You buy
a software program, enter tax information to complete a return,
then pay the software provider to transmit your return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online tax preparation services. You skip the step of buying
software and log on to a tax preparation site on the Internet. You
pay to complete your return using the online system, and you may
pay a separate fee to have the service provider forward your return
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Carolee Pfefferman, acting public affairs officer for the
Internal Revenue Service office in Cincinnati, said the government
expects the number of people filing electronically to increase
every year as taxpayers become more comfortable and proficient with
electronic filing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pfefferman said the IRS expects 23.7 million taxpayers to file
electronically through professional tax services, up from 21.2
million who used the option last year. The number using Telefile is
expected to rise from 5.7 million last year to 5.9 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The largest percentage increase, however, is expected in online
filings. About 2.4 million taxpayers filed federal returns online
using software or Web-based tax services. The IRS expects 4 million
such filings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pfefferman said the government welcomes electronic filing and is
encouraging the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you file electronically, the chance for human error is
greatly reduced,'' she said. ``There's less chance for math errors
on the part of the filers, and less chance of error on the part of
IRS employees copying information from tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax returns are processed faster with fewer errors, and
refunds go out more quickly. Everybody benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   TAX SOFTWARE FOR 2000
</P>
<P>
   If you bought an income tax preparation software product for
your tax return last year, you won't be able to use it again for
this year's return.
</P>
<P>
   An article in this section last year erroneously implied that
income tax programs could be updated from year to year. Tax
programs can be updated when tax laws for the year they cover
change, but they aren't updated to cover subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax laws and tax tables change too much from year to year
to keep using the same programs,'' said Colleen Ferrin,
spokesperson for Intuit Inc., the leading producer of tax software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has entered the tax preparation software arena this
year with TaxSaver Federal and TaxSaver Federal Deluxe.
</P>
<P>
   Local software retailers are displaying the new Microsoft
programs alongside Quicken TurboTax and Quicken TurboTax Deluxe
from Intuit Inc. and Kiplinger TaxCut and Kiplinger TaxCut Deluxe
from Block Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information on the packages and the company Web sites,
the software programs are fairly similar.
</P>
<P>
   The basic tax programs lead users through the tax preparation
process by asking questions. The taxpayer uses the computer
keyboard to enter figures, names and addresses, and uses the mouse
to pick answers from multiple choice lists.
</P>
<P>
   When the questions are answered, the programs calculate the
taxes and produce a return for the taxpayer to check.
</P>
<P>
   After verifying the accuracy of the return, the taxpayer can
either print out a return and mail it or link to the company's Web
site to electronically file the return.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe versions of the three companies software work about
the same but they include onscreen videos of tax experts and other
extra features.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the costs of the programs can be complicated. Most of
the basic programs have a list price of around $20, and the deluxe
packages sell for $30 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all the packages offer significant rebates, and you
can get several of the tax preparation products for free if you buy
other financial management products from the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Also you have to calculate the costs of electronic filing and
the costs of state forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the programs include rebates for the fee for filing your
first electronic return. After that software companies typically
charge around $10 per return.
</P>
<P>
   None of the basic tax preparation packages include programs to
file your Ohio income taxes, so you'll have to buy a separate
program for your state taxes. But you may get a state program free
if you buy one of the deluxe packages.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE SERVICES FOR TAX RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   If you are comfortable working with businesses online, you might
want to consider using a Web-based tax service instead of buying a
software package.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies offering online services has increased
from last year, they are more experienced so their services should
be more reliable and easy to use, and competition is holding the
price of services down.
</P>
<P>
   Typically the fee for filling out and filing a federal income
tax return online runs about $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Online services work much like the tax preparation software
programs you buy for your home computer. In fact, the leading
software producers run Web sites using essentially the same
programs they sell to home users.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have a slow Internet connection, the process of
filling out tax forms online can be especially tedious.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not possible to link directly to IRS computers to
file your taxes online. For security reasons, the IRS requires
taxpayers to work through intermediary companies or agencies, and
generally the companies demand payment for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS responds to online filings with a confirmation notice
within 48 hours. If you sign up to have your refund deposited
directly to your bank account, you can have a refund in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To complete an online filing, you'll have to send the IRS a
signed Form 8453-OL along with your W2 forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you filed online last year, you might receive a special
electronic code number from the IRS this year. The code numbers are
being distributed to 11 million taxpayers as part of a pilot
project, and if you receive one you'll be able to use it to sign
your return electronically and skip mailing Form 8453-OL.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start getting information about your

 &HT;    Two former friends lead Bush, McCain forces
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ They've been friends and foes and, at one
time, almost business partners. Now, in a subplot to the
presidential race, longtime Texas political strategists Karl Rove
and John Weaver are going head to head for the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is the chief strategist behind George W. Bush's political
rise to Republican front-runner for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, once a bright young star of Texas GOP politics, is
political director _ No. 2 man in the strategy department _ for
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican with the best chance of
derailing Bush's (and Rove's) White House dream.
</P>
<P>
   It all could come to a head Tuesday when New Hampshire
Republicans vote. Polls show McCain leading, but a Bush win could
deal a near-fatal blow to McCain's campaign. With it would fall
Weaver's last chance to finally score a big win over former friend
and colleague Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they were the best of friends, working side by side in
Texas' then-emerging Republican Party. Their paths diverged in the
late 1980s _ after a professional and personal falling-out that
neither will talk much about _ leading them to opposite sides of
the country's ultimate Republican contest.
</P>
<P>
   For Rove, 48, the presidential campaign is the logical
progression of a career in which he has helped turn Texas
Republican and glued himself to a political star. For Weaver, 40,
the White House race is a last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last campaign,'' said Weaver, whose wife and
6-year-old daughter are moving to Laconia, N.H., in June. ``I've
been away too much. I've not been a good husband or a good father
by being too involved in campaigns and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver doesn't know what's next, ``but it's not going to be
politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ON A SIMILAR COURSE
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver have walked similar political paths to this
final confrontation. Rove is the most important Texas Republican
whose name has never been on a ballot. He has helped craft the
message and campaigns of most of the GOP candidates who paved the
way for the party's takeover of statewide offices. In 1978, with
Rove on board, Bill Clements won the gubernatorial race and became
the first Republican to hold a statewide executive office since
Reconstruction. In 1998, with Rove's involvement, the GOP completed
its sweep of all 27 statewide posts, which range from governor to
all nine Texas Supreme Court seats.
</P>
<P>
   His success helped force Weaver to look outside Texas for
clients. Weaver built a successful career by signing on with
candidates across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver both came up through the college ranks. Rove got
involved with the College Republicans in 1973. Weaver became active
in politics as a Texas A&AMP;M student in 1978 when Aggie economics
professor Phil Gramm successfully ran for the U.S. House. He helped
Gramm become a U.S. senator in 1984. In 1996, Weaver was field
director for Gramm's ill-fated presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Rove have worked together for many GOP candidates,
including the elder George Bush's successful 1988 White House race
and several contests involving Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a native of Kermit in West Texas, and Rove, a Colorado
native, wound up on opposite sides for the first time in 1986.
Weaver worked in then-U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler's bid for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination. Rove worked for ex-Gov. Clements, who
surprised everyone by deciding he wanted back the job he lost in
1982 to Democrat Mark White. After Clements won the nomination,
Rove brought Weaver on board for the general election campaign,
which ended with Clements exacting his revenge on White.
</P>
<P>
   With Clements' approval, Weaver became executive director of the
Republican Party of Texas in 1987. Though some GOP operatives
recall some testy moments between Weaver and GOP Chairman Fred
Meyer, the ex-chairman says Weaver did a solid job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Weaver was in charge of day-to-day operations of
then-Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign in Texas.
It was in that role that Rove and Weaver had the falling-out that
doomed their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   People involved said a major flashpoint was a disagreement over
whether to use a Bush campaign fund-raising mailing that included a
letter from then-President Ronald Reagan or one from Clements.
Weaver favored the Reagan letter, and believed Rove favored the
Clements one only because Clements was a client. Over Weaver's
strong objections, the Clements letter was sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started kind of an ongoing argument between them,'' said
a Texas Republican consultant familiar with the chapter in party
history. ``They started out as very good friends, very close
friends. They drifted apart. There was a succession of events in a
short period of time that set them on different courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver were both on hand at a Houston hotel for the
elder Bush's victory celebration in 1988, but it was the last time
they were on the same side. Weaver fell into deep disfavor with
Clements, making it difficult for him to get Texas clients.
Clements declined to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a personal falling-out between the two
consultants, but Rove, Weaver and people close to them won't
discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are touching on some raw nerves between a couple of
people,'' said someone who has known both men for many years.
``It's deep, and it's personal, and it's not all pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's post-election plan to team up in an Austin,
Texas-based political consulting firm dissipated. Weaver wound up
as a competitor to Rove in the direct-mail business, the political
niche that made Rove well-known around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver says he is ``indifferent'' to his history with Rove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it one way or the other,'' he said. Asked
if he considers Rove a friend, Weaver said methodically: ``I
consider him another person in this profession who is very
talented, very focused, works very hard and has had a tremendous
track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove is uncharacteristically low-key when asked about Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not about Weaver or me. It's about the
candidates. I really have had little or no contact with him for 12
years,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT PATHS
</P>
<P>
   Weaver formed Campaign Services Group in 1988. It was based in
Austin until he moved it to San Antonio in 1993. Rove continued
doing his political magic from an office until last year, when he
sold the company and moved into Bush's downtown Austin campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After 1988, the Rove-Weaver rivalry popped up again in the 1993
special election to replace Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who became treasury
secretary for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver signed on with U.S. Rep. Jack Fields of Humble. Rove,
adding to his run of winners, worked with then-state Treasurer Kay
Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Rove continued working for winners in Texas. Weaver worked for
congressional candidates across the country, including Sens. Fred
Thompson of Tennessee and Jeff Sessions of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Weaver took a leave from his firm to work for Gramm's
presidential campaign. He returned to his firm in San Antonio after
that. A year later, he began trying to talk McCain, whom he had met
on several campaigns, into running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laughed me off, thought I had lost my mind, which maybe I
have,'' Weaver said. ``But I stayed all over him like a wet shirt
about running. The country badly needs him.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver sees nothing traitorous in trying to derail Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with being a loyal Texan,'' Weaver said.
``It has everything to do with who you think would make a better
president. I have great respect for George. But I think John McCain
would make a great president on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Austinite John Colyandro, who has worked with Weaver and Rove,
said Weaver has ``a grudging respect for Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitors or not, you can't look at his success and not
acknowledge that Karl has done extraordinarily well,'' Colyandro
said. ``The competition, quite candidly, has been one-sided. Karl
has prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver denies that he is driven by the possibility of derailing
Rove's biggest campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about John McCain and the country and the fact that
this country needs someone to change the political system and lead
the nation into the next century,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove sees no revenge factor either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what's motivating him,'' Rove said of Weaver.
``What's motivating him is the chance to play in the big leagues.
Being involved in a presidential race is a unique opportunity, and
he has had it twice.''

CRAMMING IT TOGETHER AS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rush Limbaugh, the radio philosopher, was appalled. Thousands of
his listeners were sending in messages protesting the increased
number of commercials on his program. Because he was talking the
same amount of time every day, and the show ran the same three
hours, how could this be?
</P>
<P>
   Then a surreptitious form of editing was revealed to him. ``A
new kind of digital technology,'' wrote Alex Kuczynski in The New
York Times, ``was literally snipping out the silent pockets between
words, shortening the pauses and generally speeding up the pace of
Limbaugh's speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The irate commentator stormed, ``I think it is potential doom
for the radio industry.'' Since then, he tells me: ``I have amended
that. They will reduce the pauses judiciously, no more than a
minute and a half per hour. I want to see if the nuances are
affected _ after all, a pause can be pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago I did something similar to Humphrey Bogart. He had a
habit, as do many of us, of punctuating his ad-lib phrases with
``uh.'' (This has since been replaced with ``I mean'' and
``y'know,'' which serve the same function of demonstrating a
presence while not saying anything.)
</P>
<P>
   When Bogie had a couple of drinks, the uh's came thick and fast.
In the '50s, after taping an interview with him for the Armed
Forces Network, I did him a favor and laboriously snipped all those
stammering self-interruptions out of the tape. When our talk was
broadcast, he was surprised at how articulate he sounded.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, I would do the same today as a courtesy to
interviewee and listener. I'll even clean up a grammatical error
when taking notes for a written interview, thereby preserving a
source and avoiding ((sic-sic-sic)) wiseguyism. But secret snipping
for commercial gain is another kettle of fishiness. Not only is it
sneaky, but the silent squeeze also weakens discourse by removing
dramatic pauses.
</P>
<P>
   A related danger is not a result of nefarious squeezing by
money-grubbing timesavers, but of the hurried laziness of speakers.
Let's not be stiffs about this: In pronunciation, the English
language has always tended toward contraction. Old-timers cannot
recall ever having heard  &UR; business &LR; ,  &UR; colonel &LR;  or  &UR; Wednesday &LR; 
pronounced with three syllables.  &UR; Chocolate &LR; , which geezers recall
as CHOCK-a-lit, has become CHAW-klit; its central syllable melted
away in our mouths.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1949 article in The New Yorker (now The Nyawka), John
Davenport commented on ``Slurvian,'' the language of what linguists
call syncope (SING-kuh-pee). In this laid-back lingo, syrup becomes
 &UR; surp &LR; , Americans  &UR; Merkins &LR; , and ``no, Ma'am''  &UR; gnome &LR; . His  &UR; forn &LR; ,
for ``foreign,'' was picked up by the CIA, and now ``no foreign
distribution'' is stamped NOFORN.
</P>
<P>
   In our time, such speeding up must not go unremarked. In today's
compulsive compression, other majestic and sonorous words are
losing their central syllables. In ``The Big Book of Beastly
Mispronunciations'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999, $15), Charles
Harrington Elster argues that ``syncopated pronunciations tend to
improve the fluidity of speech'' and cites VEJ-tuh-bul for
 &UR; vegetable &LR; , FAM-lee for  &UR; family &LR;  and DY-pur for  &UR; diaper &LR; . (Only
babies say ``change my DI-a-per.'')
</P>
<P>
   This has not taken place in a vacuum. (That word was once
pronounced VAK-u-um, but our natures abhorred it, and it's now
VAK-yoom.) However, Elster still cites as objectionable to
cultivated speakers such squeezings as AK-rit for  &UR; accurate &LR; ,
YOO-zhul for  &UR; usual &LR; , claps for  &UR; collapse &LR;  and VUR-bij for
 &UR; verbiage &LR; . (I would add an ASS-ter-ik.) He takes a pop at me for
countenancing an  &UR; r &LR; -less TEM-puh-chur, and he's right: From now
on, I'll take my ``TEM-pra-chur.''
</P>
<P>
   In this political season, two locutions have come under the
sustained pressure of the squeezers. One is  &UR; President &LR; , the
three-syllabled office much coveted by campaigning candidates. I
never minded Lyndon Johnson's Southern pronunciation of the last
syllable in his warm ``I am yo'  &UR; Presidint &LR; ''; that is a legitimate
dialect variation. However, the near-universal adoption of
 &UR; Prezdent &LR;  seems to me to diminish the office.
</P>
<P>
   A special target for the squirrels of squeeze has been  &UR; Social
Security &LR; . This generation, promised six full syllables with no
cutbacks, was willing to accept ``Soshasecurity.'' But what of the
candidates who promise the salvation of ``Sosh-security'' or
preserving untouched the indexed benefits of ``Sosa-CURE-ity''?
Dwayna M. Wisdom of Union City, N.J., notes other variations from
``SoSecurity'' to ``Soshacurity.''
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone pledge expanded benefits to a contracted program?
Cock a wary ear to the way the candidates squeeze this revered
phrase in coming debates. Then cast your vote for  &UR; Prezdent &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   DON'T PRESUME
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one of his fellow candidates if he would commit to
choose a pro-life running mate, George W. Bush replied, ``I think
it's incredibly  &UR; presumptive &LR;  for someone who has yet to earn his
party's nomination to be picking vice presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable commentator Laura Ingraham promptly picked up the
error, pointing out that the word Bush had in mind was
 &UR; presumptuous &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It's a fairly common error, with both words based on the verb
 &UR; presume &LR; , from the Latin  &UR; praesumere &LR; , ``to take in advance.''
That would now be put as ``to take for granted,'' as in ``Dr.
Livingstone, I presume.'' (If less certain, the newsman Henry
Stanley would have used  &UR; assume &LR; , ``to suppose.'' How did I get in
darkest Africa?)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Presumptive &LR;  means ``probable,'' based on a reasonable
assumption, as in ``Bush and Gore have been, for a year, the
 &UR; presumptive &LR;  standard-bearers.'' The meaning of  &UR; presumptuous &LR; 
departs sharply from that, to ``arrogant, assuming the
unwarranted'' _ the presuming in that formulation to be
unreasonable, not to mention uppity and pushy.
</P>
<P>
   Few suffixes split the meaning so drastically from the root
word. A subtler difference was examined some years ago, when a
State Department spokesman denounced as  &UR; contemptible &LR;  an article
of mine sneering at some feckless action of the then-secretary. An
alert reporter followed up with ``Don't you mean  &UR; contemptuous &LR; ?''
To which the quick-thinking diplomat replied, ``That, too.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CONVERGENCE RAISES QUESTIONS OF ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The huge potential power of the proposed AOL Time Warner has
applied electroshock to the cortex of the convergence industries:
information, entertainment and communication. One of the biggest
jolts is being felt in the growing market for high-speed, or
broadband, Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the world's largest Internet service provider with the
world's largest news, entertainment and cable television megalith
has set off increasingly urgent discussions about the future of
broadband and how best to ensure that no single company abuses its
control of the Internet's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for urgency are twofold. First is the issue of how
to open privately owned broadband Internet access to all comers. In
addition, the free-speech issue arises when any single entity, of
any size, controls both a transmission medium and the information
that flows over it.
</P>
<P>
   Open access is a particular concern. Premerger America Online
was in the midst of strident lobbying to shame AT&AMP;T Corp., which
had recently acquired the cable giant Tele-Communications, into
opening its cable network to America Online's (or anyone's)
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent for this demand _ known euphemistically as open
access _ is actually common-carriage law, which for decades has
compelled telephone companies to interconnect their systems and
serve all customers, including competitors, without discriminating
on price or on who can buy access.
</P>
<P>
   Despite America Online's assurances of continued support for
open access, industry executives and public interest watchdogs fear
that once it actually owns Time Warner's high-speed cable network,
that view may ``evolve,'' as one person close to the deal put it.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of AT&AMP;T and America Online as broadband superpowers
controlling enormous closed networks has convinced a growing number
of observers that without some kind of government dictum declaring
``you will interconnect,'' the battle for broadband market share is
certain to devolve into an internecine contest that wastes
trillions of dollars and frightens away customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these issues were being addressed even as the merger was
announced. In October, IEEE-USA, a trade organization for
engineers, co-sponsored a symposium at Cornell University
(www.Johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/mcadams/) at which participants
drew scenarios of a broadband future.
</P>
<P>
   But two participants realized that none were accounting for the
inevitable public policy issues ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every scenario is a nightmare scenario,'' says Richard J.
Solomon, a technology policy expert who is now a senior scientist
at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Communications and
Information Science and Policy. ``We'll end up with a monopoly and
nothing good from a technology perspective. Or there'll be a
stalemate where everyone will sue each other to block everything
from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Or he cites another scenario in which billions, maybe trillions,
will be spent on marketing competing standards, so that building a
network ``will take 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and Michael E. Bloom, a veteran telecommunications
engineer, consultant and industry analyst based in San Ramon,
Calif., were asked to write a paper for IEEE-USA on these issues.
They concluded that some variation of common carriage was the only
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that common carriage encourages the network to be
everywhere and fully interconnected, they argue, would provide
stability and thus significantly speed the development of the
broadband market. It would also free owners of content and conduit
from legal liability for carrying the content of others on their
wires.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of too much government oversight and control, Solomon
and Bloom say, can be mitigated by getting everyone to the table to
create a cooperative, open system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since government is going to be involved one way or another,
like it or not, we're proposing that the industry sit down with
government now, sit down with public-policy makers now, get
everyone in the same room and work out a set of investment and
public policy scenarios to invest in a broadband network,'' Solomon
says. ``Everyone loves to talk about their pet operating system or
protocol. But five years arguing is five years lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he adds, the broadband standards embraced today by
cable and phone companies are outmoded already.
</P>
<P>
   The pair even proposes that this group agree to create some kind
of entity _ ``governmental, quasi-governmental, a private
corporation with a set of rules'' _ that would own or manage this
network, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Johnson, a former member of the FCC who teaches law at
the University of Iowa, said the precedent for such an arrangement
was ``the Internet itself, before it was sold off by the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government built it, made it available,'' Johnson said.
``You could move over whatever you wanted to move. There was no
content control. It was fully distributed, a flat organization in
terms of control, and the thing just ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says a government-operated network would ``keep us two,
three, 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, because it would
give us the infrastructure we'd really need, and avoid an
incredible amount of wasted time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every expert agrees with the need for so radical a solution.
For example, Glenn Manishin, a lawyer with Patton Boggs LLP in
Washington, argues, ``If we regulate too soon, then we run a risk
of deflecting investment.'' Manishin, whose firm represents America
Online, has been immersed in telecommunications law since serving
as an antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department during the
breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But he agrees that there is a role for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some kind of requirement that these providers
establish a basis upon which interoperability can occur,'' he says.
``Like the telephone network, like the public Internet, which arose
because of open standards, we'd have an open, broadband,
interoperable network of networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson asserts that the ability for anyone to move content
throughout such a network is essential to free speech. Yet,
powerful corporations like AT&AMP;T and the proposed AOL Time Warner
would have the power to balkanize the broadband Internet for their
own purposes, with no legal reason to open their networks to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And as Johnson points out, ``If you can't get on the network,
you've been locked out of the market.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If America Online completes its acquisition of Time Warner, a
one-year clock will immediately start ticking.
</P>
<P>
   America Online promised investors that in the first year as a
combined company, it would add an extra $1 billion in pretax
operating profits beyond the $10 billion total the companies would
have earned separately.
</P>
<P>
   It is a goal that will be tough to meet, since the two companies
have few overlapping operations, and the high-speed multimedia
Internet services they have promised are years away from becoming
commonplace. So where can they find an extra $1 billion so fast?
</P>
<P>
   The answer pops up, literally, virtually every time someone
signs onto America Online: in-your-face advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the first thing an America Online subscriber sees after
logging on _ before checking e-mail, before slinking off to a chat
room _ is an advertisement. And the ``No Thank You'' button that
gets rid of the ad is much tinier than the ``Buy Now'' and ``Tell
Me More'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing advertising techniques to Time Warner's Web sites,
America Online promises that it can find much of that first $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the public credit for America Online's success has
gone to its ability to develop and market a service that appeals to
the masses, it has also done a better job than any other Internet
company in finding ways to cash in on that audience.
</P>
<P>
   From the first pop-up ad to tiny text links on obscure pages,
America Online has found more ways to sell more pieces of its
service than any other online company. And its ad sales force, now
more than 400 strong, is widely considered the toughest, most
aggressive team of deal makers in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those methods can or would be applied across Time Warner
sites like CNN.com and Time.com _ where journalistic convention
would dictate a church-state separation of content and advertising
_ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online has long argued that the complete separation
of editorial content and advertising is not applicable online. New
media, they argue, call for integration of commerce and content _
sales of kitchen supplies, for example, woven into recipe sections.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, America Online executives are eager to grab Time
Warner's Internet sites _ which also include entertainment sites
for Warner Bros. and Warner Music _ and stoke them with the sales
strategies it has used so successfully with its other brands,
including CompuServe, Netscape and the ICQ chat service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Time Warner sold $100 million in online
advertising,'' said Michael Kelly, America Online's chief financial
officer. ``We did more than that in our first 90 days of selling
ICQ.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online reported $352 million in revenue from advertising
and electronic commerce in the last three months of 1999, up 88
percent from a year earlier. By contrast, Yahoo, the distant No. 2
in online ads, posted total revenue of $201 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, of course, also benefits from its monthly
subscription fees, which brought in $1.1 billion in the most recent
quarter. Moreover, America Online says it now has a backlog of $2.4
billion worth of advertising contracts scheduled to run over the
next several years.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers, the merger of America Online and Time Warner
would be a mixed blessing. Many of them write big checks to America
Online because of its huge audience and its creativity in placing
ads. But the online giant has also built up a reputation as one of
the hardest companies on the Internet to deal with. And client
companies often accuse it of being aggressive, even arrogant, in
its deal making.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, America Online sold Barnes &AMP; Noble the
right to be the exclusive bookstore on its flagship service,
America Online. Then it sold Amazon.com the exclusive right to sell
books on AOL.com, the Web site that America Online members pass
through on their way to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although America Online says it now tries to sell all of its
properties in a single package, stories like that still abound _
mostly told by people who insist that their names not be used,
because they are still beholden to the online giant for much of
their own sites' traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is the 800-pound gorilla _ they know that, and they act
like it,'' said the chief executive of a company that bought an
``anchor tenant'' position on America Online's shopping mall for
this past holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of another rapidly growing online merchant
said America Online had tried to modify an advertising agreement
just a few months after signing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back to us and said they were going to tear up the
deal and start over,'' the executive said. ``Our category was
hotter than they had thought, and they wanted more money.'' The
executive said that when he pointed out there was a signed
contract, America Online executives had responded, ``So sue us.''
</P>
<P>
   Myer Berlow, the president of America Online's interactive
marketing unit, insists that the company is neither arrogant nor
duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be 800 pounds, but I hope we're guerrillas with an `e'
_ not gorillas,'' he said. ``I don't want an attitude in our group
that we don't have to try harder, because we're No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the online retailer who said America Online reneged on
the newly signed contract, Berlow said he did not know the
specifics. But he speculated that a portion of America Online's
service had been redesigned before a contract based on the old
design had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might go back to a partner that had a 12-month deal and say
we want to cut it off or renew it,'' he said. ``But we would give
credit for whatever they had left. In no case did we not honor our
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlow said America Online's preferred role was not that of a
seller of simple banner advertisements _ although it sells a lot of
them _ but that of proprietor of an online mall. Indeed, the
company pioneered the now widely copied business model in which it
charges online merchants an up-front ``rent'' for placement on its
service and also takes a percentage of each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For many merchants, this model has proved quite lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating a deal was difficult and expensive, and there were
several changes of strategy on the fly,'' said Tim Harrington, the
chief executive of FogDog Sports, another anchor tenant in the
shopping channel. ``But once you have a deal done, they are great
partners to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, America Online's staff helped FogDog find new
customers with a promotion offering certain items for $1 _ a pitch
that was displayed on the service's welcome screen. By contrast, he
said FogDog had tepid results advertising on Time Warner's
cnnsi.com sports site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have people who want to check the scores for the Golden
State Warriors, not buy Air Jordans,'' he said of the Time Warner
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many advertisers say that while their dealings with Time
Warner's various sites have not been as contentious as those with
America Online, they have not been as effective, either.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's ad sales efforts, like the rest of its Internet
operations, have been spread through its sprawling and
decentralized empire. The most troubled has been the Time Inc.
magazine group, which has been as unsuccessful in selling online
advertising as the group's defunct Pathfinder site was in
attracting an audience.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Turner television unit has been more effective,
advertisers say, in part because the CNN.com Web site has attracted
a steady audience. Moreover, the Turner unit has found ways to get
its television sales force to sell Internet ads at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge, however, may arise over Time Warner's
longstanding tradition of maintaining strict separation between its
advertising and editorial departments.
</P>
<P>
   One former Time Warner executive predicted: ``There is going to
be a major clash over the church-and-state issue. At AOL, the look
and feel of the product is controlled by the people selling
advertising. At Time Warner, it's driven by the editors, who are
thinking of the end user.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sacks, a former newspaper reporter and magazine
publisher who is general manager of the America Online flagship
service, says his staff can and does rebuff undue influence from
the advertising sales department, but says the issues are different
from those in traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks said that America Online's staff of several dozen editors,
who choose articles for its news and finance sections, operates
with the same independence as traditional journalists. But he said
that on America Online, as on a television network, non-news
programming is subject to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bond of trust between a journalistic enterprise and
its audience that is its fundamental value proposition,'' Sacks
said. ``On the AOL service, we make no illusion of a bond of trust,
except in those areas where there is pure journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Time Warner has experimented with the Internet, it
too has used some aggressive advertising vehicles, not all of which
conform to its magazines' practices. A travel agent, for example,
paid for a link to its reservation services from the travel news
page of its CNNfn.com site.
</P>
<P>
   And the Time.com and Fortune.com sites use pop-up windows, much
like America Online's, to sell subscriptions to the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Bressler, head of Time-Warner's Internet activities,
said the combined company would be true to Time's long heritage of
respecting the distinction between advertising and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we step up the use of Time Warner content on America Online
sites, if it is going to be appealing to America Online users it's
because of the integrity it has,'' he said. ``I expect that will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, people who know both Time Warner and America Online, say
that the inevitable battles over culture that exist in any merger
will likely break out first in the advertising sales area, because
the two firms are so different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner, like many large corporations, has an implied code
of civility,'' said Linda E. McCutcheon, former president of Time
Inc. New Media and currently chief executive of Internet Tradeline.
``At AOL, civility is frowned upon. It's like the bar scene in
`Star Wars': Everyone is a character, and a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   To Robert W. Pittman, America Online's president and one of the
team responsible for finding that $1 billion in new first-year
income, being tough is just part of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure don't give away our space,'' he said. ``But I haven't
found an advertiser who wants to give us extra money either.''

 &HT;    Millions in funds pumps life into Bradley campaign
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democrat Bill Bradley hasn't been getting
much good news lately. First, he disclosed more episodes of an
irregular heartbeat, a non-life threatening condition that
nonetheless raised questions about his health.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was trounced in the Iowa caucuses. Here in New
Hampshire, he has been greeted by a steady stream of polls showing
him trailing Vice President Al Gore, although the gap is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the bad news, however, Bradley produced one bit of
information last week that gave his flagging campaign plenty to
cheer about: Whatever tomorrow's outcome, Bradley will leave the
Granite State with almost $20 million to spend on his insurgent bid
to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign claims the amount is slightly more than what
Gore will have in the bank, meaning that Bradley will have the
resources to take his campaign into the March 7 primaries, and
possibly beyond. The next two rounds of primaries will decide more
than two-thirds of all the delegates that go to the Democratic
nominating convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both financially and organizationally, we are prepared to go
and go hard beyond New Hampshire,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But time will be short. Because of the front-loaded primary
schedule, Bradley will effectively have five weeks to make the case
that he can beat Gore and win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire holds only 1 percent of the delegates sent to the
Democratic convention, but the state's influence over how voters
elsewhere perceive the candidates far outweighs its modest delegate
count.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley competed in Iowa, a state he knew he could not win, to
prove that he could run a credible campaign. He has staked millions
of dollars and more than a year of campaigning in New Hampshire to
prove he is worthy of a win.
</P>
<P>
   A loss here will badly damage his prospects, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two candidate race,'' said Emory political scientist
Merle Black. ``There is a winner and a loser. Making it close in
New Hampshire may give him a little incentive to keep going. But he
really needs a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has succeeded in attracting voters who are disenchanted
with the negative tone of politics in America, Black said, but he
needs to convince traditional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's real problem is that he has to give Democratic
primary voters a reason not to vote for the vice president of the
United States in an administration that is very popular among
Democratic voters,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   After months of shying away from direct contrasts with Gore,
Bradley has now taken the offensive. On Sunday, he raised questions
about Gore's role in a 1996 fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in
California. Gore has denied that he knew it was a fund-raiser, even
though the woman organizing the event was a longtime financial
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is more explanation that is needed ... about his
participation,'' Bradley told voters in Concord, N.H. Bradley
asserted voters would reject a campaign that wasn't forthcoming
about the fund-rasing scandals, which he called ``a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also has sought to raise questions about Gore's
commitment to abortion rights and gun control, a strategy that his
aides say he will continue into the next phase of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health, however, could continue to be an issue for
him. He said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts'' that he would consider using the 25th Amendment to
temporarily transfer power to his vice president if he had to be
anesthetized for atrial fibrillation. Bradley suffers from an
irregular heartbeat and he must be anesthetized for three or four
minutes if an electric shock is required to return his heart
rhythms to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably appropriate,'' Bradley said in response to a
question about invoking the 25th Amendment. ``I would make the call
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Bradley wins New Hampshire and has a financial edge,
he still faces long odds against a well-organized campaign of a
sitting Vice President who enjoys the support of labor unions and
other Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday, several states loom large for Bradley: New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and, of
course, California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strongest base of support is in his home state of
Missouri and the Northeast, where he is well-known both as a former
New Jersey senator and a New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   He is counting on his long-standing ties to the Northeast to
help him in the Northeastern primary states. Bradley has scheduled
his biggest campaign event following the New Hampshire primary in
New York City on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also planning to devote significant time and
resources in California, which has the largest number of Democratic
delegates. Bradley is less well-known than Gore in California and
he has almost no support from the state's Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, however, claims that grass-roots organizing
in the Golden State is going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has always been built around the idea of letting
Democrats across this country have a say,'' said Doug Berman,
Bradley's campaign chairman. ``Iowa and New Hampshire are the
opening part of it _ and an important part of it _ but there is
always a national event. That's what we've been preparing for.''

 &HT;    Georgia flag issue demands a leader to act with courage
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Feb. 13, 1956, a loaf of bread cost 15 cents and
the Loew's Theater in Atlanta welcomed a packed house to see
``Forever Darling,'' starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gold Dome, Gov. Marvin Griffin signed into law a bill
changing the historic 1879 Georgia flag to one that embarrasses as
the world spotlight shines on my hometown again, this time for
Super Bowl 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The strains of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' will float from the
Georgia Dome toward the Capitol, where the flag, with its
Confederate battle emblem, flutters in an icy wind.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what televised panorama will reach which corners of a
shrinking multiracial globe. Who knows how many will say, after
all, this is the home of Braves player John Rocker, whose racial
slurs confirmed that the stereotypical redneck Southerner lives on.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer a matter of whether Georgia will eliminate the
emblem placed on the flag. It is simply a matter of when a leader
will muster the courage and support to do it. For Gov. Roy Barnes,
it soon will be a question of whether to spend some of his ready
political capital on it.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper clips of the highly charged 1956 legislative session
magnify the motivation for the flag change. It was the angry
backlash of a segregationist Legislature rebelling against the 1954
U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating an end to public school
segregation. Winning near-unanimous legislative approval along with
the flag bill was a state resolution declaring the school
desegregation ruling ``null and void.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other bills aimed at strengthening enforcement of state
segregation laws sailed through: One declared that no person could
occupy a vacant seat on a bus next to a female passenger without
her permission; another demanded that any peace officer who refused
to enforce segregation laws would lose his state pension.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular myth, there was no great oratory about
preserving history in the changing of the flag. Rep. Denmark
Groover of Bibb County, Ga., the Democratic floor leader, declared
that replacing ``the meaningless stripes with something that has
deep meaning for all true Southerners'' would somehow hold on to a
bit of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Poring over the old newspapers, I was reminded of the first
press conference I covered as a college journalism intern in 1960 _
one staged by a bunch of die-hard segregationists known as
Georgians Unwilling to Surrender, or GUTS.
</P>
<P>
   I searched the editorial pages in vain for criticism of the flag
change. But the only opinion pieces in either The Atlanta Journal
or the Constitution relating to racial issues the week of the flag
bill complimented Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson
(whom I'd always thought of as a liberal) for calling for the
banishment of the segregation issue from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   At the national and state level, politicians still are calling
the flag matter a nonissue. Barnes, a Democrat who can attribute
his election two years ago to blacks and women, says the flag issue
isn't part of his agenda. But Barnes, who already has outsmarted
his adversaries to the point of making them anxious to join him on
controversial transportation, health care and education reforms, is
storing up plenty of political capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has had to apologize for voting against the Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday when he was a state legislator. And though the
Rev. Jesse Jackson called off his planned Atlanta demonstration,
the governor surely knows the day is near when he will have to
decide whether to risk his political popularity on the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   I hope he makes the right decision. He is determined to elevate
Georgia's outdated governmental and educational institutions to the
level of her economic success. But the flag issue goes to something
far less tangible and more lasting: the soul of a state and its
</P>
<P>
   people.

 &HT;    Psychology, political correctness square off in search for
reason
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _Women who dress to look sexy need to know that they
could trigger an attack by men who are natural-born rapists.
</P>
<P>
   Women who argue that rape is about power reject this notion.
</P>
<P>
   Men who don't want to be considered potential rapists also spurn
this view, which is vended in the current issue of The Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't leave many people to defend the article in the
scientific journal that contains excerpts from a book that will be
released in April by the MIT Press titled ``A Natural History of
Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion'' by Dr. Craig T. Palmer
of the University of Colorado and Dr. Randy Thornhill of the
University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are experts in the science of evolutionary psychology,
not political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   They say current beliefs about rape are based on ``empirically
erroneous, even mythological, ideas about human development,
behavior and psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rape prevention programs need to take the natural evolutionary
drive of males to commit rape into account. Women should be told to
watch how they dress. Men should be told that just because women
are friendly or wear tight blouses does not mean they are asking
for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who just awoke from a 35-year coma might wonder what all
the fuss is about. Before the mid-1960s, rape generally was
considered a sex crime, not a crime motivated by power or violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to pull back from what is politically
correct and do an analysis on it,'' Thornhill was quoted in a New
York Times article.
</P>
<P>
   Thornhill and his co-author report that lectures on their
findings have been picketed and their scientific articles rejected
due to their findings that men have evolved to be promiscuous with
young women likely to bear children. Women have evolved to be to
more selective.
</P>
<P>
   Rape, the scientists propose, evolved as a mating technique for
males who were not as adept or lucky in love as other males.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also note that rape is not unusual in nonhuman
species. They give as examples insects, fish, birds and even
nonhuman primates.
</P>
<P>
   These scientific conclusions find considerable opposition in the
scientific community as well as the general public, according to
the New York Times article.
</P>
<P>
   An unrelated scientific study by Dr. Keith McBurnett of the
University of Chicago reports that mean, violent and disruptive
boys can be identified by analyzing their saliva.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnett's four-year study found that consistently disruptive
boys have low levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their
saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Boys who started fights, used weapons, were cruel or forced
sexual acts were tested. Some boys rated as meanest were tested.
</P>
<P>
   There was a correlation between low levels of cortisol and
disruptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnett said children with persistent conduct disorders may
have a genetic predisposition that causes them to produce hormones
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Women don't want to think that the way they dress or act
encourages their own rape. Men don't want to believe that they are
potential rapists. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between culture
and evolution, or nature and nurture.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping of the complete human genome is not far off. Genetic
and evolutionary influences on the human condition are being
discovered in rapid succession.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the day is not far off when instant saliva tests can
accurately predict the likelihood of all sorts of behavior and
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What we do with that information will be the political
correctness battleground of the 21st century.

&HT;     TEXAS CANDIDATES OFTEN FIND COOL RECEPTION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ If it's a presidential year and if it's the New
Hampshire primary, chances are there is a Texan on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is Texas Gov. George W. Bush seeking the
Republican presidential nomination. In past years it was Lyndon B.
Johnson, a Democrat; John Connally, a Democratic governor who
became a Republican presidential hopeful; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a
Democrat; George Bush, the father of the current candidate;
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm; and the cantankerous Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Not all have found success in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are bright colors,'' said Clark Hubbard, a political
science professor at the University of New Hampshire. ``We like our
colors more muted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be something to the notion that the political style
in Texas doesn't play well up here: the image of Texans and the
self-promotion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardscrabble New Englanders, while brimming with pioneer spirit,
like their politics more low-key than the colorful Texans who have
crossed the countryside here.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a larger-than-life figure, was on the ballot but stayed
out of New Hampshire in 1960, won easily here as a sitting
president in 1964, and was humiliated in 1968 when he won by only a
handful of votes. Johnson announced a short time later he would not
seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Connally spent $10 million and won one delegate in 1980 before
he dropped out of the race. He finished near the bottom in New
Hampshire, crushed by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's poll numbers were so low he dropped out of the
presidential race just days before the New Hampshire primary in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bennett, an independent pollster in New Hampshire, said in
1996 that the bragging by Texans about their prowess at raising
money irritates New England voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connally, literally, put out press releases about all the
money he had, all the copy machines he bought,'' he said. ``That
may impress people in Texas, but it doesn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also criticized Gramm's heavy Southern accent and the
fact that in 1996 he repeatedly referred to his mother in a bid for
folksiness. Gramm's ``talk-funny business about momma'' did not
play well with New England voters, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Yankees, and we are more reserved about things like
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, of course, has sent more patrician candidates to the
Northeast, but they didn't fare very well, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen in 1976 and George Bush, who has roots in the Northeast,
came in 1980, 1988 and 1992. Bentsen lost to Jimmy Carter in the
Democratic primary; Bush fell to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Bush,
claiming Houston as his residence, served as Reagan's vice
president for eight years before winning the presidency himself in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The less than successful record of Texans in New Hampshire
suggests a regional bias, but Hubbard said that isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much regionalism as a clash of political
cultures,'' Hubbard dryly noted, with reference to the bravado of
Connally, Gramm and other presidential casualties from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ager, 40, an engineer from Merrimac, said the Lone Star
State has been well represented in presidential politics here
because ``Texas is a big state. It has a big pool to draw from.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ager said personality, not the state, is what makes or
breaks candidates in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has more charisma than his father or Gramm. When Gramm
said he was an economics professor, you said, `Yeah, you are an
economics professor,''' Ager said of the senator's professorial
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush walks into a room, he has a lot of bearing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hutchenson of Londonderry, though, said she is put off by
the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's money doesn't impress us,'' she said. ``He was born
with a lot of money.''

ACTION SHIFTS TO NEW YORK FROM LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five museums _ the Metropolitan Museum, the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the St.
Louis Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art _ bought
old master paintings at Christie's on Thursday. On Friday, an
anonymous donor bought a rare Rembrandt drawing for the Morgan
Library at Christie's sale of old master drawings. And two U.S.
museums were buyers at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings on
Friday: the National Gallery and an institution that wished to
remain anonymous. At both auction houses museums were willing to
pay record prices for works that would fill gaps in their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's paintings sale brought in $47.4 million, while
Christie's paintings sale totaled $39.2 million. Bidding in the
salesrooms for the most popular works was fiercely competitive,
with dealers from all over the world raising their paddles and
telephone bidders aggressively trying to buy something, no matter
what the price. Experts from both auction houses said there were
more new buyers in these sales than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old masters have been undervalued for a long time,'' said
George Wachter, director of Sotheby's old master paintings
department worldwide. ``If you go to an Impressionist sale,
$400,000 will get you a mediocre Renoir. But at an old masters
sale, buyers can get something A-1 for under $500,000, and that's
something people are finally beginning to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently London was the center of the old master universe.
It was where the most serious scholars lived and where the best
dealers could be found. Europe of course has always been a fertile
field for the finest works of art. The stately homes of titled
families in Britain and on the Continent are still treasure troves.
</P>
<P>
   But now Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan are taking
advantage of a significant increase in Americans buying old masters
and the intricate web of import taxes crippling dealers living in
European Union countries. Many top London dealers are opening
spaces in New York in order to capitalize on its flourishing
market. Some experts wonder whether New York will eclipse London in
a few years as the center of the old master market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans have shot themselves in the foot with the
complex taxes,'' said Johnny van Haeften, one of London's leading
old master dealers. For example, he said, collectors and dealers
who live in a country like Switzerland, which is not part of the
European Union, would rather sell a work of art in New York, which
has no import tax, than send it to London, where they would incur a
5 percent import tax levied on works of art brought into European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   Van Haeften added that the improved quality of the auctions in
New York had more to do with Sotheby's and Christie's recent
expansions in the city than with tastes and taxes. He pointed out
that it was only natural that the two auction houses would make the
old master market in New York as profitable as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Kennedy, who ran the old master paintings department at
Christie's in Manhattan for 16 years and is now president of
Dickinson Roundell, an East Side gallery, said that the strength of
the New York market had more to do with marketing than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auction houses are trying to cultivate more buyers by
making their sales good,'' he said. ``The Impressionist market has
become so much stronger in New York than London because the best
things are sold here, and it seems Sotheby's and Christie's are
trying to do the same for old masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in an effort to make the sales more successful,
the auction houses moved the date of their January sales later in
the month, in part to take advantage of Wall Street collectors with
year-end bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while experts for the two auction houses are promoting
New York's improved status, they gamely defend London's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is definitely flourishing, but that doesn't mean
London isn't,'' said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's
old master paintings department in New York. ``More things are
coming here for sale because the perception is that New York is a
richer market. But good things are still being sold in London,
especially in the July sales.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years the New York auctions have sold works by
artists like Rubens, Rembrandt, El Greco, Guardi and Velazquez at
record prices, which encourages sellers to keep consigning works
there. Young Wall Street traders are now putting their money into
old masters rather than the contemporary art they favored during
the '80s boom years. Experts ascribe the shift partly to changing
tastes and partly to fear. For some collectors who remember how the
contemporary art market took a nose dive in the early '90s, old
masters seem like a sounder investment. Even seasoned collectors
who were once loyal buyers of Impressionist and modern art are
beginning to get their feet wet buying the occasional Sweerts or
Canaletto, auction house experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a massive amount of money in this country,''
Crichton-Stuart said. ``But it's not just collectors who are buying
old masters. American museums with large acquisitions budgets are
active buyers both here and abroad. And that's something that
doesn't happen in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Met bought Ludovico Carracci's ``Pieta,'' a
sprawling image of Jesus that stretches the full width of the
painting. While it was estimated to sell for $300,000 to $500,000,
the museum paid $5.2 million, a record price for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been looking for a major early Baroque painting,'' said
Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met, after the sale at
Christie's. ``It's probably the most important picture of that
period that's been available.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was difficult for museums to buy at auction because
the timing was not always right, and it was hard to predict how
much a painting would actually sell for. ``We buy if the right
thing comes along and we can manage the price,'' he said, noting
that the painting cost 10 times the high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery bought a Baroque painting for a record
price as well. It purchased Domenichino's ``Rebuke of Adam and
Eve'' for $3.3 million at Sotheby's on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been slowly building our Baroque holdings,'' said Earl
A. Powell III, the museum's director. ``And this is a major
building block.'' It is also not the only purchase the National
Gallery made last week. At Christie's on Thursday it bought
Boilly's ``L'Escamoteur sur les Boulevards,'' an 1806 scene of
Parisians watching a card trick, for $662,500.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which has been a big
buyer at auction for years now, bought Tiepolo's ``Alexander and
Campaspe in the Studio of Apelles'' at Christie's for $2.2 million,
another record price. An anonymous donor spent $3.7 million to buy
a rare Rembrandt drawing. ``We wanted it badly,'' said Charles E.
Pierce Jr., director of the Morgan. ``It's an extraordinary drawing
from the 1640s, and very few are available.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say American museums don't go abroad to buy when
the right painting comes along. In London in July at the fabled
sale of art looted by the Nazis from the Austrian branch of the
Rothschild family, the prize painting _ a three-quarter-length
portrait by Frans Hals of an Amsterdam merchant named Tieleman
Roosterman _ was bought by the Cleveland Museum of Art for a record
price of $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years the Getty Museum has purchased
important old masters by artists like Poussin, Fra Bartolommeo,
Fragonard and Correggio. Smaller museums, like the Sterling and
Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., and the J.B.
Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky., have also bought a number of
Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And while American museums, like avid collectors, will buy
wherever the goods are to be found, many institutions find it
easier to buy art in this country rather than risk the hassle of
applying for an export license and being turned down. Last October
when the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth was set to buy
Botticelli's ``Virgin Adoring the Christ Child'' for $24 million
from the Earl of Wemyss' home in Scotland, the export license was
denied when, at the last minute, the National Galleries of Scotland
were able to match the Kimbell's price.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers representing the Wemyss Heirloom Trust were the
Simon C. Dickinson Group, a London company with two galleries:
Simon Dickinson in London and Dickinson Roundell in New York. Both
handle old masters as well as Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art and both are run by former experts from
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the faster growth of the market in Manhattan than in
London, the company recently moved into three floors of a town
house on East 66th Street, which it is currently renovating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is not slower in London, it's more expensive,'' said
David Ker, a director of the Simon C. Dickinson Group. ``The bite
of the VAT is just beginning to be felt,'' he said, referring to
value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
   Ker said his company had many good works of art to sell from
European collections because it had a presence in New York. ``There
are Europeans who like the discretion of selling in New York,'' he
added. ``The market here is more discreet. If something sells,
whether it ends up going to Australia or France nobody knows,
whereas London is a small town. Everybody knows everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hall, who headed the New York branch of Colnaghi until
1996, and Richard Knight, who ran Colnaghi in London, formed a
partnership of their own with galleries in New York and London four
years ago. Like the Simon C. Dickinson Group, Hall &AMP; Knight has
just expanded its space on the Upper East Side. ``Americans still
like to go to Paris to buy French furniture, but collectors of old
masters find it's more convenient to buy paintings here,'' Hall
said. ``Clients interested in a painting can easily take it home to
see how it looks in their living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers, in both New York and in London, who specialize in
other areas have moved into old masters to meet the growing demand.
Lowell Libson, who runs Spink-Leger, a New Bond Street gallery, has
started dealing in old master drawings even though he built his
reputation selling mainly 18th- and 19th-century British works on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was a way of removing British art from its gloomy
sideline, by showing works by, say, Gainsborough, in context with
Fragonard,'' he said. But now, as more American collectors come to
him for old master drawings, he finds himself spending more time in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractions for both dealers and the experts at the
auction houses is trying to lure big buyers who have made a name in
other collecting areas into the old masters field. Last year
Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, bought the two most
expensive paintings in Sotheby's January sale in New York, a
Rembrandt and a Rubens. Both are hanging in Wynn's minimuseum at
Bellagio, his $1.6 billion hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas.
Experts say that Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who has had
eyes mostly for classic Impressionist paintings, is now buying
Canalettos.
</P>
<P>
   Value aside, tastes and fashion are also a draw. It was once
only the pretty old masters, flower paintings or landscapes, that
appealed to American buyers, while Europeans would embrace the more
difficult religious subjects. More recently buyers here are asking
for Baroque paintings, Wachter of Sotheby's said, pointing to
``Adam and Eve Lamenting the Death of Abel,'' by Philippe de
Champaigne. The painting, which depicts a blood-splattered Abel,
might be described as a difficult subject, yet Wachter said he had
lots of interested takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they learn,'' he said, ``the more sophisticated they
are getting.'' The work sold to a telephone bidder for $266,500,
not quite twice its high estimate.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An intensifying disturbance moving through Maine will circulate
chilly but drier air into the middle Atlantic region and much of
southern New England on blustery winds from the west. Along the
coast, sunshine will return by midday and the wind will gust at
over 30 mph. Inland, an abundance of low clouds will cover the
region from the foothills of the Appalachians westward. Snow
showers will be most common in the higher elevations and along the
west slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Bright but cool weather is expected across the South as high
pressure glides east from Arkansas. A cold front moving southward
through Florida will be preceded by clouds and showers. The return
flow of moist air into south Texas will cause low clouds and
drizzle. A veil of high clouds will stream into the southern Plains
ahead of a new disturbance over the Four Corners.
</P>
<P>
   Light to moderate snow will fall in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, with snow showers developing across western Colorado and
New Mexico. The deserts of the Southwest will be mainly sunny,
though cooler. High pressure in Wyoming will lead to pleasant
conditions in the northern Rockies, though valley fog will persist
in some sections of Idaho and western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful storm will approach the Northwest, with gales and
heavy rain developing on the coast and wet snow spreading through
the Cascades. Showers should reach northern California later. The
Central Valley fog will linger into the afternoon in many sections.
The Pacific coast will turn cooler.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: January Flip
</P>
<P>
   It took until the last couple of days of the month, but the
average temperature for January 2000 has slipped a bit below the
30-year normal for the first month in both Boston and New York.
This is a remarkable turnabout, since after the first week of the
new year both cities were averaging nearly 15 degrees above normal.
The weather pattern made a switch between Jan. 12 and 14 as
jet-stream winds from the northwest began to dominate. Frequent
surges of polar air have kept readings generally below seasonal
levels for over two weeks. There is no sign of a significant change
in the week ahead.

   NEW YORK _ Five museums _ the Metropolitan Museum, the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the St.
Louis Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art _ bought
old master paintings at Christie's on Thursday. On Friday, an
anonymous donor bought a rare Rembrandt drawing for the Morgan
Library at Christie's sale of old master drawings. And two U.S.
museums were buyers at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings on
Friday: the National Gallery and an institution that wished to
remain anonymous. At both auction houses museums were willing to
pay record prices for works that would fill gaps in their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's paintings sale brought in $47.4 million, while
Christie's paintings sale totaled $39.2 million. Bidding in the
salesrooms for the most popular works was fiercely competitive,
with dealers from all over the world raising their paddles and
telephone bidders aggressively trying to buy something, no matter
what the price. Experts from both auction houses said there were
more new buyers in these sales than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old masters have been undervalued for a long time,'' said
George Wachter, director of Sotheby's old master paintings
department worldwide. ``If you go to an Impressionist sale,
$400,000 will get you a mediocre Renoir. But at an old masters
sale, buyers can get something A-1 for under $500,000, and that's
something people are finally beginning to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently London was the center of the old master universe.
It was where the most serious scholars lived and where the best
dealers could be found. Europe of course has always been a fertile
field for the finest works of art. The stately homes of titled
families in Britain and on the Continent are still treasure troves.
</P>
<P>
   But now Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan are taking
advantage of a significant increase in Americans buying old masters
and the intricate web of import taxes crippling dealers living in
European Union countries. Many top London dealers are opening
spaces in New York in order to capitalize on its flourishing
market. Some experts wonder whether New York will eclipse London in
a few years as the center of the old master market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans have shot themselves in the foot with the
complex taxes,'' said Johnny van Haeften, one of London's leading
old master dealers. For example, he said, collectors and dealers
who live in a country like Switzerland, which is not part of the
European Union, would rather sell a work of art in New York, which
has no import tax, than send it to London, where they would incur a
5 percent import tax levied on works of art brought into European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   Van Haeften added that the improved quality of the auctions in
New York had more to do with Sotheby's and Christie's recent
expansions in the city than with tastes and taxes. He pointed out
that it was only natural that the two auction houses would make the
old master market in New York as profitable as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Kennedy, who ran the old master paintings department at
Christie's in Manhattan for 16 years and is now president of
Dickinson Roundell, an East Side gallery, said that the strength of
the New York market had more to do with marketing than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auction houses are trying to cultivate more buyers by
making their sales good,'' he said. ``The Impressionist market has
become so much stronger in New York than London because the best
things are sold here, and it seems Sotheby's and Christie's are
trying to do the same for old masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in an effort to make the sales more successful,
the auction houses moved the date of their January sales later in
the month, in part to take advantage of Wall Street collectors with
year-end bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while experts for the two auction houses are promoting
New York's improved status, they gamely defend London's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is definitely flourishing, but that doesn't mean
London isn't,'' said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's
old master paintings department in New York. ``More things are
coming here for sale because the perception is that New York is a
richer market. But good things are still being sold in London,
especially in the July sales.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years the New York auctions have sold works by
artists like Rubens, Rembrandt, El Greco, Guardi and Velazquez at
record prices, which encourages sellers to keep consigning works
there. Young Wall Street traders are now putting their money into
old masters rather than the contemporary art they favored during
the '80s boom years. Experts ascribe the shift partly to changing
tastes and partly to fear. For some collectors who remember how the
contemporary art market took a nose dive in the early '90s, old
masters seem like a sounder investment. Even seasoned collectors
who were once loyal buyers of Impressionist and modern art are
beginning to get their feet wet buying the occasional Sweerts or
Canaletto, auction house experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a massive amount of money in this country,''
Crichton-Stuart said. ``But it's not just collectors who are buying
old masters. American museums with large acquisitions budgets are
active buyers both here and abroad. And that's something that
doesn't happen in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Met bought Ludovico Carracci's ``Pieta,'' a
sprawling image of Jesus that stretches the full width of the
painting. While it was estimated to sell for $300,000 to $500,000,
the museum paid $5.2 million, a record price for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been looking for a major early Baroque painting,'' said
Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met, after the sale at
Christie's. ``It's probably the most important picture of that
period that's been available.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was difficult for museums to buy at auction because
the timing was not always right, and it was hard to predict how
much a painting would actually sell for. ``We buy if the right
thing comes along and we can manage the price,'' he said, noting
that the painting cost 10 times the high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery bought a Baroque painting for a record
price as well. It purchased Domenichino's ``Rebuke of Adam and
Eve'' for $3.3 million at Sotheby's on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been slowly building our Baroque holdings,'' said Earl
A. Powell III, the museum's director. ``And this is a major
building block.'' It is also not the only purchase the National
Gallery made last week. At Christie's on Thursday it bought
Boilly's ``L'Escamoteur sur les Boulevards,'' an 1806 scene of
Parisians watching a card trick, for $662,500.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which has been a big
buyer at auction for years now, bought Tiepolo's ``Alexander and
Campaspe in the Studio of Apelles'' at Christie's for $2.2 million,
another record price. An anonymous donor spent $3.7 million to buy
a rare Rembrandt drawing. ``We wanted it badly,'' said Charles E.
Pierce Jr., director of the Morgan. ``It's an extraordinary drawing
from the 1640s, and very few are available.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say American museums don't go abroad to buy when
the right painting comes along. In London in July at the fabled
sale of art looted by the Nazis from the Austrian branch of the
Rothschild family, the prize painting _ a three-quarter-length
portrait by Frans Hals of an Amsterdam merchant named Tieleman
Roosterman _ was bought by the Cleveland Museum of Art for a record
price of $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years the Getty Museum has purchased
important old masters by artists like Poussin, Fra Bartolommeo,
Fragonard and Correggio. Smaller museums, like the Sterling and
Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., and the J.B.
Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky., have also bought a number of
Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And while American museums, like avid collectors, will buy
wherever the goods are to be found, many institutions find it
easier to buy art in this country rather than risk the hassle of
applying for an export license and being turned down. Last October
when the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth was set to buy
Botticelli's ``Virgin Adoring the Christ Child'' for $24 million
from the Earl of Wemyss' home in Scotland, the export license was
denied when, at the last minute, the National Galleries of Scotland
were able to match the Kimbell's price.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers representing the Wemyss Heirloom Trust were the
Simon C. Dickinson Group, a London company with two galleries:
Simon Dickinson in London and Dickinson Roundell in New York. Both
handle old masters as well as Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art and both are run by former experts from
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the faster growth of the market in Manhattan than in
London, the company recently moved into three floors of a town
house on East 66th Street, which it is currently renovating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is not slower in London, it's more expensive,'' said
David Ker, a director of the Simon C. Dickinson Group. ``The bite
of the VAT is just beginning to be felt,'' he said, referring to
value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
   Ker said his company had many good works of art to sell from
European collections because it had a presence in New York. ``There
are Europeans who like the discretion of selling in New York,'' he
added. ``The market here is more discreet. If something sells,
whether it ends up going to Australia or France nobody knows,
whereas London is a small town. Everybody knows everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hall, who headed the New York branch of Colnaghi until
1996, and Richard Knight, who ran Colnaghi in London, formed a
partnership of their own with galleries in New York and London four
years ago. Like the Simon C. Dickinson Group, Hall &AMP; Knight has
just expanded its space on the Upper East Side. ``Americans still
like to go to Paris to buy French furniture, but collectors of old
masters find it's more convenient to buy paintings here,'' Hall
said. ``Clients interested in a painting can easily take it home to
see how it looks in their living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers, in both New York and in London, who specialize in
other areas have moved into old masters to meet the growing demand.
Lowell Libson, who runs Spink-Leger, a New Bond Street gallery, has
started dealing in old master drawings even though he built his
reputation selling mainly 18th- and 19th-century British works on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was a way of removing British art from its gloomy
sideline, by showing works by, say, Gainsborough, in context with
Fragonard,'' he said. But now, as more American collectors come to
him for old master drawings, he finds himself spending more time in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractions for both dealers and the experts at the
auction houses is trying to lure big buyers who have made a name in
other collecting areas into the old masters field. Last year
Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, bought the two most
expensive paintings in Sotheby's January sale in New York, a
Rembrandt and a Rubens. Both are hanging in Wynn's minimuseum at
Bellagio, his $1.6 billion hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas.
Experts say that Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who has had
eyes mostly for classic Impressionist paintings, is now buying
Canalettos.
</P>
<P>
   Value aside, tastes and fashion are also a draw. It was once
only the pretty old masters, flower paintings or landscapes, that
appealed to American buyers, while Europeans would embrace the more
difficult religious subjects. More recently buyers here are asking
for Baroque paintings, Wachter of Sotheby's said, pointing to
``Adam and Eve Lamenting the Death of Abel,'' by Philippe de
Champaigne. The painting, which depicts a blood-splattered Abel,
might be described as a difficult subject, yet Wachter said he had
lots of interested takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they learn,'' he said, ``the more sophisticated they
are getting.'' The work sold to a telephone bidder for $266,500,
not quite twice its high estimate.

`CHILDREN IN WAR': CHILDREN CAUGHT IN THE WARS ADULTS WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Program notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New
York area. Check local listings.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first scene says it all. In Sarajevo, a
7-year-old boy is shot by a sniper. He lies dead in the street, a
huge pool of blood beside his head. He is one of an estimated
15,000 children, the narrator says, killed in the civil war in his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers of a certain age, it will be impossible to watch the
HBO documentary ``Children in War'' Monday night without
visualizing the 1960s poster that said, ``War is unhealthy for
children and other living things,'' illustrated with a childlike
drawing of a flower. It was a sentiment meant to overwhelm with its
obviousness, which may be the thinking behind this film as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alan and Susan Raymond, who wrote, directed, produced,
photographed and narrated the two-hour documentary, visited and
interviewed children in four very different war zones: Bosnia,
Israel, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. The results are sometimes
poignant, occasionally chilling and often predictably parrotlike.
</P>
<P>
   When a teen-age girl in Northern Ireland is asked if her father,
who is in prison, is a terrorist, she answers, ``Yes, he has been
accused of being a terrorist, although, as the saying goes, one
man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.'' When a
Palestinian boy in a classroom is asked whether he believes the
tactics of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, are right, he
replies, ``We support Hamas and all its actions.'' He adds, ``The
Jews do much more to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The film hopes, it is assumed, to convey the voices of children,
but it's clear that these are the opinions of their parents and
other elders. If the young people have reflected on these views, if
they have observed their situations and come to those conclusions
independently, there's no sign of it here. If the Raymonds ever did
ask, ``What do your parents tell you about this?'' or ``Is this how
you feel or how your parents and teachers feel?'' they haven't
included the exchanges in the finished documentary.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the sentiments the children appear to have
heard at home are more positive. Some children speak of resignation
and of hoping that others are spared suffering. ``God forbid that
they have to live what we've gone through in Bosnia,'' says a
12-year-old boy with only one arm. It's both heartening and
heartbreaking to hear him say of the attack that took his left arm:
``What can you do? A shell doesn't have eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those interviewed are adolescents, presumably
chosen because they would be more articulate than their younger
siblings. But the youngest victims are some of the most eloquent. A
5-year-old Rwandan girl, with the scars of huge gashes in her head,
tells of running with her mother and her father from the attackers,
watching her parents being killed and being attacked herself.
``They cut me with a machete and killed me,'' she says. Why did
these people do these things? ``They did it for nothing.'' Some
300,000 children, the film reports, were victims of the Rwandan
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   At times ``Children in War'' inadvertently presents the trauma
as nothing that a little art therapy couldn't fix. (Numerous
children's drawings of tanks and explosions and bodies are shown.)
At other times, the film makes the horror fresh. An Israeli street
scene shows piles of plastic garbage bags on the sidewalk. They are
filled, we are told, with body parts of bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswerable question the film brings to mind is which is
worse, boys and girls who have never experienced the innocence of
childhood because they have grown up in the middle of armed
conflict (as in Israel and Northern Ireland), or those whose
childhoods were snatched away suddenly when war broke out (Bosnia
and Rwanda)? The choice is between children with hard eyes or with
dead eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``War,'' says a 12-year-old girl in a Bosnian refugee camp, who
speaks calmly but has the air of someone permanently startled,
``Whoever hasn't experienced it doesn't know what it is.''
</P>

ZIMBABWE IS THE NEXT STOP ON THE AGASSI EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ ``Five shots, can you believe I had to
get five shots?'' Brad Gilbert said of the medical requirements
shortly before he and the new Australian Open champion Andre Agassi
boarded a plane that was headed in the direction of Harare,
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   No, the next stop on Team Agassi's ever-more successful world
tour will bear little resemblance to those that preceded it. After
winning his sixth Grand Slam singles title on Sunday in Rod Laver
Arena with its eye-catching retractable roof, Agassi will be
playing his next match under a potentially leaky roof in the City
Sports Centre, a ramshackle arena with wooden bleachers that is
full of drafts and history and located just a short drive from
central Harare up a rough road.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Zimbabwe and its two key players, Wayne and Byron
Black, hosted a Davis Cup match, the financially strapped electric
company cut power to part of the city: the part that included the
arena. That meant that the lights went out in the midst of Wayne's
singles match against Chile's Marcelo Rios. While Zimbabwean tennis
officials hustled off to plead for power, the arena remained dark
for approximately an hour, and by the time the lights were finally
switched back on, most of the spectators had already headed home.
</P>
<P>
   But the lights are expected to remain in working order when
Agassi comes to town along with his new Davis Cup captain John
McEnroe and the rest of the American team. But not with Pete
Sampras, who withdrew because of a torn hip flexor sustained early
in his five-set semifinal loss to Agassi in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to it,'' said Agassi on Sunday of
his return to Davis Cup after a self-imposed one-year absence.
``It's unfortunate that Pete is not going to be able to make it,
because it certainly made all of our jobs a lot tougher, but I
think we can rise above.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi has been excelling professionally since May, and he has
now won three of the last four Grand Slam events: his only loss
coming against Sampras in the Wimbledon final. ``There's not
anything in my career that compares with these last eight months,''
Agassi said, after defeating Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Sunday, 3-6,
6-3, 6-2, 6-4. ``Winning in Paris alone has given me more than I
could ever ask for or dreamt of, let alone the U.S. Open and here.
It's been a crazy life.''
</P>
<P>
   More unusual still because it is now shared with Steffi Graf,
who won 22 Grand Slam singles titles of her own before retiring
shortly after winning the French Open and losing in the Wimbledon
final. Graf was in the stands for each of Agassi's matches in
Melbourne, sitting between coach Gilbert and Agassi's powerfully
built trainer Gil Reyes. She was there again on Sunday, her face
impassive throughout much of the match but her leg nervously
jiggling as Agassi relentlessly, inexorably overcame yet another
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerve-wracking, no question about it,'' Graf said afterward.
``It's difficult to watch but also very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Agassi understandably prefers to keep his
private life exactly that. ``Certain things are sacred,'' he said.
``Our relationship is for us, not for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that Graf, the most successful
attacking baseliner in the history of the women's game, could find
much more to relate to in Agassi's backcourt duel against
Kafelnikov than she could in the fast-twitch fourth round against
Mark Philippoussis or the semifinal against Sampras when long
rallies were far from the rule.
</P>
<P>
   And that is perhaps the most impressive aspect of Agassi's run
to a second Australian Open title _ he beat players with widely
varying styles. He beat players who happened to be the most
dangerous in the draw, including local hero Philippoussis and
Sampras, whose big serves were theoretically big advantages on a
Rebound Ace court that was much quicker than usual: so quick that
tournament director Paul McNamee said it will be slowed down next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sampras' injury removed some of the satisfaction from
his victory, Agassi quickly answered no. ``For me it's about doing
what I need to do when I'm out there,'' he said. ``He came up with
200 kilometer second serves in the breaker. As far as I'm
concerned, hurt or not, he was brutal to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been even harder to stop Agassi, who has now won 27 of
his last 28 matches in the Grand Slam events. ``Only Steffi, Rod
Laver twice and Don Budge can say they reached the 28-0 mark, so
he's in pretty good company there,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in his post-match news conference what it would mean to
him to complete the Grand Slam by winning all four majors in the
same calendar year, Agassi said: ``The same thing as winning the
lottery would mean to everybody in here. I couldn't even comprehend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed a highly unlikely prospect: ``I'm not even thinking
about that at all,'' he said. But what he is interested in is
sustaining the fitness and white-hot concentration that have
transformed him from a gifted yet unpredictable wild card into a
lean and hungry trophy hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you if I fall off the face of the earth again,
I'm not coming back,'' said Agassi, who was ranked 141st and
playing Challenger Tour events late in 1997. ``But I'll take it as
long as it's there for me, and as long as it's in the plan of my
life for sure.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said: ``I used to see the frustration in his eyes when I'd
see him on court, and now his eyes look like laser beams out there:
fixed on the point at hand and then the next point.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he ever been this focused during a Grand Slam event? ``I was
pretty focused at the Open, too,'' Agassi said referring the U.S.
Open late last summer. ``With Pat Rafter and Pete gone, I had just
to keep the course. I had to stay focused there, too, but yeah
there wasn't a point I let go here.''
</P>
<P>
   And precious few he celebrated, as he jerked his glance away
from his winners like others jerk away from their mistakes. ``The
question you've got to ask yourself and answer is how do I make
this the most difficult on my opponent, because he's struggling as
much as you are,'' Agassi said. ``He's having to beat you, too, and
the only way to do that is to think about the next point. It's
quite a profound simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Made all the simpler when one is not gasping for air or feeling
pain in one's legs. In previous years, Agassi has relaxed in the
off-season. This year, he chose to train at home in Las Vegas
without skipping a day, including Christmas Eve when he and Reyes
headed to the hill near his house that they call ``Magic Mountain''
for sprints of approximately 320 yards from the bottom to the top.
``Up there with no TV cameras and no bright lights,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said: ``We had to maximize the time that we had, and you
don't have a lot. A month is not a lot of time to recover and
prepare. I wasn't worried about how long a year it was as far as
how much tennis I had played. I was more concerned about getting
myself to a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Reyes, Agassi is in the best shape of his life at
age 29 and can lift the entire stack of weights on a leg machine
and bench press nearly 300 pounds. According to Gilbert, Agassi has
never had a better understanding of the game's intricacies, and
Gilbert believes he can reasonably expect to play for three more
years. Yet as Gilbert, Reyes, Agassi and even Graf also understand,
the question is whether someone who already has reached the summit
can keep summoning the desire to climb higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows he needs to,'' Gilbert said. ``He can't slack
off. He does not serve like Pete. He can't hit an ace any time. He
has to work his butt off. If he's a little bit vulnerable everybody
knows it because people pay more attention to Andre than any other
player, man or woman.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, it will be the Zimbabweans turn to pay attention, and
if Agassi can keep the focus with the drums beating and perhaps
even the roof leaking, they will also be in for a treat, if not
necessarily a celebration.

VODAFONE SETS BROAD ALLIANCE WITH VIVENDI OF FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain announced Sunday that
it had agreed to an alliance with Vivendi SA of France.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the other benefits to Vodafone, the most immediate
effect is to derail a plan by Mannesmann AG, a German company that
had planned to link with Vivendi in hopes of thwarting Vodafone's
$156 billion hostile bid to acquire Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, a major mobile phone company, and Vivendi, a
broad-based company that owns a 44 percent stake in the French
mobile phone carrier Cegetel, said the two companies would develop
a ``portal'' or entranceway to the Internet accessible by
computers, mobile phones and cable or satellite television. They
said the alliance might also include the two companies' wireless
and fixed-line telephone networks. The alliance is contingent upon
Vodafone's success in acquiring Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, chief executive of Vodafone, and Jean-Marie Messier,
chairman of Vivendi, announced their alliance Sunday afternoon in
Paris, where they described their plans for a Web portal. The new
offering would be called MAP, for multiaccess portal. The companies
said they might list MAP on the stock exchange as a separate
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most compelling alliance of the Internet age in
Europe and beyond,'' Messier said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Vodafone would sell Vivendi an additional
7.5 percent stake in Cegetel if Vodafone acquired Mannesmann. Now,
Mannesmann has a 15 percent stake in Cegetel. Gent did not specify
the financial terms, but said that the Cegetel stake would be sold
``at a fair price.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's announcement was a setback for Mannesmann, which had
held talks with Vivendi about a complex merger, one that could have
provided a compelling argument against a Vodafone takeover of
Mannesmann. Klaus Esser, Mannesmann's chief executive, had been
outspoken about his desire to create a closer relationship with
Vivendi. Esser also counts Messier as one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Esser responded to the Vodafone-Vivendi alliance by issuing a
statement Sunday. ``Vodafone's sell-off of Mannesmann's premium
assets continues,'' he said, referring to the planned sale of the
Cegetel stake. ``This would destroy Mannesmann's superior growth
prospects and destroy the opportunity for greater value for our
shareholders.'' Under British regulations, Vodafone would have to
sell Mannesmann's British wireless company, Orange PLC, if the
Vodafone takeover succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, an industrial company that in recent years has made
communications its mainstay business, was most interested in
Vivendi's stake in Cegetel, a holding company that owns the French
mobile phone company SFR and Cegetel 7, a struggling competitor to
France Telecom in fixed-line communications.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mannesmann already owns wireless networks in three of
Europe's biggest markets _ Germany, Italy and Britain _ control of
Cegetel in France would have given it an unrivaled position in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said Vivendi had decided against a
deal with Mannesmann, which was discussed at a board meeting on
Saturday in Paris, because of the German company's uncertain
future. The executives explained that Vivendi was betting that
Vodafone would win its battle for Mannesmann and that the French
company would be able to benefit from access to the combined
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gent heralded the deal as another reason shareholders should
back Vodafone's offer for Mannesmann. ``Everyone was focusing on
Mannesmann doing a deal with Vivendi, but I think they liked our
approach in terms of partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi, which was formerly known as Compagnie Generale des
Eaux, is a complex operation. It owns water utilities and
water-treatment companies around Europe and in the United States,
as well as several electric utility companies. It also owns stakes
in scores of media companies, including 49 percent of Canal Plus
SA, Europe's biggest pay-television company; 25 percent of B-Sky-B,
the British satellite television company controlled by the News
Corp., and all of Havas SA, the French advertising and publishing
company.

`KING JOHN': A SHAKESPEAREAN TAKE ON THE PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man in the front row, the one with the heavy
black eyeliner, can't believe what he's seeing. Actually, he's a
character in Karin Coonrod's lively new production of Shakespeare's
``King John,'' but he has decided to join the audience to get a
clearer perspective on what's going on between the play's title
monarch and the King of France. It is, he has decided, a pretty
disgusting spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   All those rubber principles bending every whichaway, all that
instant backtracking, all that compromise parading as conviction:
this all comes as a shock to the fellow known as the Bastard, a
virgin in the realm of government, played by Derek Smith. What he
observes leads him to wax poetic and satiric on something he calls
``commodity,'' or pure self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most famous monologue in this brooding political
cartoon of a play, which opened Sunday night in a production by the
Theater for a New Audience at the American Place Theater, a
mock-Machiavellian primer of a speech on how to get by in a corrupt
society.
</P>
<P>
   That it is delivered by a man who has just been sitting among us
seems especially apt. As far as the stage of statesmanship is
concerned, the view from the audience really hasn't changed much in
four centuries. One need only look to that American spectacle known
as the presidential primaries for a contemporary equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bastard (who wears his epithet proudly, by the way) isn't
the only character in this ``King John'' to step back and sit down
with the audience to watch the wicked world go by, and the device
matches the evening's governing point of view. This early,
intriguing history play, written in the 1590s, is arguably
Shakespeare's most detached-seeming work, a cool look at a fraught
era in which alliances are made of straw and heroes are hard to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Ms. Coonrod, the vigorous and imaginative director
of the ``Henry VI'' plays at the Joseph Papp Public Theater,
provides an evening of energetic, stylized carnage and
double-dealing kept at a cynical remove. This interpretation
doesn't provide much in the way of psychological insight. But it's
appropriately tough-minded and darkly funny, and the production
makes its central points (which, refreshingly, are also the play's)
with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   John (played here by Ned Eisenberg) is among the least
charismatic of Shakespeare's crown wearers, with nothing of either
the outsize villainy of Richard III or the patriotic glamour of
Henry V. (The event for which his real-life model is best known,
the signing of Magna Carta, isn't even mentioned.)
</P>
<P>
   He struts and fulminates and pulls rank, but basically he's a
waffler and a mama's boy, which is understandable when you realize
that Mama is the domineering Eleanor of Aquitaine (Myra Carter).
John's foreign peer, Philip II of France (Mark Vietor), isn't much
more decisive or commanding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the only character with kingly virtues, as Shakespeare
would later define them, is that same Bastard, who is the
illegitimate son of John's brother, Richard the Lionhearted, and
who, taken up by the royal court, winds up running it. Harold Bloom
has gone so far as to say that the Bastard ``inaugurates
Shakespeare's invention of the human.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the character has that rich mix of varied
elements associated with great Shakespearean figures and that we
are allowed to see him grow in a way no one else in the play does;
his initiation into realpolitik is also ours. Ms. Coonrod and the
vibrant Smith have chosen to bypass interior-probing portraiture in
favor of an exaggerated everyman figure, a jaunty master of
ceremonies who is part jester, part moral watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   This may serve the evening's thematic purposes, but for more
intricate characterization, you'll have to look elsewhere. There is
above all Eisenberg, who has ingeniously taken hold of the slippery
John by playing him as a small-time mafioso thrust into the role of
leading don. (John Cazale's Freddie Corleone in the ``Godfather''
movies comes to mind.)
</P>
<P>
   The Eleanor of Ms. Carter (of ``Three Tall Women''), her mouth
set in a militant pout, and Pamela Nyberg's high-strung Lady
Constance _ the determined mother of the young Arthur (Michael Ray
Escamillo), another claimant to the throne _ are maternal dragons
to remember, vivid studies in vicarious ambition. And Nicholas
Kepros is excellent, somehow dry and unctuous at once, as the most
skilled politician of the lot, a papal legate from Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the charged physicality of Ms. Coonrod's staging,
starting with a wordless crown-tossing free-for-all as a curtain
raiser, the evening has its longueurs. You can't avoid the feeling
that this is one of those rare Shakespearean plays in which the
language has more fat than meat, with speakers taking a dozen lines
to say the equivalent of ``Get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   P.K. Wish's costumes are a little too self-consciously hip,
suggesting a medieval-themed collection by Helmut Lang, and there's
enough hair gel in use to start a serious oil slick. And while
Christopher Akerlind employs lighting to inspired effect in
underscoring soliloquies and asides, the use of performers in
multiple roles can be confusing, as when Katie MacNichol, the
lovely actress playing Blanche, John's niece, later shows up in an
expensive-looking debutante dress as a messenger from the
battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, the evening moves forward with speed and
clarity. And Ms. Coonrod consistently demonstrates a keen ear for
the hollowness and duplicity of the language of state, getting
laughs from the characters' orotund speech, especially as rendered
by Bruce Turk's Dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   And in one terrific bit of interpolated business, the toll taken
by battle between England and France is registered by having those
nations' monarchs meet several times, repeating exactly the same
lines. The words _ beginning with, ``France, hast thou yet more
blood to cast away?'' _ are brave and lofty. In the repetition,
they lose their sheen, perfectly setting the stage for a less than
noble truce between two posturing kings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Barry Diller has been among the most
respected _ and feared _ figures in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   To admirers like Joe Roth, who resigned earlier this month as
the head of Disney's movie studios, Diller is ``the smartest, most
astute businessman I've ever worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, who generally won't speak by name, Diller's temper
and unwillingness to share power have kept him from building a
first-tier media company. In Hollywood, stories of Diller's
behavior are legendary, including the time a decade ago when he
threw a videotape so hard that he put a hole in a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Diller's career has come to a crossroads. Diller, who will
turn 58 on Wednesday, is no longer the whiz kid who took control of
the Paramount film studio 26 years ago, or the can't-miss
programmer who in the late 1980s built the Fox network into a
challenger to television's traditional Big Three. The company he
now controls, USA Networks, ranks far behind top old-media players
like Disney in clout, size and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new crop of moguls dominates the media industry,
including Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom, Mel Karmazin of CBS and,
more recently, Stephen M. Case and Robert W. Pittman of America
Online. If Diller is ever to seize the crown of power and
recognition that friends say he wants, he must somehow figure out a
way to close the gap between USA and its bigger cousins. Otherwise
he runs the risk of being remembered as the Dan Marino of the media
business, a great player who was unable to win the biggest prize in
his chosen game.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's quandary has sharpened the last four months, as America
Online has agreed to buy Time Warner and Viacom to merge with CBS.
Together, those deals create a new scale for media companies. The
combined AOL Time Warner will have annual revenue of more than $30
billion, while Viacom-CBS will have annual revenue of around $25
billion. In comparison, USA will have revenue this year of less
than $4 billion, according to analyst's projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be enormously difficult for him to get
the brass ring, if the brass ring is that very small circle of
those largest and most powerful companies,'' said Michael Fuchs,
the former head of HBO and Warner Music and a friend of Diller.
``And in the last couple months, in the light of what's happened,
he's gotten relatively smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diller's friends warn not to bet against him. And in an
interview on Friday, Diller rejected the notion that he will feel
successful only if USA reaches the media industry's first tier. He
said he aims to build a company that is a profitable hybrid of old
and new media.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a wrestling show on his flagship USA Networks might
direct a viewer who wants to buy tickets to a local wrestling match
to www.ticketmaster.com, a Web site that is part-owned by USA.
After buying the tickets, the fan would then be offered a wrestling
T-shirt from the Home Shopping Network, another USA company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company is both old media and new media, supported by
advertising revenue, subscription revenue and pure commerce
revenue,'' Diller said. ``Now you could say that we won't pull it
off. We believe that if we do pull it off, we will have created a
great company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said of
Diller: ``I'm sure Barry would like a larger opportunity, but it's
a pretty good business he's got. His search is for the right
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Diller's relative silence recently is notable, given some
of his past efforts at making deals. In 1993 and 1994, he was
thwarted in separate efforts to buy Paramount and merge with CBS.
His bold attempt last year to recast himself as an Internet
visionary by taking over Lycos, a Web portal company, failed after
a major Lycos shareholder came out against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lycos merger blew up, Diller has contented himself
with much smaller Internet acquisitions. Most recently, he traded
his Internet Shopping Network and $40 million in cash for a 75
percent stake in Styleclick.com, a company that had all of $768,546
in revenues in its September quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a $140 billion merger out there, and Barry buys an
Internet company for $40 million. It's a slightly different
scale,'' Fuchs said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a testament to Diller's reputation, even that
relatively minor deal drew substantial attention in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, revenues and profits do not necessarily equal power
in the media industry. Both in Hollywood and on Wall Street,
control of prime assets like a major film studio or a broadcast
network is perceived as incredibly valuable, though their profits
are relatively meager.
</P>
<P>
   But the assets Diller controls do not exactly make up in
prestige what they lack in size or profitability. In addition to
USA and Home Shopping cable channels, his company owns Ticketmaster
and a television production company. It also owns a chain of
little-watched local television stations viewed as likely
candidates to be sold or merged with ABC under relaxed station
ownership rules regulators issued last year. Its Internet assets
include 43 million shares of Ticketmaster Online-City Search, which
provides online ticketing and local guides, and the Hotel
Reservations Network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, investors have given Diller the benefit of the
doubt. Most Wall Street analysts rate USA Networks a buy, and his
company's stock has risen fivefold the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry's up to something,'' said the mutual fund manager Mario
Gabelli, whose funds owned more than 3 million USA shares as of
Sept. 30. ``You've got electronic commerce and entertainment,
you've got a wonderful array of portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors appear to be hoping that Diller will sell USA to
a larger media company, or even an Internet company like Yahoo.
Mark Greenberg, portfolio manager of the $575 million Invesco
Leisure fund, which owns 60,000 USA shares, said Diller could
easily find a buyer if he wanted to sell. But any buyer will have
to tread lightly, since Diller has repeatedly said he would never
again work for anyone else. Further complicating any combination is
the fact that Seagram controls close to half of USA and has veto
power over any major deal.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   USA's soaring stock valuation has left the company expensive
compared with other big media companies, leaving Diller little room
for error.
</P>
<P>
   USA has not yet reported its fourth-quarter results, but for all
of 1999, analysts expect the company to report about $3.2 billion
in revenues and $550 million in cash flow. In 2000, with the aid of
several small acquisitions, the company is expected to post about
$3.8 billion in revenues and less than $700 million in cash flow.
(Cash flow is operating profit before interest, taxes, and
depreciation and amortization costs. Media industry analysts often
focus on cash flow rather than bottom-line profit, which few media
companies except Disney have much of.)
</P>
<P>
   With about 370 million shares outstanding, USA's total market
value is close to $19 billion. So assuming the company's total cash
flow meets estimates this year, USA is currently trading at about
28 times its 2000 cash flow and five times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Walt Disney trades at about 17 times estimated
2000 cash flow and 3.5 times revenues, while the combined
Viacom-CBS would trade at 23 times estimated cash flow and five
times revenues. Yet Disney and Viacom-CBS have brands, reach to
consumers and influence with advertisers that USA can only dream
of. Even if USA's money-losing Internet businesses are factored out
and valued separately, a step most analysts take, the company
remains expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The high valuation leaves some in Hollywood and on Wall Street
puzzled. USA Networks ``has been a very good market performer
relative to its actual results,'' said Harold Vogel, an independent
media analyst and author of ``Entertainment Industry Economics: A
Guide for Financial Analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel said USA's stock has such strong returns mainly because of
Diller's reputation. ``He is very good at presenting himself as a
visionary, and he has done some very important things in the past
that validate that view on Wall Street,'' Vogel said. But Vogel
added that he was not sure what to make of Diller's current
strategy. ``Recently, it hasn't come together, it hasn't come
together as well as he would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   But the PaineWebber media analyst Chris Dixon, who rates USA a
buy, said that ``anybody who's looking at cash flow or earnings
today doesn't get it.'' Dixon said that USA's combination of
television and Internet assets would make it a leader as the two
media converge.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Diller disputed the notion that USA is overly
expensive. ``I think the fact that this company is highly valued
has something to do with people's faith in the management, but I
don't think that's a major reason,'' Diller said. ``The businesses
that we are in have promise, and the strategy as articulated makes
some sense.''

INVESTORS ASK IF BEIJING CAN ENFORCE ALL ITS NEW INTERNET RULES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Of all the requirements needed to invest in the
Internet in China these days, the most important may be steady
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing government announced a raft of new regulations last
week governing the release of material on the Internet. The rules
would crack down on Internet providers who distribute information
the government deems to be ``state secrets,'' either through news
services or electronic chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week came word of rules requiring Chinese Internet
companies to receive approval from three state agencies before they
issue shares of stock. These regulations could hobble several
promising start-up concerns, which had hoped to go public this year
to capitalize on the pell-mell growth of online usage here.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to some experts, Beijing has set a deadline of
Monday for companies to register their commercial encryption
software with the government. Companies use encryption codes to
prevent outsiders from monitoring their confidential electronic
communications. By requiring companies to disclose details of the
software, the authorities could keep tabs on e-mail and other data
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these new regulations can be seen as a frontal
assault on the Internet by a government that is afraid of losing
control. Yet most local entrepreneurs and foreign investors
shrugged off the latest blasts from Beijing. As long as China's
policy toward the Internet is still inchoate, they are content to
go about their business and leave the worrying for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential rewards are so great that people are ignoring
the risks,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner in BDA China Ltd., an
Internet consulting firm in Beijing. ``You won't see people panic
unless the government does something draconian, like throw an
Internet executive in jail or shut down a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the companies were betting that China would be able
to carry out only a fraction of its new rules. With the number of
Internet users here more than quadrupling, to 8.9 million in 1999,
and with new online ventures proliferating, they think that the
government will have neither the resources nor the ingenuity to
monitor every chat room or to vet every business plan.
</P>
<P>
   China has been struggling to get a handle on the World Wide Web
ever since its leaders decided to harness the new medium rather
than suppress it. Initially, some officials favored building a
domestic Internet that was walled off from the Web. But the concept
of a Chinese ``intranet'' foundered when it became clear that the
government could not stanch the flow of information into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, experts said, officials seem to have abandoned an
overarching Internet policy in favor of a piecemeal approach that
relies on ribbons of bureaucratic red tape and the occasional stern
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `We're going to take the best of the Internet,
but we will not allow the influences we consider inappropriate or
harmful,''' said Gordon G. Chang, a lawyer in Shanghai who advises
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of scattershot approach reflects a fierce debate
within the government about who should supervise the Internet. The
Ministry of Information Industry had originally been expected to
oversee virtually all aspects of its regulation, and investors
pored over the comments of its minister, Wu Jichuan, like tea
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Wu caused alarm last fall when he unexpectedly reaffirmed a
prohibition on foreign investment in Chinese Internet providers _
only to back off after China signed a landmark trade deal with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wu appeared to retreat further when he said in an
interview with a Chinese magazine that his ministry had
jurisdiction only over Internet service providers. Internet content
companies _ news services, community groups and the like _ were to
be regulated by ``relevant departments.''
</P>
<P>
   That set off a stampede by other ambitious officials eager to
lay claim to various patches of cyberspace. The State Press and
Publication Administration said it is drawing up guidelines on how
companies should disseminate news on the Internet, while the
Administration for Radio, Film and Television said it must approve
services that deliver online broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's motivation seems to be as much economic as political.
``There is a land grab going on by different government
departments, who recognize the billion-dollar valuations that
Internet IPOs are getting,'' Clark said. ``Some of the ministries
are saying, `We can do this ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet entrepreneurs have responded to Beijing officials'
discomfort by steering clear of the areas that arouse the most
sensitivity. Two of the best-known Chinese portals, Sina.com and
Sohu.com, originally made news a key part of their services _ even
signing partnerships with Western media companies like Dow Jones
and Reuters. But after a warning from the government, they dropped
nonfinancial foreign news from their Web sites and cut links to the
sites of foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``News content is not going to drive the Internet in China,''
said R. Mark Mecham, an analyst at Claydon Gescher Associates, a
technology consulting firm in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rage among investors are ventures that specialize in
electronic commerce, online auctions and other activities that are
less likely to touch nerves in Beijing. Among the most prominent of
these are Netease.com, which sponsors online auctions, and
8448.net, an e-commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   But even electronic commerce may not evade the long arm of the
government. Experts said Beijing's demand that companies register
encryption software had especially worrisome implications for
e-commerce businesses. They predicted that some companies would
leave China rather than risk having their transactions monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``No foreign company wants to give up its source code,'' Chang
said. ``They'll have to end up with some sort of a negotiated
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is confident that Beijing and the Internet will
find common ground. Asia Tech Ventures, a venture-capital firm in
Hong Kong, has shunned mainland Internet companies, focusing
instead on Hong Kong and Taiwan. It has only one China holding, a
Shanghai-based online auction service called Eachnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make a single investment in the mainland until last
November because the regulations are always changing,'' said Hanson
Cheah, a partner at Asia Tech Ventures. ``I'm not dismissing China.
I'm just extremely cautious about it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A ST. JOHN'S, DISCORD AND CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ First he apologized for his late arrival at a
postgame news conference. Then, Mike Jarvis played concerned
pastor, perplexed by his distracted flock. St. John's had just been
bounced around by a Notre Dame team far less talented than his own.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the sermon he gave his team after a 73-60
defeat _ the Red Storm's third loss in its last four games _ lasted
a little longer than usual. With a rueful smile, he quipped that
there had been a ``double collection.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit a high, gentle note by reminding his team, as well as
observers, that about 250 other college teams would love to be 13-5
and ranked in the top 25. He dropped a low, vengeful note when he
scolded that his bunch had launched a greedy 29 3-pointers and
turned its back on the Red Storm's attacking style.
</P>
<P>
   He called that long range attack fool's gold. Like fools, Jarvis
intimated, his players grabbed for the easy score and paid for it.
The St. John's coach is too patient to panic and too calculating to
show up his team publicly. But he made it clear that the Red Storm
received a Come-to-Jarvis talk.
</P>
<P>
   He made it plain that Monday night's game with undefeated and
fourth-ranked Syracuse (17-0) in the Carrier Dome is as good a time
as any for the Red Storm to renew its faith in its system and in
each other. He told them he performed his best when things are at
their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is time for his players to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses was in the desert for 40 years,'' Jarvis intoned in one
last evangelical flourish. ``We've only been in there for a couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing a few games in January is not that big a deal. Neither
are the occasional on-court mental lapses that allowed Ohio State
to dash off an 11-0 run in the final 2 minutes 49 seconds of one
recent defeat. Or the Red Storm's stubborn insistence last Saturday
to try to outgun rather than outrun a plodding Fighting Irish team
_ despite the fact St. John's is one of the poorest
3-point-shooting teams in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   What is worrisome, however, is the increasingly dissatisfied
tone of the players in the locker room after the losses. In both
instances, players have complained about whistles that were or were
not blown. The senior Lavor Postell, one of the team's most
clearheaded leaders, announced his intention to call a players-only
meeting after Saturday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner, Erick Barkley said calling a meeting is fine
but what is really needed is for his teammates to remember their
roles. In a nutshell: the shooters should shoot and the passers
should pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should do what they do best,'' said Barkley, a
grimace darkening his face. ``What they do in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore runs the floor for the Red Storm. He is a splendid
talent and a zealous competitor who worked hard in the off-season
to improve his jump shot. Barkley had been magnificent so far this
season, but he is also louder, more demonstrative and often
disapproving of his teammates during the game. At one point against
the Irish, he screamed ``No!'' as Chudney Gray attempted to launch
a shot over Troy Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Gray suffered an 0-for-7 shooting night; but the
senior's defensive effort and rebounding, as well as nine points a
game, have been vital _ especially since he essentially is the Red
Storm's only bench player.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley was asked if he was perhaps trying to do too much _
especially after a 6-of-16 shooting performance (a team-high for
attempts) with 11 3-point tries (also a team-high) countered by
just one assist, he dismissed the question disdainfully. ``They are
starting to play me differently,'' he said. ``They are keeping me
from the basket and forcing me to kick it out. Guys got to step up
and make those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse offers no such discord or confusion about how they fit
together. Three seniors _ Jason Hart, Ryan Blackwell and Etan
Thomas _ have led the Orangemen to their best start in school
history. The defensive-minded Hart leads the Big East in assists
(6.8 a game). Blackwell unobtrusively patrols the blocks, and
scores and rebounds (8.2 a game), and Thomas is the best
shot-blocking center in a league full of them. He leads the Big
East with 4.1 blocks a game, and he scores 14.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis and his players find comfort in the fact that they had a
similar rough stretch at this time last season _ three tough losses
to Duke, Connecticut and Miami _ which they learned from to reach
the South Regional finals of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim and Hart are
motivated by a first-round loss to Oklahoma in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When Syracuse walloped UConn last Monday, Boeheim urged his
players to take part in a fans-to-the-floor celebration at the
Carrier Dome. The Syracuse coach wanted his team _ virtually the
same underachieving group from last season _ to understand that
they had just taken a big step toward their national-title
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarvis has a different team this season, one without the
budding National Basketball Association star Ron Artest or the
sturdy Tyrone Grant and a rotation that often went nine deep. The
St. John's coach has acknowledged that this edition is not as
talented, but rightfully believes it is a serious threat come
tournament time.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that, however, each member must take responsibility
for these recent defeats and recognize they are significant
setbacks to their title dreams. No whistles. No finger pointing.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm need not worry about wandering in the desert for
40 years, but they quite possibly could get lost through March.

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, the chairman of the German industrial power
Mannesmann, has built his career by amassing control. The next
seven days will determine if he loses it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of an election-style campaign that may
determine who will dominate Europe's booming market for wireless
communications, Esser is desperately trying to persuade
shareholders to vote down a hostile takeover bid by Vodafone
AirTouch of Britain. Mannesmann shareholders have until next Monday
to decide whether to accept or reject Vodafone's offer of about 290
euros, or nearly $282.50, for each share of their stock.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest hostile takeover ever attempted, and it has
electrified Germany, a country where hostile bids have been rare
and successful ones almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Esser suffered a potential major defeat Sunday when Vodafone
announced a major alliance on Internet projects with Vivendi, one
of France's most important media and communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is contingent on the success of Vodafone's bid, but it
is devastating to Mannesmann because Vivendi's chief, Jean-Marie
Messier, has been a longtime ally. Indeed, Esser had sought to
devise his own merger with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   With a current value of about $155 billion, the hostile bid is
inflated by investors' delirious expectations about wireless
stocks. And it has sent Esser barnstorming for support, from
Duesseldorf to New York, with the same core message: ``It is easy
to see how this would benefit Vodafone shareholders. But it offers
nothing to Mannesmann shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mannesmann's share price of 260 euros still trails
Vodafone's offer of more than 300 euros, it has soared 78 percent
since rumors of a Vodafone offer began in early November. Esser,
who has raised his estimate of the ``true'' value of Mannesmann
twice since the fight began, says the offer is still too low.
</P>
<P>
   But Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent, has waged his own
charm offensive. Knowing that resistance to his offer is strongest
in Germany, he spent much of last week visiting investors there and
exchanging potshots with Esser.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have taken out numerous advertisements in German
newspapers, sometimes in response to each other. After one
Mannesmann ad featured a baby and the headline ``He has made big
plans,'' Vodafone countered with one showing a breast-feeding baby
and the headline ``Whoever wants to get big needs a good mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Esser's chances of victory are only even at best, according to
analysts, who say that about 60 percent of Mannesmann shares are
held by foreign investors, and many of them appear ready to sell.
</P>
<P>
   All this has left Europeans, especially Germans, gaping in
disbelief. The value of European mergers hit a record pace in 1999,
exceeding that of U.S. mergers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, German companies were among the biggest foreign buyers,
as when Deutsche Bank bought Bankers Trust and Mannesmann itself
bought the British cellular carrier Orange for about $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Germans, including Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, attack
the Vodafone bid as an ``Anglo-Saxon'' assault on their country's
tradition of a ``consensus'' economy.
</P>
<P>
   The shock has been all the greater because of the target:
Mannesmann, which a decade ago was a maker of steel tubes and auto
parts, transformed itself into a fast-growing communications
company that had seemed to be doing almost everything right.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what may surprise most, given the uproar, is the extent to
which Mannesmann and German leaders have been willing to play by
Anglo-Saxon free-market rules. The clash has shaped up largely as a
struggle between two expansionist corporations with a common goal:
creation of a pan-European communications giant that controls
networks across the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude may explain why the Germans have not tried to
challenge Vodafone's right to mount a hostile bid. There is no push
to restrict foreign takeovers. And, in a departure, neither the
government nor Germany's patrician financial institutions have
tried to protect Mannesmann by buying a friendly stake in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generates very emotional reactions among the people who
are affected, but it isn't a rational reaction,'' said Hans Georg
Crone-Erdmann, director of the Association of Chambers of Commerce
in Mannesmann's home state, North-Rhine Westphalia. ``When you see
which banks, insurers and chemical companies are merging across
national boundaries, then you know that these kinds of takeovers
are natural.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine two more different personalities
leading the campaigns. Gent, a gregarious and irreverent
51-year-old, is a magician at using the Vodafone stock as currency
for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, a methodical and phlegmatic 52-year-old lawyer who
studied business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
achieved his successes by taking a handful of shrewd, calculated
chances.
</P>
<P>
   But both have strong ambitions to expand their companies _
ambitions that were set on a collision course early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone already owned Britain's second-largest wireless phone
network and several stakes in wireless carriers around the world.
Mannesmann's crown jewel, meanwhile, was its controlling stake in
D-2, Germany's largest wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that when Mannesmann first applied for a wireless
license in 1989, the move seemed little more than a side bet.
``Most of the management was either skeptical or hostile,'' said
Peter Mihatch, who persuaded Mannesmann's chairman at the time,
Werner Dieter, to take the plunge and then ran the mobile-phone
unit until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, though, it was clear that Europe's digital
wireless telephones _ linked throughout the European Union by a
common technical standard called GSM _ would become a huge
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who was financial director of a Mannesmann engineering
unit at the time, played almost no role in Mannesmann's original
move into mobile phones. By the time he was elevated to chief
financial officer in 1994, though, he was convinced Mannesmann's
future lay in communications, rather than in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, Esser, who became chief executive last
May, orchestrated the sales of many older businesses and began
branching into new areas. He bought a 15 percent stake in Cegetel,
a French consortium led by Vivendi, that owned France's
second-largest mobile network. In 1997, Mannesmann expanded its
stake in Omnitel, the Italian mobile carrier owned by Olivetti, to
22 percent. And it started building fixed-line networks to compete
against Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It was in January 1999 that Esser began to regard Gent as a
threat. That was when Gent reached a deal to buy the big U.S.
wireless carrier AirTouch Communications for about $65 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Esser had no interest in the U.S. market. But AirTouch worried
him, because it owned 35 percent of the D-2 network and was a
partner in most other Mannesmann telecommunications ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had always had a close partnership with AirTouch,'' he said
recently. ``We both had a lot of respect for each other and would
never have considered a hostile takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fax to Gent on Jan. 7, 1999, Esser warned that an AirTouch
deal would create a ``conflict'' and that Gent ought to consult
with Mannesmann before proceeding. Gent did meet with Esser in
London eight days later _ the same day AirTouch agreed to
Vodafone's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, both executives saw opportunities to collaborate.
Mannesmann wanted access to the British market, while Gent sought
to expand his grip on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, both were wary about ceding control. Esser
said that Vodafone rebuffed his suggestions about Mannesmann taking
a ``meaningful stake'' in its British operation. And he grew
suspicious when, later in January, The Financial Times published a
gossip item that Vodafone was interested in buying Mannesmann _
though people close to Gent say he had no firm plans at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Esser was busy shoring up his own position around
Europe. In a coup last summer, he acquired control of the Omnitel
cellular network in Italy by supporting Olivetti's successful
takeover bid against Italy's dominant telephone company, Telecom
Italia.
</P>
<P>
   In that deal, Mannesmann agreed to buy Olivetti's stake in
Omnitel and a fledgling fixed-line phone service for $7.8 billion.
That cleared a regulatory path for Olivetti to win control of
Telecom Italia, which had its own mobile telephone business.
Suddenly, Mannesmann controlled wireless networks in Europe's two
biggest markets, Germany and Italy, in addition to a small stake in
the French wireless network SFR.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, Esser began a frontal assault on Vodafone in
Britain. ``We always made it clear that entering the United Kingdom
was one of our highest priorities,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Flying to Hong Kong in October, Esser hammered out a deal with
the Hong Kong holding company Hutchison Whampoa, the biggest
shareholder in Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest wireless
carrier. In October he said Mannesmann would acquire Orange for $33
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gent was outraged. He said he learned of the deal by reading
about it in a newspaper on Oct. 20 _ the day before he was
scheduled to meet Esser in Berlin to discuss further
``cooperation.'' Late that night, Esser called Gent to confirm the
news and to cancel the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gent hired Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to analyze a
possible run at Mannesmann. On Nov. 14, Gent announced Vodafone's
hostile takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two-and-a-half months later, people at both companies say
it is possible, though unlikely, that the two will reach a friendly
deal before next Monday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's main argument for a merger is that the combined company
would instantly form the world's dominant wireless carrier,
generating huge savings and having far more muscle to roll out new
technologies for high-speed data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Esser's counterargument is that Mannesmann already controls the
basis of a European platform. He dismisses the value of Vodafone's
American properties, noting that Vodafone cut a deal last year with
Bell Atlantic Corp. that left it with only a 45 percent stake in
those systems.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann also says that, unlike Vodafone, it has a growing
array of fixed-line fiber optic networks able to offer a full line
of high-speed data and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone says it can prevail simply by winning more than 50
percent of Mannesmann shares. Esser argues that Vodafone could be
blocked on key issues, which under British regulations might
include the forced sale of Orange, unless Vodafone buys out all
minority shareholders _ an expensive process that would require
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that U.S. institutional investors, which own about
20 percent of Mannesmann shares, appear overwhelmingly ready to
accept Vodafone's offer. ``The bottom line is that this would be a
global company on the first day,'' said Jo Oliver, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, German individual investors, who hold an estimated 10
percent of the company's shares, seem to support Mannesmann
overwhelmingly. German financial institutions, which own about 30
percent, are keeping quiet but are believed in most cases to lean
toward Mannesmann. The company can also count on support from
Hutchison Whampoa, which owns 10 percent of its stock, a result of
the Orange deal.
</P>
<P>
   In short, many analysts see the contest as too close to call.
But not all analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, our official view was that it was a 50-50
race,'' said Frank Rothauge, senior telecommunications analyst at
Sal. Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. in Frankfurt. ``But I now believe that
Mannesmann has a slightly better chance than Vodafone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothauge said European institutions were concerned that shares
of a new Mannesmann would not remain part of the key European or
German benchmark indexes, since British companies _ outside
Europe's single-currency zone _ are not included. That could cause
investment funds based on those indexes to sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, the companies have not ruled out a
last-minute deal. But before that could happen, Esser or Gent would
have to make a decision neither has ever made before: to give up
control.

   The argument in the control room was subtle, but not trivial.
Did the actor on the video screen grunt? Or did he clear his
throat? Or did he grunt in the process of clearing his throat?
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we trying to get across here?'' asked Chris Kallet, a
training supervisor at VITAC of Canonsburg, Pa., 20 miles southwest
of Pittsburgh, one of the top three television captioning companies
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A trainee answered, ``More or less, he's just getting a little
emphatic about having just won a bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hutchins, a VITAC executive, stood to the side and watched
as the captioners replayed over and over a few frames of the video.
``This may never come up again,'' Hutchins explained. ``You can't
make a rule out of it and say when somebody goes, `Uhmmmm,' here's
what you write. But what you can say is, `What did we get as
hearing people?'''
</P>
<P>
   So goes the work of the nation's captioners. They are a busy
breed these days. Once used only to help the deaf and those with
partial hearing loss, captions are increasingly ubiquitous, with
advertisers and television networks recognizing their value. More
and more, they are appearing on screens in places like sports bars,
health clubs and offices, where the audio would be distracting or
difficult to hear. They are also being used to help teach the
English language.
</P>
<P>
   Captioning got a jump-start a few years ago when the Federal
Communications Commission, seeking to help those with hearing loss,
set a schedule mandating that captioning be phased in for most
television programming by 2006. But the major broadcasters and some
cable companies are well ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So there is plenty of work for companies like VITAC and
captioners like VITAC's Marla M. Lahr, who must combine the
quickness and ear of a stenographer with the nerves of an
air-traffic controller.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of captioning. One is offline captioning,
done by fast typists who work on taped programs, using standard PC
keyboards and professional video editing software.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahr, initially trained as a court reporter, does ``real
time captioning'' for live programming. This requires the speed
made possible by a 22-key stenography machine and the skills to
break a stream of speech into the basic sounds of language, like
the ``buh om buh'' that make up the the word ``bomb'').
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahr has one shot to get it right and must maintain a pace
that keeps the transcript no more than an echo away from the
action. Though a script is often delivered beforehand _ the same
one that prompts the on-air talent, like a news anchor _ the actual
dialogue often deviates, and there are always unscripted segments.
Ms. Lahr has to recognize what is new, transcribe it and send it
instead of the scripted material.
</P>
<P>
   VITAC has to make significant changes in technique before court
reporters can go on the air as captioners. ``There's a certain
pathology to the process that we recognize,'' Hutchins said. ``A
young lady will come in here, pretty good court reporter, very
confident about her abilities, excited that she's going to get into
captioning, and she will begin the training process very fired up,
excited. Generally we know that in two to four weeks that she is
going to be walking around with stooped shoulders, totally
dejected, feeling like, `I'll never get this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A court reporter _ responsible for a more limited vocabulary and
in most cases unconcerned with context _ can concentrate on speed
and clean up the transcript later. Real-time captioners, on the
other hand, must be aware of context _ should they use ``there'' or
``their''? _ and may have to write on subjects ranging from war to
baseball and are constantly making decisions about what they are
sending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Izmit the name of a town or a person, or something else?''
Hutchins asked an imagined captioner. ``Is Izmit the name of a
seismic registry system? If you don't have a clue, you don't even
know where to begin looking for the answers as to how to make that
caption more accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at VITAC talk a lot about making captions accurate.
Twenty years ago, the emphasis was on getting captions into the
video signal. The first captioning agency, the Caption Center, was
established in 1971 at WGBH, the Boston public station.
</P>
<P>
   It began by providing open captioned (visible by all who tuned
in) rebroadcasts of ``The French Chef'' with Julia Child and the
ABC News programs. The center, now part of a larger body, the
CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media, worked with ABC, the
FCC, advocacy groups and technology providers to develop the
current system of closed captioning. In 1979, the FCC formed the
National Captioning Institute as a nonprofit provider of
closed-captioning programming.
</P>
<P>
   Newer, for-profit companies like VITAC, which is announcing a
merger Monday with the court reporting company LegaLink, Media
Captioning Services of Carlsbad, Calif., and others have since
entered the market. They compete with the Caption Center and the
National Captioning Institute for the federal grants and
advertising dollars that pay for captioning.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Feinberg, director of marketing services for the captioning
institute, said the first closed-captioned programming was
broadcast by three stations on March 16, 1980: the Sunday night
movie on ABC, ``The Wonderful World of Disney'' on NBC and
``Masterpiece Theater'' on PBS. Only viewers with decoders, which
had just become available, could view the captions. A decade later,
federal law mandated that closed-captioning decoders be built into
most televisions produced for the American market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although the amount of captioned programming has grown immensely
the last two decades and the technology involved has advanced, the
human talent needed for the job has remained a constant.
</P>
<P>
   A real-time captioner has to keep cool under all circumstances,
from tragedy to comedy. At the 1988 Republican National Convention,
Hutchins recalled, an anchor asked a nearby delegate what he
thought of George Bush's choice of a running mate, Dan Quayle. The
delegate answered that where he came from ``we shoot quail.'' The
whole captioning team was in stitches, including Marty Block, now
an officer at VITAC, who was doing the captions and managed to hold
on even though he could barely control his fingers for a few
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The other extreme is captioning tragedies. Concentrating on such
live coverage as the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and John
F. Kennedy Jr. was difficult for the captioners at VITAC, Hutchins
said, because the emotional elements were distracting.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday evening, Ms. Lahr took a turn captioning
CNN's Headline News at the 5 p.m. return from a commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   She tapped a pedal with her right foot to send the script, as
she heard it, one line at a time, and she read ahead in the preview
screen to determine when she would need to transcribe. Even as she
tapped the pedal, her fingers danced, in coordinated motions,
pulsing the air over her steno keys. They need to descend a nearly
imperceptible amount to take over the writing. Her transitions are
seamless.
</P>
<P>
   It was a virtuoso performance, the stress of which was belied by
her dry brow. The only hint at what it took to accomplish was her
comment during a commercial break: ``Whew, only three more
half-hours left.'' &QL;

PATENTS: WALLS THAT GLOW IN THE DARK; LIGHT-EMITTING CHIP FOR
LAPTOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Thomas Edison. George Mueller and Ihor Lys have seen
the future of lighting, and it has nothing to do with light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, 29, and Lys, 30, this month received a patent digital
lighting technology that they contend may ultimately replace the
conventional lighting that's been around in one form or another _
from incandescent to halogen _ for over a century.
</P>
<P>
   Their fledgling Boston-based company, Color Kinetics, which just
received $13 million in financing from investors that include
Deutsche Bank, imagines that one day ordinary houses will be
equipped with digital lighting. Such illumination might instantly
change the hue of a wall, from muted eggshell to splashy pigments
throbbing chromatically to the beat of Beck or Bach or whatever
music happens to be playing.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is based on light-emitting diodes _ or LEDs,
those tiny little lights that have been around since the 1960s as
indicators on electronic circuits and stereos. Essentially, the
inventors have bunched many diodes together for a new type of color
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LEDs are very very small and you can package them into any
conceivable two-dimensional shape,'' said Kevin Dowling, Color
Kinetics' director of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   LEDs are semiconductor devices that light up when an electrical
current passes through them. They have become brighter and brighter
over the last 10 years, according to Dowling.
</P>
<P>
   And even more important for Mueller and Lys, in the mid-1990s a
Japanese inventor figured out how to make a blue LED _ thus
completing the elemental light palette of reds, greens and blues
that, when mixed together in different intensities, yields nearly
any color of light that the human eye can detect.
</P>
<P>
   The new patent covers microprocessor-controlled LEDs used for
lighting and display purposes. Examples can be viewed at the
company's Web site, www.colorkinetics.com.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is very different from the traditional method of
creating colored light, which is to put a filter or gel in front of
a white-light source so that only certain colors of the spectrum
shine through.
</P>
<P>
   While the patent was pending, Color Kinetics had already been
selling products. Its lighting is used primarily for commercial
purposes, such as large displays in department stores. But Mueller,
who is the company's chief executive, contends that the technology
enables ``virtually unlimited applications'' far beyond the
products that the company currently sells.
</P>
<P>
   The company cites other advantages to its LED lights. For one
thing, they emit no ultraviolet light, so they will not fade
fabrics or artwork. And LEDs are a a very low-temperature light
source, so they won't burn the skin if touched.
</P>
<P>
   So how many people does it take to change a Color Kinetics light
fixture? None, according to the company _ at least for 11 years.
That is how long Color Kinetics contends that it takes the LEDs to
burn out _ and then only if they have been running continuously 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and Lys received patent 6,016,038, which was assigned to
Color Kinetics.
</P>
<P>
   A Light-Emitting Chip for Small Computers
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lepselter has patented a self-illuminating semiconductor
chip _ a breakthrough that he contends could be used to manufacture
laptop computers that sell for as little as $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forever have been trying to get light out of silicon,
but they've only been able to get minuscule amounts of light,''
said Lepselter, who holds 55 patents and is a former director of
the semiconductor division at AT&AMP;T/Bell Labs.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to do so, he said, by inserting more than a million
miniature fluorescent tubes, each grouped into triads of red, green
and blue, with each triad acting like a tiny color pixel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a myriad of microscopic fluorescent bulbs that shine
out through the cover of a chip's package,'' Lepselter said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a liquid crystal display, or LCD, Lepselter's invention
is a plasma display _ albeit a miniature one that relies on a
technology very different from the plasma displays already found in
large flat-panel screens. Plasma displays require no independent
source of lighting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, according to Lepselter, his technology could be
used to build a laptop computer that consists of little more than a
keyboard and an eye piece that resembles those found on
stereopticons _ those old-fashioned viewers that create a 3-D
illusion with stereo images of a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer user leans into the eye piece, ``he will see
the equivalent of a large screen because the eye becomes part of
the optical circuit,'' Lepselter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other tiny little displays in existence, most of
them using LCDs,'' Lepselter said. ``But nobody has made a small
plasma display.''
</P>
<P>
   The same technology could be used for many inexpensive
electronic devices, from video conferencing devices to virtual
reality eyepieces, according to Lepselter.
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,990,620, which he plans to license through
his company, BTL Fellows, Inc., based in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent

LEWIS NOT ON THE AGENDA (YET) AS TYSON PONDERS HIS FUTURE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ A few minutes after he had dispatched
Julius Francis with a technical knockout in the second round, Mike
Tyson returned to the center of the same ring here at the MEN Arena
for a press conference. It was the perfect setting, because he
looks very much at ease there.
</P>
<P>
   There was no snarling, no gloating. There was no overwhelming
appearance of joy, either. It seemed like just another day at the
office for Tyson, who knocked Francis down five times before
referee Roy Francis stopped the bout at 1 minute 3 seconds of the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed all in black, Tyson mopped sweat from his brow
occasionally as he dissected his victory over the hapless British
heavyweight champion. He thanked the British fans for their
hospitality and held out the possibility that he will fight here
again. Tyson shed little light on his future other than to say that
he would like to fight within six weeks, and possibly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But before anybody pronounces him the Tyson of old, Tyson
himself knows the difference. ``I've got a ways to go,'' he said.
``I'm trying to get better and cultivate my skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Francis (21-8) was completely overwhelmed by Tyson
(47-3), the former undisputed heavyweight champion got hit a lot.
He was moving his head and making himself a difficult target to
track, but at one point Francis nailed Tyson with a stiff jab that
seem to keep him at bay momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me, but I'm still here,'' Tyson said. ``We're in the
hurt business. If you're not prepared to get hit, you shouldn't
step in the ring. I really didn't know what to expect from him. I
was in a real determined mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis lacked the skills and the means to keep Tyson off him
and eventually Tyson's work to the body (Francis was dropped by two
body shots) did Francis in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried, man,'' Francis said. ``He's a good puncher. Everybody
knows he's a great boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Francis, 35, to do any better than he did. And
he did come to fight. He did not run away from Tyson and make it a
horrible match. But he was not even in the same class with Tyson
who is struggling to get his confidence back. When asked whether he
needed to step up to a higher level of opponent or fight more
consistently to get his confidence back Tyson said, ``Yeah, all of
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has a March 25 date to return to the ring. The opponent
will either be Shannon Briggs or Lou Savarese, who retired after
getting battered by Michael Grant in June. The sites being
discussed are the Meadowlands, Paris, Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's advisers let go a huge sigh of relief that this fight
did not dissolve into something bizarre. It was Tyson's cleanest
fight in his last three bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mood and spirits are better than they have been in a very
long time,'' said Jay Larkin, senior vice president of sports and
event programming at Showtime, which broadcasts Tyson's bouts. ``I
will tell you that getting his head in the right place is as
important as the amount of time he spends in the gym preparing for
a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and his advisors are at a crossroads. If his skills have
diminished to the level that he cannot handle top level competition
then they would risk his financial future by matching him against
someone who could beat him. But they must be careful to find
opponents the buying public will accept.
</P>
<P>
   They have some options: There are Zeljko Mavrovic and Vitali
Klitskcho, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion. They
can continue to have him fight in Europe and other foreign
countries where people will come out to see him simply because he
is Mike Tyson, the celebrity boxer, regardless of who he fights. Or
they can gradually step up the competition over the next two fights
and try to prepare Tyson for an eventual heavyweight championship
bout against Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are no guarantees that Lewis will have the
undisputed heavyweight championship by the time Tyson is ready to
fight him. Lewis will meet Michael Grant in April at Madison Square
Garden and no one is sure how that bout will end.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, Tyson and Lewis are not on a collision
course, because each man has an exclusive contract with rival cable
networks. Tyson is signed with Showtime and Lewis is signed with
Home Box Office.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said it is ridiculous for anyone to be talking about
Tyson and Lewis fighting. He mentioned the fact that HBO would
never allow Lewis to fight on a rival network, although Showtime
fighters (Evander Holyfield and Felix Trinidad) have fought on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they would allow Lennox to fight on Showtime, I'd love to
do the fight,'' Larkin said. ``But look at the history. Have you
ever seen that door open the other way? And it never will. The only
way it will happen is if Lennox goes to them and says make the
fight. Mike Tyson doesn't need Lennox Lewis. Lennox Lewis needs
Mike Tyson.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A SUPER ATTRACTION WITHOUT THE DYNASTIES HERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VESCEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the nice things about Super Bowl XXXIV was that
neither the St. Louis Rams nor the Tennessee Titans carried the
heavy weight of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed genuinely grateful to be part of the Super
Bowl, knowing that it might only come around once, and none of them
brought an attitude of ``been here, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the blessing of parity, of which the National Football
League can never get enough. The concept of parity comes off as a
goofy stereotype until Commissioner Paul Tagliabue starts talking
about how the league shares its network television money to level
the playing field for well-run organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Then along come the Rams and the Titans, two teams that made the
right choices of players and coaches in the short run, which is
really all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had never appeared in a Super Bowl, going back to the
Houston Oilers franchise that began in 1960. The Rams had made
their only appearance in a previous life in Los Angeles back in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   A number of franchises have given off the definite impression
that they belonged in the Super Bowl just about every year _ even
though their identities shifted over the years, from Dallas to San
Francisco, from Buffalo to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the biggest thing was how I always perceived teams who
made it to the Super Bowl,'' said Bruce Matthews of the Titans, in
his first Super Bowl after 17 years. ``I always thought they were
head and shoulders above other teams, or if I was ever going to be
on a Super Bowl team there would be no doubt in my mind that we
were going to make the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Matthews played on a transplanted team with an
excellent 13-3 won-lost record that survived the extra week of the
wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week our confidence grew, and I don't think until the
clock ran out in Jacksonville that I ever perceived ourselves as a
Super Bowl team,'' Matthews said. ``I think that's a quality in our
team that has helped us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bunch of hungry guys who haven't really accomplished
anything as far as a team goes in this league. We want to taste
that success. We're sick and tired of hearing, `You can't do this
and you can't do that,' and basically watching other teams in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time two franchises were in the Super Bowl for the
first time was in 1986, when the Chicago Bears and the New England
Patriots met. Leading up to that game, the Bears acted as if they
were good enough to blow away the Patriots, which is exactly what
they did, by a 46-10 score.
</P>
<P>
   This year both teams believed they were good. The Rams were
favored by roughly 7 points, and the Titans smarted a bit about
that, noting that they had already beaten the Rams, 24-21, this
season, and didn't that count for something?
</P>
<P>
   Both teams gave off the old sports cliche of just being happy to
be here.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Proehl, who caught the pass for the Rams' only touchdown
in the conference title game, said: ``I've been to every one since
I've been in the league. I come just because I'm a fan of the game.
It's just fun to come down and see a lot of the guys you play
against.'' Now he was getting paid to attend the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about it growing up playing football in the streets
with your friends,'' said Frank Wychek, the Tennessee receiver who
tossed the lateral for the game-winning touchdown in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm in my hotel room, I just think about what
is really happening this week. You have to stop and pinch yourself
because these things don't happen to guys like me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm enjoying every second of it. Just to play in the
game and set foot on the field is enough for me, but to do
something special in a game of this magnitude is just icing on the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of excitement even came from the two coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher of the Titans, who earned a ring with Chicago
although injured in the Bears' Super Bowl season, never lost his
poise in public this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil of the Rams had coached the Philadelphia Eagles in
the 1981 Super Bowl, and then left the business, citing the dreaded
``coach's burnout.'' He returned to coach the Rams three years ago
and has been generally upbeat in this sudden rush to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil did turn crabby when both teams were advised against
trying to get to the Georgia Dome for a practice last Saturday
because of the icy roads.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the nasty weather that produced an introverted
feeling of waiting for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no golf, no going around in shorts,'' noted Neil
O'Donnell, the Titans' backup quarterback, who played for
Pittsburgh in the 1996 game in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a focus, a looking forward to the game
itself. If this was to be their Super Bowl experience, they were
going to enjoy it.
</P>

GENE PROJECT YIELDS SPINOFF: DIGITAL ODOR SYNTHESIZER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Firestein is a biology professor who says he has a poor
sense of smell. But that has not stopped Firestein from becoming a
leading expert in the neurobiology of olfaction _ the science of
smelling. Nor has it stopped him from joining the corporate
advisory board of DigiScents, a privately held company dedicated to
bringing smells to computer games, Web pages and even movies.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents, based in Oakland, Calif., was founded a year ago by
Dexster Smith and Joel L. Bellenson, co-founders of DoubleTwist, a
biotechnology company whose gene-sequencing software is used by
Columbia University's biology department, where Firestein teaches.
</P>
<P>
   The company is creating a digital language for recording,
re-creating and transmitting fragrances, and is also preparing to
sell a small computer peripheral device, called the iSmell, that
would act as a personal scent synthesizer. When the device becomes
commercially available later this year, users will be able to
activate different combinations of chemicals on a scent palette, or
cartridge, to produce particular scents. Each palette will contain
more than 100 fragrances, each about as strong as an air freshener,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents officials say that just about any digital medium can
be fragrance enhanced in this manner. The company is also building
a registry of thousands of scents that developers can license.
</P>
<P>
   Recent olfactory research, combined with work on the
international Human Genome Project, has brought rapid advances,
Firestein said. (Of the more than 100,000 genes in human DNA, about
1,000 have something to do with the nose.)
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents is ``ideally positioned to work with the sort of
information that's about to pour out of the genome project,''
Firestein said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestein, who is periodically consulted by perfume companies as
well, acknowledges that adding scents to entertainment products
would not have been his first choice for commercializing olfactory
research, but he is enthusiastic nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more of a stick in the mud,'' Firestein said,
referring to the DigiScents executive team. ``But I've always
suspected that smelling is an undiscovered pleasure.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON'S NEW ELECTION-YEAR TACK TOWARD WORLD
TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ After seven years of pushing harder than
any other postwar president to expand trade between the United
States and the rest of the world, President Clinton told global
leaders here this weekend that the American people have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and society at large, despite a record-breaking
economic expansion built in part on an explosion of foreign trade,
have less enthusiasm for exchanging goods and services with the
world than they did when he first took office, Clinton said. If new
trade deals are going to get done, the world needs to reinvent the
way it thinks about trade and globalization to accommodate this
U.S. political reality.
</P>
<P>
   That message was delivered in an otherwise upbeat, even
passionate address to prime ministers, government officials and
chief executives of multinational companies who gathered at an
annual conference in this Alpine village to dream up ways of moving
globalization forward. Many of the people assembled here were eager
to put last year's collapse of world trade talks in Seattle behind
them. Clinton insisted that Seattle was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who heard a wake-up call in Seattle got the right
message,'' Clinton said. ``I do not agree with those who view with
contempt these new forces seeking to be heard in the global
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   These new voices, as anyone who watched or read about the
demonstrations in Seattle late last year knows, are labor unions
and an assortment of private groups known collectively as
nongovernment organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new trade policy has two big winners, and one is those
new voices from Seattle, who have been welcomed as partners in
setting trade policy. The other is his vice president, Al Gore, who
is running for president with Clinton's strong support.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and environmental groups are a core part of the
Democratic Party constituency. Unions, in particular, have a record
of rolling out reliable votes for their favored candidates. Those
votes could potentially make Gore a winner in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged in his speech here that the world stop thinking
about those groups and the causes they promote _ including workers'
rights and environmental protection _ as nuisances to trade. The
U.S. position, he said in effect, is that trade cannot become freer
unless those groups can be persuaded to like it.
</P>
<P>
   In saying this, Clinton shook a pillar of U.S. foreign policy.
The United States in the post-Cold War era has made trade perhaps
the most important tool for expanding its ties with other nations.
But by insisting on linking trade to labor and environmental
issues, he made it much less likely that the post-Seattle logjam on
trade will be broken while he is in office.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of developing countries, including India and China, are
about as passionate as Clinton when they insist on writing their
own labor and environmental laws and on not having such laws
decided in negotiations with rich countries. Even a hint that the
World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body that regulates
trade, might one day become an enforcer of U.S. standards on wages,
factory safety or industrial emissions has been a deal-breaker in
recent trade negotiations. There are few signs in the weeks since
the Seattle collapse that poor countries are rethinking that
stance.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Mexico, with which Clinton seven years ago
sealed the North American Free Trade Agreement, probably the most
dramatic market-opening measure in recent years, could hardly be
more emphatic in expressing a different view.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, also speaking at the World
Economic Forum here in Davos last week, delivered a sharply worded
attack on what he called ``very peculiar alliance of left and right
forces'' and ``self-appointed representatives of civil society.''
Those groups have hijacked global trade talks under the guise of
protecting the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be suspect of their motives,'' Zedillo said,
contending that Mexico is proof that old-style free trade works
wonders for developing countries. ``Serious efforts to liberalize
trade must not stop because a few people use fallacious arguments
as subterfuges for protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier about Clinton's speech this weekend, though,
than John J. Sweeney, the president of the powerful AFL-CIO, who
like Clinton attended this year's forum in Davos. During his
hourlong address here Saturday, Clinton referred to Sweeney by name
three times, more than he mentioned anyone else there. The audience
included several presidents and prime ministers, including those
from Turkey and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is firmly committed to making labor issues a
part of trade negotiations, and he did make that clear,'' Sweeney
said after the address. ``My reaction is very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials dispute the idea that the
president pushed for a more prominent place for labor and
environment on the world trade agenda solely to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not election year issues,'' said Charlene
Barshefsky, Clinton's top trade official. ``They reflect a change
in the body politic in general.''
</P>
<P>
   But few would dispute that Clinton shifted gears on trade at an
odd time. The president, for one, now has little time left in
office to make a substantially new approach to world trade stick,
even if other nations agree to start a broad dialogue on the
subject this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton has vowed to push through the
Republican-controlled Congress three big trade deals negotiated the
old way _ without unions and nongovernment organizations playing an
active role. Those trade deals involve Africa, Caribbean nations
and, perhaps most notably for U.S. foreign policy, China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's gamble seems to be that labor and
environmental groups might soften their opposition to pending trade
agreements in return for a bigger voice in future ones. But it is a
risky bet. Opponents of the China trade package, for instance, are
already arguing that Clinton's new embrace of labor and
environmental standards perfectly illustrates why Congress should
vote no when presented with trade deals that do not do much to
advance those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the odds, Clinton said in his speech, people who favor
freer trade have no choice now but to open the door to those new
voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we deny this,'' he said, ``the more we will fuel the
fires of protectionism, not put them out.''

NEW MESSAGES FOR A NEW, RICHER NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.H., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ To the naked eye New Hampshire looks
unchanging.
</P>
<P>
   Quaint village streets are still lined with white-spired
churches and jumbled general stores, blank-windowed mill buildings
remain along the Merrimack River, highway signs still warn of moose
crossings not far north of Manchester. In thrifty and rock-ribbed
New Hampshire, people do not brave snowy streets in trendy
sport-utility vehicles, they just put chains on the tires of their
Ford sedans.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire has changed as much as any state in the nation
in the last 10 years. A financial basket case in the early 1990s,
the state is booming, with unemployment rates far lower than the
national average, and job growth and income levels far higher. It
is not simply that the economy is better, it is profoundly
different than it was eight or even four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shaggy men in plaid shirts and suspenders still roam the
streets, but they are less likely to be loggers or mill workers
than computer jockeys (and they have the body piercings to prove
it). Many have come from elsewhere, particularly Massachusetts, to
work in a high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   State officials boast that they have the highest concentration
of technology workers in the country _ 82 out of every 1,000
workers in the private sector. High-tech services employ about 7
percent of New Hampshire workers _ far above the national average
of about 4 percent _ and that does not include all the people who
live in the state but work at technology companies in
Massachusetts. Payrolls at some high-tech companies grew by almost
$1 billion between 1995 and 1998, according to state data.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how these changes will be reflected in the
presidential primaries. And analysts remain unsure whether the
newcomers will change New Hampshire politics, or if New Hampshire
will change them.
</P>
<P>
   But high-tech workers elsewhere have traditionally avoided
joining political parties, and that seems to be the case in New
Hampshire. Since 1996, the percentage of independent voters has
risen from 28 percent of the electorate to 37 percent and they now
outnumber either Democrats or Republicans, according the New
Hampshire Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bennett, president of the American Research Group, a New
Hampshire polling operation, said the newcomers do not seem engaged
by national politics, although they have started participating in
local politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially with high-tech people,'' Bennett said, ``they think
government systems are antiquated and unresponsive, a bad
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But independents are expected to play an important role in the
New Hampshire primary. Residents do not need a political
affiliation to vote in a party's primary and polls show independent
voters are split between the insurgent candidates in each party,
Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was only eight years ago that James Carville, Bill Clinton's
chief political strategist, set the theme for the campaign with the
phrase, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Anyone who made such a remark
today ``belongs in a mental health institution,'' said Steve
Duprey, the state Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 46,000 people were looking for work; today, the number
is under 19,000. Back then, the unemployment rate was 7.5 percent;
now, it is 2.5 percent, well below the national average of 4.1
percent. Per capita income has risen by almost a third, and, in
1998, housing prices finally recovered all the value they had lost
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan, who won the state Republican primary in 1996,
would probably not find much support for protectionist philosophy
now, local officials say. New Hampshire is sending 70 percent more
products overseas than it was five years ago. More than half of its
roughly $2 billion in exports are related to computers, electronics
and industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, during the worst of the economic decline, the state's
population fell as blue-collar workers, in particular, fled. But
New Hampshire's population has been growing rapidly, especially in
the two counties just north of Boston along the Massachusetts
border. Between 1993 and 1998, even with some workers still
leaving, the two counties, Hillsborough and Rockingham, grew by
43,000 people, or about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 percent of those who live in New Hampshire were born
there, said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth.
The people moving in, especially those from Massachusetts, are
richer than those who are leaving, according to data from Regional
Financial Associates, an economics consulting firm in West Chester,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by a high quality of life and the lowest taxes in the
nation, many of them are bringing their businesses with them, or
starting new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the people much more cooperative for starting a
business here than in Massachusetts,'' said Robert D. Thompson, who
moved from Massachusetts about a year ago to start his own
biochemical engineering business in Manchester. ``The cost of
living was attractive,'' and, he added, ``I couldn't have rented
the same space for so low in Massachusetts, at least nothing near
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But computer companies are not the only ones that have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the Boston mutual fund giant, employs more
than 2,000 people in New Hampshire. Wal-Mart, which opened its
first store in the state in 1991, is one of the state's largest
employers. A decade ago, construction and mining were among the New
Hampshire's top four industries; today, they have been replaced by
financial services and real estate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has benefited. Population is still
falling in New Hampshire's northern counties, which are also poorer
than the rest of the state. And prosperity has led to new problems
in New Hampshire. People worry about traffic, congestion and
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Health care topped the list of concerns among registered voters
questioned in a Dartmouth survey last fall, with 25 percent of
Republicans and 39 percent of Democrats calling it the most
important issue facing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even tax cuts are not as much in demand as they long had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican candidates are trying to appeal to voters by
promising to cut taxes,'' Ms. Fowler, of Dartmouth, said, ``but
they're not getting any traction.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are trying to adapt to the new New Hampshire. Now,
when they meet with New Hampshire business leaders, they are less
likely to discuss agricultural programs or defense spending and
more likely to give their views on taxing sales made over the
Internet. And Gov. George W. Bush's parents aren't the only
celebrities he has campaigned with here. Last month he drew a big
crowd in Manchester when he appeared with Jim Barksdale, the
founder of Netscape.

DEVILS' COACH FACES FINE OR SUSPENSION FOR THROWING BENCH ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing only once in 15 games, the Devils lost twice in two
nights over the weekend. One of their players was badly cut, and
Coach Robbie Ftorek may be fined or suspended for tossing a bench
onto the ice in the 3-1 loss on the road to the Detroit Red Wings
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek threw the bench because he was so incensed at the
officials for not calling a penalty against the Red Wings when Jay
Pandolfo was crashed into the end boards by Mathieu Dandenault. The
cuts to Pandolfo's forehead and face were so severe that he
required 84 stitches, mostly over his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost consciousness, but I knew I hit my head hard,''
Pandolfo said. ``I got the cut on my forehead for crashing against
the boards, but the rest is because someone's skate caught me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was falling on the ice behind Martin Brodeur's goal
from the check by Dandenault, Sergei Brylin of the Devils fell
backward over Pandolfo. Brylin's skate opened up the most dangerous
cut over Pandolfo's left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfo is almost certain to be placed on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League may take action against Ftorek as
early as Monday. One mitigating element for Ftorek is that he did
not toss the bench toward an official but threw it on the ice in a
moment of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek would not say whether he expected to be suspended for the
incident, but Ron Ego, the supervisor of officials at the game,
said a suspension for Ftorek was rather unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Devils interviewed about the incident put blame on
Ftorek for losing his cool in the game between the league's two
conference leaders. For a game of such significance, especially
since it was the teams' only meeting in the regular season, it
seemed peculiar that the league did not assign two referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Robbie; he's a fiery guy,'' defenseman Lyle
Odelein said. ``He was frustrated, we all were, that a player got
hurt like that and nobody did anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who is usually the most outspoken of all the
Devils, was visibly upset that there was no call on the play
involving Pandolfo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a democracy, but don't get me going,'' Holik
said. ``Don't get me to say anything. There is an unwritten rule
that players are not allowed to talk about officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek threw the bench to the delight of the sellout crowd
immediately after Kirk Maltby scored the third goal for the Red
Wings. It came with 6 minutes 44 seconds left in the period in the
same sequence during which Pandolfo got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The moment drew more laughs from the crowd when it was announced
that the Devils were assessed a bench minor.

new Procter &AMP; Gamble hair care line, have determined that both men
and women are influenced by ``bad hair days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more fascinating,'' said psychology and women's and
gender studies Professor  &UR; Marianne LaFrance &LR; , ``is our finding that
individuals perceive their capabilities to be significantly lower
than others when experiencing bad hair.''

allergic to peanuts and vomited at the slightest smell of them? Do
you think that person could ever travel by plane?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total mindblower,'' writes Zeb. ``How could one go

   Vodafone-Vivendi Alliance Derails Mannesmann Plan
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone AirTouch of Britain announced that it had agreed to an
alliance with Vivendi of France. Whatever the other benefits to
Vodafone, the most immediate effect is to derail a plan by
Mannesmann, a Germany company that had planned to link with Vivendi
in hopes of thwarting Vodafone's $155 billion hostile takeover bid
for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, a major mobile phone company, and Vivendi, which owns
a 44 percent stake in the French mobile phone company Cegetel, said
they would develop an Internet portal accessible via computers,
mobile phones and cable television. The alliance is contingent upon
Vodafone's succeeding in its bid for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   New NatWest Bids Are Likely
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland are preparing to
increase their bids for National Westminster Bank, as the British
takeover battle nears its peak, people familiar with the plans
said. Royal Bank will have to pay at least another $3.2 billion to
top the $38.7 billion that Bank of Scotland is offering for
NatWest, Britain's third-largest bank.

   Rules May Slow Investment in China
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government announced several new regulations last

   TV Captions for a Wider Audience
</P>
<P>
   Television captions, once used only to help the deaf and hard of
hearing, are becoming increasingly common, with advertisers and
television networks recognizing their value. They often appear on
screens in places like sports bars, health clubs and offices, where
the audio would be distracting or difficult to hear. Captioning got
a jump-start a few years ago when the Federal Communications
Commission set a schedule mandating that captioning be phased in
for most television programming by 2006. But the major broadcasters
and some cable companies are ahead of schedule.

used as indicators on electronic circuits and stereos. Essentially,
the inventors have bunched many diodes together for a new type of

WEB HACKERS IN JAPAN DENOUNCE RAPE OF NANJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Internet hackers posted messages on the Web site of
Japan's postal service Sunday criticizing this country's wartime
role in China in the 1930s, as a series of similar attacks over the
last week began to look like a daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 government agencies here have been attacked by the
hackers. In each incident, they have denounced Japan's involvement
in the so-called Nanjing Massacre, or Rape of Nanking, the
murderous 1937 sacking of that city by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
   The security breaches, which have affected the Science and
Technology Agency, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Japan, the
Finance Ministry and the Defense Ministry, among others, have
deeply embarrassed the Japanese government, which has rushed to set
up a task force to catch the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Perceiving that it lags behind the United States in Internet
technologies, the Japanese government has been pushing use of the
Web for government information and services as a top priority. But
after the recent incidents, many commentators here have said that
Internet security seems to have been something of an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have also served to keep attention focused on
Japan's wartime role, a source of continuing tension between Japan
and China and other Asian nations that were occupied by Japanese
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over Japan's wartime atrocities were revived last week
when nationalist groups held a conference in Osaka at which
revisionist historians and others gave speeches denying that there
had been any large-scale massacre at Nanjing and disparaging
Japan's critics.
</P>
<P>
   China criticized Japan bitterly for the conference, warning that
it would oppose Osaka's bid to be the host city for the Olympics
unless the Japanese government took action against similar
conferences in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has said that it
would be an infringement of free speech to prevent people from
holding conferences on controversial subjects, but it has called
the Nanjing Massacre a regrettable fact of history.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional historical accounts of the December 1937 attack on
Nanjing hold that the Japanese occupiers killed 60,000 to 300,000
people, including thousands of civilians and prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Internet attacks Sunday, a message in English
holding Japan responsible for the Nanjing killings appeared as a
Web page added to the site of the Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry in Naha, the capital of Okinawa province.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hackers inserted an image of a Japanese flag and a
Chinese message in red characters, including the phrase ``Tokyo
Massacre,'' on the site of the Government Data Research Center in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, a Web site of a nonprofit organization
affiliated with the prime minister's office was attacked with a
similar message.
</P>
<P>
   Another attack erased most of the contents of the Web site
operated by the National Personnel Authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Web site of the Bank of Japan was attacked at
least 1,600 times by hackers, said a bank spokesman, Satoru
Yamadera.

SPORTS COLUMN: A NEW SUNRISE FOR THE ORIGINAL T.D. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every Super Bowl has an X-factor; a play, a player or
a happening that emerges from the shadows to alter the course of
the glitter-drenched championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Miami, the X-factor turned out to be an
off-the-field escapade involving Eugene Robinson, the Atlanta
Falcons' veteran safety and team leader, who was arrested for
soliciting a prostitute for $40 the night before the Super Bowl. A
year earlier it was Terrell Davis, who had a breakout game in a
breakout season. In Super Bowl XXXI there was Desmond Howard's punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV had a number of potential X-factors. There were
well-known X's like Rams quarterback Kurt Warner and running back
Marshall Faulk, Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair and running back
Eddie George. There were lesser known X-factors like London
Fletcher, the Rams 5-foot-11-inch linebacker, and Rams wide
receiver Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Dorsett was the X-factor waiting to happen. Dorsett,
26, is the Titans free safety who was suddenly thrust from his
special-teams role when he was forced to start for Marcus
Robertson, the Titans veteran free safety, who broke his laft ankle
in last Sunday's conference championship game. Dorsett's father is
Tony Dorsett, the Hall of Fame running back for the Dallas Cowboys
who played in two Super Bowls. The father-son angle became a
compelling story line this week with the young Hawk, as he is
called, asked to look at his celebrity father through a child's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night into early Sunday morning, Tony Dorsett put
aside the paternal feelings and looked at his son the way the Rams
would look at him: Like the hunter looks at the deer, like the lion
looks at the zebra.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at his son as prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was game-planning the Titans,'' Dorsett said, ``and I got
a young guy stepping in there, starting for the first time in the
biggest game of the year, I'd test him. I'd test him early, and I
might test him often until he gave me reason to say, `OK, he's
going to hold this down. We might be shooting some blanks thinking
that we're going to win this game going in that direction.' If he
steps up to the plate, that's fine; if he doesn't then they're
going to come at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett leaned forward in his chair. ``They want to see if he's
going to be out of position,'' he added, ``if he's done his
homework throughout the course of the week. They want to see if
he's going to be the weak link.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond discussing specifics of the game, Dorsett said he wanted
to make sure his son savored the moment. Throughout the week, Tony
Dorsett has tried to put the day, the game, the moment in
perspective for Anthony _ from the feeling of running out of the
tunnel to hearing the national anthem just before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett played in Super Bowl XII in 1978 when Dallas
defeated Denver, 27-10; he played in Super Bowl XIII when Dallas
lost to Pittsburgh, 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Anthony, think about this: I don't know who's
going to be introduced, offense or defense, but if they introduce
that defense, they're introducing you to the world,''' Dorsett
said. ``You got a big stage, a big platform to perform in. The
feeling that you're going to have is unexplainable, it is the best
feeling you're going to ever have, being introduced for a football
game, in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may come back, but you won't experience it like you're
going to experience it the first time. You ain't going to be able
to wait for that ball to be kicked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett and Dorsett look alike, wear the same number (33) on
their jersey. They are linked by blood and history but are
separated by age and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett was a hardened, seasoned veteran. A heralded
All-American at the University of Pittsburgh, Dorsett barreled into
the Cowboys organization as the second player chosen in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had leverage that he didn't have at this stage of the
game,'' Dorsett said. ``One thing I knew with the Cowboys was that
they needed me as much as I needed them. That was always my
mentality. I wasn't afraid. I wasn't the kind of guy who said, `I
need to be making more,' but was afraid to go ask for more, or
afraid to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, the Cowboys' all-time leading rusher with 12,036 yards
and No. 2 on the National Football League's all-time rushing list
with 12,739, was traded to Denver in 1988 after 11 seasons with
Dallas. He tore up his knee and retired in 1989. He wanted to
return to the Cowboys but the team signed Emmitt Smith instead.
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes do not get a second crack at the system. Now, Tony
Dorsett warns his son and his nephew, Ty Law, who is a cornerback
for the New England Patriots, not to get so blinded by the money
and the glitz that they lose track of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're becoming more aware of the business aspect of
what's at stake,'' Dorsett said. ``I'm sitting down with Anthony
and one of his teammates the other day, the kid asks, `What do you
think about what happened in Denver? It just came out that Terrell
Davis is going to have to come back next year and fight for his
job. Have to win his job back from a rookie.' I said, `That just
goes to show you where you're at: When you get some leverage, you
have to take advantage of it because you're just a number to them.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some numbers are more significant than others; no other
Dallas Cowboy player will wear Dorsett's No. 33. There is also the
magic of being able to play in two Super Bowls and have a son
become a central figure in a third.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Tony Dorsett said that win, lose or draw Sunday, he
would say he watched his son play in the game of both their lives.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a man who recently announced that he was
leaving public life, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was in the thick
of the fray last week, making a scathing case against Vice
President Al Gore and urging Sen. Bill Bradley to be more
aggressive in doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   It's just business, Kerrey insisted, nothing personal, noting
that he had made a point of shaking Gore's hand on the night of the
State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that it's politics,'' Kerrey said. ``He said
it's maddening sometimes, but it's part of the process.'' Kerrey, a
56-year-old Democrat, said he simply had to make a choice in the
race for the Democratic nomination. And, he added, ``I see in Bill
Bradley the most uncorruptible politician I've ever met _ and I
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is tempting to see Kerrey's impassioned campaigning in
New Hampshire as one more chapter in a long-running feud between
Bob Kerrey and Bill Clinton _ who, by the way, were bitter rivals
for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Kerrey insisted again. ``I don't dislike the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he did once describe Clinton as ``an unusually good liar,''
but ``that was in an interview, and frankly I didn't expect it to
get out, and that's my own fault.'' Loaded in the Lexis-Nexis data
banks, he said, ``It sounds like I'm saying it all the time,
because it appears _ and, by the way, it was in many people's minds
a pretty good description of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a deftly done dig-while-denying-personal-animus,
something of a Washington art form. In fact, at this Friday morning
interview, Kerrey did not seem like a burnout case, saying a weary
farewell to politics, even though he declared less than two weeks
ago, when he announced that he would not seek re-election, ``I have
a spiritual, interpersonal and creative cistern that needs to be
filled back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey sighed. ``That's an unfortunate statement. First of all,
I loved the misinterpretation that occurred early. Some thought I
said `sister,' not `cistern,' which is a whole subject all by
itself.'' But Freudian slips aside, he said that his was not a case
of spiritual death by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get spiritually hollowed out in politics,'' he said.
``It's not as a consequence of being in politics. This could happen
if I were in the restaurant business or a journalist. It happens to
people in all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began when the possibility of a job in the private sector
was floated _ the presidency of New School University, although the
university won't comment _ and Kerrey found that he ``got more
enthusiastic than I should have if I was committed to running for
re-election.'' So, he explained, ``I stepped back for a couple of
weeks, talked to lots of friends, especially in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   While the political world buzzed, he wrote two statements, one
saying he was returning to private life, the other saying he was
not. ``The first one made me smile, the second one didn't. And that
still, quiet voice said it's time to go back to private life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of public soul-searching that makes people
either love or hate Bob Kerrey, who acquired the nickname Cosmic
Bob years ago in Nebraska. A Navy Seal who won the Medal of Honor
and lost a leg in Vietnam, fighting a war he came to oppose, Kerrey
was a rising political star as the governor of Nebraska, then
announced he would serve just one term and returned to private
life.
</P>
<P>
   He re-emerged a few years later as senator from Nebraska, the
darling of the pundits and his party's bright hope; he jumped into
the race for the Democratic nomination in 1992 but faltered early.
He considered, but decided against, another presidential run this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As governor and across two terms in the Senate, Kerrey was often
the quintessential inner-directed politician _ not running when he
was expected to run, not following his party's marching orders,
immersed in his own political journey. Even now, while announcing
his retirement, he notes that he has not ruled out a return to
electoral politics in some future campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was the experience that framed his life _ he spent nine
months in a Navy hospital, trying to recover from his wounds _ and
over the years he has become a symbol of an era and the unending
reflection it spawned. Does he ever get tired of being asked about
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I get tired of it, but it's like getting tired
of trying to figure out who you are. You can't stop. It's not
something you can ever stop doing. I think it's dangerous to stop
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey has two grown children in Nebraska and a significant
other, the writer Sarah Paley, in New York. When asked what he was
looking forward to most about private life, he responded, ``You can
observe, you can see, you can hang out with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to be a little more concrete, he replied: ``I'll use a
New York City example. I'm on a subway, and I'm not a senator.
People will come up and talk to you differently. They don't come up
and say, `I didn't like that vote you cast.' Or `What the hell are
you doing out here, riding the subway? Don't you work?'''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on his talks with New School University,
saying that he had wanted to decide first whether to seek
re-election, and then figure out what to do instead.
</P>
<P>
   But he has clearly thought about life in New York. ``I do like
it,'' he said. But, he added, ``I think if I lived there I'd miss
the sunrise and the sunset and the direct sunlight. I'd need to get
out to the flatland, out to the prairie, from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he was back in New Hampshire this past weekend,
in the eye of the political hurricane he has decided to leave. For
now.

 &HT;     BUSH LIKENS McCAIN TAX PLAN TO CLINTON-GORE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Sunday challenged
the tax-cut plan of Republican rival John McCain, criticizing it as
a knockoff of the Clinton-Gore administration as he seeks to eke
out a victory in the hard-fought New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, acknowledging a ``healthy debate'' between the rivals for
the Republican presidential nomination over tax reduction, said his
$483 billion tax cut was far more distinctive than the $250 billion
tax break being offered by McCain, the senior senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for our party to nominate somebody
running for president who'll have a tax cut plan that stands in
stark contrast to the Clinton and Gore people _ not somebody who
sounds exactly like them,'' Bush told a packed campaign rally at a
high school in this southern New Hampshire community.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the GOP would need to ``draw clear distinctions'' over
taxes with the Democratic candidate so that ``the American people
will have a choice'' in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, McCain pressed his grass-roots crusade. He staged
his 114th question-and-answer session before more than 1,000 people
crowded into the three-story town hall in Peterborough, where he
had faced barely 40 people at the first such event last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator demanded that Bush telephone New York Gov.
George Pataki to clear the way for McCain to get on the statewide
ballot in New York's March 7 primary. And McCain insisted that he
would be a stronger challenger to the front-running Democrat, Vice
President Al Gore, because he alone favors overhauling campaign
financing practices that contributed to questionable donations to
the Clinton-Gore re-election drive in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced I can beat Al Gore like a drum,'' McCain said in
a nationally televised interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who leads in national polls, is no guaranteed winner in
Tuesday's primary. Surveys released on Sunday showed at least
one-third of likely voters still have not decided how they will
vote. Bush and McCain remain locked in a statistical dead heat,
with Bush pulling even with McCain with support from previously
undecided Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are competing in a GOP primary with three other
candidates who have never been elected to public office _ magazine
publisher Steve Forbes, talk show host Alan Keyes and former Reagan
administration official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave his campaign audience on Sunday a real stem-winder
after speaking briefly on Saturday at a campaign rally in Milford,
where his parents, former President George Bush and Barbara Bush,
joined him on the New Hampshire campaign trail for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor touted his family, plans for tax cuts,
strengthening the armed forces, bolstering education and extending
the American dream to people left behind amid prosperity.

   Bush vowed a ``positive and hopeful'' campaign against his
``worthwhile opponent'' in the days ahead. But the two-term Texas
governor drew contrasts with McCain, without ever naming his
63-year-old rival, a former Navy pilot who has served in the House
and Senate for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, appealed directly for voters' support both at the
outset and at the conclusion of his remarks. ``Today I am here to
ask for your vote,'' Bush said. ``I want your vote come Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal for support in remarks to more than 500 people packed
into a standing room-only rally was not enough to persuade Kathy
Cooper, 42, an engineer living in Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said just didn't do it for me,'' said Cooper, who said
she is a registered Republican torn between voting for Bush or
magazine publisher Steve Forbes. ``There was no chemistry there. By
Tuesday, I'll have to decide whether to vote my heart and support
Forbes _ or vote my brain and go with the man who looks like he'll
win the Republican nomination anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Cloutier, a woman in her 60s working part time to register
new voters in Hudson, said she expects a close race between Bush
and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a Bush supporter,'' Cloutier said with some
hesitation two days before voting. McCain ``might take it,''
though,'' Cloutier said, recalling that President Bush had an
uneven record in New Hampshire. ``George lost here too,'' Cloutier
remembered. ``Do you think history will repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush lost the New Hampshire primary to Ronald Reagan
in 1980. Bush lost the contest again in 1988, to Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, but recovered to win the GOP nomination and the presidency.
Bush won the GOP primary here in 1992. But the 37 percent showing
by challenger Patrick Buchanan was seen as a setback that critics
said weakened Bush and helped enable then-Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton to defeat him in 1992.

   McCain defended his $250 billion tax cut proposal in his
televised interview, saying that his more modest tax cut was
designed to reserve most of the federal budget surplus to bolster
middle-class entitlement programs, including Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   McCain echoed his subtle criticism of Bush in his television
appearance, saying that there is only one Republican in the race in
New Hampshire who is ``fully prepared'' to be president.'' McCain
added: ``These are all good people that are running, but I believe
I'm the person who can lead the country in this new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered, saying that his executive experience as a
governor of the nation's third most populous state would make for a
better president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not of the Washington scene. I'm not a committee
chairman,'' Bush said in a thinly veiled reference to McCain, who
is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.

   MOUNT GERLITZEN, Austria _ To many average Austrians, Joerg
Haider is that southern governor with the odd blend of liberal
spending plans and anti-immigrant sentiments that they might
quietly agree with but that they know look bad to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   To his local fans here, he is their maverick man shaking up the
fat cats in Vienna who for decades handed out jobs based on
political connections rather than brains or talent.
</P>
<P>
   To foreigners, he is that xenophobic Austrian who once said
several pro-Nazi things.
</P>
<P>
   For the 14 years of Haider's seemingly irresistible rise in the
politics of tranquil, prosperous Austria, these differences were
mostly a tempest in a schnapps cup. Now that his party looks set to
join Austria's government, Israel has threatened to break
diplomatic relations, and France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Italy _
in fact all of Austria's 14 partners in the European Union _ are
seriously alarmed and pondering retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the winners in the national elections in October, the
Social Democrats, have failed to form a government after three
months of bickering with their traditional partner, the
business-oriented People's Party, Haider is taking a crack at it.
</P>
<P>
   If he and the People's Party can find common ground, they will
have a 104-vote majority in the 183-seat Parliament, and squeeze
the Social Democrats out of power for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is up in arms, warning Austria's president, Thomas
Klestil, against allowing Haider's party into power and threatening
unspecified consequences. Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter based
in Vienna, warns of a ripple effect across Europe and of a drastic
decrease in the tourism and trade on which Austria depends for its
evident well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Haider favors shutting the door to new immigrants and preventing
the expansion of the European Union, which he says would mean a
flood of impoverished east Europeans into Austria, the union's
easternmost member.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's allies do not see this as anything to do with Nazism,
and seem deaf to accusations of racism. Haider's parents were
Nazis, of course, and he made some hasty remarks years ago about
Third Reich labor policies and the steadfastness of World War II
veterans, they say, but they were blown out of proportion and,
anyway, he apologized.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Haider was asked whether he was angry about the
foreign criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not angry, amused,'' he said. ``We're a small country, and a
small party inside it, and all the powerful leaders of the world
are afraid of our success fighting the rigid system in Austria.''

KNICKS BEAT THE KINGS AT THEIR OWN PLAYGROUND GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks fixed their attention on Sacramento's
pop-culture hit as he strutted onto the Madison Square Garden floor
with his power of illusion and sleight-of-hand to all but pull
quarters from behind their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams had the talent to use the Knicks as props for his
show. In a dizzying second, the fancy future of the league that is
embodied by the Williams-inspired Kings could have left the
buttoned-down Knicks looking as antiquated as a wagon wheel. But
completely out of character, the Knicks crossed the chalk line the
Kings drew on the asphalt and stepped into the lighter side of this
playground game Sunday afternoon. All of a sudden, the conservative
Charlie Ward was lofting a stream of alley-oop passes to a variety
of teammates, including one lob to a wide-eyed Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Camby leaped, reached and emphatically put down a dunk. Before
he came to earth, he swung on the rim and drew a technical foul for
his theatrics. For once, a Knick got a technical for overzealous
fun instead of out-of-control fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Coach Jeff Van Gundy was willing to let his
spirited players go free as long as they remembered one staple:
defense. The Knicks clamped down on the Kings in an overpowering
second quarter and built a stunning 24-point lead late in the
third. Soon, an exasperated Williams was ejected and a hot Chris
Webber got bogged down in foul trouble. Although they experienced
their habitual fourth-quarter meltdown, the Knicks muddled through
the anticlimactic end for a 120-111 victory after taking the Kings'
dare to play for style points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of West Coast basketball,'' said Latrell
Sprewell who dunked and drove and played unrestrained on his way to
matching his season high of 32 points. ``I felt at home. It was
fun. It's more of a playground style of basketball, and I think we
all enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks faced down the league's highest-scoring,
snazziest-passing team with their highest point total in two years.
But unlike the Kings, the Knicks had limits on the circus plays
they were willing to pull. On a breakaway in the third quarter,
Williams tossed a pass off the glass for Webber to turn into a
highlight dunk. Webber flubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd tried that?'' Sprewell said. ``Jeff would have had a
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks had not played defense, Van Gundy would have been
much more upset. The Knicks gave up 61 percent shooting in the
first quarter. Then the Knicks began to get back in transition and
hover around the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the second quarter the Knicks did not allow a
fast-break point and held the Kings to 33 percent shooting. With a
14-2 run and a 66-foot heave by Camby at the buzzer, the Knicks
led, 66-51, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a grade-school shot,'' said Camby, who leaped up over
the scorer's table and bounded into the locker room at the half.
``I'd never done that before. That was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   But luck had nothing to do with hard, aggressive defense. While
the Knicks continued to bang and shadow their men, the Kings gave
Allan Houston (28 points), Kurt Thomas (13 points) and Sprewell
precious open space. In a jump-shooting zone, the Knicks went on a
20-10 run to take a 24-point lead with 1 minute 31 seconds left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This nationally televised debacle was getting to Williams. The
kid from rural West Virginia _ a second-year player who had never
been to New York _ came unraveled under the bright lights of the
Garden with 11:15 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After Hue Hollins called him for traveling, Williams flung the
ball in frustration high into the air and behind the Knicks' bench.
Hollins slapped him for a technical foul. Nine seconds later,
Williams was guarding Ward, mumbling to himself and shaking his
head. What seemed harmless enough irritated Hollins, who tossed
Williams out of the game. Some Knick fans even booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say anything,'' said Williams, who finished with an
unspectacular 2-for-9 effort from the floor, 5 points, 12 assists
and 7 turnovers. ``I don't know what happened. Your guess is as
good mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Williams would have heated up. Perhaps Webber, who scored
19 of his 26 points in the first 20 minutes, would have gathered
some steam if he had been beside Williams. As it was, Coach Rick
Adelman had taken all of his starters out with the Knicks up by 22
points and 9:18 left. The Kings' second group preyed on a sudden
slump in the Knicks' aim _ 31 percent shooting in the fourth
quarter _ and took off on a 20-6 run. But after two missed jumpers
by Darrick Martin, and some timely free throws from a Knick team
that set a club record by hitting all 24 of its attempts, the
Knicks escaped disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in New York, when you beat a very good team, are you
asked about the fourth quarter,'' Van Gundy said. ``Let's not talk
about those first three quarters, let's get right to the
negativity. But you are right, it wasn't as good a finish as we
would have liked. We don't have the killer instinct, yet, with our
best players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' best side came out Sunday against an elite team. Not
only did they play well defensively when they had to, they opened
up their game and let the fun come out. They threw six alley-oop
passes just in the first half, Sprewell came up with a couple of
nifty driving dunks in the second, and Houston was automatic from
the perimeter all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that they are going to make some
spectacular plays,'' Houston said. ``It's fun to play them. We
weren't as concerned about making it spectacular _ although we had
fun, too _ but we knew we still had to work and get the win.''

<P>
   MOUNT GERLITZEN, Austria _ To many Austrians, Joerg Haider is
that southern governor with the odd blend of liberal spending plans
and anti-immigrant sentiments they might quietly agree with but
know look bad to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   To his local fans, he is their maverick man shaking up the fat
cats in Vienna who for decades handed out jobs based on political
connections rather than brains or talent.
</P>
<P>
   To foreigners, he is that xenophobic Austrian who once said
several pro-Nazi things.
</P>
<P>
   For the 14 years of Haider's seemingly irresistible rise in the
politics of tranquil, prosperous Austria, these differences were
mostly a tempest in a schnapps cup. Now that his party looks set to
join Austria's government, Israel has threatened to break
diplomatic relations and France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Italy _
in fact all of Austria's 14 partners in the European Union _ are
seriously alarmed and pondering retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Haider and his supporters are openly offended by the idea that
fellow Europeans would issue threats over an election result not to
their liking. But Saturday, they had other things to do at his 50th
birthday party, an all-day affair that moved from hut to hut on
this magnificent alp, with beery crowds of well-wishers at each
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The day culminated at the last chairlift in a trick-skiing
display, fireworks and the gift of a snowboard _ made, the emcee
proudly told Haider, right here in Carinthia, the southern Austrian
province that borders Italy and Slovenia. Carinthia is inordinately
proud of its tanned, athletic native son, who led his party to
second place in the national elections in October.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the winners, the Social Democrats who have been in
power continuously since 1970, have failed to form a government
after three months of bickering with their traditional partner, the
business-oriented People's Party, Haider is taking a crack at it.
</P>
<P>
   If he and the People's Party can find common ground, they will
have a 104-vote majority in the 183-seat Parliament, and squeeze
the Social Democrats out of power for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is up in arms, warning Austria's president, Thomas
Klestil, against allowing Haider's party into power and threatening
unspecified consequences. Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter based
in Vienna, warns of a ripple effect across Europe and of a drastic
decrease in the tourism and trade on which Austria depends for its
evident well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But Carinthia can hardly wait. At every stop on Haider's route _
followed by an entourage of skiing politicians, skiing spokesmen
and skiing cameramen (plus a few hapless hacks in street shoes who
had to stumble off the lifts and chase him on foot) _ was a table
with blue bottles of Bear Beer, made in nearby Villach. Blue is the
Freedom Party's color, and each had a happy bear named Joerg in
blue overalls on it.
</P>
<P>
   Next to them were free samples of a new Villach schnapps named
Stand Up, Little Man. It is a sexual double-entendre, but the
little man was also wearing a bow tie. That is the unmistakable
symbol of Wolfgang Schuessel, leader of the People's Party, who
invariably wears one in public.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, currently foreign minister, is now negotiating with
Haider over who will hold what roles in a joint government.
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to reassure the world that Haider will not be
a problem. ``I am the guarantor of Austria's stability,'' he has
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schuessel's convinced he'll tame Haider, but I'm convinced he
won't be able to,'' said Christa Zochling, author of a biography of
Haider. ``Schuessel thinks he's quick, intelligent and smooth, and
he is, but not enough. He won't tame him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This question of who is taming whom in this political dating
game is giving editorial cartoonists a field day. The front page of
the mass-circulation tabloid Kronen Zeitung has a drawing of
Schuessel in his briefs spraying on deodorant (his toilet kit has
little bow ties on it) while Haider waits in bed in a wig and blue
underwear. The caption is ``Fatal Attraction,'' a reference to the
movie where a man thinks he is seducing a woman and then sees her
nearly destroy his family.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly magazine News has Haider on the cover dangling
Schuessel as a marionette.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The subtext to the ``taming problem'' is this: Haider favors
shutting the door to new immigrants and preventing the expansion of
the European Union, which he says would mean a flood of
impoverished East Europeans into Austria, the union's easternmost
member.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's allies, and his ever-growing circle of voters, do not
see this as anything to do with Nazism, and seem deaf to
accusations of racism; they have simply voted out what they regard
as a cozy, corrupt bunch of politicians and replaced them with a
man who seems to offer a dynamic alternative. His parents were
Nazis, of course, and he made some hasty remarks years ago about
Third Reich labor policies and the steadfastness of World War II
veterans, they say, but the remarks were blown out of proportion
and, anyway, in November, he apologized.
</P>
<P>
   To Haider and his allies, the foreign criticism smells of panic
by Social Democratic governments around Europe that see one of
their own being shoved out of power, and a right-wing party
entering government at a moment when traditional conservatives are
riven by scandal in France and Germany, raising the specter that
right-wing parties there will emulate Haider's success.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Labor government is complaining because it hates to see
its leftist allies shoved out in Austria, contends Peter
Sichrovsky, a prominent Jewish member of Haider's party who wrote
``Born Guilty,'' a book of interviews with children of Nazis. ``But
they're speaking as Jews because they know it's more powerful that
way,'' he said. ``You'll notice Sharon's party is being very
careful.'' Ariel Sharon is the leader of the right-wing Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has even become a factor in the New York Senate race,
with Hillary Rodham Clinton releasing a letter asking people to
``express their concern'' that the Austrian might enter government
after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appeared on the same dais as Haider at
a Martin Luther King Jr. Day dinner. Giuliani's spokeswoman said
the mayor did not know that Haider would be there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At one of his ski stops Saturday, Haider was asked whether he
was angry about the foreign criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not angry, amused,'' he said. ``We're a small country, and a
small party inside it, and all the powerful leaders of the world
are afraid of our success fighting the rigid system in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might visit foreign leaders to reassure them, he

We'll convince them by doing and not by speaking.''

   In fact, Haider has made tours in the past _ to Israel, to New
York, to Washington to visit the Holocaust Museum and eat dinner
with the Congress on Racial Equality. But Hans Rauscher, a
political analyst for the daily Der Standard, says, ``He gets his
photo taken with a rabbi from some fake Jewish group, but he's not
connected where it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's supporters deny that he is even really a right-winger.
``Le Pen hates us,'' Sichrovsky said of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader
of the right-wing National Front in France. ``I wanted to throw Le
Pen out of the European Parliament for calling the Holocaust a
minor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And Georg Hoffman-Ostenhof, an analyst for the weekly news
magazine Profil, delves into psyche-probing to explain his worries
about Haider: ``I'd never say he's a Nazi, but he has the Nazi
views of his father in his background, and they inform him.''
Haider has called Churchill a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   He despises the Social Democrat-Christian Democrat split as a
Democratic/Republican or Labor/Tory political form imposed on
Austria by the Allies, Hoffman-Ostenhof said, adding: ``In 30 years
in politics, he makes pro-Nazi remarks every five years. It's not
by chance. It's inside him.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's fans consistently reject such analyses. They are not
Nazis, not anti-Semites and not racists, they contend; they just
find Austria's immigration laws absurdly liberal and threatening to
their high wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When foreigners come to Austria, they can say they have five
children in the old country and get money for them, even if it's
not true,'' said Sandro Vecellio, 26, the owner of Mad Mexx bar,
who was skiing with his bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Austrian, you need lots of papers to make a business,
but a foreigner only needs the papers he needs in his own
country,'' he said. ``Someone from another country can get
unemployment insurance here without having worked here. This
shouldn't be, and Haider's against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sickl, hostess at one stop on Haider's birthday trail,
says she would never be part of a party that did not share her
``humanist values.'' She joined Haider's party, she said, because
she was a teacher and could not get a principal's job without
joining one of the two governing parties. Since coming to power in
Carinthia, she said, Haider has introduced a merit system fair
enough to promote Social Democrats and even Slovenian nationalists
in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezing past them on her way out for some air was Claudia
Kohlweg, 24, one of the skiing bears who accompanied Haider from
stop to stop. Obviously, she was a merit selection, because few
people can ski with their head inside a big fur fishbowl. As it
happens, a cuddly brown bear is both Haider's party symbol and
Mount Gerlitzen's mascot. But, this ski teacher was asked, was she
a Haider voter?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she confessed, a little tentatively. ``My boss told me
to do this.''

U.N. FACES BIG CHALLENGE IN ANY CONGO PEACEKEEPING MISSION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an unusual meeting of African leaders and the Security
Council ended last week, there was general agreement that the
United Nations will have to be given a major role in bringing peace
to Congo. But when, and in what form, are still open questions that
are expected to dominate council discussions in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a former director of
U.N. peacekeeping, recommended that the Security Council, which has
already authorized sending 500 cease-fire monitors to Congo, add
5,537 troops. This would include infantry as well as medical,
communications, mine-clearance and air and water transportation
experts for a nearly roadless region. The start-up cost is
estimated at $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan said that 960,000 Congolese have been
displaced by the war and that they and another 300,000 refugees
from other wars in the region are dangerously short of food.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials say they see in Congo's complicated
war a challenge like no other that the organization has faced since
the Balkans disintegrated into ethnic warfare after the collapse of
European communism.
</P>
<P>
   Within the United Nations, even the word Congo has tragic
resonance. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold died on a Congo peace
mission in 1961 when his plane crashed in what is now Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the American representative, called the
unusual meeting of African presidents and ministers as January's
council president. He has been telling U.N. officials and members
of Congress that the Congo operation may be the United Nations'
last chance to prove it can get peacekeeping right. That was the
message he delivered directly to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on its recent field trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But other diplomats say that this assertion masks another
problem. Unless the United States allows the Security Council and
the U.N. peacekeeping department to mount a credible operation in
Congo, they say, the organization will be in danger of repeating
its experience in Somalia and Rwanda, two regional conflicts that
it proved unable to bring under control. .
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Rwanda, where a genocidal war in 1994 first
disrupted the region and drew Congo into the fighting, the United
States prevented the Security Council from acting for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke says that he is determined that this will not happen
again. But he also accepts that he has two huge tasks ahead. The
Clinton administration has agreed to give Congress 15 days notice
of Security Council resolutions creating U.N. peacekeeping
operations, for which the United States is billed more than 30
percent of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   So Holbrooke will have to persuade reluctant members of Congress
that skimping on Congo will lead to disaster. Congress already has
a law on the books saying that the United States will limit its
payments to 25 percent, and often balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Holbrooke has been urging African leaders, on
a trip there in December and in the Security Council in January, to
take more responsibility for the region. Without political will in
Africa, he tells them, nothing the United Nations tries can
possibly work. A few Africans left New York last week saying they
felt ``bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, African nations involved in the Congo war joined the
government of President Laurent Kabila in Lusaka, Zambia, where
they agreed on a peace accord. A month later they were all back at
war. By the fall, they were clamoring for international help, a
message delivered most bluntly last week by President Robert Mugabe
of Zimbabwe. He supports Kabila's government in its war with rebels
who are, in turn, backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In Security Council speeches last week, and in a statement of
purpose that followed the meetings, African leaders coupled their
calls for U.N. peacekeepers with new pledges to put their Lusaka
agreement into practice. Britain's representative, Sir Jeremy
Greenstock, welcomed African commitments to peace. But reflecting
the skepticism of many at the United Nations, he noted that the
world had been pleading with Africans for action for some time, but
``frankly, they weren't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   The deep divisions between Congo and its neighbors, evident even
in public speeches last week, were reportedly even more pronounced
in closed-door meetings among the African leaders, Annan and
American and other officials and diplomats. One Western official
said that by the end of the council deliberations Wednesday there
was ``blood on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Considerable attention was focused last week on Kabila, who made
his first trip to the United States and apparently went home less
convinced of American support for his enemies, Rwanda and Uganda.
Kabila's American public relations aides were elated with his trip
and say that he plans to return in May, hoping to talk with
American companies about more investment in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and American officials see hope in economic
pressures. All the nations involved in the Congo war are now
feeling the costs of that involvement and are looking for a way to
withdraw without a loss of dignity, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The political will to take that step, the secretary-general's
report says, is not only what matters most but is also the basic
condition for peace.

CONNECTICUT GETS DEFENSIVE IN SECOND HALF TO THWART SETON HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Upset by St. John's two weeks ago and
decisively beaten by Syracuse last Monday, sixth-ranked Connecticut
seemed vulnerable Sunday afternoon as it prepared to face a Seton
Hall team that had won 10 of its last 11 games. That one of Seton's
Hall victories by the Pirates came over St. John's, two days after
the Redmen had beaten the Huskies at home, appeared to enhance
Seton Hall's chances even further.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the first half at the Hartford Civic Center, it
appeared that UConn was indeed vulnerable. Seton Hall outplayed the
Huskies, mainly on the strength of the perimeter shooting of Darius
Lane, who connected on all five 3-point shots he took, and five
blocked shots by the 6-foot-11-inch freshman center, Samel
Dalembert, who had seven over all. But then a 3-point basket by
Albert Mouring put Connecticut ahead 25-24 with 8 minutes 35
seconds left in the half. UConn led at intermission, 36-32, and
never relinquished the lead en route to a 66-56 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we did a terrific job, especially in the second
half,'' Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Amaker, the third-year coach of Seton Hall (13-4 over all
and 5-2 in the Big East), agreed. ``They turned it up a notch
defensively in the second half,'' said Amaker, a defense-oriented
coach. ``And they defensed Lane much better in that half.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane is the Pirates' leading scorer, but the Huskies limited the
6-4 sophomore from Brooklyn Center, Minn. to only five shots in the
second half. He made only one of them, another 3-pointer with 6:02
left in the game, that enabled him to finish with a game-high 21
points. By then UConn (15-4, 4-3) had taken a 15-point lead, its
biggest of the game, before a crowd of 16,294.
</P>
<P>
   At least Lane scored. Connecticut effectively shut down Seton
Hall's second and third leading scorers, seniors Shaheen Holloway
and Rimas Kaukenas. Holloway, who had averaged 13.3 points through
the Pirates' first 16 games, made only four of 12 shots, but none
of six from 3-point range, to finish with 8 points, four in each
half. Kaukenas had an even worse time, getting off only six shots
and making just one, a layup with 4:45 remaining in the game. That
gave him 2 points, 10 below his average.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lane's success from 3-point range, Seton Hall _ which
had made 33 of 69 3-pointers (47.8 percent) in its last three games
_ lost its touch from the perimeter. Unable to work themselves
free, the Pirate shooters connected on only two of 11 3-point
attempts over the final 20 minutes to finish at eight for 22 on
perimeter shots.
</P>
<P>
   Besides intensifying its defensive pressure, Connecticut also
became more of an offensive force in the second half, making 45
percent of its shots.The point guard Khalid El-Amin made five of 13
from the field, including two 3-pointers, and all four of his free
throws to finish with 16 points. Jake Voskuhl, the 6-11 UConn
center, who scored a career-high 18 points in the loss to Syracuse
and whose effectiveness in the post has improved markedly in the
last two weeks, hit on four of five shots and all three free throws
to finish with 11 points. He also had with six rebounds, all on the
defensive end, and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Though Connecticut shot 42.3 percent as against 37.5 by Seton
Hall, the Huskies actually made only one more basket. But they went
to the free-throw line far more often, where they made 19 of 24
free throws compared with six of only 10 by Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strength and experience were big factors,'' Amaker said.
``And they're very strong and very physical. They're a very good
basketball team, while we need to be quicker and faster and
stronger.''

   PRIEST1: Hundreds of Roman Catholic priests across the United

   PRIEST2: The young men who went to St. Stanislaus Seminary near
Florissant, Mo., in the '60s answered a calling to serve God. Two
decades later, only seven of the 26 in the classes of '67 and '68
would be ordained. Three of the seven would die of AIDS. Critics
say St. Stans represents a missed opportunity to prevent the

   PRIEST3: A priest with AIDS is still a matter so sensitive that
it has yet to be fully addressed by the Roman Catholic Church, the
priests' families, or even the priests themselves. Solutions are
difficult to find. But experts say that until the church starts
encouraging a more healthy understanding of sexuality _ and less
secrecy _ priests will continue to die of AIDS. 60 inches.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were on the same platform on Saturday, George
Bush and George W. Bush, father and son, former president and
would-be president, plus the family matriarch, Barbara Bush, and
three of George W.'s four siblings, seeking votes in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   But you will incur the Bushes' wrath if you compare their family
to that other well-known American political clan, the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really irks me,'' the former president said the other
day, in one of the rare interviews he has given about his son the
presidential candidate. ``We're not like them. We don't do press
about everything, and we certainly don't see ourselves as a
dynasty. `D' and `L' _ those two words, dynasty and legacy _
irritate me. We don't feel entitled to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't talk about dynasties justified, maybe inevitable, he
was asked, with the eldest son, George W., the governor of Texas
who is running for president, and another son, Jeb, the governor of
Florida, both following in the footsteps of their father and their
grandfather, Prescott Bush, a longtime senator from Connecticut?
Particularly since there is a fair chance that George W. could
become the first presidential son since John Quincy Adams to enter
the White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of fellow was Quincy?'' the elder Bush replied,
taking refuge from a hard question in the kind of jokey banter that
characterizes the family. ``Was he an aristocrat, or was he as good
a guy as George?''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may be the candidate of the Republican regulars,
but he, too, disclaims dynastic credentials. In Midland, Texas,
where he grew up, he said in a separate interview, ``you were
judged apart from your pedigree _ Texas is like that.'' Yes, he
followed his father to Andover and Yale, the only Bush of his
generation to do so, but unlike his father, he was neither a
scholar nor an athlete, and he was a bit uncomfortable at both
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though he tapped his father's compendious mailing list for
donors, the younger Bush strives to send the message that his is a
Texas-based, not a Washington-based, campaign. He often wears
cowboy boots. He tells crowds in New Hampshire, ``my area code is
512, not 202'' _ Austin, that is, not Washington. And except for
foreign-policy advisers, he has staffed his campaign with Texans,
turning his back on many of his father's old aides and on the East
Coast establishment in general, which he has found socially and
intellectually pretentious since his student days.
</P>
<P>
   He tells friends that he would see himself as the outsider in a
contest with Vice President Al Gore this fall. It would be a good
ol' boy from Texas, he told one member of his inner circle, against
a golden boy from Washington, D.C., a graduate of San Jacinto
Junior High School in Midland against a graduate of preppy St.
Albans in Washington. Never mind Andover or Yale or Bush family
wealth dating back several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush father and Bush son speak of each other with immense
affection and with none of the edge that often mars relations
between generations. The former president said that the two had
``always been close, very, very close, though no closer than I was
to the rest of my kids.'' George W. said he was ``a proud son _ at
times an independent proud son, because he gave me the sense of
freedom to say what I want to say, along with unconditional love _
but always a proud son.''
</P>
<P>
   During his school days, the younger Bush recalled, his father
was often away on business trips, and his mother, Barbara, ``took
over as the front-line disciplinarian, and you know, she has a very
quick fuse, quick-burning, quick to forgive.'' Mrs. Bush was the
peacemaker who waded into the middle of fights between George W.
and Jeb and sorted them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was a matriarchal family,'' Jeb Bush once said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Minutaglio, a Texas journalist, in a biography of George W.
Bush, ``First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty''
(Times Books), writes that ``she was the one who spent most of the
time with her eldest child, the one known as the Little League mom
at every Midland Cubs game.'' She also passed along her habit of
plain and occasionally harsh speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more outgoing than I am,'' former President Bush
said. ``He's less constrained by convention _ maybe it's
generational, maybe it's Barbara _ but it's true, anyway. That's
one reason he's better at campaigning. I tend to keep things
inside. Get tense. He's more open and frank.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former president is clearly his son's hero, the
prototype of the Good Man about whom he often speaks. Some of the
jocularity, the needling and the sarcasm, goes out of George W.'s
voice when he speaks about his father, replaced by a quieter tone.
He is respectful, deferential, almost worshipful. He calls his
father ``a steady beacon of decency and honor'' who preached ``the
old rules, like keep your word and finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been around to play catch some nights, the
younger Bush said, ``but my father more or less invented quality
time.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, however, things grew tense between them.
Working one summer on a drilling rig in Louisiana, George W. left a
week earlier than he was supposed to, thinking no one would notice.
His father noticed. He called his errant offspring into his Houston
office and told him, as Minutaglio has written, ``I just want you
to know you have disappointed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the incident, George W. recalled: ``I was crushed.
Those are the toughest words a dad can say, `You disappointed me,
son.'''
</P>
<P>
   His father may have been disappointed at other times. Whereas
the former president had been a hero as a Navy pilot in World War
II, his son joined the Air National Guard at least in part to avoid
the Vietnam War. Whereas his father made millions in oil, George W.
made hundreds of thousands. Whereas his father won a seat in
Congress, George W. ran in 1978 in a tough district for Republicans
and lost. But the younger man never heard a word of chastisement.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some reports, the elder Bush said, he had almost
nothing to do with his son's decision to swear off alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him drink too many a time or two, and it wasn't a pretty
sight,'' Bush said of George W. But he said he could not recall
ever having mentioned it to his son or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give them leeway,'' the former president said. ``You put
your arm around them and tell them you love them, you pick them up
and dust them off when they fall down, but you don't try to manage
their lives.''

PRIEST1: DAY ONE OF PRIESTS SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Eds.: This is a retransmission.)
Hundreds of Roman Catholic priests across the United States have
died of AIDS-related illnesses, and hundreds more are living with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of AIDS deaths is difficult to determine. But
it appears priests are dying of AIDS at a rate at least four times
that of the general U.S. population, according to estimates from
medical experts and priests and an analysis of health statistics by
The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and Kansas alone, at least 16 priests and two
religious-order brothers have died of AIDS since early 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are of such concern to the church that most dioceses
and religious orders now require applicants for the priesthood to
take an HIV-antibody test before their ordination.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's 60 million Catholics, served by 46,000 priests,
the AIDS issue goes straight to the heart of church doctrine _ a
doctrine that teaches compassion and forgiveness but also considers
homosexual relations a sin and opposes the modern practice of
``safe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide confidential survey of 3,000 priests by The
Star, two-thirds of the more than 800 responding lauded the church
for being caring and compassionate to priests with AIDS. Often, the
church covers medical costs, gives them a place to live and cares
for them until they die.
</P>
<P>
   Most priests, however, said the church failed to offer an early
and effective sexual education that might have prevented infection
in the first place. Two-thirds said sexuality either was not
addressed at all or was not discussed adequately in the seminary.
Three of four said the church needed to offer more education about
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality still needs to be talked about and dealt with,''
said the Rev. Dennis Rausch, a priest with AIDS who runs an AIDS
ministry program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get into the seminary here for the last
several years to do an awareness course for the guys, so when they
come out, they at least have some knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the survey, which had a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points, include:
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 Roman Catholic priests in the United States know at
least one priest who died of an AIDS-related illness, and one-third
know a priest currently living with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those responding _ about 1 in 114 _ said they either
have HIV or AIDS or might have but haven't been tested. That would
translate into about 400 priests nationwide, an estimate supported
by members of the National Catholic AIDS Network. In the general
U.S. population, according to figures from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, between 1 in 300 and 1 in 420 people are
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Many priests and behavioral experts argue that the church's
adherence to 12th-century doctrine about the virtues of celibacy
and its teachings on homosexuality have contributed to the spread
of AIDS within the clergy. Unwittingly, the church has kept
fledgling priests _ some of whom were as young as 14 when they
entered seminary in the '60s and '70s _ uneducated about the
reality of a sexual world and its temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the
breaking of celibacy vows as shameful, the church has scared
priests into silence, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,''
said Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of
Detroit. ``Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to
handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would
handle it in ways that were not healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to
be celibate and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were
never really taught how to do. And that was a major failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic cardinals in the United States and high-ranking
church officials in Rome declined requests to discuss the issue or
the newspaper's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which has no policy on dealing with priests who
have AIDS, referred questions about the issue to local bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Raymond J. Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St.
Joseph in Missouri said the AIDS deaths show that priests are
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as we would regret it, it shows that human nature is
human nature,'' Boland said. ``And all of us are heirs to all of
the misfortunes that can be foisted upon the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Boland thinks church leaders now are doing a better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel today that a lot of our men get many opportunities _
the standard of spiritual direction, the standard of formation is
much higher,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the issue of AIDS deaths among priests has
been so sensitive that many of those who later died kept their
illnesses a secret. Some death certificates listed AIDS-related
conditions such as pneumocystis pneumonia but never mentioned the
disease itself. Other certificates were falsified.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church clearly is not alone. Clergy in other
denominations also struggle with sexuality and have died of AIDS.
But the Catholic Church's condemnation of homosexual acts, its
requirement that priests be male and its unique demand of celibacy
make the issue all the more vexing for its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very strong social implications behind this,''
said Robert Goss, a former Jesuit priest who is now chairman of the
Department of Religious Studies at Webster University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gays are in the priesthood, and not all of them are celibate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those issues are explosive issues that superiors and
bishops don't want to deal with publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss himself left the priesthood after 11 years when he fell in
love with a seminarian who was just shy of ordination. The two
became longtime partners. The former seminarian died of AIDS in
1992.

   That was the case with college, he added; each of his children
had gone to a different university. It also was the case with
politics; he insisted and George W. confirmed that the former
president had never urged any of his children either to run for
office or not to. A real patriarch, the younger Bush said, lays the
groundwork for his sons but his father never sought to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George W. said he has always suspected that when an old
friend of his father's, former Gov. Allen Shivers of Texas, came to
see him in 1978, just before the congressional race in West Texas,
his father was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Shivers told me I had no shot at winning,'' Governor
Bush said. ``He said the district wasn't ready for a Republican. I
ran anyway, ran a good campaign, and lost. But whether he sent
Shivers to see me or not, my dad clearly wasn't pulling strings,
trying to get me the seat.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as recently as the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, when strong stirrings of a George W. Bush
presidential candidacy began to be heard, his father told several
of his intimates that he was not sure that George W. would end up
running. Jeb Bush, he said at that time, might be a stronger
candidate, in some future election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Saturday's appearance, one of fewer than half a dozen he
has made this year, the elder Bush has also avoided trying to
stage-manage his son's presidential campaign. They talk often on
the phone, as often as three or four times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the ball's in his court,'' the former president said. ``I
don't want to be the hovering father here, like Joe Kennedy. When
we talk, it's more `How you doing,' `Don't let them worry you,'
that kind of thing. No pointers, nah. I'm in no position to tell
him to shift this policy or that. I can't tell you the fine points
of his health plan, or Clinton's.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush senior is intensely proud of his children. The day in 1998
when two sons were elected governor, one for the first time, one
for the second, ``was the happiest day of my life,'' he said,
``even happier than my wedding day, even happier than the day I was
elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, George W. has been his father's fiercest defender.
He knows the former president made mistakes in his unsuccessful
re-election bid; in an interview in 1994, he said that ``the big
lesson I learned in 1992 is that you can't rest on your laurels and
hope the voters will elect you out of gratitude.'' His father
should not have allowed Bill Clinton to set the terms of debate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he still thought his father deserved to win, and was deeply
hurt when he was beaten. Ever since, he has bitterly blamed Ross
Perot, the Texas maverick who ran as the Reform Party candidate,
for costing President Bush a second term.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush has a long memory. He has never forgotten, or
fully forgiven, a remark made to him in his undergraduate days by
William Sloane Coffin Jr., then chaplain at Yale, shortly after his
father lost a Senate race to Ralph W. Yarborough in 1964. Coffin, a
die-hard opponent of the Vietnam War, has since denied it, but Bush
distinctly recalls him saying: ``I know your father. Frankly, he
was beaten by a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   He resented Yale for waiting until 1991 to give his father an
honorary degree and resented even more the fact that Helen Whitney,
a maker of left-leaning documentary films, who is married to Benno
C. Schmidt Jr., then Yale's president, did not attend the reception
for his father.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the years he spent as an adviser to his father in the
White House, the younger Bush resented anyone on the staff, as he
said at the time, ``who gets confused about who is president and
who works for him.'' The extreme case, in his view, was John
Sununu, the chief of staff, and he played a major role in
persuading Sununu to resign. The younger Bush called himself ``the
enforcer.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can charm as well as browbeat, and last week Sununu, a
former governor of New Hampshire, endorsed him with the comment,
``I have never had a problem with any conversation I have had with
Governor Bush.''

BRADLEY AND MCCAIN COMPETE FOR INDEPENDENTS' VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE with ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Inside a VFW Hall in Franklin, N.H., Sunday
afternoon, it seemed like another routine campaign day for Sen.
John McCain. But as he was speaking inside, something far from
ordinary was happening outside: A cluster of Bill Bradley workers,
brandishing big blue signs for the Democrat, tried to drum up
support for their candidate from voters who had gathered to hear
McCain, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident. Katherine Soffer, a Bradley worker,
explained that the campaign's internal polling found that there
were ``quite a significant number of independents on the fence
between McCain and Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two days before the primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday,
Bradley and McCain are locked in an improbable struggle over a tiny
pool of truly independent voters who are allowed to cast ballots in
the Democratic or Republican contest and, it turns out, are torn
between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   It seems particularly unlikely because they are hardly political
lookalikes: Bradley does not wince when he is called a liberal.
McCain happily calls himself a conservative. But in the closing
stretch of the campaign, both candidates have intensified their
pitches to independent-minded voters by emphasizing their proposals
to reform the campaign finance system _ and by portraying
themselves as Washington iconoclasts.
</P>
<P>
   Such competition between candidates in different parties is
highly unusual and reflects, in part, an influx of new voters into
this state who are less rooted with one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for an unlikely scene on the campaign trail. An old
pick-up truck parked near a Bradley event in Concord Sunday had two
bumper stickers: One for Bradley and one for McCain. It was only
fitting that in between the stickers was a ``Live Free or Die''
license plate, reflecting the state slogan that celebrates New
Hampshire's maverick image.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 37 percent of registered voters in New Hampshire are not
affiliated with one party or another. But the majority of those
voters lean toward one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   So, says Andrew E. Smith, director of surveys for the University
of New Hampshire, McCain and Bradley are battling over three to
five percent of the voters who truly are open to jumping from one
party to another. That would amount to between 10,000 to 18,000
voters, depending on the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small group of people,'' Smith said. ``But in a close
race that can make a difference.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That helps explain why, at the VFW hall in Franklin Sunday,
Bradley's workers were encouraging people gathered to hear McCain
to also make their way to an event for Bradley's wife, Ernestine.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harris, a spokesman for McCain, was dismissive of the
Bradley interlopers. The only thing that worried him, he said, was
that ``they were taking up valuable real estate where I wanted to
put TV cameras.'' Even so, the episode underscored what appears to
be a determined drive by Bradley to pick off McCain's supporters.
It may stem from the fact that there are signs that McCain may be
winning over independents who had been leaning toward Bradley but
have soured on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a toss-up between the two,'' Smith said, ``they
seem to be going from Bradley to McCain _ not McCain to Bradley.''
As evidence, he cited a poll he conducted showing that more than 40
percent of undeclared voters who are leaning toward Bradley said
their second choice would be McCain. But among undeclared McCain
supporters, only 10 percent cited Bradley as their second choice.
The most popular second choice of those undeclared McCain
supporters was Gov. George W. Bush, who draws about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are clearly competing for the loyalties of this
small segment of voters. Bradley, for one, has broadcast a new
commercial declaring himself the only one of the seven candidates
(including five Republicans) who is a whole-hearted backer of
abortion rights. Had he intended the advertisement solely to draw
support from Vice President Al Gore, Bradley might have
specifically described himself as the Democrat who is reliable on
abortion. In another direct appeal for independents earlier last
week, Bradley appeared here with former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
of Connecticut, a Republican turned independent. He delivered an
unabashed plea for independent voters. ``They're not as important
as Democrats,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who was stumping
here Sunday for Bradley. ``But, obviously, independents are
enormously important.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that as Gore has pounded away at him, Bradley has
lost what has been a significant advantage over the vice president
for the support of independent voters. McCain, by contrast, still
maintains an edge over Bush for independents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush made a direct appeal for independents at a rally
Sunday afternoon at a high school in Hudson. ``It may shock some of
the independents here today,'' the governor said, ``to hear a
Republican talking about people living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said while his campaign
would not neglect independents altogether, he was most concerned
about those who lean toward the Republican Party _ not ones who
might vote for Bradley. ``There is a group of independents who, by
and large, tend to vote in Republican primaries and another group
of independents who tend to vote in the Democratic primary. And
there's not this swapping back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists argue that the battle between McCain and
Bradley is overstated. ``It's more like a beauty pageant than a
fight,'' said David Carney, a veteran Republican strategist here.
He said voters who were torn between the two contenders may go with
McCain because, polls show, he is in a tighter race than Bradley,
who has been sliding behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents always go where the most exciting contest, the
closest race, is,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   But in random interviews Sunday, several voters said they still
could not decide between Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the independents McCain and Bradley are fighting
over,'' said Tris Newbury, who is from Concord. ``They are both
very good about letting people know about where they are and what
they are doing _ and Gore and Bush really are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Deb Leahy, also from Concord, said she was also mulling over
McCain and Bradley. ``A lot of it has to do with more than
policy,'' she said. ``It has to do with what kind of people they
are. And both Bradley and McCain are good people.''

</P>
<P>
   ...former seminarian died of AIDS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several church leaders respond that the church is dealing with
the issue forthrightly. Any criticism, they say, must be tempered
by the realization that many priests wish to keep their medical
condition private, as do many AIDS sufferers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary education on sexuality has been slow to evolve, but so
has the acceptance of homosexuality and the understanding of AIDS
in the general population. Many of today's priests, whose average
age is about 60, entered the seminary in the 1960s, the age of
``free love'' and sexual experimentation _ not HIV awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The church hasn't abandoned its priests who have HIV or AIDS,
some say, and often celebrates their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are priests who are gay, there are priests with AIDS,
there are priests who are different that are doing wonderful
ministry,'' said the Rev. Jim Nickel, director of pastoral care for
Damien Ministries in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their frailties, no matter what their history,
no matter what their differences, there are people out there who
are making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many priests have died of AIDS or are infected with
HIV is unknown, in part because many suffer in solitude.
</P>
<P>
   When priests do tell their superiors, the cases generally are
handled quietly, either at the priests' requests or because church
officials are reluctant to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bishop Emerson J. Moore left the Archdiocese of New
York and went to Minnesota, where he died in a hospice of an
AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed his death to
``unknown natural causes'' and listed his occupation as ``laborer''
in the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a Minnesota AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials
changed the cause of death to ``HIV-related illness.'' The
occupation, however, has not been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Farley Cleghorn, an epidemiologist with the Institute of Human
Virology in Baltimore, said it was common practice with early cases
not to disclose AIDS as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priest that I saw with AIDS _ this was back in 1982
_ we did not put AIDS on the death certificate, because they wanted
us not to,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn said he has treated about 20 priests and
religious-order brothers with AIDS, all of whom had kept it a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church and religious orders need to acknowledge that there
is a problem _ that priests have sex and they are susceptible to
all sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important message is that, just like every
other part of the population, priests need sex education and sexual
disease prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, experts who counseled and treated priests
with AIDS estimated that about 200 in the United States either had
died of AIDS or had contracted the disease. Now, those who work
with infected priests say the numbers are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking several hundred,'' said the Rev. Jon Fuller, a
Jesuit priest and physician who serves as assistant director of
Boston Medical Center's Clinical AIDS Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Star alone _ through death certificates and interviews with
fellow priests and family members _ found information on about 100
priests who have died of AIDS nationwide since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And many priests and medical experts now agree that at least 300
priests have died. That translates into an annualized AIDS-related
death rate of about 4 per 10,000 _ four times that of the general
population's rate of roughly 1 per 10,000 and about double the
death rate of the adult male population.
</P>
<P>
   Other statistics and experts suggest that those estimates are
too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the annualized death rate of priests confirmed by
The Star to have died of AIDS in Kansas and Missouri from 1987 to
1999 is 7 per 10,000, or seven times that of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   That death rate is consistent with the rate calculated by The
Star after reviewing death certificates of priests who died in
California, Missouri and Massachusetts in 1995. The finding: six
priests _ or 7.3 per 10,000 _ died of AIDS in those combined states
that year. The AIDS death rate of the general population in those
three states in 1995 was 1.8 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Richard Sipe, a former priest who has spent more than 30
years studying sexuality issues in the church, thinks that about
750 priests nationwide have died of such illnesses. That would
translate into an AIDS-related death rate eight times that of the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Barone, a New Jersey psychiatrist and AIDS expert, puts
the number of U.S. priests who have died at 1,000 _ nearly 11 times
the rate of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Barone directed an AIDS ministry from 1983 to 1993 for students
at North American College in Rome. While there, he set up an
underground AIDS testing program. Over seven years, he tested
dozens of seminarians. Barone gave them false names, drove them to
their tests in an unmarked car and paid for the tests himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who they were; they didn't know who I was,''
Barone said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those he worked with, he said, 1 in 12 tested HIV-positive.
By the time Barone left Rome, he had treated about 80 priests with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is many of them have been so duplicitous and so
closeted,'' said Barone, a member of the National Catholic AIDS
Network. ``They didn't realize what they were doing, not only to
themselves, but to other individuals, because of the exponential
transmission rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Isola, a New York City social worker and
psychotherapist, said all the priests with AIDS that he has treated
are gay men in their 40s to early 60s who became infected through
same-sex relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them had sexual contact in the seminary which
continued after ordination, and some of the men had their first
sexual contact with other priests or with laymen after they were
ordained,'' Isola said.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of the priests responding to The Star's survey
described themselves as heterosexual, 15 percent said they were
homosexual and 5 percent bisexual. Estimates of the percentage of
homosexuals in the general population have been widely debated, but
those who conduct research on gays and lesbians say the figure is
between 5 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of education and inadequate preparation on sexual issues
continues to be a problem in the seminaries, many priests and
behavioral experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the great majority of the priests who take
that vow are really not developed enough psychosexually,'' Isola
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During seminary, the questions about sex or homosexuality or
sexual feelings were usually dealt with by the novicemaster or the
head of training saying, `If you say the Mass every day and say the
rosary every day, the rest of it will take care of itself,' which
for many of them just doesn't work.''

</P>
<P>
   From Oct. 15 through Oct. 21, 1999, The Kansas City Star mailed
a survey to 3,013 priests randomly selected from a list in the 1999
edition of The Official Catholic Directory. Surveys were sent to
priests in all 50 states and all but one diocese in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Star received responses from 801 priests through December, a
response rate of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sample size, the poll's margin of error is 3.5
percentage points, meaning that if the same poll were conducted 100
times, 95 of those times the results would be no more than 3.5
percentage points higher or lower than the results of this poll.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that because this survey was mailed and
anonymity was assured, The Star cannot ensure that the priests
responding are demographically and geographically representative of
all Roman Catholic priests. The priests who chose to respond to the
survey may be different from those who opted not to reply.
</P>
<P>
   However, responses to questions about the type of priest and the
priests' ages indicate that the results should be fairly
representative.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate,
two-thirds (67 percent) of the nation's 46,352 priests are diocesan
priests, with the remaining third being religious-order priests. By
comparison, 63 percent of the priests responding to this survey are
diocesan priests. The average age of diocesan priests is 59, while
the average age of religious-order priests is 63, according to The
Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. The Star's survey
showed average ages of 58 for diocesan priests and 62 for
religious-order priests.

DAY TWO OF PRIEST SERIES

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE: EMGARGOED for MONDAY AMS JAN. 31. HOLD FOR RELEASE. THIS
IS A RETRANSMISSION.)
</P>
<P>
   The young men came from Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Texas.
Some came from wealthy and prominent families, others from families
that were practically penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Many were ``cradle Catholics''; others converts. But all had
something in common _ a calling to serve God.
</P>
<P>
   They were united as novices at St. Stanislaus Seminary in
Florissant, Mo., a 150-year-old Jesuit institution tucked away in
the rolling countryside northwest of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the sexual revolution, in the Age of Aquarius and
during the height of the Vietnam War, the 26 novices in the classes
of 1967 and 1968 spent their days in prayer and meditation,
preparing to become priests.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Stanislaus and other seminaries, there were rules:
(ital)Non quam duo, semper tres.(end ital) Not in twos, always
threes. And the young men were told to avoid ``particular
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, when it came to sex, there was often only silence.
</P>
<P>
   Just over two decades later, only seven of the 26 in the classes
of '67 and '68 had been ordained. Three of those seven had died of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say St. Stanislaus represents a missed opportunity to
prevent the subsequent spread of AIDS in the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly anybody was prepared to deal with the problematic side
of sexuality, because in most seminaries and religious communities,
it was a topic not discussed,'' said the Rev. James Gill, a Jesuit
priest and psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say today they're doing a better job of educating
prospective priests about sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to a number of seminaries, and sexuality is being
treated in a much more honest and direct way,'' said the Rev.
Stephen Rossetti, president of St. Luke Institute, a residential
treatment program for priests in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Rossetti's center conducts one- and two-day sessions on human
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's supposedly picked up by the seminary faculty
adviser, and they continue to dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rossetti said, people sometimes fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes when they fail, some of them can come down with
AIDS,'' he said. ``And that's a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the St. Stanislaus novices paralleled those of
thousands of others who entered the priesthood during a tumultuous
era that reshaped not only American culture but also the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredibly exciting time to be alive, to be young,''
said the Rev. William Hart McNichols, who entered St. Stanislaus in
1968 and is now a renowned iconographer. ``The world was moving so
fast then. It was the '60s, and gosh, it was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the ``make love, not war'' theme resounded and the Second
Vatican Council liberalized some of the church's restrictive
policies, seminaries continued to avoid a hidden part of their
culture: homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: A magical place
</P>
<P>
   Posing for class pictures outside the novitiate, the St.
Stanislaus novices appeared much younger than their 18 or 19 years.
Some looked awkward, even slightly out of place, in their black
ankle-length cassocks cinched with rope-like belts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dobbels of Olathe sat in the front row of the Class of '67,
chubby-cheeked and grinning. Also on that row, a fellow novice from
the Kansas City area stared solemnly, a scowl on his face.
</P>
<P>
   In the Class of '68 photo, Pat Arnold, fresh from Regis High
School in Denver, stood with his hands at his side. McNichols, who
had just finished a year at Colorado State University, sat in front
and to the right of Arnold, looking more like a gleeful 12-year-old
than age 19.
</P>
<P>
   The four soon would develop lasting friendships. Before long,
they would find that they had another common bond. They all were
gay.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols had grown up in Denver in a family of prominent
politicians. His father was governor of Colorado from 1957 to 1963,
and his uncle was a popular Denver mayor. Raised Catholic, young
Bill McNichols knew by the time he was 5 that he wanted to be a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   He entered St. Stanislaus in the fall of 1968. It was even
better than he'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very magical,'' McNichols said, ``sort of the
last of the old seminaries. There was this aura of history of a
place being lived in, prayed in, died in.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Arnold _ who also entered in September 1968 _ would
describe ``St. Stans'' in his book, ``Wildmen, Warriors and
Kings'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the Jesuit order and encountered there a
spirituality rich with masculine myth, symbols, and lore....We
male-bonded in life-long friendships and dreamed of heroic lives in
service to Christ, like our forebears.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical day at St. Stans began around 5 a.m., when the novices
went to ``morning visit'' at the chapel. After prayer, they
returned to their rooms for 45 minutes of private meditation.
Throughout the day, they studied Jesuit spirituality, history of
the liturgy and Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week, the novices could listen to music after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gigantic renaissance going on,'' McNichols said.
``I remember driving home with Pat in the novitiate van and `Bridge
Over Troubled Water' came on, and also `He Ain't Heavy, He's My
Brother.' Those were his two favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all just got quiet in the car, because there's a sense
of spirituality in both of those songs. And the Doobie Brothers had
just done `Jesus is Just Alright With Me.' So over the radio was
coming a lot of spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Keenan, who grew up in Kansas City and entered St.
Stans in September 1967 with Dobbels, said the events occurring
throughout the world were shaking the seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shortly before me, they were real secluded. They spoke
Latin all the time, day in and day out,'' said Keenan, who now is
director of radio ministry for the Archdiocese of New York. ``By
the time we got there, they had loosened some of that up. We had
access to TV and radio, stuff like that. We had a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Kramer, a St. Stans novice in 1965, said lifting some of
the restrictions may have had unforeseen consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vatican II had just taken place, and everything was changed
from `law and authority' to `love,' '' Kramer said. ``This wasn't a
hippie commune, but there certainly was a lot of that element
coming in, which allowed people to feel more and open up more.
Almost all of us were kids; we were 17, 18, 19 years old. So we
weren't very experienced in the world, or in our own emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in dealing with their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never brought up,'' Kramer said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ...never brought up,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Inner conflict
</P>
<P>
   As Kramer grew to know his fellow novices and superiors at St.
Stanislaus, he realized that others were gay like him. He tried to
avoid the temptations of sex and learned that it was best not to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have this joke, that the fourth vow is that you're
not going to come out,'' he said, referring to the vows of poverty,
obedience and chastity that religious orders require priests to
take.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1975, Kramer found the struggle between his sexual
identity and his commitment to the church too difficult. He took a
leave of absence and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols said Arnold was struggling with an inner conflict as
well. His was more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat had this darkness, a void inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold told McNichols that he often felt that God wasn't with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had nothing but a desire for God, which any spiritual guide
will tell you (ital)is(end ital) God. You can't have a desire for
God without God. But every time he'd start to feel that God was
speaking to him, then he wouldn't believe it. And he'd fall back
into the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols said that both Dobbels and Arnold contemplated leaving
the Jesuit order because they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this huge issue with everybody gay about how you
can't be authentic and be in the church,'' McNichols said. ``Which
is still the way a lot of people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to remain Jesuits _ unlike many of their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, two-thirds of the St. Stans novice classes
of '67 and '68 would drop out _ some to get married, some to pursue
other interests.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: `There were just too many'
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, seven years after being ordained, the Rev. Bill Dobbels
tested positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   He confided in the Rev. Bill McNichols, who was working at an
AIDS hospice in New York City. Before long, McNichols would receive
similar news from fellow St. Stans novice Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols was horrified _ and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of cases where people would get it from a
partner who they had no idea was at risk,'' he said. ``But Bill and
Pat got it way after it was known how you could get it. I couldn't
help but think, `What were you doing? How could you possibly get
AIDS now, when everybody knows what's dangerous?''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols isn't sure they even knew when they contracted the
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the bigger thing was why did they take the
chance? They both had so much to offer. If they'd have only been
more responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the fellow St. Stans novice from the Kansas City area _
who had been ordained in the late 1970s _ died of complications
from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1987, Dobbels learned that his HIV had developed into
full-blown AIDS. He died in December 1990, just three days before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols officiated at Dobbels' memorial service. Pat Arnold
attended too, his frail body showing the signs of his battle with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold had been teaching theology in Berkeley, Calif., until he
became too sick. He finally moved back to Denver, where the Jesuits
helped care for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People took very good care of him,'' said the Rev. Edward
Kinerk, a 1966 St. Stans novice who later was Arnold's provincial
and is now president of Rockhurst University. ``The struggle was to
get Pat out of living by himself in an apartment and back into a
Jesuit community.''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols was working in Albuquerque, N.M., in October 1991 when
Pat Arnold's mother called from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His 41-year-old friend was near death. McNichols rushed to
Denver to see him. The next morning, Oct. 23, 1991, Arnold's mother
called McNichols at his parents' Denver home to say Arnold had
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when I started shaking,'' said McNichols, who had
seen many friends _ not all of them priests _ die during his AIDS
hospice work. ``People understood that this was a good friend, but
nobody could know this was the 150th death for me. They didn't
understand that there were just too many. I thought I was
unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: An effort to change
</P>
<P>
   St. Stanislaus closed on Aug. 18, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Juniorate, or Collegiate Seminary, moved to Fusz Memorial
near St. Louis University, where seminarians could receive a better
program than was possible at St. Stans.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Novitiate, where the novices were trained, was moved to
Rockhurst College to avoid having all the seminary training in the
St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Jesuit officials decided that the expense of
maintaining the huge seminary solely as a retirement home for
Jesuits would be too costly. The seminary was put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Those who attended St. Stans have fond recollections of their
years there. Yet even those closest to the priests who died of
AIDS-related illnesses express shock at the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One priest who was a novice in 1962 is dead. So are three from
the combined classes of 1967 and 1968, and one from the class of
1968 who quit just shy of ordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite amazing, isn't it?'' McNichols said as he looked
at old class photos.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deaths, the Jesuits say they have tried harder to help
seminarians face sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jesuits have made a much more concerted effort to educate
our men on sexuality and celibacy and what that means,'' Kinerk
said. ``I think we lived in a climate in the '50s and the '40s in
the church where you just didn't talk about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Because no one closely monitored the deaths _ and others kept
quiet _ it's impossible to know whether St. Stanislaus was the
exception or the norm.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the AIDS deaths at St. Stans, the Rev. Thomas
Gumbleton, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit and a
vocal proponent of better seminary training on sexual issues, said:
``That seems like a very high percentage. But who knows for sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have learned some valuable lessons from those deaths
if anyone had been paying attention. But unfortunately, they
weren't,'' Gumbleton added. ``They didn't want to know.''

 (ATTN: N.M., Wis., Ohio, Fla., Minn., Ariz., Ind., Texas, Pa.,
Calif., Mich. Kan.)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ One mother said it was the violence. Another
said it was the drug dealing. A third said it was the growing
number of children she noticed each day smoking, hugging and
kissing in the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, two dozen parents from low-income neighborhoods in
southwest Albuquerque explained how fear and anguish had led them
to remove their children from public schools and enroll them in
private schools costing as much as $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories unfolded as part of a plea to lawmakers to enact a
school voucher program that would let them use public funds to help
pay private school tuition. It is a plea that has caught the ear of
Republicans here, particularly Gov. Gary Johnson, who is proposing
what would be the most ambitious voucher program in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But their heartfelt passion is being met with equal fervor by
other politicians, as well as teachers and their union
representatives, who fear that taking money out of public schools
would hasten their erosion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a debate playing out across the country with increasing
intensity as more than 25 legislatures consider bills that would
create some type of system in which public dollars would be used
for private and parochial schools like the Abundant Life Christian
School here, where many parents pay $2,000 a year for each child
they enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Even with violence, drugs, overcrowding and unqualified teachers
undermining achievement in many public schools, few measures, if
any, including New Mexico's, are expected to pass this year. But
forces on both sides _ and experts who have studied the public and
private financing of education _ say support for school vouchers is
growing so rapidly, especially in poor neighborhoods, that more
cities and states will eventually implement programs through
legislation or statewide ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been talking about this issue for quite a
few years,'' said Eric Hirsch, a senior policy specialist for the
National Conference of State Legislatures, who tracks education
issues. ``A lot of states aren't quite there yet, but there are a
lot of proposals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Peterson, a professor of government at Harvard who has
studied the existing programs, said the growing popularity of
charter schools around the country was strong evidence that more
voucher programs were inevitable. Charter schools are public
schools that operate largely free of state and local regulations
and unions. They are intended to provide a creative alternative to
traditional public schools but must demonstrate progress or risk
being closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time something is introduced that provides more choice,
it is never taken away,'' Peterson said. ``Parents really like it,
so politicians can't afford to take it back. Vouchers may creep
along, because the political opposition is so intense, but it'll
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five public voucher programs are operating now _ in
Milwaukee, Cleveland, Florida, Minnesota and Arizona _ each serving
a relatively small percentage of children.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, legislation proposed last year and again this
month by Johnson, a second-term Republican, would exceed them
significantly by offering each of the state's 316,000 children in
public schools a voucher worth $3,500 a year that could be used for
tuition at any private or parochial school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to have a choice,'' said Geri Paiz, a
disgruntled mother who pulled the last three of her six children
out of public schools this year and is now paying $1,000 each for
them to attend Catholic schools. ``What they don't realize is that
many parents would jump at the chance to have a choice. I think if
parents speak out, we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the slow pace of acceptance is largely the result of
efforts of politically active and well-organized opponents,
including unions like the National Education Association and the
American Federation of Teachers, that have strong ties to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that using public dollars to help some students get
into private schools hurts those left behind, by taking money away
from teacher salaries, school construction and teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that private and parochial schools, which have
the right to accept or reject applicants, would take only
higher-performing children, leaving public-school classrooms filled
with a higher percentage of students who have learning, language
and behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Independent studies of the Milwaukee and Cleveland programs have
found that students who use vouchers to attend private schools
perform at a slightly higher rate than public school students. A
greater advantage, as the studies show, may be satisfaction among
parents _ for having the choice and for feeling secure that their
children are learning in a safer environment.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers like Kim Metcalf, a professor of education at
Indiana University, say the programs are too young and too small
for any definite conclusions to be drawn, and some results may
reflect factors that have little to do with the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the performance of kids in private vs. public
schools, the private schools look substantially better,'' Metcalf
said. ``But there's a probability that private school parents are
better-educated, make more money and provide more intellectual
stimulus at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said: ``Nobody finds them bad for kids, and there is a
tremendous enthusiasm from parents. So if you believe that's a good
thing, then they're a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their growing appeal among parents, private-school
vouchers have received virtually no support at the national level
since the Bush administration, and very little, until recently, in
state legislatures, which have been debating the issue for over 20
years. Ballot initiatives have fared no better, failing decisively
in Michigan (1978), Oregon (1990), Colorado (1992) and California
(1993).
</P>
<P>
   To create a choice for parents, cities and states have more
often allowed parents to enroll their children in any public
school, as happens in New Mexico, and have approved more charter
schools, which now number 1,700 around the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the existing voucher programs paid for with public
money is Milwaukee's, which has been in effect for 10 years. It
offers vouchers worth up to $4,894 a year to families whose income
falls below certain levels.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's 5-year-old program uses other income levels to offer
vouchers worth up to $2,250. In Florida, which last year became the
first state to approve a statewide measure, each public school is
graded annually for overall academic achievement, and any child
attending a school that has been judged to be ``failing'' two years
in a row becomes eligible for $3,500 from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Programs in Minnesota and Arizona take a different approach,
offering tax benefits for dollars invested in education. In
Minnesota, families making less than $37,500 with children in
public or private schools are eligible for $1,000 per child, to a
maximum of two, as reimbursement from the state for certain
educational expenses, including textbooks, tutors and computer
equipment. All families are eligible for tax deductions for tuition
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, residents who donate to ``student tuition
organizations,'' which distribute money to needy families, can
deduct the full amount of the donation from their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite formidable political opposition, proponents of vouchers
in other states are pushing ahead for their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last three years, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
supported a proposed pilot program for students at low-performing
schools. The legislation failed both times, but its sponsor, Sen.
Teel Bivans, R-Amarillo, intends to introduce it again when the
Texas legislature returns to session next year. Bush continues to
support vouchers as a Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, another Republican governor, Tom Ridge, has
failed four times since 1995 in efforts to push through legislation
that would provide state money to children for private or parochial
schools. A spokesman said the governor would keep trying through
the end of his second term, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after California's first ballot initiative on
vouchers failed, supporters are trying again, collecting signatures
to get a measure before voters this November. A ballot initiative
is also being developed in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, lawmakers are considering a pilot voucher proposal
that would aid 300 at-risk children even though Gov. Bill Graves, a
Republican, has clearly indicated that he is ``less than
enthusiastic'' about voucher programs of any kind, according to his
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Johnson has made vouchers one of his hallmark
issues, convinced that the ever-increasing money spent on state
public schools _ $1.6 billion was proposed this year, almost half
the budget _ has not produced significant improvements in student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he refused to sign a budget that did not include a
voucher program, and he called in legislators for a special session
to iron out their differences. Facing Democratic majorities in both
chambers, Johnson finally signed a package that did not include
vouchers, but he succeeded in creating new visibility for what he
says is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans in the House and Senate introduced his
proposal again, and in his State of the State address this month
the voucher issue was the first he mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state screams out about every single problem in
education and asks what they should be doing,'' Johnson said in an
interview. ``By all measures, we're doing just a little bit worse
year by year by year. But vouchers is the right vehicle, and
ultimately you are going to see school reform based on choice
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson conceded that he did not expect the measure to survive
the legislature again this year. But with all 112 state lawmakers
facing re-election in November, ``I want to make this the campaign
issue this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect delights parents like Ms. Paiz and Elena
Maldonado, who enrolled her daughter, Laura, 12, in the Abundant
Life school two years ago because of gang activity and drugs at her
public elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maldonado said she was a Democrat who planned to vote for
Vice President Al Gore, an opponent of vouchers, in the
presidential election. But she vowed to vote against her state
legislators, who are Democrats, if they do not support a voucher
program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Linda M. Lopez, a Democrat who represents a southwest
Albuquerque neighborhood in the state legislature, voted against
the program last year but said she would keep an open mind now,
especially if she heard from more people like Ms. Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   But whether New Mexico or any other state approves a voucher
system might ultimately depend less on local politics than on the
U.S. Supreme Court. Seven months after the Ohio State Supreme Court
ruled last year that the Cleveland program was constitutional, a
federal district judge ruled it unconstitutional. The critical
issue is whether vouchers financed by taxpayers violate the
separation of church and state when they are used for religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court is reviewing the case, but experts say any
ruling would most likely be taken to the Supreme Court, which may
be ready to consider the voucher issue after refusing to hear
appeals of rulings that the programs in Milwaukee and Arizona were
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court rules that the Ohio program is
constitutional, that could change everything,'' Metcalf said. ``It
would certainly open the door for virtually all of the 20 to 25
states considering legislation to push this through more quickly.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In the year he has suffered from osteoarthritis,
Harold Katcoff has followed his doctors' advice, to no avail:
aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs. The pills,
he says, offer little relief from the stabbing pain in the back of
his knees. So Katcoff, an 80-year-old retired pharmacist, is trying
Chinese medicine instead. Or at least, he thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday and Thursday since late November, Katcoff has come
here, to Kernan Hospital, to see an acupuncturist who pokes him
with 20 needles, nine in each leg and two in the belly, and then
hooks the probes to a mild electrical current. The patient is
convinced that the therapy works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' Katcoff says. But in the same breath, he
admits that he cannot be certain if the effect is real or imagined.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Katcoff may be receiving sham acupuncture _
needle sticks in places where, according to the theories of
traditional Chinese medicine, they should not do any good. He is a
volunteer in a $2.5 million federally financed study, run by a
rheumatology professor and a family-practice doctor at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The study represents a new wave in academic medicine: the
application of rigorous, Western scientific methods _ including the
gold standard of medical research, the placebo, or fake therapy, as
a control _ to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo biloba to
shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known as qi gong.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, many academics would not have gone near
such studies, for fear they would become laughingstocks. And while
alternative therapies remain hugely controversial in the stodgy
world of science _ ``quackupuncture'' is how one vocal critic, Dr.
Victor Herbert of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, summed up the
University of Maryland's work _ large, multimillion-dollar clinical
trials are getting under way this year at some of the nation's most
prestigious university hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific games have begun,'' declared Dr. David
Eisenberg, director of the Center for Alternative Medicine Research
and Education at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston.
Or, as Dr. Barrie Cassileth, chief of integrative medicine at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said: ``The
research is just coming into its maturity. It's bar mitzvah time.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom is being driven by the National Institutes of Health,
which, under pressure from Congress, has sharply increased its
budget for studies of alternative medicine. Eight years ago, much
to the chagrin of institute leaders, Congress required the
institutes to establish an Office of Alternative Medicine, a tiny
operation with a budget to match, just $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' said Dr. Daniel Moerman, a medical anthropologist at
the University of Michigan, ``like setting up an office of deviltry
within the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a rocky beginning, the office is gaining acceptance at
the institutes and is setting the tone for scientists around the
country. Last year, Congress upgraded the office, making it the
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which
means it now has grant-making authority. Its yearly budget has
grown to $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a new director came on board, Dr. Stephen E. Straus,
a virologist and longtime NIH insider whom Dr. Harold Varmus, the
former director of the institutes and once one of the program's
biggest detractors, describes as ``a really distinguished
scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hospitals and medical schools are bowing to
economic reality: alternative medicine is big business. According
to the Nutrition Business Journal, an industry trade publication,
Americans spent $27.2 billion in 1998 on providers of alternative
health care, including those in chiropractic, traditional Chinese
medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy and massage therapy. Sales of
herbs are also growing, to $4.4 billion last year, from nearly $2.5
billion in 1995, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of more than 2,000 adults, conducted by Eisenberg and
published in November 1998 in The Journal of the American Medical
Association, estimated that 46 percent of the American population
had visited a practitioner of alternative health care in 1997, up
from 36 percent in 1990. Patients like Katcoff, who had never
before tried alternative therapies, are increasingly doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are saying, I want some type of care and I will pay
for it out of pocket if I need to,'' said Dr. Brian Berman, the
principal investigator in the Maryland acupuncture study. ``I think
that has been heard by the medical establishment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But applying Western methods to Eastern traditions may be easier
said than done, as Berman well knows. For one thing, how do you do
placebo acupuncture? Berman and a Chinese colleague, Dr. Lixing
Lao, ran several experiments just to figure out a technique that,
they say, can reliably fool patients. And medical concepts do not
easily translate. The diagnosis ``osteoarthritis of the knee'' does
not exist in traditional Chinese medicine. The closest translation,
Lao said, was ``the knee area is energy blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural clashes aside, the work proceeds. At Duke University,
330 patients are being enrolled in a study of St. John's wort, an
herb that is thought to relieve mild depression. One-third of the
participants will receive the herb, one-third will receive a
placebo and one-third will receive Zoloft, a commonly prescribed
drug.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center has just begun
testing shark cartilage as a treatment for lung cancer; the study,
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and approved by the Food
and Drug Administration, will involve as many as 700 patients who
will receive either shark cartilage or a dummy pill in addition to
conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And at the University of Michigan, Dr. Steven F. Bolling, a
heart transplant surgeon who describes himself as ``the high priest
of techno-medicine,'' is surprised to find himself examining
whether practitioners of the Chinese art of qi gong can help his
cardiac surgery patients recover faster. One-third of the patients
in the clinical trial will be visited by a qi gong master, who
performs slow-motion exercises that are said to release a healing
energy. One-third will be visited by an impostor and one-third will
not have visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's proven, it works and it helps my patients,'' Bolling
said, ``so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is affecting the training of young doctors as well.
Two-thirds of the nation's medical schools now have courses on
alternative medicine, many of them to teach doctors how to handle
questions from patients. Harvard Medical School is about to begin a
fellowship program to train internists in how to conduct research
on alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a small army of clinician researchers who will do this
work now,'' said Eisenberg, the co-director, ``and for the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how alternative medicine has worked its way into
the mainstream of scientific research begins not with scientists,
but politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, became chairman of
the subcommittee that holds the purse strings to NIH. At about that
time, Harkin said, a friend, Rep. Berkley Bedell, D-Iowa, became
ill with Lyme disease and prostate cancer, and resigned from
Congress. ``A couple of years after that, Berkley came to see me
and he looked like a new man,'' Harkin said. ``He told me about a
strange cure he had taken, an alternative approach. I was just
amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin has since become an aficionado of alternative medicine
himself: He takes bee pollen for his allergies, a practice that
critics find silly. But Harkin may have had the last laugh. In
1991, he inserted a provision into the NIH appropriations bill
requiring the institutes to create an Office of Alternative
Medicine, with a $2 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fought it and fought it and fought it,'' Harkin said in a
recent interview. ``You'd think I was single-handedly destroying
NIH by spending $2 million on alternative therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount was indeed a drop in the bucket for the institutes,
an agency that now has a $15 billion annual budget. The tiny office
on alternative care was set up in a remote outpost, nowhere near
the institutes' main campus in Bethesda, Md. Its mission was
complicated. Alternative medicine is such a vast conglomeration of
practices, ranging from the use of vitamins and herbs, to
meditation, massage, movement therapy and acupuncture, that even
its practitioners cannot agree on what to call it. (The terms
``complementary,'' ``integrative'' and ``alternative'' are used
interchangeably.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The office began by offering small grants of $30,000 each. Soon,
it was drawing fierce criticism for spending taxpayers' money on
projects of dubious scientific merit. ``The quality was incredibly
low,'' Varmus said. ``The investigators who were applying didn't
really know much about science.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress took a step that would have a major effect on
patients' access to alternative therapies. It passed a law that
permits manufacturers to make claims about health benefits for
herbal medicines whose safety and effectiveness had not been proved
by the usual standards applied to prescription drugs. Now, said
Cassileth, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, ``Everybody can play doctor
and buy anything they want over the counter and treat themselves.''
Good research became even more necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the battles at NIH continued. The alternative medicine
office ran through a string of directors. The man who took the job
in 1995, Dr. Wayne B. Jonas, drew criticism because he practiced
homeopathy, a 200-year-old system of medicine in which illnesses
are often treated with diluted solutions of plant extracts. Most
mainstream scientists, including Varmus, take a dim view of
homeopathy. As a result, said Jonas, who left the institutes at the
end of 1998, he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals
to finance research.
</P>
<P>
   But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the
office and public interest grew, Varmus said, ``I came to feel that
there was a real public health concern that NIH had a
responsibility to address.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main
institutes' campus, and Varmus had formed an advisory group of
government scientists to set priorities. The alternative medicine
literature contains thousands of studies, but the majority are
scientifically flawed. Varmus wants scientists to test the most
promising and most widely used therapies.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics remain. Herbert, the Mount Sinai professor,
calls the institutes' center on alternative medicine ``a worthless
waste of money'' that was ``set up to promote fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of
Medicine, said the center had so far failed to publish any
significant articles in scientific journals. ``The proof is in the
pudding,'' Dr. Angell said. ``Just show me the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   That may take some time. It will be three to four years, Straus
predicts, before the current crop of clinical trials is complete.
Still, in a recent interview, Straus came armed with two loose-leaf
notebooks full of articles that had grown from NIH-financed
research, some published in the respected Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the center ``still has to prove itself.''
But, he said, ``I predict it will.''
</P>
<P>
   For the American health care system, the implications of the new
research will be vast, medically and economically. Health
maintenance organizations are just beginning to cover some
alternative therapies; Oxford Health Plans, for instance, offers
coverage for acupuncture. If therapies being tested prove
effective, patients will undoubtedly begin demanding coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new research could be a boon to manufacturers of herbs.
Several manufacturers of dietary supplements are beginning studies
of products like ginkgo and St. John's wort that could lead to
their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, in the same way
the agency approves prescription drugs, said Michael McGuffin,
president of the American Herbal Products Association, a trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is joining Chinese
scientists to develop herbal medicines as drugs. In addition, Dr.
Steven DeKosky, who directs the university's Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center, has also received a $3 million NIH grant to see if
the ginkgo herb can prevent dementia. Two thousand elderly patients
will be enrolled. If it works, he said, the next step will be to
isolate the active ingredients and figure out how they work.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers, including Eisenberg of Harvard, say
alternative therapies will not be truly accepted as mainstream
until scientists can prove not just that they work, but how. But
already, medical practice is opening up, said Dr. Marc C. Hochberg,
the rheumatology professor at the University of Maryland, who is an
investigator in the acupuncture study.
</P>
<P>
   This year, acupuncture was mentioned for the first time in the
American College of Rheumatology's guidelines for medical
management of osteoarthritis of the knee. ``Our work has opened
people's eyes,'' he said. ``This used to be in the same ball park
as copper bracelets. I think we have taken acupuncture for
osteoarthritis out of that realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hochberg said, an important question remains: does the
acupuncture really work, or is it just the placebo effect? Hochberg
hopes to have an answer by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As for Katcoff, he is sold. He said he had been reading up on
Chinese medicine, and had learned that even people who did not
believe in it could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm getting the real goods,'' he said recently,
moments after a treatment. ``I've been going twice a week, and this
is my fifth week, and I can honestly say that the pains in the back
of my legs are gone.''

A DREAM IS FULFILLED, AFTER 39 YEARS

 (ATTN: Ky.)  (lb)

<P>
   NICHOLASVILLE, Ky. _ Last spring, when Wini Yunker stopped
dyeing her hair black and let it grow in gray, her friends finally
began to believe her decades of talk about joining the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't take all the cosmetic supplies I need for that to
Ukraine,'' Wini explained, looking wistful but venturesome as she
made the rounds to say goodbye to her friends in this bluegrass
town where she was born 65 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I just can't do this any more,'' said Wini, who had
decided she needed to make a fashion statement worthy of her
long-delayed wanderlust. ``It was a big step 'cause I always liked
my hair dark,'' she said. ``But I went and shaved all my hair off.
I looked like Michael Jordan. A man at church saw my shaved head
and said, `That's a real foxy hairstyle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wini looks like a silver-locked Peter Pan, ready to fly to
Kiev on Monday after a 39-year wait to join the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Gertie, of Gertie's Dirty Pie fame at the Nicholasville Cafe,
offered Wini a terse, honest Kentucky goodbye at the cash register
during the busy lunchtime. To avoid tears, Wini seemed to be doing
most of the talking, table-hopping to Sam O'Connell, who was just
out of the hospital. ``Tickled to see you,'' she said in farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to live in a small town,'' Wini said with a gentle
tone of passion as she headed down Main Street to arrange an
absentee ballot at the Jessamine County Courthouse. ``Everybody
knows everybody. People here still stop on the sidewalk out of
respect when a funeral procession passes by.''
</P>
<P>
   On Main Street, Wini looked up at the cupola on the Presbyterian
Church, which, older neighbors still remember, she climbed on a
whim when she was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always doing things like that,'' said her son, Joe, who
at 22 is old enough for Wini to be able to leave the family's
simple working-class frame house on North Second Street to fulfill
her dream of joining the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gone to Washington to look for a career like so many
young girls back then,'' Wini said of a spellbinding time when she
was 26 and got an office job a block from the White House. She saw
President John F. Kennedy, who passed by often, waving and smiling,
as the embodiment of a special style of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just dashed when the Peace Corps turned me down,'' she
said of her fling at Kennedy idealism that has far outlasted the
Kennedy days.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Wini came home and lived a full life. On
Tuesday, she finished a career here at Sargent &AMP; Greenleaf, a lock
company, where she moved up from the clerical pool to chief
assistant to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In this time, she has enjoyed at least two courtships and a
wedding, raised a son who has Wini's amiable way, and got a
divorce. And she studied at night and on weekends for the
bachelor's degree (plus a master's) that she was lacking when her
Peace Corps application was first rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they told me Ukraine, I thought that was Siberia,'' Wini
said, laughing. ``But then I realized Yalta is in Ukraine and I
thought, great,'' she said, showing the instincts of a true
Kentucky Democrat raised to worship the history of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt and his search for world peace at the Yalta
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reading up and discovered the Ukrainian people are a
lot like us here,'' said Wini, who will begin her adventure by
living with a Ukrainian family for 12 weeks to learn the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ukrainians are very independent, don't like Russia telling
them what to do,'' she said, packing every bit of experience with
her as she heads off to spend the next two years teaching American
business techniques to Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
   Older volunteers make up less than 10 percent of the 7,000 Peace
Corps volunteers in 77 countries, but Wini finds nothing special in
her status. ``I can do this,'' she said flatly after all the years
of protecting her dream.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In her final hours here, Wini said goodbye to her five older
sisters, making them promise to stay healthy while she is gone. She
had a final lunch with her best friend, Patsy Gray, who will handle
her finances while she is away. She exulted in a fluent goodbye
with Soon Bok-kin, a young Korean immigrant whom Wini taught
English. And she welcomed Tom Smith from Tennessee for a parting
weekend visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be engaged and we stayed good friends,'' Wini
explained, heading for the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``E.J.,'' she said sadly to the county clerk, Eva McDaniel, a
girlhood friend. She gave E.J. a hug and an unnecessary promise to
keep voting straight Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're one of a kind,'' Eva said as Wini headed off.
</P>
<P>
   Out on Main Street, Wini savored a last look at this place, but
in a paradoxical way. ``I may not come back,'' she suddenly said.
``I may stay. I hear there are these American businesses there who
need people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Wini Yunker was trying to stay one dream ahead as she
left home. ``If I come back here I think my life will be changed.''

OFFICER OF ISRAELI-BACKED LEBANESE MILITIA KILLED BY BOMB
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Guerrillas fighting to oust Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon killed the second-most-senior officer of the
Israeli-backed militia there Sunday with a bomb that exploded near
his house.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, took
responsibility for killing the officer, Col. Akl Hashem, 47, who
commanded the western brigade of the pro-Israeli militia, known as
the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hashem, who was also the chief of the group's intelligence
service in his area of command, was considered the likely successor
for the 71-year-old militia commander, Gen. Antoine Lahd.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from southern Lebanon said that Hashem, who had survived
several previous attempts on his life, was killed instantly when a
cluster of explosive charges went off in the yard of his farmhouse
near the village of Dibel in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh of Israel promised a
response to the killing of Hashem, and he accused Syria, which
exercises wide influence in Lebanon, of showing bad faith in
negotiations with Israel by failing to rein in Hezbollah. Talks
between Israel and Syria resumed in December but were suspended
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conceal the fact that this assassination is a real
blow for us and for the south Lebanese,'' Sneh said. ``That is why
it will not go unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing jolted the Israelis and threatened to demoralize
further their militia allies, who are already worried about their
future after an expected Israeli pullout from southern Lebanon.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to bring the Israeli troops
there home by July.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has held a nine-mile-wide swath of territory in southern
Lebanon since 1985, saying it serves as a buffer zone against
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel. About 1,100 Israeli troops
are stationed in the zone, allied with the 2,500-member militia.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were reported Sunday night to be urging
militia commanders to use restraint and resisting their calls for
retaliation, cautioning against an escalation in fighting that
could spin out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything so that those who struck Akl Hashem will
get the punishment they deserve,'' Barak said. ``At the same time I
expect the situation not to deteriorate all along the Lebanese
border. The potential is there, and the harm of a possible
deterioration is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy exchanges of gunfire and Israeli airstrikes were reported
throughout the day in southern Lebanon, and a Lebanese woman was
seriously wounded. An anti-aircraft shell fired by guerrillas
landed near a kindergarten in the Israeli border community of
Margaliot, but there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria allows Hezbollah to carry out serious attacks that can
lead to escalation,'' Sneh, the Israeli deputy defense minister,
said. ``That means Syria doesn't care if there's a deterioration,
and this raises grave doubts about the seriousness of their
intentions in the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneh, a former commander of the southern Lebanon zone held by
Israel, said that he had known Hashem for more than 20 years and
called him ``one of the strongest and staunchest allies of Israel
in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese authorities had sentenced the colonel, who defected
from the Lebanese army in 1976, to death for ``dealing with the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming responsibility for killing him on Sunday, Hezbollah
said it had slain ``the criminal traitor Akl Hashem.'' In the
Lebanese port city of Tyre and in the town of Nabatiye, Hezbollah
supporters celebrated in a raucous car convoy and handed out candy
to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the protracted war of attrition fought between Israel and
Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, both sides have used bombs as a tool
to assassinate key military and political figures, relying on
informers to track their movements. Hezbollah's last major success
was in February of last year, when a roadside bomb killed an
Israeli general.

TOWN'S ENVIABLE RECORD: ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT N.H. WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HUDSON, N.H. _ It has strip malls, subdivisions, and a solidly
middle-class population of 22,000, giving this town the look and
feel of Anywhere, USA.
</P>
<P>
   But Hudson does have one distinction. And it matters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1952 this community just over the Massachusetts
border has voted for the Democratic and Republican presidential
primary winners, something unique in this state, despite other
towns' claims to be bellwethers for each of the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In search of an early peek at what the results might be in this
state's first-in-the-nation primary, residents were asked over the
weekend to reveal their thoughts and voting booth secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, their replies were laced with cynicism and a desire to
send a message that they want someone honest leading the country,
although many people still seem to be deciding the best way to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally vote Republican, but my man doesn't have a
chance,'' said Normand Bastien, an independent 53-year-old retired
police officer who likes Steve Forbes. ``So I will give up my
independence and go for Bradley just to get Gore out of there.
</P>
<P>
   As for George W. Bush, Bastien said, ``there's nothing there if
you look in his eyes. He's not his father. He's not his mother,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, he added from his booth in Kay's Coffee
Shop and Restaurant, ``is not an outsider. The only outsider is
unelectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Censabella, 28, a police officer standing in the parking
lot of Citizens Bank, said she is still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But her brother, James, just switched his vote from Gore to
McCain after attending a town meeting where the Arizona senator
responded to many questions from the audience, including one of
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave him a straightforward answer,'' Censabella said. ``He
asked, `What would you do with the economy?' And McCain said, `I'm
concentrating on where we have problems right now.' Which seems
like a decent answer to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Dagesse, 32, has never voted before. But guilt has been
creeping up, she said, and may push her to the polls, after a
weekend of reading the newspaper to decide how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend that's thinking strongly on Bill Bradley,''
Dagesse said. ``But a lot are finding it hard to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, who declined to give his name because he earns a
federal paycheck, said he has been turned off by the candidates'
televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the bickering I've seen is really unprofessional,'' he
said, adding that he usually votes Republican but is still
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Blease, 41, a machine setup worker, said he, too, is
uncommitted, although he is leaning toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has it inbred in him,'' said Blease, a Republican. ``I
think he did a good job as governor. But I like McCain, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Blease was saying that, McCain was stirring up an
audience of about 500 people just down the road in Windham, also
part of the so-called golden triangle area of southern New
Hampshire between Manchester, Salem, and Nashua that has swelled
with voters since the 1950s, when Hudson emerged as a ballot-booth
trendsetter.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, once a farm town, is now a Massachusetts bedroom
community and home to many high technology firms, including
Lockheed Commercial Electronics Co. and Micronetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters rule here, with 5,595 registered as such,
compared with 4,311 Republicans and 3,448 Democrats. They are
mostly white, with median family incomes of $62,000, and are mostly
concerned with traffic congestion, education, and health care,
which is the reason that Cathy Bastien, 50, a nursing home
administrator, is voting for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an man of integrity,'' she said. ``And his health care
proposal is much better than Gore's.''

THEORY PLACES BUSH IN MIDDLE OF FORBES-MCCAIN SQUEEZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ When Steve Forbes's caucus vote crept above
30 percent last Monday night, assuring him of a strong second-place
finish in Iowa, his happy advisers laid out a wistful scenario of
how the Texas colossus, Governor George W. Bush, could be brought
down.
</P>
<P>
   According to their theory, Bush will be bloodied by Senator John
McCain in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. Weakened by a loss in
that state, Bush would then be subjected to one-two punches _ from
Forbes on the right and McCain on the left _ in subsequent
primaries, and the favorite in the Republican race would collapse
in spite of his $70 million treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is composed of a mixture of political history,
strategic planning, and wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political director, John Weaver, dismisses the idea.
The Forbes campaign is not strong enough to support the right flank
of a pincer movement, he said, because Forbes has no substantial
operation on the ground beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign operatives insist that the Texas governor is
better fortified than his adversaries in the states that lie ahead
and can withstand any challenges from Forbes or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as Bush stares at the possibility of defeat in New
Hampshire, Forbes and McCain find themselves engaged in a temporary
alliance of convenience that will play itself out over an intense
schedule of primaries in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy to stay out of Iowa appeared to be vindicated
by Forbes's ability to hold down Bush's winning margin. And now
that Forbes appears to be lagging in New Hampshire, it will be
McCain's turn to throw an obstacle in Bush's path.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Republican candidates, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes,
do not figure in the long-range equation because the
one-dimensional nature of their antiabortion campaigns poses little
threat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is already looking ahead to a duel with Bush in South
Carolina, which hosts the next major primary, on Feb. 19. While
Forbes's aides are vague about their candidate's plans for South
Carolina, they say the magazine magnate may try to upset Bush in
Delaware, a state Forbes won in 1996, in a primary there on Feb. 8.
Forbes is also preparing for a major confrontation with Bush in
Michigan on Feb. 22, the same day McCain expects to win the primary
in his home state, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule could keep Bush busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at this possibility for some time,'' said John
Maxwell, a senior adviser to Forbes. ``It looks like 1968, when
Richard Nixon was the establishment candidate.'' New York Governor
Nelson Rockefeller ``ran from the left and picked up a significant
number of delegates. Ronald Reagan collected a number of delegates
_ mostly from California _ and Nixon went to the convention in
Miami Beach with just under 50 percent.'' The only reason Nixon
prevailed, Maxwell recalled, was because he won procedural contests
that gave him all the votes of three state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes vowed last week that he will emerge from the Republican
struggle as the ``true conservative'' in the race. And unlike 1968,
when the right ultimately failed to stop Nixon, his advisers say
the most conservative candidate will win the GOP nomination this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush made a strategic mistake by trying to lock up the
moderates,'' Maxwell said. ``He's losing them now _ lock, stock,
and barrel _ to McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of McCain's team acknowledge that Forbes's 30-point
performance in Iowa helped take some of the luster off Bush's
victory, bruising the Texan before a tough fight in New Hampshire.
But they say McCain can win the nomination on his own, as a
candidate defying the Bush machine and capturing the public's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, are drawing on historical parallels. After enduring a
series of defeats in 1976, Reagan's campaign suddenly caught fire
and nearly toppled his own party's president, Gerald Ford, with a
closing rush.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire primaries also produced dramatic results in
Democratic contests. In 1968, Eugene McCarthy's second-place finish
shocked President Lyndon B. Johnson and helped drive him from the
White House; in 1976, Jimmy Carter won his first great victory; and
in 1984, Gary Hart rocked the sure-bet candidacy of Walter F.
Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, voters used the primaries to send a message of
discontent with the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no coincidence that the McCain campaign last week
prepared a new television commercial exhorting the voters of New
Hampshire to ``send a powerful message to America.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JASON WILLIAMS IS HAVING FUN DOING IT HIS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Skedded earlier as BKN-KNICKS-COLUMN)  
(ms) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Van Gundy wore an incredulous look when he
returned to the bench for the third quarter Sunday. He rolled his
eyes, shook his head and remarked to no one in particular,
``Throwing it off the backboard?''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' coach was referring to the circus pass Jason
Williams left for a trailing Chris Webber at the end of the first
half, a highly unorthodox play for a team 15 points down.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of hoop etiquette, Williams is supposed to lay
the ball in, get back on defense, walk to the locker room with his
head down and regroup for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened instead: Webber blew the dunk so
spectacularly, Ty Corbin grabbed the long rebound and hit a bomb of
a 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left. And then Marcus Camby launched a
66-foot prayer at the second-quarter buzzer, as if he was shooting
for a Range Rover. Swish!
</P>
<P>
   It was the most surreal end to a half at Madison Square Garden
anyone could remember, triggered by that mischievous showboat who
plays point guard for the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Desecrating the game can be awful lot of fun sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A behind-the-back pass is as easy for me as a chest pass is
for you,'' said Williams, unfazed that several of those passes
ended up in the Garden's third row Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks beat the Kings, America's church-league team,
120-111. Williams missed seven of nine shots he attempted, threw
more than a half dozen no-look turnovers and got under the skin of
old-school referee Hue Hollins enough that Hollins through him out
in the opening moments of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Before it turned to slop late, the game was a wildly
entertaining matinee. Van Gundy, the purist, prevailed over the
Kings' panache. He earned the right to coach the Eastern Conference
All-Star team next week in Oakland, Calif., where you can already
picture Vince Carter in the doghouse because he failed to block out
his man at the end of a 145-120 East victory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will probably not be at the center of the NBA universe
next week, but he is already smack in the middle of a growing
generational debate in the hoop community: Should a dynamic
ball-handler with shades of Pete Maravich be constantly hyped if he
only makes 35 of every 100 shots he takes? And if he should, at
what juncture does entertainment supersede winning?
</P>
<P>
   To sell the Post-Michael NBA to viewers, David Stern and Dick
Ebersol need Williams and Webber to perform their open-court magic.
But if that magic only lasts one round of the playoffs, what good
will that do anyone? It is a tough act to balance, playing the game
for fun on instinct while occasionally using your head during a key
possession, so the game does not get away from you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players start thinking what they're going to do, they're
going to start playing like a robot or something,'' Williams said,
explaining his propensity for flair. ``I just go out and ...
whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams put on some incredible theater in the first quarter,
depositing unreal passes on the fingertips of teammates streaking
to the basket. Over the shoulder. Through the legs. The building
was in awe. Like a pool shark, the more difficult the angle and
placement, the more personal satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   But there were several moments where he just got caught up in
the spectacle of playing at the Garden for the first time during
his first-ever visit to New York, junctures in which looking good
appeared to get in the way of leading his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little pain in my chest when he does it,'' said Pete
Carrill, the Hall of Fame college coach who went West two years ago
to become a Kings assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd pairing, the Coach of Backdoor U. and the Crossover
Kid, sitting by side by side on the same bench. Carrill would have
never let his coat-and-tie Princeton teams play this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's driving me crazy,'' Carrill said. ``But I
notice the difference, I'll tell you that. That's the way this team
has to play for the time being, until they get to be more mature
and our point guard finds better ways to do what he wants to do and
be more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Former coaches turned announcers like Hubie Brown and Matt
Guokas have taken Williams' game to task on many occasions, to
which Williams pays no mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lot of older people in the crowd and older announcers really
don't like it, and I think they don't like it because they couldn't
do it when they was little or younger,'' Williams said. ``And they
still can't do it. But I bet they're the first in line to see us
come to town. They're talking out of both sides of their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' No. 55 jersey disappears in stores quicker than any
other NBA item, a coveted product among thousands of young
ballplayers. Meanwhile, grade-school coaches watching those same
young ballplayers yo-yo downcourt openly curse his name.
</P>
<P>
   On it rages, kids and fuddy-duddies arguing over whether or not
a 23-year-old point guard is good, great or detrimental to the
game. There is no neutrality. Just ask Van Gundy as he rolls his
eyes. Or Hollins after he threw him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the refs sometimes see a lot of the things we do
as players,'' Williams said. ``For the first time, they're kind of
amazed.'' Then he added, referring to the summer Rucker League in
New York: ``Maybe they need to get out to the Rucker or
something.''

CANDIDATES LOOK TO NORTH COUNTRY FOR MARGIN OF VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HART'S LOCATION, N.H. _ Deep in the icy expanse of the White
Mountains, Bill Bradley stood with his back to a crackling fire in
a remote inn, facing every voter in the hamlet _ all 27.
</P>
<P>
   Time raced toward Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, a test that
could make or break Bradley's quest for the White House. Yet on a
day when other candidates were all but tripping over each other in
the state's populous southern tier, Bradley nestled Saturday over
cookies and coffee with one of the tiniest blocs of voters in the
state's largely ignored, but potentially crucial, North Country.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there were only three Democrats in the bunch.
There were 12 independents, and any one of them could make the
difference in a race that Bradley considers as tight as a political
contest can be. And Bradley, like a number of other candidates who
have recently spent time up north, are demonstrating that they know
their New Hampshire history.
</P>
<P>
   While the population mass clearly is in the south, the great
stretch of country north of Concord sometimes provides just enough
votes for a margin of victory in a tight race: precisely what the
candidates are looking for. Candidates such as Patrick Buchanan in
1996 and George Bush in 1988 have won primaries here in part
because of their strong showing in the north country.
</P>
<P>
   So, in addition to Bradley's foray, Steve Forbes last week
traveled to Littleton and George W. Bush recently spent
considerable time in the Lakes Region, although it has been awhile
since he went to the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The North Country can be crucial in different ways for the two
parties. Some of the most active and conservative Republicans live
throughout the North Country. And Berlin is a sort of Democratic
island in the White Mountains, a working-class city with a
reputation for high voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley stopped in Berlin, a largely Franco-American factory
city and Democratic stronghold that is nearly as close to Montreal
as it is to Manchester. There, a moose mascot danced in the doorway
as Bradley was introduced by a supporter, Roland Beausejour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other candidates say, `To hell with the North Country,
we'll go to Manchester where there are a million people living,' ''
Beausejour said afterward. ``I think it will make a good impact
that Bill Bradley came here.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bradley made an impromptu stop at a Wal-Mart in Berlin,
he discovered the region's contrarian nature. Shaking the hand of a
female customer, he said, ``I hope you'll vote for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep hoping,'' the customer responded.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart manager then shooed Bradley and his entourage out of
the store, announcing, ``There is no soliciting on Wal-Mart
property.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the presidential campaign takes place in
what many consider to be the exurbs of Massachusetts, in a region
that runs roughly from Portsmouth to Nashua to Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than half of the registered voters in this
10-county state live in the two southernmost counties, Rockingham
and Hillsborough, and more than two-thirds of the voters are south
of Concord. So it is in the southern tier, amid the suburbs and
shopping centers and strip malls, that most of the candidates spend
most of their time, hitting the same town halls and restaurants and
VFW halls.
</P>
<P>
   But in the popular imagination, the real New Hampshire lies
northward, in the rustic hamlets and gritty logging towns of the
White Mountains, in the covered-bridge country hard by the Vermont
border, in the lakes region and the vast heavily timbered tracts
``north of the notches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two states here,'' said former Governor Hugh Gregg,
who has watched the state change dramatically over the last several
decades. ``North of Concord is the old New Hampshire. South of
Concord is the new New Hampshire, where the independents have come
in, where we have got the highest density of high-tech workers per
capita in the nation. The south is where the presidential
candidates are concentrating. North is for the `photo ops.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But another former New Hampshire governor, John H. Sununu, told
a St. Anselm's College seminar last week that presidential
candidates ignore the north country at their peril. Sununu said
that the defining moment of former President Bush's 1988 primary
came when he insisted that the campaign go north in the final days.
Sununu said it wound up providing the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrigan, who edits three North Country weekly newspapers,
including the Coos County Democrat, said that he has seen fewer
visits by presidential candidates over the years. But Harrigan said
Bradley was wise to go north because many people there are upset
with President Clinton's actions and tag Gore with their
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley will run away from Gore here,'' Harrigan predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race, however, is as tight in the north as it is
in the southern part of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, in an interview, said that he made an extra
effort to go north, believing the region is heavy with veterans and
independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent a lot of time there,'' said McCain, who often tells
audiences that he has twice been to Dixville Notch, the home of The
Balsams resort, where a handful of voters cast the first primary
votes. ``But the difference between now and 1996 is that there has
been a real significant economic uptick in the northern part of the
state. In '96, the south was doing well, the north was in trouble.
Now the north is doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   The region is notorious for its bad weather, and every campaign
seems to have a story of canceled trips. But some candidates insist
on making the trip, believing it could make or break their
campaign. In 1976, with a vicious snowstorm was swirling around
Manchester, Jimmy Carter was determined to keep an engagement in
Berlin. A reporter who accompanied Carter asked, ``Is this trip
necessary?'' Carter replied that he had been reading the Bible the
night before and had found a passage that spoke about how the
apostles set ``a straight course unto Coos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the county where Berlin is located, don't you?''
Carter said. ``It's Coos County.'' So Carter flew into the teeth of
the storm and delivered his speech in the Democratic bastion of the
north country _ and won the primary.

AMERICA ONE AGAIN LOSES AT ITS OWN GAME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Before the start of the final round of
the Louis Vuitton series to determine the next America's Cup
challenger, and well before the San Francisco-based America One
syndicate found itself down by 3-1 to Italy's surprisingly
hard-nosed Prada Challenge, the U.S. skipper Paul Cayard offered
what has become a prescient analysis of the action to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some hard races,'' he said. ``Some
heartbreaking races. You might lose a race after leading all the
way around the course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you deal with that,'' he added, ``could make all the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after having led at every mark of the 18.5-mile course,
Cayard and his team succumbed to Prada in the final excruciating
moments of Race 4 in the five-of-nine final.
</P>
<P>
   There was no racing Monday in observation of Auckland
Anniversary Day. When the series resumes Tuesday, Cayard and his
squad will need to stage a mighty rally to salvage their hopes of
facing Team New Zealand in the America's Cup finals, which begin
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   When the series began, the conventional wisdom went like this:
with a slight speed deficit in some conditions, Cayard and his more
experience crew would ultimately prevail after rattling the
Italians into submission with an aggressive, take-no-prisoners,
street-fighting style.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to King Cayard's
coronation. America One has enjoyed a slight but pronounced
boat-speed advantage in the gusty conditions in which the last two
races were sailed. But it didn't matter. The Italians were still
victorious in both contests.
</P>
<P>
   In each contest, Prada beat the gunslinger Cayard at his own
game.
</P>
<P>
   In Race 3, a wet, wild affair with blasting winds that peaked at
more than 30 knots, the Italians stayed calm and collected in a
tight downwind crossing that is the sort of close-quarters racing
in which Cayard and his mates usually thrive. Instead, the
Americans panicked and fouled the Italians, the first of several
sail-handling errors that led to an easy Prada victory.
</P>
<P>
   Race 4 was something altogether different, a contest in which
America One gained control in savage fashion on the first downwind
run. Cayard's aggressive tactics sent the Italians spinning out of
control and flailing in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the final downwind run in which the race was
won...and lost. In the closing stretch, having pulled back into
contention on the winds of a strong following breeze, the Italians
again converged on America One in another crossing maneuver that
would decide the affair.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Cayard's crew could not pull off the
maneuver in time. Obliged to stay clear of Prada, Cayard could not
and the on-the-water umpires signaled America One for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   America One crossed the finish line a nose ahead, but still had
to complete its penalty turn.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it did, the race was over. Prada had won.
</P>
<P>
   The deck is now indeed shuffled. The only remaining question now
is, does Cayard hold an ace up his sleeve?

ITALIANS ARGUE OVER EFFORTS TO MAKE TRIALS FAIRER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italy prepared for the year 2000 by passing laws to speed
up its notoriously slow judicial process and to protect the rights
of defendants better.
</P>
<P>
   But so far those milestones seem almost buried by a clamorous
debate over whether justice in Italy is independent or ruled by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, politicians on the left and the right were
obsessively re-examining cases past, seeking to rewrite two of the
most turbulent chapters of recent Italian history: the terrorism of
the 1970s and 1980s _ a period so violent that it is known as the
``years of lead'' _ and Tangentopoli, or Bribesville, the criminal
investigations into a huge web of corruption and bribery that in
the early 1990s brought down the centrist Christian Democratic
party and its Socialist allies.
</P>
<P>
   Those two very different cases have at least one thing in common
_ critics on each side insist that the investigations were
politically biased. And those sentiments, echoed most heatedly in
Parliament, highlight one of the weaknesses that undermine efforts
at legal reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a real effort to make changes in the legal
system,'' said Vittorio Grevi, director of the C. Beccaria
Institute of Law and Criminal Procedure in Pavia. ``But the real
problem is that there is such deep distrust of the magistrates who
apply the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The tortuous legal saga of Adriano Sofri and two co-defendants,
radical leftist intellectuals who were convicted in 1990 of
conspiring to kill a police inspector in 1972 and maintained their
innocence throughout eight different trials, is a cause celebre
that has long polarized Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Fo, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote ``Accidental Death of an
Anarchist'' based on one of the elements of the Sofri case. When a
Venice court upheld the convictions last week, there was an
outpouring of anger and distress.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Veltroni, who leads the Democrats of the Left, the party
of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, said the verdict must be
``respected'' but added, ``The whole truth of that unjustifiable
murder must come out and the guilty be brought to justice,'' a
statement that clearly implied that all the trials and judges'
verdicts so far had not achieved this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence in the justice system has so deteriorated that
people feel they can just dismiss a verdict they don't agree
with,'' said Massimo Pavarini, a law professor at the University of
Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, it is the center-left that usually argues
that magistrates in Italy are impartial enforcers of the law, and
that any attempt to rein in their power is a political assault by
politicians who fear corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of Parliament on Wednesday approved a
parliamentary committee to investigate Tangentopoli, in which
hundreds of businessmen and politicians were charged and convicted,
though only a few served time in prison. It is not yet clear
exactly what is under scrutiny: Italian socialists and center-right
politicians on the committee want to show that the prosecutors were
overly zealous and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left, including the government of D'Alema, hopes to
show that if anything, the prosecutors did not probe deeply enough.
The government reluctantly agreed to the commission, not because it
believed there was any need to re-examine Tangentopoli, but because
it wanted to woo socialist backing for its fragile center-left
coalition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political mistrust is so entrenched that few court decisions are
viewed as unassailable. At the funeral of the former Socialist
prime minister, Bettino Craxi, who fled to Tunisia before he was
convicted on corruption charges stemming from Tangentopoli, some of
his supporters hurled insults at government representatives who
attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   But not even his supporters maintain that Craxi, who was
convicted in two separate trials, was innocent. Instead, they
insist that every political party accepted bribes and illegal
contributions, and that Craxi was unfairly singled out.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime
minister and media tycoon, has led the campaign to limit the power
of prosecutors. There are legal experts who agree that prosecutors
in Italy have too much power and that defendants' rights need to be
strengthened. But Berlusconi's motives can hardly be described as
impartial. He has been convicted three times on charges of false
accounting and illegal campaign financing, and is currently
awaiting trial on accusations that he sought to bribe judges.
</P>
<P>
   For all the political squabbling, however, Parliament did manage
to pass two reforms before the end of 1999. One law reduces from
three to one the number of judges who preside over most criminal
trials. It is aimed at speeding up trials that in Italy can drag on
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The other, passed in November, is called ``just trial.'' Most
important, the law obliges witnesses to testify in court and be
cross-examined, as is customary in the United States. (Before,
prosecutors could rely on affidavits signed by informants during
the police investigation, even those that reported hearsay.)
</P>
<P>
   The Italian legal system's dependence on the testimony of
hostile witnesses, most notably on ``pentiti '' _ defendants who
testify in exchange for liberty or shorter sentences _ has long
been under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, such testimony was used in trials in which the
defense could not cross-examine the accusers. And the Italian
witness-protection program allowed several pentiti to continue to
commit crimes while guests of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal of Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister
whose two trials on charges that he collaborated with the Mafia
while in office dragged on for years, was one of the most visible
blows to the credibility of pentiti.
</P>
<P>
   In a less noticed but equally telling ruling, a court in Palermo
earlier this month acquitted seven men charged with a 1995 bank
robbery _ and handed their accusers, mobsters turned state's
witnesses, far stiffer sentences than the ones they received from
plea bargaining.

 McAfee Hopes One Good Launch Leads to Another  &HT;     
 By KELLY ZITO  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hoping to build on the momentum of its spin-off McAfee.com, whose
price tripled in a stock market debut in December, Network
Associates will launch MyCIO.com, a Web site where businesses can
download antivirus and other security software.
<P>
   The site, which went online today under the direction of a new,
100-employee division within Santa Clara's Network Associates, aims
to be a Web-based provider of information technology services. CIO,
in this case, stands for chief Internet officer, rather than the
better-known chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is changing the (information technology)
business,'' said Zach Nelson, president and chief executive of
MyCIO. ``All businesses want to be e-businesses ... and things like
security are mission critical, but no one wants to spend time
building that expertise in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   The move illustrates a continuing shift within the traditional
packaged software industry to move products and services online as
the Internet emerges as a more efficient means of distribution than
brick-and-mortar stores. It also reflects an organizational change
for Network Associates, which sees itself becoming a holding
company of smaller entities built around its core antivirus and
security technology. Network Associates' traditional business model
has been based on consulting and software development.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, MyCIO will offer two products to potential
corporate clients _ VirusScan ASaP and CyberCop ASaP. The first
allows a company to purchase a certain number of ``agents'' which
sit on an employee's desktop. Each time a user signs on, the agent
automatically updates itself with new antivirus cures each day by
dialing into MyCIO. The cost of the service is $3.50 per user per
month and goes down as the number of users increases.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a way for a company to test the vulnerability of
its firewall _ usually the first line of defense against its
Internet-connected systems _ by bombarding it with models of known
hacker attacks. A group of six such scans costs $500.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually MyCIO hopes to expand its offerings to include
so-called ``availability'' applications, which assess and provide
reports on things like why a company's network is slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``(MyCIO) makes a lot of sense from a business strategy point of
view,'' said Erik Suppiger, analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``There are a lot
of organizations out there that are organizationally constrained
when it comes to IT. To the extent (companies) can outsource''
elements of their business that aren't a core competency, ``it's a
great efficiency for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that if the company meets its goals _ which include
about $20 million in sales in its first year _ Network Associates
hopes to spin MyCIO out into a separate business, and to eventually
take it public.
</P>
<P>
   So far, MyCIO has no signed agreements, but Nelson said he has
gotten calls from DuPont and United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Network Associates offered shares of
McAfee.com, which sells a range of consumer-oriented computer
maintenance and antivirus programs, to the public. Originally
priced at $12 per share, the stock soared to close at $44 on
Nasdaq. Since then, it's closed as high as $54.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the tracking stock gave a needed boost to its
parent, which retains 85 percent ownership in McAfee.com Inc.
Network Associates stock dropped more than 60 percent last year.

DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS TAKE OFF THE GLOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. _ An angry Al Gore finally fired back at Bill
Bradley Sunday, as the Democratic rivals all but labeled each other
liars and continued their unlikely showdown over two issues _
abortion and campaign fund-raising _ on which they almost entirely
agree.
</P>
<P>
   With some polls suggesting that the Democratic primary race is
tightening in the last days before the New Hampshire primary, Gore
abruptly abandoned the restraint he had demonstrated in recent days
as Bradley waged an escalating assault on the vice president's
honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest volley, Bradley Sunday accused Gore of falling
``into bed with special interests'' and called on the vice
president to fully explain his role in the ``disgrace'' of the 1996
campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley has attempted to manufacture differences where
there are none,'' Gore told more than 1,000 supporters at the
Hilltop Equestrian Center barn in Somersworth. ``Instead of
character, courage, and commitment, we have manipulative attack
after manipulative attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has seemed rattled in the late days of the election by
Bradley's unrelenting counterattack, which began last week in the
final debate before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is counting on a strong showing here to sustain his
insurgent candidacy, said he launched the offensive after silently
enduring for months Gore's attacks on his record. After battering
Gore for three days over the vice president's former opposition to
abortion, Bradley Sunday opened fire on a new front, zeroing in on
the 1996 scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to an overflow crowd at Franklin Pierce Law
Center in Concord, said the 1996 abuses were ``so tragic'' because
they damaged the Democratic Party's ``identity and credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Waving a copy of a story from the Feb. 7 issue of Fortune
magazine about Gore's 1996 fund-raising at a Buddhist temple near
Los Angeles and the vice president's association with key figures
in a federal investigation of the scandal, Bradley said, ``Quite
frankly, I think more explanation is needed about his
participation, and I believe that unless that explanation is
forthcoming, then the public will reject a candidacy next fall that
fails to come to terms with this circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Gore's electability, Bradley said, ``Unless we clean
up our own house, Republicans are going to clean that house up in
the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore, sometimes shouting, rejoined: ``Today, the
attack from Senator Bradley is on campaign finance reform. This,
coming from a man whose fund-raising has been strongly
criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Waving his arms to stir the crowd, Gore said, ``Why did Senator
Bradley raise these issues to divide Democrats? Maybe it's because
he can't answer real questions from real people about the very real
problems we need to be facing,'' Gore said, eliciting a loud roar
from the crowd, perhaps the biggest he has drawn in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' resisted several
efforts by reporters for him to call Gore a liar for his assertion
last week that he has always supported abortion rights. But Bradley
would say only that Gore's statement was ``not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley produced two letters on Saturday that Gore had written
to constituents _ one in 1984, the other in 1987 _ in which Gore
said abortion was ``arguably the taking of a human life.'' In the
1984 letter, Gore said he was personally opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe the same day, Gore
declined to say whether he personally opposed abortion, calling the
question irrelevant if one believes, as he does, that abortion is a
decision to be made by a woman. Gore pointed to his record of
support for abortion rights, going back more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the attack, coupled with Bradley's charges about Gore's
fund-raising practices, clearly put Gore on the defensive for the
first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Gore moved very close to unleashing the type of personal
attack on Bradley that he has accused Bradley of making. Gore said,
as he has in the past, that ``I haven't question his character, and
I will not. I haven't question his integrity, and I will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, meanwhile, summoned allies to stump for them in
the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   On Gore's behalf, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa,
characterized Bradley's attacks as an act of desperation in his
uphill fight against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed about what I am seeing come out of
Senator Bradley's campaign operation,'' Harkin told the crowd at
the equestrian center. ``It says that when the going gets tough,
and you find out you're not winning, that's not the time to get
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bradley has accepted ``$2.7 million in speaking fees''
from corporations, Harkin added, ``I don't need a lecture from''
him on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Former Labor secretary Robert Reich, a Bradley supporter, told
the Concord crowd, that he was ``very proud'' to have served in the
Clinton-Gore administration. ``But I'm not proud of this
administration on this issue,'' Reich said of the campaign finance
abuses. ``This is not only about campaign finance. It's also about
truth telling and integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also produced a statement by congressional
Democratic leaders, urging Bradley not to make negative attacks
that could weaken the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ``campaign has taken a sharp negative turn, and veered
into the kind of negative, personal attacks he has repeatedly
denounced,'' said the statement by House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, Democrat of Illinois, and Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Democrats, we urge that Senator Bradley's campaign remain
focused on the issues, and that he abandon negative, personal
attacks that do not bring credit to this nomination contest or the
Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley responded by releasing quotes from Gephardt in 1988
complaining about Gore's negative campaigning when both were
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sounding more like Al Haig than Al Gore,'' Gephardt
said in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Things got nasty outside the barn after Gore's speech. Senator
Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and Representative Jerrold
Nadler, Democrat of New York, had come to the event to defend
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and a Gore supporter, came barreling
out of the barn to rebut them. Other Gore supporters, a couple of
whom appeared to be volunteers, made derisive comments about
Nadler's weight, and called Kerrey, who recently announced his
retirement, ``a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any holier-than-thou lectures,'' Harkin told his
congressional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane, informed of the Gore
volunteers' comments about Nadler and Kerrey, said, ``They're
volunteers. They have a First Amendment right to say what they
want.''

COMMENTARY: PUTINISM LOOMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ A Russian doctor told the ambulance driver
to take his patient directly to the morgue. ``Why?'' cried the
patient. ``I'm not dead yet.'' ``Shut up,'' said the doctor,
``We're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That lugubrious joke is being told about Vladimir Putin, chosen
by the Kremlin clique to succeed Boris Yeltsin. In eight weeks,
riding a wave of war hysteria, this KGB apparatchik is likely to be
elected president _ to take his patient, Russia, to the cooler of
repression and autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton refuses to see this. In his whirlwind junket
to the annual Davos gathering of politicians, executives and
scientists, his lame-duck army of aides passed the word that Putin
could well be a closet democratic reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Americans here were already embarrassed by their president's
royal arrival. The day before, Britain's Tony Blair came with a
modest party of 15 to deliver his speech.
</P>
<P>
   But when hundreds of junketeering Clintonites descended on
Davos, meeting participants were ordered out of the hall to make
room for the huge entourage. When the offended audience resisted,
the Clinton traveling claque had to relent.
</P>
<P>
   More dismaying was the Clinton refusal to see that its Russia
policy _ by failing to tie economic aid to democratic reform and
property rights _ has been a flop. The result has been the takeover
of the government by a combination of corrupt oligarchs, the
internal police and the army.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's extended ``family'' put a KGB man in place, took
advantage of lawlessness in Chechnya to launch a popular war and
called a snap election to capitalize on the war fever. By so doing,
they avert prosecution for corruption and silence the beginnings of
a free press.
</P>
<P>
   It's working for them. An instant cult of personality has been
created for Putin _ tough-minded and lean-bodied, in contrast to
the staggering Yeltsin _ and he rides high astride his Chechen
warhorse. The army is with him: he pays the troops, and has raised
spending on armaments by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man whose basic principle is to have no inconvenient
principles. His first major political act was to double-cross the
fake reformers close to the Kremlin by making a deal with the
Communist Party. Now Putin controls the Kremlin while his new
Communist allies _ along with the wildman Vladimir Zhirinovsky _
dominate the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He is now counting on his generals to crush the Chechens before
March 26, election day, or at least to provide the illusion of
low-casualty victory until then. His surprise enemy at home is the
Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, a hard-to-harass group that
provides casualty figures 10 times greater than Kremlin
disinformation.
</P>
<P>
   He has been suppressing the truth by arresting journalists who
dare to report from the front lines and silencing independent TV
commentators. Media controlled by Boris Berezovsky, the Putin
sponsor reportedly denied entry to Davos by Swiss authorities, tout
the new Napoleon to the skies and besmear opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition is on the run. Names like Primakov and Luzhkov _
seemingly sure things for power six months ago _ have faded fast.
The Communist boss Zyuganov exists only as a foil with no future.
</P>
<P>
   The only real reformer left standing is Grigory Yavlinsky, who
suffered losses for daring to denounce the switch in goals from
anti-terrorism to all-out war. He is gutsily running again, but his
time won't come until Russians tire of stagnation, weary of war and
are no longer bamboozled by the Kremlin-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Putin is the oligarch-KGB-army choice. But his quick
popularity in polls rests on war fever; when that dissipates, so
may he. If he does not win a majority in the first round, the
fickle Russian public could drop him overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that a ``Putin era'' would mean an uncompetitive,
economically weakened Russia _ no threat to the West. A ``Yavlinsky
era'' would marry a literate work force to a free-market system
under law _ and Russia would soon compete as a world power.
</P>
<P>
   Those fearful of resurgence of Russian power prefer the surly
stagnation of what would come to be called Putinism. The more
hopeful of us wish the Russians a better life, but should be
careful what we wish for.

Where's do you buy phat clothes in Oaktown?
<P>
   Who's sells the best hip-hop?
</P>
<P>
   What up? What the dealio?
</P>
<P>
   It's Ask Jeeves' new Internet search service that will look for
answers to questions posed in the popular language of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Emeryville's Ask Jeeves Inc., today will announce a deal to
develop an ``urban street language'' database for Urban Cool
Networks Inc., a Web portal aimed at those in the hip, young urban
culture who may not be down with the Net just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Adding street language to the Internet is one way of helping
bridge the Digital Divide that is keeping some urban dwellers away
from the Web, said Jake Miles, founder and CEO of Urban Cool,
located in Dallas.

   ``There are millions of people at lower ends of the economic

<P>
   That way, a visitor to Urban Cool can find the best, or ``Pretty

<P>
   When an unusual meeting of African leaders and the Security
Council ended last week, there was general agreement that the
United Nations will have to be given a major role in bringing peace
to Congo. But when, and in what form, are still open questions that
are expected to dominate council discussions in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a former director of
U.N. peacekeeping, recommended that the Security Council, which has
already authorized sending 500 cease-fire monitors to Congo, add
5,537 troops. This would include infantry as well as medical,
communications, mine-clearance and air and water transportation
experts for a nearly roadless region. The start-up cost is
estimated at $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan said that 960,000 Congolese have been
displaced by the war and that they and another 300,000 refugees
from other wars in the region are dangerously short of food.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials say they see in Congo's complicated
war a challenge like no other that the organization has faced since
the Balkans disintegrated into ethnic warfare after the collapse of
European communism.
</P>
<P>
   Within the United Nations, even the word Congo has tragic
resonance. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold died on a Congo peace
mission in 1961 when his plane crashed in what is now Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the American representative, called the
unusual meeting of African presidents and ministers as January's
council president. He has been telling U.N. officials and members
of Congress that the Congo operation may be the United Nations'
last chance to prove it can get peacekeeping right. That was the
message he delivered directly to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on its recent field trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But other diplomats say that this assertion masks another
problem. Unless the United States allows the Security Council and
the U.N. peacekeeping department to mount a credible operation in
Congo, they say, the organization will be in danger of repeating
its experience in Somalia and Rwanda, two regional conflicts that
it proved unable to bring under control. .
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Rwanda, where a genocidal war in 1994 first
disrupted the region and drew Congo into the fighting, the United
States prevented the Security Council from acting for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke says that he is determined that this will not happen
again. But he also accepts that he has two huge tasks ahead. The
Clinton administration has agreed to give Congress 15 days notice
of Security Council resolutions creating U.N. peacekeeping
operations, for which the United States is billed more than 30
percent of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   So Holbrooke will have to persuade reluctant members of Congress
that skimping on Congo will lead to disaster. Congress already has
a law on the books saying that the United States will limit its
payments to 25 percent, and often balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Holbrooke has been urging African leaders, on
a trip there in December and in the Security Council in January, to
take more responsibility for the region. Without political will in
Africa, he tells them, nothing the United Nations tries can
possibly work. A few Africans left New York last week saying they
felt ``bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, African nations involved in the Congo war joined the
government of President Laurent Kabila in Lusaka, Zambia, where
they agreed on a peace accord. A month later they were all back at
war. By the fall, they were clamoring for international help, a
message delivered most bluntly last week by President Robert Mugabe
of Zimbabwe. He supports Kabila's government in its war with rebels
who are, in turn, backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In Security Council speeches last week, and in a statement of
purpose that followed the meetings, African leaders coupled their
calls for U.N. peacekeepers with new pledges to put their Lusaka
agreement into practice. Britain's representative, Sir Jeremy
Greenstock, welcomed African commitments to peace. But reflecting
the skepticism of many at the United Nations, he noted that the
world had been pleading with Africans for action for some time, but
``frankly, they weren't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   The deep divisions between Congo and its neighbors, evident even
in public speeches last week, were reportedly even more pronounced
in closed-door meetings among the African leaders, Annan and
American and other officials and diplomats. One Western official
said that by the end of the council deliberations Wednesday there
was ``blood on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Considerable attention was focused last week on Kabila, who made
his first trip to the United States and apparently went home less
convinced of American support for his enemies, Rwanda and Uganda.
Kabila's American public relations aides were elated with his trip
and say that he plans to return in May, hoping to talk with
American companies about more investment in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and American officials see hope in economic
pressures. All the nations involved in the Congo war are now
feeling the costs of that involvement and are looking for a way to
withdraw without a loss of dignity, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The political will to take that step, the secretary-general's
report says, is not only what matters most but is also the basic
condition for peace.

 Designing Products Based on Real Life  &HT;       
 By Peter Kupfer  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jack Whalen surveyed real estate agent Cid Young's home/office in
Moss Beach with the keen eye of a tax assessor. As Young described
her daily routine, Whalen listened attentively, occasionally
jotting down notes or training his digital camera on the blizzard
of papers and Post-it notes scattered around the room.
<P>
   Why, Whalen asked, did Young have three computers? Wouldn't it
be easier, he wondered, to use computerized forms instead of paper
ones? How does she access the Multiple Listing Service that is the
lifeblood of every real estate agent?
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, Whalen isn't an IRS auditor. Nor is he a
documentary filmmaker. He's a sociologist from Xerox's legendary
Palo Alto Research Center studying how people who work out of their
homes and on the road access the vital information they need to do
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He's among a growing number of social scientists hired by
technology companies to conduct ethnographic research, a branch of
anthropology that studies human culture. But unlike Margaret Mead
and other academics, the ethnographers who toil in the technology
industry have been hired with the idea that their observations and
insights will lead to the development of new products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like a reconnaissance mission,'' said David
Frohlich, a psychologist specializing in conversation analysis at
Hewlett-Packard's research center in Bristol, England. ``You're
mapping out the landscape, constantly foraging for opportunities
for new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In years past, product development in the technology industry
was largely driven by engineers, who usually designed products
based on their own interests and left the marketing department with
the task of finding consumers to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But with the accelerating pace of technological innovation,
product cycles are measured in weeks rather than years. Many
companies are finding that it makes better business sense to design
products based on what consumers want rather than what engineers
think they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, you had a bunch of white middle-aged guys
sitting around saying, `This is what I like and this is what my
wife likes, so let's make that,' '' said Marietta Baba, chairwoman
of the Anthropology Department at Wayne State University in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Baba, who has conducted ethnographic studies for automakers and
technology companies, said that the increasing globalization of
markets makes such an ethnocentric approach to product design
impractical. For example, a black cell phone with myriad functions
designed for the U.S. market may hold little attraction in Latin
America, where bright colors and simpler designs are preferred.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for information about consumer behavior has taken
ethnographers to some unlikely places and has sometimes yielded
surprising results.
</P>
<P>
   When Intel sent John Sherry to Alaska to research a salmon
fishery, he discovered that the tender who picked up the day's
catch from the fishermen had duct-taped a notebook computer to the
outside of his cabin. The reason? The tender had to keep a lot of
records and that was the most convenient spot for him to enter the
data. The study, dubbed ``Fish and Chips,'' helped Intel understand
the importance of designing microprocessors capable of withstanding
extreme weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When Motorola sent anthropologist Jean Canavan to the Caspian
Sea region to investigate business opportunities in the emerging
markets of Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan, she found that
savvy consumers had learned to read the bar codes on cell phones to
find out where they were manufactured. Those made in the United
States, Canavan discovered, were considered more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Another Motorola study found that Chinese businessmen working in
rural areas with no telephone service had developed an elaborate
system of using pagers to send coded messages. That discovery led
Motorola to develop a two-way pager for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of office workers in England, Hewlett-Packard's
Frohlich noticed a recurring theme: Workplace communications almost
always involved documents. ``We realized that something that could
bring together people's conversations and printed documents would
be very useful,'' he said. That finding led to the development of
the DeskSlate, a device that connected to a telephone and allowed
users to view a document and listen to voice mail about that
document at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every field trip leads to a product idea. Intel
sent a team of three ethnographers to observe families in Europe
last summer. The team shadowed their subjects from morning to
night, following them in their homes and workplaces, to
neighborhood cafes and restaurants, through parks and markets. The
researchers took thousands of photographs, hundreds of hours of
audio recordings and reams of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings was that life in Europe revolves around the
family to a far greater extent than in the United States. ``In
Europe, business conforms to life,'' said Tony Salvador, an
experimental psychologist at Intel who participated in the study.
``In the United States, life conforms to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the research has not resulted in any specific products,
it has given the company a better grasp of an important market.
``Europe is a place we don't understand as well as we should,''
said Christine Riley, who oversees ethnographic research at Intel.
``This was an investment in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the seminal ethnography studies by a technology company
was conducted by Lucy Suchman, a young anthropologist hired by
Xerox PARC in 1979. Suchman made a now-famous film showing office
workers struggling to do a copying job on a Xerox machine. After
viewing the film, Xerox engineers concluded that simplicity was
more important than fancy features. That finding gave rise to the
large green button to make a single, fuss-free copy that is now a
prominent feature on almost every Xerox machine, no matter how
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Another Xerox study discovered that the company's repair
technicians often learned how to fix troublesome machines during
informal exchanges with their colleagues. ``They swapped war
stories at restaurants and bars, and embedded in those stories were
diagnostic clues and procedures,'' said Baba. ``This was a major
 &LR; aha &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Xerox equipped its repair technicians with mobile
phones to facilitate the exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Suchman study, almost every major technology company,
and many smaller firms, have integrated ethnographic research into
their product development process.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnographers say their approach has a number of advantages over
traditional market research techniques such as surveys and focus
groups. For one thing, ethnography entails first-hand observations
of what people do in their everyday lives, as opposed to what they
say they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people say and what they do are often very different,''
said Susan Squires, president of the National Association for the
Practice of Anthropology and a founder of GVO, a technology
consultancy in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   One example of this disparity involved a major management
consulting firm that hired Squires' outfit to evaluate the
feasibility of installing video-conferencing technology in its
offices around the world. When Squires interviewed company
executives, they were enthusiastic about the idea and couldn't wait
to get the new technology. But when a prototype of the system was
installed in the offices of several executives, almost every one of
them turned the cameras off in short order because they found them
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic mismatch,'' Squires said. Her company
recommended delaying the installation, and the client saved
millions of dollars on unnecessary technology.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of ethnographic research is that it can be
done relatively quickly. Although some studies take months, or even
years, to complete (Hewlett-Packard's Frohlich once spent three
years observing and analyzing the telephone habits of a single
English family), others can be done in a matter of weeks or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rapid pace of technological change, you need to find
out what is going on out there, and you need to find out fast,''
said Baba. ``Big surveys can take months. Ethnography is fast.'' A
sound methodology, she said, will translate into valuable insights
in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnographers commonly have degrees in anthropology, sociology
or psychology, but some technology firms are casting a wider net in
their quest for knowledge about consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, an Internet consultancy in Cambridge, Mass., and one of
the pioneers in ethnographic research, for example, has a workforce
that includes historians, actors, theologians, literary critics and
even a cookbook author. What this wildly eclectic group has in
common, said Rick Robinson, Sapient's chief experience officer, is
that ``they are all good at observing the relationship between
people and culture and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Moss Beach, Xerox researcher Whalen called it a day
after spending nearly four hours observing Young as she worked in
her office and visited a nearby house she was trying to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the lab, Cid is just another real estate agent,'' Whalen
said. ``But out here, she comes alive. That's the beauty of
ethnography. You can't design products for someone unless you can
see the richness and uniqueness of their world. That's lost in the
laboratory.''

 ExciteAtHome Hopes Security Tool Calms Users  &HT;       
 By Todd Wallack  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
For years, ExciteAtHome executives have earnestly tried to fend off
criticism that their high-speed Internet cable service is wide open
to hackers.
<P>
   Now, the Redwood City company seems to be conceding it is losing
the public relations battle.
</P>
<P>
   In a stark admission that many customers continue to be worried
about intruders, ExciteAtHome today plans to team up with
McAfee.com to sell subscribers a sophisticated computer security
tool, called a firewall, that is normally only used to guard
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ExciteAtHome executives still insist that the vast
majority of its customers don't need to install a firewall on their
home PC. But company representatives said they hope the McAfee deal
will calm those subscribers who are particularly worried about
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical deal since there is an overwhelming, albeit
incorrect, feeling that broadband (or high-speed service) is less
secure than 56k (traditional modem service),'' said ExciteAtHome
spokeswoman Jacqueline Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome concedes there were major security flaws when cable
modem service first became available a few years ago. Because
Microsoft's Windows operating system makes it easy to share files
with other computers, subscribers sometimes discovered they could
just as easily browse documents stored on their neighbors'
computers. ExciteAtHome's service is delivered over traditional
cable TV lines, which are shared among neighboring homes much like
a telephone party line.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome said subscribers can easily solve that problem
by turning off the option to share files. Indeed, ExciteAtHome
technicians try to make sure that is done when setting up new
subscribers. Executives say their newer equipment also helps
prevent the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say that all high-speed links, including cable
modems and phone companies' digital subscriber lines (DSL), are
attractive targets for hackers because the computers are often
connected to the Net around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   With conventional dial-up access, most customers are only on for
an hour or so at a time _ giving hackers less time to break in and
use the computer. Plus, each time users log on again, they are
normally assigned a different Internet address (called an IP
address), making it harder for the hacker to find them and break in
a second time.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ExciteAtHome subscribers normally keep the same IP
address for months at a time, making them tastier targets. ``Those
of us with cable modems and DSL connections are watching the
systems be scanned for security vulnerabilities several times a
day,'' said Mudge, a Boston hacker and computer security expert
best known for telling a congressional committee that he and his
colleagues could shut down the Internet in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jay Rolls, ExciteAtHome's vice president of network
engineering, concedes ``the exposure is higher'' when a computer is
connected to the Internet around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome executives insist that the average user running
a Mac or PC with Windows doesn't need to install a firewall.
</P>
<P>
   Mike StJohns, a network architect with the company, said only
advanced users are likely to be hit by hackers. That would include
people using their PC to host a Web site, those running Linux
(which is similar to the Unix programs frequently targeted by
hackers invading corporate networks) or those trying to link their
computer to a home network. Also vulnerable are users who download
many files from a variety of Web sites without running antivirus
software. StJohns said users doing more sophisticated tasks also
need more sophisticated security.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome said it won't distribute the firewall product,
called McAfee Personal Firewall. But McAfee paid ExciteAtHome an
undisclosed amount of money to pitch the product to its customers.
McAfee, a unit of Santa Clara's Network Associates, also agreed to
give ExciteAtHome customers a discount and let them try it out free
for 90 days. Russo said prices haven't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell spokesman Shawn Dainas said his company, which
offers DSL high-speed links to California customers, is considering
similar security deals. But he couldn't resist using the
announcement to crow about cable modem's past security problems.
``There has always been a concern with cable modems because
neighbors share the network,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. analyst Jeanette Noyes said it's
awkward for ExciteAtHome to peddle high-power security tools while
insisting the cable service is nearly invincible to hackers. But
she noted that the company has to appeal both to novice users ``who
probably don't need and wouldn't know how to use'' a firewall, as
well as power users who want the service for their home business or
to power a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Noyes said demand for both DSL and cable modem
service hasn't been slowed by security concerns. Between 1 percent
and 2 percent of homes now subscribe to the fast Net service, and
both cable and telephone companies are scrambling to keep up with
orders.

MIXED NOTICES FOR THE TOUGHER BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Trent Thompson sees a lot of things in former
Sen. Bill Bradley that he likes, from his down-to-earth style to
his ideas for expansive government. But when Bradley began accusing
Vice President Al Gore of being dishonest last week, it tweaked
Thompson's loyal Democratic sensibilities in an unpleasant way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore has a lot of integrity,'' said Thompson, a
31-year-old physician. ``I think he's being unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark underscores the problem Bradley faces as he ratchets
up his attacks on Gore's integrity in the final days before New
Hampshire's primary on Tuesday, the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than a week ago that Bradley drastically shifted
gears in his insurgent campaign, dropping his reasoned, soft-spoken
responses to Gore's brass-tacks criticisms of him and beginning a
full-throated attack against Gore's character.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had not been honest in this campaign, Bradley and his
surrogates began asserting _ about his record on abortion, about
his proposals for health care and gun control, about his role in
campaign finance abuses by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new, get-tough tone cheered many of Bradley's strongest
supporters here, who had grown dispirited by Bradley's falling poll
numbers and by a steady diet of anti-Bradley criticism from the
vice president's camp.
</P>
<P>
   But to many independent voters, many undecided Democrats and
even some of Bradley's supporters, the insurgent's brash new tone
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   To some Democrats, Bradley seems to be trying to tar the vice
president with President Clinton's ethical problems, which to them
seems unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   To others, Bradley's new attacks are reminiscent of what they
like least about politics: the bickering and negative tit-for-tat.
</P>
<P>
   And to some of his supporters, Bradley's new approach seems to
rub against the grain of what they liked most about him: his gentle
style, his idealism, his anti-politics politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea that he's changed his approach,'' said
Steve Harvey, a 51-year-old independent voter who came to see
Bradley speak in a college bar in Durham Sunday. ``I'd like to see
someone who stays above the fray as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Morris, an undecided Democrat, liked Bradley enough to
venture out Sunday night to hear him speak in a packed auditorium
at Phillips Exeter Academy. But he said he had been disappointed by
Bradley's performance in a debate last Wednesday, finding him a
little naive, even annoying, when he began bitterly complaining
about Gore's attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded a bit childish,'' said Morris, 48, a space science
researcher at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was not impressed by Bradley's assertion that
Gore is not honest. ``The most truthful president in my lifetime
was Jimmy Carter, and it didn't do much for him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's attacks against Gore for 1996 campaign finance abuses
also seemed to upset some Democrats who feel that the Clinton-Gore
campaign's aggressive fund-raising, while questionable, was
necessary to accomplish Democratic goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bothered by what happened in the 1996 campaign,'' said
Thompson. ``But the Clinton administration has done good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides say the people criticizing him for punching back
at Gore seem to have forgotten that the vice president started the
fight by slashing at Bradley's record and campaign agenda months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly, Bradley's new assertiveness is playing well among
his staunchest supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fired up finally,'' said Silvie Thierry, 61, who came to
see Bradley speak in Concord Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago, I was worried that he wouldn't be able to
handle the Republicans, that he was too much Mr. Nice Guy. Now I'm
more confident.''

   TOKYO _ Internet hackers posted messages on the Web site of
Japan's postal service Sunday criticizing this country's wartime
role in China in the 1930s, as a series of similar attacks over the
last week began to look like a daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 government agencies here have been attacked by the
hackers. In each incident, they have denounced Japan's involvement
in the so-called Nanjing Massacre, or Rape of Nanking, the
murderous 1937 sacking of that city by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
   The security breaches, which have affected the Science and
Technology Agency, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Japan, the
Finance Ministry and the Defense Ministry, among others, have
deeply embarrassed the Japanese government, which has rushed to set
up a task force to catch the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Perceiving that it lags behind the United States in Internet
technologies, the Japanese government has been pushing use of the
Web for government information and services as a top priority. But
after the recent incidents, many commentators here have said that
Internet security seems to have been something of an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Japanese government security in
cyberspace is that the government leaders know little about
technology,'' Raisuke Miyawaki, a former chief cabinet spokesman
and now an independent security analyst, told the newspaper Nihon
Keizei Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have also served to keep attention focused on
Japan's wartime role, a source of continuing tension between Japan
and China and other Asian nations that were occupied by Japanese
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over Japan's wartime atrocities were revived last week
when nationalist groups held a conference in Osaka at which
revisionist historians and others gave speeches denying that there
had been any large-scale massacre at Nanjing and disparaging
Japan's critics.
</P>
<P>
   China criticized Japan bitterly for the conference, warning that
it would oppose Osaka's bid to be the host city for the Olympics
unless the Japanese government took action against similar
conferences in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has said that it
would be an infringement of free speech to prevent people from
holding conferences on controversial subjects, but it has called
the Nanjing Massacre a regrettable fact of history.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional historical accounts of the December 1937 attack on
Nanjing hold that the Japanese occupiers killed 60,000 to 300,000
people, including thousands of civilians and prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Internet attacks Sunday, a message in English
holding Japan responsible for the Nanjing killings appeared as a
Web page added to the site of the Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry in Naha, the capital of Okinawa province.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hackers inserted an image of a Japanese flag and a
Chinese message in red characters, including the phrase ``Tokyo
Massacre,'' on the site of the Government Data Research Center in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, a Web site of a nonprofit organization
affiliated with the prime minister's office was attacked with a
similar message.
</P>
<P>
   Another attack erased most of the contents of the Web site
operated by the National Personnel Authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Web site of the Bank of Japan was attacked at
least 1,600 times by hackers, said a bank spokesman, Satoru
Yamadera.

 Drug Companies Battle Over Patent for Enzyme Used in DNA Testing  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A pinch of mugwort, a drop of lemon balm, these are the elements of
a witch's brew. But the real sorcery of the modern age is the
manipulation of DNA, and here one of the magic ingredients has been
an enzyme named Taq.
<P>
   Originally found in bacteria living in the hot springs of
Yellowstone, Taq speeds up the widely used process that amplifies
trace amounts of DNA in order to create enough material for
scientific study.
</P>
<P>
   Every time an AIDS patient gets an HIV viral load test, or a
forensics expert studies a DNA sample from a crime scene, a bit of
Taq, or a related enzyme, goes into the test tube along with the
genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   A pinch of Taq only costs 30 cents to 65 cents, but with all the
DNA work being done in commercial and academic labs, not to mention
the genome-mapping programs, those many dime-sized doses add up to
a chemical market worth $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why this innocent enzyme is at the heart of a
7-year-old legal battle between Roche Molecular Systems of Alameda,
which owns the Taq patent, and Promega Corp., a Wisconsin firm
which Roche has accused of selling this chemical without a license.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been argued in the San Francisco court of U.S.
District Judge Vaughn Walker who, any year now, will finally settle
the contractual and patent haggles and decide who owes whom money
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But this protracted dispute offers a hint of what may be in
store as commercial firms race to file conflicting patents on human
genes and the chemicals used to identify and manipulate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Taq story begins in 1987, when scientists at the now-defunct
Cetus Corp. in Berkeley patented polymerase chain reaction. PCR
turns small amounts of DNA into large amounts of DNA. The process
involves adding an enzyme to DNA, heating the mixture, then cooling
it, again and again, doubling the amount of DNA present with each
heating and cooling cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the subsequent discovery _ and patenting _ of Taq
that made it easy to automate PCR. The first enzymes used during
PCR were degraded by rising temperatures. Someone had to stand
around to add a pinch of enzyme between each cycle during the four
hour process.
</P>
<P>
   Taq could take the heat. After Cetus patented this enzyme in
1989, PCR machines became common. Scientists could throw a dash of
Taq into a test tube with some DNA, put the tube in a PCR machine,
and walk away while the machine went through its cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made PCR faster and more practical for a whole host of
applications,'' said Thomas White, senior vice president of Roche
Molecular. Roche entered the picture in 1991, when it purchased
Cetus's &LR;  patents for PCR and Taq. Roche has licensed these patents
to some 27 vendors who supply the market for DNA test equipment and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But Promega, relying on a contract signed with Cetus in 1990,
has refused to bow to Roche's licensing terms, and since 1992 they
each have spent millions to argue their conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Promega) act as if they're carrying on this crusade,''
said Roche Molecular's President Kathy Ordo &LR; n &LR; ez, making quote
marks in the air. Ordo &LR; n &LR; ez said Roche has used some of the profits
from Taq sales to create new types of DNA tests like one that
measures HIV virus in the bloodstream, which has opened up new
types of treatment. She characterized Promega's conduct as
``piracy,'' which undercuts such advances.
</P>
<P>
   Promega, which says it was selling Taq before Cetus got its
patent, says it was first bullied by Cetus, and now by Roche, and
isn't going to take it anymore. It has used the case to attack the
validity of the Taq patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think their patent was fraudulently obtained, and so far
the judge seems to agree with us,'' said Promega President Bill
Litton, who was cheered by a preliminary decision in December
invalidating one of Roche's patents.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Promega were in San Francisco last week as their case
winds slowly through the legal sausage grinder.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the eventual decision on Taq is the warning
this case should send up about the mass of patents being filed on
human genes. At least 10,000 are stacked up in the patent office,
with more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech observers realize that many of these patents will have
conflicting claims. Someone will use this enzyme to identify that
gene, while someone else uses a different chemical, leading to
potential conflicts over primacy of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these conflicts will land in the lap of some federal
judge, who will then spend years sifting through legal arguments
and expert testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent completion of the human genome map has been
heralded as the next fundamental advance in medical knowledge. And
that it may eventually be. But as the Taq case illustrates, in the
rush to patent genes we could be stirring up a legal cauldron of
double, double, toil and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Resurrection: &LR;  Fourteen months ago, I wrote about
Neurobiological Technologies Inc., a biotech firm in Richmond that
was trying desperately to raise enough cash to carry on clinical
trials of a pain-killing drug called Memantine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug showed some promise of relieving the unbearable nerve
tinglings associated with extreme forms of diabetes. It was also
being eyed as a possible pain reliever for nervous system disorders
associated with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Now NTI is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
CEO Paul Freiman recently announced that the company had achieved
positive results for a Phase II clinical trial of Memantine. In
November, it bolstered its short-term cash position with a $4.2
million private placement.
</P>
<P>
   NTI was delisted from Nasdaq in 1997 when the company was at its
lowest point, and now trades as an over-the-counter stock. Its
recent efforts, combined with a resurgent biotech stock sector,
have allowed its shares to surge from $1 in September to $5.38,
although it was off 25 cents on Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging as it sounds, Freiman has a big challenge ahead. He
must find a drug company willing to fund a Phase III study, costing
on the order of $10 million, in return for a license to market a
diabetes pain reliever with a market potential of between $150
million and $300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone in Washington, D.C., Freiman said he's
confident some company will take the bet _ even though a large
percentage of drug candidates fail in the third and final stage of
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big pharmaceutical companies need drugs, and we have a good
candidate,'' said Freiman, adding that his relatively low-cost
trial ``is tip money for a big company.''
</P>
<P>
   Freiman said he's hopeful of announcing a deal by April, when
NTI presents the full data from its study _ so far it has only
released a summary _ before the American Academy of Neurology. Stay
tuned.

MOVIE, MUSIC INDUSTRIES TAKE ON DIGITAL DUPES  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Like the sheriff in an old B-grade Western, Jack Valenti wants to
draw a line in the sand.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of the Motion Picture Association of America sees a new
gang of digital outlaws a-ridin' in, bent on pillaging his town _
Hollywood. He doesn't want to allow the same kind of rampant
digital piracy that he says has beset the record industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to file a thousand lawsuits a day, we'll do it,''
said a defiant Valenti. ``It's less expensive than losing control
of all your creative works.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the MPAA and other industry groups have filed several
lawsuits in the past month trying to stop a variety of Web site
operators from spreading the tools that entertainment companies
fear open the door to widespread digital piracy of movies and
music.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side of the showdown, the so-called outlaws say
they have the law on their side, including the shield of the First
Amendment rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   They say the technological advances that let consumers download
digital music, books and eventually top-flight films right from the
Internet to their homes are already bringing a new sheriff to town.
</P>
<P>
   That means the old-guard entertainment industry leaders will
either have to get with the program, or get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about hacking, it's not about copyright infringement,
it's not about piracy,'' said Tom McGuire, vice president of
communication for the Electronic Frontier Foundation of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is evolving at such a fast pace and it is so
empowering to consumers that (consumer-driven technical innovation)
is going to happen. The motion picture business would be better off
embracing what's going on and not villain-izing everybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in intellectual property and entertainment say the
motion picture industry's battle against hackers is the latest in a
number of important showdowns over who will control distribution of
traditional consumer entertainment, like music, books and film, in
the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment community is a lot more concerned about
(piracy) because they see their traditional strength _ their
stranglehold on distribution _ evaporating,'' said Eric Doney, a
Marin attorney who has specialized in intellectual property issues
for the software industry since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA, the DVD Copy Control Association and the Recording
Industry Association of America have been involved in a flurry of
court activity in the past two months that highlight some of the
changing forces at work.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Morgan Hill's DVD Copy Control Association sued 99
hackers and Web site operators for posting the code to a free
software program called De-CSS, which can be used to unlock the
program that scrambles movies recorded on DVDs, or digital
versatile discs.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD association alleged the descrambling code amounted to
theft of its intellectual property, a DVD Content Scrambling
System, or DVD CSS, devised to make it difficult, although not
impossible, to make illegal copies of movies recorded on DVD. The
code was crucial for the DVD industry to convince major film
studios to trust putting their movies in that format.
</P>
<P>
   The De-CSS code was originally posted on the Web in October by
Norwegian teenager Jon Johansen and a group called the Masters of
Reverse Engineering and picked up by thousands of Web sites
worldwide. Norwegian authorities last week raided the 16-year-old
Johansen's home and confiscated his personal computers, some disks
and a mobile phone, according to press reports from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The De-CSS code, the author of which is still unknown, allows
users of the Linux computer operating system to play back DVDs on
their machines. Linux supporters say they had no choice but to hack
because the DVD industry has only licensed devices that play back
DVDs on machines using Windows or Macintosh operating systems, but
refuse to support alternatives like Linux because the market is
still too small.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown continues, as the DVD Copy Control Association said
its code is available for license to anyone wishing to produce a
Linux DVD player, but no one has applied. The MPAA, meanwhile,
contends that no matter what, the hackers simply broke the law when
they broke the code.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, whose online civil liberties group has stepped in to
help fight the suits, said the 1998 federal Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, which allows programmers to legally reverse engineer
software to make them more useful, allows the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a single example of anyone doing anything remotely
like piracy here,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said posting the code on the Web was no different than
writing and posting a good poem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fundamental component of the way open systems
software is created, designed and improved. If this kind of
activity had been made illegal, Linux might not be around today,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On January 21, Santa Clara County Judge William J. Elfving
issued a preliminary injunction of 21 defendants named in the suit
to stop posting the De-CSS code.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day earlier, a New York judge issued an injunction in a
similar lawsuit the MPAA filed against three Web site operators in
New York and Connecticut who also posted the De-CSS code.
</P>
<P>
   And on the same day, the MPAA joined the four major U.S. TV
broadcast networks and two professional sports leagues in a suit to
block a Canadian Web site, iCraveTV.com, from retransmitting
over-the-air broadcasts of TV shows and movies through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the record industry, which has been struggling for
two years with the widespread digital copying and distribution of
songs on the Internet spurred by the MP3 revolution, got into the
act.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America filed a copyright
infringement suit in New York against MP3.com. The complaint claims
a new service that allows users to instantly hear music from the
San Diego Web site and add their personal music to a playlist for
others was a copyright infringement, a charge MP3.com refutes.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA also went to court in December to sue a small San Mateo
online company called Napster, which the group claims ``facilitates
music piracy'' by allowing millions of people to share and swap
digital songs with each other over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are already huge for the worldwide recording
industry, which claims counterfeit CDs and illegally downloaded
songs cost them $4.5 billion each year in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry doesn't face as immediate a threat from
digital piracy, although it estimates the losses from pirated VHS
movies amount to about $3 billion a year. Valenti said bootleg
copies of first-run films like ``Toy Story II,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut''
and ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' were available even before
they were released in theaters. Copies of ``Phantom Menace'' were
on as many as 400 Web sites when the movie first came out last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there are several barriers to making a DVD copy. For
one thing, a DVD disc holds about 5.2 gigabytes of data, an
impractical amount for most home computer users to copy, and it
would take about 40 hours to download the same data off the
Internet using a 56-Kbps modem.
</P>
<P>
   And the price of a writable DVD disc is still about $50 each,
about twice the cost of buying a prerecorded DVD movie. Consumer
electronic companies Samsung and Panasonic have announced plans to
introduce DVD recorders later this year, but the units will cost at
least $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But those barriers could fall over time with the increase of
high-speed Internet cable and DSL services and digital satellite
services. The movie industry itself is slowly moving toward the day
when instead of shipping analog film on reels, studios beam
first-run movies digitally to theaters. Experts say this will
inevitably spur some hacker to devise a method of tapping into
those transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti recently told a congressional subcommittee that with
future methods of digital recording and transmission, ``our
ramparts are being breached on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the outcomes of the current flurry of court
suits will go a long way in shaping consumer entertainment of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But as the recording industry has found with the spread of
MP3-formatted songs, trying to stop every digital bootleg movie or
song on the vast World Wide Web will be virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that they can absolutely control distribution
overstates their solutions,'' said attorney Eric Doney, of Donahue,
Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and recording industries instead are taking the path
set by software companies, which fight piracy through a combination
of consumer education and selective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're educating the public on what is right and what is
wrong,'' Doney said. ``They're combining enforcement as the stick
and the carrot of education, and in general, it's worked.''
</P>
<P>
   And software companies have worked to improve their wares so
that consumers are inclined to buy legitimate software that comes
with support and upgrades, rather than using bootleg copies that
may crash.
</P>
<P>
   Changing consumer perception of copied digital music or movies
may prove more challenging than with software, however. Unlike
copying a VHS tape, the 100th digital copy of a song or movie is
just as good as the original, and there are no support issues.
``They've got to do something to make their original product
something that's not easily matched on the outside'' in pirated
versions, Doney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Garon, a professor of entertainment law at the Western State
University College of Law in Fullerton, said the movie industry is
using digital piracy as ``a rallying cry'' that is more show than
substance. But he said the industry needs to start embracing the
technology soon or get left behind in the stampede.
</P>
<P>
   The major record labels are already moving quickly to control
Internet music distribution. The biggest example is the recent
merger agreement between record giant EMI and Time Warner, which
itself is merging with Internet powerhouse America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the majority of the studios recognize where the
industry could head,'' Garon said.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs the studios are waking up. This month,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Blockbuster agreed to develop and test a
way to make MGM's movies available for download into homes via
Blockbuster's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Porteneuve, MGM's corporate communications director, said
the two companies have not figured how to make digital movie
downloading work, but ``the great hope is that we have something to
show by year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the entertainment industry will ever be able
to get their arms around piracy completely,'' Porteneuve said.
``It's the same with films and video and any other forms of
entertainment products; it's always been the subject of piracy.
It's a matter of us doing our best to circumvent that piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said he's not opposed to the coming new digital world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we're going to have films borne by some digital
delivery system, like the Internet or cable or satellite, it has to
be protected from those who would steal it,'' he said. ``That's a
simple declaration.''

 Ask Jeeves, Urban Cool Take the Web to the Street  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Where's do you buy phat clothes in Oaktown?
<P>
   Who's sells the best hip-hop?
</P>
<P>
   What up? What the dealio?
</P>
<P>
   It's Ask Jeeves' new Internet search service that will look for
answers to questions posed in the popular language of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Emeryville's Ask Jeeves Inc., today will announce a deal to
develop an ``urban street language'' database for Urban Cool
Networks Inc., a Web portal aimed at those in the hip, young urban
culture who may not be down with the Net just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Adding street language to the Internet is one way of helping
bridge the Digital Divide that is keeping some urban dwellers away
from the Web, said Jake Miles, founder and CEO of Urban Cool,
located in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of people at lower ends of the economic
scale that aren't on the Internet,'' Miles said. ``Getting them
access, we believe, is just part of the solution. The other part is
that the Internet is not relevant to them. The Internet does not
speak their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Cool, which links to about 6,000 urban business and
consumer sites, has struck a deal to have Ask Jeeves create a
specialized version of natural language search technology to
include common street idioms not found in Webster's dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   That way, a visitor to Urban Cool can find the best, or ``Pretty
Hot and Tight'' clothing in Oakland. And a search for hip-hop style
music or clothing in Atlanta won't come with ways to get
hip-replacement surgery or hops for beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone uses the old term `homey,' it will be able to
recognize that as well,'' Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Cool, at &LR;  www.urbancool.com &LR; , also plans to install a
network of high-speed Internet kiosks in 25 urban markets and has
announced plans for an initial public offering.

BARAK VISITS EGYPT'S LEADER TO GIVE PEACE EFFORT A PUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel held three
hours of talks here Sunday with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in
an effort to re-energize Middle East peace efforts on several
fronts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders gave few details about their discussion, but
Barak said he remained hopeful that the stalled negotiations with
Syria would soon resume and that new talks with the Palestinians,
which began Sunday, would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators settled in for what was described by
both sides as serious and intensive talks at an undisclosed
location in Jerusalem aimed at bridging the wide gulf on difficult
issues like refugees, the status of Jerusalem and the contours of a
possible Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had set Feb. 13 as a deadline for achieving at least a
framework agreement on the outstanding issues, with a further aim
of reaching a full-fledged treaty with the Palestinians by
September.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of talks has been attended by a flurry of
diplomatic activity. In addition to Barak's visit to Egypt,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and with Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister,
at the site of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, commenting in Davos on the sputtering Middle East
negotiations, optimistically compared them to an Alpine walk in
winter. ``It's a lot like walking across the path here and slipping
occasionally, then getting back on track, or moving from summit to
summit through valleys and basically trudging along through snow
and ice and trying to get to an end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa soon left for Moscow, where another offshoot of Middle
East negotiations, a round of multilateral talks between Israel and
Arab countries, is set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the officials attending will be the Saudi foreign
minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, representing the Arab countries on
the Persian Gulf, and the foreign ministers of Israel, Jordan,
Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions will cover regional issues like water, trade and
security. Syria and Lebanon have boycotted the multilateral talks
since the Madrid peace conference on the Middle East in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On another diplomatic front, Dennis Ross, President Clinton's
envoy to the Middle East, is expected in Israel on Wednesday. Barak
is also set to meet with Arafat on Thursday or Friday and said in
Cairo that he would go to Jordan next week to meet with King
Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
   The missing link in the newly intensified peace effort is Syria,
which resumed talks with Israel in December after a break of nearly
four years. After a second round of negotiations in the United
States in mid-January, the talks again broke off.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials have said they want Barak to commit Israel to a
full withdrawal from the Golan Heights as the starting point of
talks, before discussions about security arrangements, opening of
normal relations and sharing of water. In remarks to reporters
after his meeting with Mubarak, Barak repeated his position that
talks should proceed without preconditions. But he added, ``We
respect the Syrians, their dignity, their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been criticized at home for taking on too much
at once by trying to negotiate simultaneously with the Syrians and
the Palestinians, the Israeli prime minister said he could handle
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we can, and should, move forward without trying
to play each track against the other,'' he said. ``If we try to do
it, at first it seems to be tempting, but it will end up with loss
of trust on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has long played a role as facilitator, message carrier,
adviser and booster in the often rocky relations between Israel and
other Arab countries. Mubarak said Sunday that he would continue to
act as a kind of consultant to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   He made a surprise visit to Syria last week to meet with
President Hafez Assad and has taken the lead among Arab countries
in pressing Israel to open its nuclear arms program to
international inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's nuclear weapons capacity, long a subject that Israeli
leaders have refused to discuss or even acknowledge, is one of the
topics that the Arab foreign ministers have said they want to talk
about in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak also dismissed suggestions that Barak would be hampered
by the controversy in Israel over allegations of illegal
contributions to his election campaign last year. The controversy,
Mubarak said, is an internal matter for Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a man who recently announced that he was
leaving public life, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was in the thick
of the fray last week, making a scathing case against Vice
President Al Gore and urging former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
to be more aggressive in doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   It's just business, Kerrey insisted, nothing personal, noting
that he had made a point of shaking Gore's hand on the night of the
State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that it's politics,'' Kerrey said. ``He said
it's maddening sometimes, but it's part of the process.'' Kerrey, a
56-year-old Democrat, said he simply had to make a choice in the
race for the Democratic nomination. And, he added, ``I see in Bill
Bradley the most uncorruptible politician I've ever met _ and I
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is tempting to see Kerrey's impassioned campaigning in
New Hampshire as one more chapter in a long-running feud between
Bob Kerrey and Bill Clinton _ who, by the way, were bitter rivals
for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Kerrey insisted again. ``I don't dislike the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he did once describe Clinton as ``an unusually good liar,''
but ``that was in an interview, and frankly I didn't expect it to
get out, and that's my own fault.'' Loaded in the Lexis-Nexis data
banks, he said, ``It sounds like I'm saying it all the time,
because it appears _ and, by the way, it was in many people's minds
a pretty good description of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a deftly done dig-while-denying-personal-animus,
something of a Washington art form. In fact, at this Friday morning
interview, Kerrey did not seem like a burnout case, saying a weary
farewell to politics, even though he declared less than two weeks
ago, when he announced that he would not seek re-election, ``I have
a spiritual, interpersonal and creative cistern that needs to be
filled back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey sighed. ``That's an unfortunate statement. First of all,
I loved the misinterpretation that occurred early. Some thought I
said `sister,' not `cistern,' which is a whole subject all by
itself.'' But Freudian slips aside, he said that his was not a case
of spiritual death by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get spiritually hollowed out in politics,'' he said.
``It's not as a consequence of being in politics. This could happen
if I were in the restaurant business or a journalist. It happens to
people in all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began when the possibility of a job in the private sector
was floated _ the presidency of New School University, although the
university won't comment _ and Kerrey found that he ``got more
enthusiastic than I should have if I was committed to running for
re-election.'' So, he explained, ``I stepped back for a couple of
weeks, talked to lots of friends, especially in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   While the political world buzzed, he wrote two statements, one
saying he was returning to private life, the other saying he was
not. ``The first one made me smile, the second one didn't. And that
still, quiet voice said it's time to go back to private life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of public soul-searching that makes people
either love or hate Bob Kerrey, who acquired the nickname Cosmic
Bob years ago in Nebraska. A Navy Seal who won the Medal of Honor
and lost a leg in Vietnam, fighting a war he came to oppose, Kerrey
was a rising political star as the governor of Nebraska, then
announced he would serve just one term and returned to private
life.
</P>
<P>
   He re-emerged a few years later as senator from Nebraska, the
darling of the pundits and his party's bright hope; he jumped into
the race for the Democratic nomination in 1992 but faltered early.
He considered, but decided against, another presidential run this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As governor and across two terms in the Senate, Kerrey was often
the quintessential inner-directed politician _ not running when he
was expected to run, not following his party's marching orders,
immersed in his own political journey. Even now, while announcing
his retirement, he notes that he has not ruled out a return to
electoral politics in some future campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was the experience that framed his life _ he spent nine
months in a Navy hospital, trying to recover from his wounds _ and
over the years he has become a symbol of an era and the unending
reflection it spawned. Does he ever get tired of being asked about
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I get tired of it, but it's like getting tired
of trying to figure out who you are. You can't stop. It's not
something you can ever stop doing. I think it's dangerous to stop
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey has two grown children in Nebraska and a significant
other, the writer Sarah Paley, in New York. When asked what he was
looking forward to most about private life, he responded, ``You can
observe, you can see, you can hang out with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to be a little more concrete, he replied: ``I'll use a
New York City example. I'm on a subway, and I'm not a senator.
People will come up and talk to you differently. They don't come up
and say, `I didn't like that vote you cast.' Or `What the hell are
you doing out here, riding the subway? Don't you work?'''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on his talks with New School University,
saying that he had wanted to decide first whether to seek
re-election, and then figure out what to do instead.
</P>
<P>
   But he has clearly thought about life in New York. ``I do like
it,'' he said. But, he added, ``I think if I lived there I'd miss
the sunrise and the sunset and the direct sunlight. I'd need to get
out to the flatland, out to the prairie, from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he was back in New Hampshire this past weekend,
in the eye of the political hurricane he has decided to leave. For
now.

BUSH, MCCAIN ATTRACT CROWDS AS CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Charging into the last hours of the New
Hampshire Republican race, Texas Governor George W. Bush Sunday
adopted the folksy approach used by his father in a successful
campaign here in 1988 while Senator John McCain made an emotional
appearance at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates attracted throngs of spectators at their public
events, though the pace of their schedule eased in late afternoon
as the campaign segued into a series of Super Bowl parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was greeted by an overflow crowd of 700 spectators packing
a gym at Alvirne High School in Hudson, while another 200 stood
outside to welcome the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, returned to Peterborough, where he hosted an
event last summer that attracted a handful of people. Sunday,
hundreds crowded into every available spot in the town hall to hear
the Arizona senator tell of his plans to deal with the Federal
surplus and to answer questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, seems to have concluded the last days before
the primary are a time to lift the curtain on the candidate's
lighter, human side. Followed by dozens of photographers and camera
crews, the Texas governor has been emphasizing his athleticism and
informality in a series of carefully-planned stops over the final
weekend of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the casual theme, Bush replaced his business suit
with a sports jacket and slacks. He has gone snowmobiling and
played goalie in a soccer game. Monday he hopes to go ice fishing
and bowling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's color. It helps us win on personality,'' said Patrick W.
Griffin, Bush's New Hampshire media strategist. ``I've never seen
John McCain without a coat and tie on. McCain does one thing and he
does it well. But winning the New Hampshire primary is as much
about image as issues. Our key right now to optically differentiate
the two men.'' Griffin called it ``the Elvis factor, the rock star
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is reminiscent of the photo opportunies used on the
way to the White House by his father, George Bush, who donned a
sports cap and climbed aboard a tractor in the closing days of the
New Hampshire primary 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And as the candidates dashed across the state in an eleventh
hour appeal for support, polls, including the latest Boston
Globe/WBZ-TV tracking poll, continued to reflect a very tight race
between McCain and Bush with the other three candidates lagging
well behind.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was cautious about his prospects Sunday. He said he
thinks the vote will be close, and that Tuesday would be ``a late
night'' for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to draw contrasts between himself and Bush,
without quite criticizing his rival. On NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
host Tim Russert asked McCain several times whether an advertisment
asserting that the senator is the only candidate fully qualified in
military and foreign affairs was meant to imply Bush was not
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has often vowed publicly to forgo negative
campaigning, avoided saying that, repeating that he was simply more
qualified than the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was trying to say was that I am fully prepared, and
fully qualified,'' he said shortly afterward on his bus. ``I'm not
saying he's unprepared, I'm just saying I'm better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Peterborough Town Hall for his 114th and final town
hall event. ``What happened at Peterborough is really the metaphor
for what happened in this campaign,'' McCain told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, McCain said, he held a town hall meeting in
Peterborough, gave away free ice cream, and only 40 people showed
up. Back then, he garnered just three percent of Republican voters
surveyed. Last December, he drew a crowd of 400, without benefit of
free dairy products, he said. Sunday's crowd doubled the December
event and McCain was jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   His last town hall meeting was worlds away from his earliest
ones in more ways than audience size. Instead of recorded music,
itself a very recent addition to McCain events, a live band revved
up the crowd with Van Morrison and James Taylor numbers. They
cranked out ``Johnny B. Goode'' when McCain arrived, but were
barely audible over the applause.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain had answered his last question, the audience rose,
the band struck up with ``Play That Funky Music (White Boy)'', and
red, white, blue and silver streamers and confetti rained down on
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain continued to quarrel over the merits of
their rival tax proposals during their public appearances, Steve
Forbes sought to insert himself into the day's debate by suggesting
that Bush was not committed to a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush had said that he hoped to achieve a tax cut in
his first term, Forbes said the statement implied that the American
people would have to wait four years or longer for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea that you make a weak tax proposal and then not even
be willing to fight for it vigorously from day one, that's the
difference,'' Forbes said. He also accused Bush of ``straddling and
wishy-washiness'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing badly in public opinion surveys, Alan Keyes and Gary
Bauer campaigned in the shadows of their competitors. Bauer kept a
light schedule, and Keyes turned his tongue on the Democratic
candidates, describing the race between Bill Bradley and Al Gore as
a choice between ``the devil and Beelzebub.''
</P>
<P>
   Although discussion of abortion has been muted in the Republican
contest since the campaign departed Iowa, the two leading
candidates were grilled on the subject during network television
appearances Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' McCain explained that he had ``come to
the conclusion that the exeptions for rape, incest, and the life of
the mother are legitimate exceptions'' to an outright ban on
aboritons. ``I don't claim to be a theologian, but I have my moral
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   If Roe v. Wade is overturned and abortion outlawed, McCain said
he felt doctors who performed abortions would be prosecuted. ``But
I would not prosecute a woman'' who obtained an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the National Right to Life Committee had labeled his
position as ``conflicting'' because the organization opposed him on
another issue -- campaign financing. The anti-abortion group has
``turned a cause into a business, and they are very worried that if
I have campaign finance reform, all these ncontrolled, undisclosed
contributions may be reduced, and it may harm them in their efforts
to continue this huge business they've got going in Washington,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Bush was asked
about McCain's reluctance to prosecute women who might obtain
abortion should the day come when abortion is once again illegal.
``I think that's a realistic position that the senator took. I feel
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the contention of Bauer and Keyes that abortion
is the premier issue of the day, Bush said, ``I think abortion is
an important issue, but it is not the only issue. I think it is
important to have a president explain the value of life. But it's
certainly not the only issue on the American agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, during McCain's town hall meeting in
Peterborough, a member of the audience triggered applause when she
told McCain that the abortion issue should be taken out of
politics.

OPPOSITION CANDIDATE IN TAIWAN WON'T PUSH CHINA ON INDEPENDENCE
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Taiwan's main opposition candidate said Sunday that if
elected president, he would not push for Taiwan's formal
independence from China or try to enshrine Taiwan's separate status
in an amendment to its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The statements by Chen Shui-bian, the Democratic Progressive
Party's candidate, marked his strongest effort yet to assure
nervous voters in Taiwan that his election would not provoke a
crisis with China. And his remarks came after new warnings on the
issue from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan, the headquarters of the Nationalists
since their defeat in the civil war in 1949, to be an errant
province and has repeatedly threatened a military attack if it
moves toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   Chen announced his policy on relations with China at a news
conference in Taipei. He is one of three main presidential
candidates in the March elections, which will be closely watched in
Beijing and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   '``Taiwan is already a sovereign and independent state,'' Chen
said Sunday. ``There is no need to declare independence or change
the state name.'' The island is officially known as the Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking formal independence as the ``Republic of Taiwan'' was a
prime goal of the Democratic Progressive Party when it emerged in
the 1980s in opposition to the long-governing Nationalists. But in
the last few years, and especially as Chen, a popular former mayor
of Taipei, prepared to run for president, the party has tried to
appeal to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperous and democratic, Taiwan increasingly has its own
identity. But a large majority of voters say they prefer the status
quo _ in which Taiwan functions as a separate country but keeps
open the possibility of rejoining the mainland _ to declaring
independence or other steps that could trigger a missile attack or
blockade by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With Chen's statements Sunday, his position on relations with
China appears to be converging with those of his main opponents,
Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalist Party and James Soong,
a longtime Nationalist leader who broke away last year for an
independent run, largely on personal grounds.
</P>
<P>
   If the traditional supporters of the rich, powerful Nationalist
Party remain divided, then Chen, who is seen as a crusader against
corruption and cronyism, may have a good chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists are officially committed to reunification, but
President Lee Teng-hui, who was Taiwan's first directly elected
president and will step down this year, has often said that Taiwan
is sovereign and cannot rejoin the mainland until China is more
democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's remarks last summer that negotiations could only proceed
on a ``state-to-state'' basis angered Beijing, leading it to cancel
planned talks. Lien and Soong decline to use that offending phrase,
but like Lee and Chen, they say that Taiwan is sovereign in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also said Sunday that unless the mainland attacked Taiwan,
he would not call for a national referendum on independence, which
his party has long sought but which China considers objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from the Nationalist Party and Soong's camp criticized
Chen's position Sunday as a hypocritical ploy to gain votes. His
party's founding statement of principles, some noted, still calls
for eventual independence.

ATTACKS

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley said Sunday that Vice
President Al Gore would lose the general election unless he offered
a better explanation for attending a fund-raiser at a Buddhist
temple four years ago, but minutes later Gore assailed Bradley for
``divisive, manipulative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh words Sunday were the latest in a series of
back-and-forth attacks between the two Democratic presidential
candidates, who had spent the past few days arguing over who was a
more reliable defender of abortion rights. At a rally Sunday in
Somersworth, Gore said that when his rival attacked him over old
anti-abortion votes he was dividing the abortion rights forces
``for the sake of his own political tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   And about Bradley's campaign finance attack, Gore asked, ``Why
did Senator Bradley raise this issue to divide Democrats, which
only helps Republicans, who are the true impediments to campaign
finance reform?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he spoke, Gore's supporters passed out copies of a
statement by the minority leaders in Congress, Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge that Senator Bradley's campaign remain focused on the
issues,'' the statement said, ``and that he abandon negative,
personal attacks that do not bring credit to this nomination
contest or to the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   With almost every public poll showing him trailing by a
substantial margin, Bradley escalated his attacks to their toughest
level yet by questioning Gore's electability, an explosive issue
that until now Bradley has left to his followers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue troubles Democrats because of the ammunition it will
provide to the Republicans if the vice president is nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has been pressed by his followers to open up on Gore's
greatest vulnerability, his 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple
where campaign cash was raised. But he has been reluctant to do so,
instead raising the issue incrementally.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, for example, he said that Gore should ``face up
to his disgraceful behavior.'' He also said that unless the
Democrats cleaned up their own house, the Republicans would do it
for them. He repeated that remark here Sunday, and in an interview
this morning on the ABC News program, ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Bradley cited an article in the latest issue of
Fortune magazine saying that Gore must have known that money was
being raised at a Buddhist temple where he appeared in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he only learned of the fund raising after the
fact, a statement widely doubted by critics of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago when Bradley was asked in a television interview
what he thought of the 1996 Democratic fund raising, he praised
Gore for saying he had learned lessons from the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continued: ``In Al's case, the attorney general
investigated it fully and determined that an independent counsel
was not needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday the senator told several hundred supporters gathered
at Franklin Pierce College, an institution named for the only
native of New Hampshire ever to become president: ``Here is the
latest article in Fortune magazine about Al Gore and the year 1996,
relevant to the fund-raising issue. Quite frankly, I think there is
more explanation that is needed, that this article raises, about
his participation. And I believe that unless that explanation is
forthcoming, that the public will reject a candidacy in the fall
that fails to come to terms with this circumstance in our
Democratic Party in 1996. Just as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore speech, given in a horse barn in Somersworth, had been
planned before Bradley's latest attack over fund raising, but was
adjusted to account for his comment on ``This Week'' and his
stronger remarks in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   At first Gore spoke stiffly from notes, but he got hotter as he
went on and the crowd booed mentions of Bradley's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now clear that Senator Bradley is looking for a different
kind of fight,'' Gore said. ``In the closing day of the New
Hampshire primary, Senator Bradley has suddenly changed. Instead of
the promised character, courage and commitment, we have
manipulative attack after manipulative attack.'' Boos followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley is now stepping down, unfortunately, to the
level of personal vilification, challenging the integrity of those
who disagree with him,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Bradley of inventing differences between them ``where
there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proudly pro-choice and he knows it,'' Gore continued.
``He knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bradley of running a divisive campaign ``because he
cannot answer real questions from real people about the very real
problems we face.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then Gore attacked Bradley's health care proposal, saying the
average $150 a month Bradley's health care plan proposed ``leaves
people with disabilities, the elderly in nursing homes, people with
AIDS, the 40 million Americans who depend on Medicaid out in the
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that Bradley had no program on education. ``He
doesn't rebuild one crumbling school,'' Gore said. ``He doesn't
have one idea to turn around failing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``He cannot defend his own proposals, so he's
committing foul after foul, and I believe that on Tuesday, the
likelihood is that the voters are going to blow the whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   When the speech was over, two Bradley supporters, Sen. Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, turned up
to criticize Gore. Then Gore supporters arrived and started trying
to drown them out, chanting ``stay and fight'' and ``airball.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bradley has been arguing that because Gore was not telling
the truth in his campaign, he could not be trusted as president, a
reporter asked Kerrey if he considered the vice president
trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey replied, ``I personally think he's trustworthy. Yes. But
I'm just one voter.''

<P>
   The young Buddhist leader who fled from his monastery in
Chinese-controlled Tibet in December was driven by monks to a
rugged border area with Nepal and then rode unnoticed on horseback
before flying on to India, according to accounts of his flight only
now emerging from Buddhists in Nepal, India and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old monk _ Ugyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa of
the Karma Kagyu order, one of Tibetan Buddhism's four main schools
_ has not spoken of his journey publicly for fear of endangering
more people at his Tibetan base, the Tsurphu monastery, north of
Lhasa, Tibetan exiles say.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tracked the Karmapa's journey through Nepal said that
to avoid attention he never had more than half a dozen people
around him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his path through Nepal crossed the former Buddhist
kingdom of Mustang, a territory almost entirely isolated from the
world until the last decade, when limited numbers of trekkers and
adventure tourists were admitted. But Tibetan Buddhist monks and
some traders have always crisscrossed the border between Mustang
and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa is now in seclusion at a monastery in north India,
near the headquarters of the Dalai Lama, the leader of another
sect, the Gelugpa, but a figure recognized by almost all Tibetan
Buddhists as the political as well as religious head of the Tibetan
exile movement and the Tibetan people in general.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa is the only major Tibetan lama recognized as a
reincarnation of his lineage by both the Dalai Lama and the Chinese
government, and his flight from Tibet was considered a blow to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhists in India say that Indian intelligence agents have
interviewed the Karmapa at length, while a Chinese intelligence
team has been quizzing people in Nepal. China's relations with
Nepal have long been a concern to India, and both China and India
are anxious to know if the other was in any way implicated in the
escape, Tibetan exiles say. There are questions about how the
Karmapa was able to evade Indian immigration controls when he flew
in from the Nepali resort town of Pokhara.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan Information Network in London said that recent
reports from Tibet indicate that at least two monks at Tsurphu
monastery have been detained since the Karmapa's departure.
Tibetans in Nepal said that two police officers assigned to monitor
the monastery were also arrested. The Karmapa's Kagyu order has the
largest following in the West, where Buddhists have donated large
sums of money to restore Tsurphu and other Kagyu monasteries. The
16th Karmapa accompanied the Dalai Lama into exile from Tibet in
1959 and died in Chicago in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic story of the Karmapa's flight that exiles have now
pieced together, supported by Tibetans in Nepal, begins at Tsurphu
on Dec. 28. The Karmapa is reported to have left the monastery in a
car with two other monks, both experienced drivers. For two days,
they apparently drove more or less nonstop to the Nepali border in
the Mustang region, where they switched to horses. There are no
roads in Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear where the group actually crossed the border into
Nepal on Dec. 30, because Tibetans say that the Chinese had
fortified police checkpoints between Lhasa, the Tibetan capital,
and Dram, the only legal crossing point into Nepal in the Mustang
area, and the party must have taken an evasive route known to
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   From the border, through the old royal Mustang capital of Lo
Manthang, the Karmapa's group, by then numbering six people, rode
on horseback to the nearest airport, possibly at Jomsen, which
connects to Pokhara, in a Himalayan valley about 125 miles west of
Katmandu, Nepal's capital. By some accounts, they rode directly to
Pokhara, but trekkers familiar with the area question whether that
much territory could have been covered on horseback between Dec. 30
and Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa and a few followers apparently avoided Katmandu by
taking a flight from Pokhara to an airport in northern India on
Jan. 3, and then either flew or drove to New Delhi _ accounts
diverge on this point. All agree, however, that the Karmapa left
New Delhi by taxi on the evening of Jan. 4 and arrived unannounced
at the Dalai Lama's headquarters at Dharmsala early on Jan. 5.

BAUER GAINS SOMETHING OTHER THAN VOTES ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Gary Bauer was in his hotel lobby taking
questions from a handful of reporters when Steve Forbes blew by,
trailed by stampeding cameramen and the two guys in pink pig suits
who accompany him everywhere, waving signs that say, ``Cut pork!''
and ``Tax meat!''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly knocking over his fellow candidate's wife, Carol Bauer,
Forbes paused: ``Oh! Sorry,'' he said, patting her back. ``Nice to
see you, Steve,'' she called after him, as he and the crowd charged
on.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing badly in the polls, Bauer had only one reporter
traveling with him Sunday and, without conceding anything, was
already showing a sense of humor about his chances. Asked what he
would do if he lost, he laughed and said: ``What? A blow right to
the solar plexus! Well, in the unlikely event that I don't get the
nomination ...''
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer, the conservative head of the Family Research Council,
would not walk away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   He has had an enormous amount of face time with the
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush, who he proudly says has been
cribbing some of his lines on abortion. With jokes, candor and some
unexpected positions _ a focus on racial reconciliation, which he
mentions in nearly every speech, and support for a ban on soft
money _ he has also made a surprising number of friends in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not enough to put him up there with Sen. John McCain, but
quite a coup nonetheless for one of the country's leading
anti-abortion and anti-gay rights lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Making friends with reporters ``has been one of the nicest parts
of this,'' Bauer said. ``Conservatives too often adopt an
adversarial attitude with the media. And previously there was a
tendency to put me more in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a campaign aide even fretted about a reporter's decision to
tag along on a Sunday, when the schedule was heavy on church
meetings, ``a stereotype Gary has worked hard to get away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also had a humanizing scandalette this fall, when an aide
who later went to work for Forbes made a fuss over the fact that he
sometimes spent time behind closed doors consulting with a much
younger female aide. He responded by turning the matter into a
feminist issue, asking how women who cannot meet privately with
their bosses could ever hope to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he rode in the van with three top female aides: the
same young woman whose closed-door advice caused the stir; his
wife, Carol, who was sharing hand lotion with the aide; and his
daughter, Elyse, who an aide noted is as important to the Bauer
campaign as Karenna Gore Schiff is to her father's operation.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bauer mused that his campaign should have used the
slogan ``Beep for Bauer'' on signs instead of letting Bill Bradley
get ``Beep for Bradley,'' she did weigh in: ``That's not that
original,'' she said, with proper daughterly disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that women see a softer side in Bauer. He
is the only Republican, in fact, who does better with women than
men.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning speech to a Republican audience, Bauer was
approached by a couple who described themselves as liberal
Democrats but could not stop praising him. ``It makes me proud
there's someone like you in politics,'' said Julie Schoenfeld of
Boulder, Colo., who said she did not agree with Bauer on any of the
issues but admired him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So, after all these years, has Gary Bauer gone mainstream? He
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always mainstream,'' he said. ``You guys just figured it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the exception of McCain, no other candidate seems to
be enjoying himself more. Bauer seems genuinely moved ``that the
son of a janitor can run for president along with the son of a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish you could make a living doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, appearing at a pregnancy counseling center, Bauer held a
baby in front of the center and said it was important to remember
that the work done here, talking young women out of abortions, was
not theoretical. In his soft-spoken way, he also denounced same-sex
marriage, and a girl holding a big Bauer sign yelled, ``That's
cool!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some social conservatives have indicated they like to
see some righteous anger in their candidate, more along the lines
of the perpetually churning Alan Keyes, who bested Bauer in last
week's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to his hotel at the end of the day, Bauer suggested
that after this campaign, he may be in a rather enviable position
to push his issues, even if conservative voters end up favoring the
louder Keyes and the richer Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going away,'' he said.

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANTARNY, Russia _ At the start of the death march in
Koenigsberg, they numbered about 7,000 _ the vast bulk of them
women, most quite young, all clad in wooden-soled shoes, thin rags
emblazoned with yellow six-pointed stars and telephone wire belts
on which were strung their cups and tin-can bowls.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they reached a vacant lock factory in this
nondescript seaside village, after two days and 25 miles of brutal
winter weather, there may have been 4,000 left. They remained
perhaps four days, then were herded down a bucolic cobblestone lane
and past dilapidated workers' cottages to an abandoned amber mine
on the shore of the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, 55 years ago Monday night, that Nazi SS guards
split them into packs of 50, sent them fleeing down the beach and
on to the ice-covered water itself, then mowed them down with
machine guns. Others were escorted to the mine and shot
point-blank.
</P>
<P>
   Auschwitz had been liberated four days before. ``Never forget,''
the civilized world said.
</P>
<P>
   But the world completely forgot about the massacre of Jewish
innocents at Palmnicken, now the Russian town of Yantarny, until
Sunday. Sunday, on the beach, a roaring gale whipped the sleet into
needles and raised towering whitecaps on a sea the color of wet
cement. At the base of the amber mine, a steep concrete-buttressed
cliff resembling a battlement, some 200 mourners dedicated a small
pyramid of stones and a plaque to the victims of the Koenigsberg
march and the Palmnicken massacre.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first tangible recognition that the march and
massacre had ever occurred. Until Sunday, there was no memorial to
Holocaust victims anywhere in Koenigsberg _ known now as Russian
Kaliningrad _ even though it was home to several small
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, the whole of the Kaliningrad region _ one million
people, the eldest of whom fought valiantly to defeat Hitler's army
in World War II _ was utterly unaware until a year ago that the
massacre had ever taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, no one needed this,'' Rabbi David Shvedik of
the Jewish Community in Kaliningrad said in an interview. ``For the
authorities in Yantarny and in the region, it was not at all
interesting to them to remember 7,000 dead Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the massacre, and of Kaliningrad's slow awakening
to it, is at once riveting and chilling. Put simply, the victorious
Soviet Union closed the book on Nazi atrocities once it seized
Koenigsberg from the Germans at the end of World War II. Thousands
of Germans were deported in rail cars to be replaced by Russian
immigrants; Jewish Holocaust victims were reburied as ``Soviet
heroes,'' stripped of religious identity. Red Army reports on the
massacre and on the discovery of mass graves were written, filed
and classified.
</P>
<P>
   Kaliningrad became a Soviet naval base and a closed region,
steeped in secrecy. Horrific memories half-lived into rumor, then
myth, then taboo enforced by the Kremlin's own unspoken, unofficial
anti-Semitism. Justice, delayed decades, was forever denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, not a single person was ever sentenced for
this,'' said Alexsander Aderichin, the investigative editor for the
Kaliningrad newspaper Dvornik, which helped break the massacre
story over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That Kaliningrad awakened at all may be credited to Christians _
a German and an American _ who grew up near Palmnicken and would
not suppress their own memories of the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The German, Martin Bergau, witnessed the executions of some
women and gave harrowing testimony to them in a German-language
book and in a submission to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Remembrance
Authority in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The American, Gunter Nitsch, had only heard stories of the
killings as a boy. But as an adult, he was so haunted by the
massacre's specter that he was compelled to track down the truth _
and in the process, to unleash the long-hidden accounts of what
happened during that terrifying week in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful,'' Nitsch said last week in a long telephone
interview. ``These were my people. Most of the people in my family
were members of the Nazi Party. Whatever happened cannot be
changed. But it must not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitsch, now 62, was but a 7-year-old when the Red Army stormed
through Poland and into Koenigsberg in early 1945. As the
Communists moved north, the Nazis began vacating a network of 30
camps ringing Poland's huge Stutthof concentration camp, moving
some 20,000 Jews away from the advancing army. Ninety percent were
women, mostly from Hungary and Lithuania; the men were Lithuanian
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of all 20,000 is unknown. What is clear is that roughly
7,000, by the latest estimate, wound up at a subcamp in
Koenigsberg, now the Baltic port of Kaliningrad, in January weather
so unusually bitter that ice floes stretched hundreds of feet from
the shore. On Jan. 26, Nazi guards began marching the crowd, clad
only in rags, some 25 miles northwest to Palmnicken.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 or more died along the way, either of
exhaustion or execution as they tried to flee their torturers. ``We
marched in heavy snow,'' Dora Hauptman, one of the captives, told
Yad Vashem in 1994. ``The cold was fierce, and a freezing wind blew
_ this was the weather we had to cope with. We weren't allowed to
rest at all. Every moment shots were fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The frostbitten survivors were imprisoned in the Palmnicken lock
factory and, after three or four days, marched five abreast to the
seashore. Some were taken to an open-pit amber crater. Bergau, then
a 15-year-old member of a German home-defense force, watched in
agony as they knelt and were shot in the back of the neck with
pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Other women were less fortunate. In his testimony, Bergau
recalled riding a horse in the area a week later, hearing gunshots
and sprinting in panic toward the seashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chestnut suddenly stopped short in his tracks, hesitated
and snorted,'' he wrote in 1994. ``I could not believe my eyes.
Between the ice flows, near the shore, the water was thick with
countless floating bodies. They were bobbing like swimmers in the
swell.'' He fled, he said, ``in cold horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 7,000, there were 13 known survivors. One of
them, Ms. Hauptman, had dived into the sea after a man told her
that ``someone must survive to describe their barbarity.'' Shot
once in the hand, she crawled ashore and, miraculously, was taken
in by a heroic German woman, Bertha Pulver, who hid her until the
Red Army arrived on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Nitsch saw none of this, but his Lutheran grandfather did. The
victorious Soviets commandeered German civilians that summer to
exhume the sand-covered bodies of the massacred and transport them
to mass graves and cemeteries for reburial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't believe it had happened,'' Nitsch said. ``It just
blew him apart. For the first few weeks, he couldn't talk at all.
All he did when he came home was to read the Bible. He lost a lot
of weight. And within a couple of months, he died.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though a child, Nitsch worked too, weeding and painting a
cemetery where the victims had been reburied. Soon his family was
loaded into a cattle car and deported to East Germany; later, he
fled to West Germany. And in 1964, he moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not forget. Friends said he imagined the killings.
But at a German book fair in New York City, he found a volume with
a chapter on Palmnicken and, he wrote, ``felt vindicated.'' Still
later, he found Bergau's book with its eyewitness account of the
murders. Working on a still-unpublished book, he asked the Simon
Wiesenthal Center and Yad Vashem for files on the Palmnicken
slaughter, and received Ms. Hauptman's account, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he flew to Kaliningrad and asked regional officials for
help. A state archivist listened, then said he must be mistaken; no
such event could have occurred and been erased from history. Nor
was there any trace of the Jewish cemetery where he once weeded
graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing had been forgotten,'' he said last week. ``I could
accept that they didn't know where the cemetery was, but to find
out they didn't know about the massacre at all was mind-boggling.''
Not until the archivist sent Nitsch to journalists like Aderichin
of Dvornik did the truth emerge. A spate of articles led to an
observance of the massacre last year; this year, fund raisers
collected enough for a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The region's governor spoke at its dedication Sunday, something
remarkable in a society where Jewish suffering in World War II was
little acknowledged in public even a decade ago. Another speaker
called it Kaliningrad's Babi Yar, a reference to the ravine near
Kiev where SS guards massacred more than 100,000 Jews from 1941 to
1943. That atrocity went largely ignored until the poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko wrote about it in 1961 to protest plans to desecrate
the site with a sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new question now: how to investigate rumors that
8,000 more Jews were marched to the nearby town of Baltisk, sealed
in a barracks and then killed in a massive explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we gathered here instills hope that something
like this won't happen again,'' Shvedik said Sunday, shouting into
a bullhorn to be heard above the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the rundown kindergarten that is his congregation's
temple, he recalls a woman who walked past the little memorial as
it was being completed this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came by with her children,'' he said, ``and then she
asked: `Why are you putting up a monument to Jews here? Why not a
monument to the Russians?'''

PAY HIKE AHEAD FOR FISHER

PAY HIKE AHEAD FOR FISHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jeff Fisher is on his way to becoming one of the
highest-paid coaches in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the Titans owner Bud Adams and the
representative for Fisher began several days ago in an attempt to
reach a new contractual agreement. Fisher has one year remaining on
his deal.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are believed to have been beneficial in that Adams
made it clear how much he values Fisher and that he is willing to
pay top dollar for his services. It is likely that Fisher and Adams
will reach an agreement for a long-term deal in the weeks after
Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   There are some minor sticking points, however, according to
several league officials. Last year Adams told Fisher that if the
team did not at least get to the playoffs this season, that Fisher
might lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   Adams also then wanted some changes, including the dismissal of
at least one member of Fisher's coaching staff. Fisher stood up to
Adams and the coach kept his job. Adams, the league officials said,
is again balking at paying that coach, and Fisher is again
defending him.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the assistant coaches and Adams is a
tenuous one. Adams is considered by some of them to be extremely
difficult to work for and is notorious for not paying them well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Adams will likely pry open his wallet for Fisher. It is
believed the two will eventually agree on a multiyear extension
worth at least $2 million a season. Fisher makes around $800,000 a
year now.
</P>
<P>
   If Fisher gets $2 million a year, he would be among the top five
highest-paid coaches in the league, and maybe in the top three if
coaches with the additional title of general manager are not
included. Before retiring from his coaching duties, the Jets' Bill
Parcells made about $2.5 million a year in his dual capacity as
coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is valuable to the Tennessee franchise not only because
of his coaching skills, but also because he is cherished by the
players and highly respected by almost everyone in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would agree that if it was not for Jeff's
coolness under pressure,'' running back Eddie George said, ``we
would have never made it to the Super Bowl.'' --MIKE FREEMAN &QL; 
 &QL; 
THESE TITANS AREN'T NEW YORK'S &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Jets' fans. These Tennessee Titans are not named for the
once-upon-New York Titans. Those Titans were an original American
Football League team, most of which left an unusual legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that the Titans (nee Oilers) were
the last of the original eight A.F.L. teams finally to get to a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But while that is strictly true, the fact is that four of those
original eight cities never got to see their team in the Super Bowl
_ by the time the teams made it to the championship, they were
playing in another city. And most had changed their names.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, of course, originally were the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets started life as the Titans, before changing their name
after being rescued from bankruptcy court. But at least they stayed
put before capturing Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers started life in Los Angeles before moving south to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs originally were the Dallas Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots first played in Boston before winding
up in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, only the Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, Buffalo
Bills (who moved to the suburbs) and the Jets rewarded their
original fans with a chance to see them in the ultimate game.

THE VERMEIL REGIMEN
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, Dick Vermeil's Eagles got to a Super Bowl
against the Raiders, and the Eagles were uptight against a team
that used to come late to its own meetings and never heard of
curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermeil of that era dressed all his coaches in warm-up suits
for the flight to New Orleans _ so they could feel athletic and
have a sense of urgency about what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   And Vermeil also wanted his coaches to jog between assignments
during the week, much like the plebes at West Point have to
double-time-it everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in a jogging suit and actually jogging was the
septuagenarian quarterback guru Sid Gillman. He was one of the most
innovative minds in the history of the passing game, and Vermeil
had brought him in as a coach for Ron Jaworski.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter interviewing Gillman had to jog along with him as he
ran from one place to another before a practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy,'' Gillman said, speaking of Vermeil, ``will kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Vermeil was also tough on his players, who were
drilling twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, Vermeil _ while hardly lax _ has put his
players through more normal routines. And none of his coaches (at
least publicly) has complained about the hours or the sweat.

BUSH ROOTS FOR OILERS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Bill Bradley were in New
Hampshire Sunday campaigning for the Democratic nomination for
president just two days before the primary here. But their hearts,
and perhaps their minds, were in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV paired teams hailing from the candidates' home
states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is from Carthage, Tenn., and Bradley was born and raised in
Crystal City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign had a Super Bowl party Sunday evening in
Manchester, billing it as an opportunity for Bradley to cheer for
``his hometown St. Louis Rams.'' But hometown team may be a
stretch; the Rams moved to St. Louis from Los Angeles five years
ago, after nearly 50 years in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Missouri,'' Bradley said Sunday morning on the ABC
program ``This Week.'' ``I grew up 35 miles south of St. Louis and
so I'm pulling for the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his staff watched the game with other Tennessee Titans
fans at a restaurant in Nashua. Gore's team is also new to his
state _ moving to Tennessee from Houston for the 1997 season. Marla
Romash, a spokewoman for Gore, said that he is a big fan of the
team, and cheered strongly for Tennessee. He has attended at least
one Titan game this season, Romash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been fighting hard for the voters of
New Hampshire, and he'll be using some of that energy to cheer on
the Tennessee Titans,'' Romash said. ``And then he'll go back to
fighting for New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is also campaigning in New Hampshire,
attended a Super Bowl party in Portsmouth. When asked who he
thought would win the game, Bush said, ``the Houston Oilers.'' The
Oilers moved to Tennessee and became the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, another candidate combining the game and
politicking with a party in Amherst, said that he was ``uninformed,
but partial to St. Louis.'' -- JOHN FILES &QL;

A.P. TO DISTRIBUTE ONLINE SITE'S NEWS REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Associated Press, a news service whose journalism
has been a staple of American newspapers for 151 years, plans this
week to begin distributing the work of Cnet News.com, a
four-year-old Internet site, as part of The A.P.'s overall offering
of financial news, according to executives of both news services.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Cnet, which ich specializes in coverage of the
Internet and related industries, is The A.P.'s first with a
nontraditional news organization and provides another validation of
Internet journalism _ a genre sometimes associated with gossip and
scandal-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, The Associated Press would take 5 to 10
of Cnet's articles daily, edit them and distribute them on The A.P.
financial news wire, whose 300 clients include most American
newspapers with circulations over 100,000. In exchange, Cnet
News.com (www.news.com) would get access to The A.P.'s online
service, a distillation of its national, international, sports and
entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   Like the arrangement made a year ago to link CBS News and the
online financial news site MarketWatch.com, The Associated Press'
deal with Cnet represents a major news organization's desire to
compete more aggressively in the new media world. It is a world
well understood by Cnet News.com, which was born to sell itself
online.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a world that the Reuters news service, The A.P.'s
chief rival, has set out to conquer. In 1998, 55 percent of the $63
million revenue that Reuters earned in the Americas came from
online sites like Yahoo, Excite(AT)Home and Walt Disney's Go.com.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crooke, a spokesman for Reuters, which is owned by the
Reuters Group, said last week that of the 250 online sites that buy
the Reuters service, 20 percent were owned by traditional newspaper
and broadcast companies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for The A.P. said on Friday that the service did
not disclose the number of customers it has on the World Wide Web
or the revenue derived from Web sales.
</P>
<P>
   Internet audiences, analysts say, tend to be eager consumers of
financial news, particularly news about the Internet. The A.P.
executives said that enhancing their financial reporting with the
coverage of Cnet's 45 journalists _who specialize in new products
and deals _ would enhance the content of the Associated Press
members' Web sites. It may also fatten the news service's bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Cnet's first deal with a traditional media
organization: it provides news to the online edition of The New
York Times, for example. But The A.P.'s reach _ it has 1,549 daily
papers among its members, of which about 900 have Web sites _ will
ensure dissemination of Cnet's articles to millions of readers
largely unfamiliar with its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unprecedented that an online-only news
organization would partner with a 150-year-old entity,'' said Jai
Singh, the editor of Cnet News.com, who began his career in the
mid-1970s at a chain of suburban newspapers outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, which is organized as a cooperative, has
made one similar arrangement to use the journalism of a news
organization outside that framework. In 1994, facing pressure from
the then-upstart financial news service of Bloomberg L.P., The A.P.
arranged to repackage substantial material from the Dow Jones wire
as part of The A.P.'s financial news wire _ an arrangement that
continues.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jon Wolman, The Associated Press' managing editor,
the new Cnet deal is ``an evolution'' of the thinking that led to
the Dow Jones deal. ``News presentation is changing and news
services are popping up; Cnet is a great example,'' he said. ``We
want to present our members with a great variety, and we want to
respond to the explosion of interest in Internet and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That interest in technology and financial news is palpable on
the Internet, with growing audiences viewing news sites like
CNNfn.com, CNBC.com, MarketWatch.com _ in which CBS now has a stake
_ and TheStreet.com, in which The New York Times Co. owns a stake
and with which The Times operates a joint financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the national and international news that
Reuters and The A.P. provide is now so ubiquitous that its use
affords a Web site little competitive advantage in gaining an
audience. There is greater demand for news that is unique _ often
local news _ and news that is specialized and timely.
</P>
<P>
   While local news has long been an A.P. specialty, the wire
service could not devote anything close to the 45 reporters that
Cnet News.com has covering technology and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Reuters is part of a diversified company _ media revenue
represented about 5 percent of total revenue in 1998 _ The A.P. is
a cooperative that answers to its members. It is controlled by a
governing board made up of top executives from major newspaper
companies and gets constant feedback from groups like the
Associated Press Managing Editors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under this cooperative arrangement, the members of The A.P. _
newspapers or broadcasters _ pay a fee, based on the size of their
audiences or circulations, for a variety of services that include
national, international, sports and entertainment news. Much of the
material is generated by The Associated Press' own corps of 3,500
editorial and technical employees, working from 240 bureaus in
state capitals and other American cities, financial centers and key
international sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While The A.P. has rapidly expanded into new areas, investing
millions of dollars in technological improvements and video and
audio news operations, many of its members still retain the same
kind of conservatism that caused their predecessors to balk at
selling the news service to radio broadcasters 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of close scrutiny from A.P. members, the service's
executives have tended to be conservative about what news they
distribute, and to whom. Jim Kennedy, The A.P.'s director of
multimedia services, said that when he first proposed the Cnet
arrangement, ``there was some queasiness in The A.P. about it; some
people didn't know who Cnet was.''
</P>
<P>
   Members, Wolman said, are likely to have similar qualms.
``Everyone is going to want to see it to believe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wick Temple, The Associated Press' vice president and director
of newspaper membership, said that ``some members think A.P. should
serve only traditional customers.'' The biggest concern about
selling news to online competitors, Temple said, is that such
features will help online rivals lure away the high-margin
classified advertising that accounts for one-third to one-half of
the revenue of most newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   When Singh started Cnet News.com in 1996, he said, he came to
The A.P. as a potential customer, looking to buy one of its general
news products. ``I went to A.P. and said, `I would like to get your
service.' They said, `Get lost; we don't provide news to just
anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Singh added, that kind of skepticism evaporated. ``The
lucky thing for us,'' he said, ``has been that from the get-go we
have been able to prove, on a daily basis, that we do credible
journalism.'' &QL;

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Company was coming and Laurie Luhn could not
believe the mess her colleagues were making of the green room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we pick up all the little trash?'' she asked, sounding a
tad frazzled as she surveyed the cramped chamber that was to hold
Gov. George W. Bush and his entourage before his appearance Sunday
on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Snow and Paula Zahn, the Fox News personalities, grabbed
some of the empty cups and plates and cleared out. ``Laurie, be
calm,'' Brit Hume said to Ms. Luhn, the segment producer, who was
doing double duty as Fox's emissary to the Bush campaign for the
morning. ``All the trash will be picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume, Fox's Washington managing editor and a veteran political
reporter, could be forgiven for affecting a certain blase air. But
in truth, Bush's agreement to appear on ``Fox News Sunday'' on the
weekend before the New Hampshire primary was cause for some
jitters. It was, after all, a minicoup for the three-year-old news
program, perhaps the least well established in the competitive
battleground of Sunday morning punditcasts.
</P>
<P>
   All five of the major Sunday talkfests decamped for New
Hampshire this weekend, eager to stock their shows with
presidential timber. Sen. John McCain signed on with ``Meet the
Press'' on NBC; Bill Bradley assumed the hot seat on ``This Week''
on ABC; McCain and Alan Keyes were guests on ``Late Edition'' on
CNN; and Bush, after appearing on Fox, moved on to ``Face the
Nation'' on CBS. Vice President Al Gore did not appear on any of
the programs.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual grilling of the candidates takes on a kind of tense
pageantry on a pivotal weekend like this one. The questioners and
questioned understand, Hume said, that they are all participating
in something a bit more rarefied than a conversation at a groggy
hour of the morning. ``This is not an interview in the usual sense
_ it's an event,'' Hume said. ``There are certain customs that are
observed on Sunday mornings. You're expected to seek to make news.
There's a certain formality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hour before the broadcast, the panelists gathered in the
offices of WMUR-TV, Fox's headquarters for the primary, to figure
out what line of inquiry might make Bush blink. ``He's been so
controlled,'' Snow, the program's host, said. ``My strategy is to
loosen him up a bit. I want to try as best as I can to get him off
his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no one on the panel held out much hope of a scoop.
``You have to figure out a new question, otherwise, he's got these
stock answers,'' observed Morton Kondracke, executive editor of
Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard, was
positively mopey. ``I'd rather have on Karl Rove than `W.,''' he
said, referring to the governor's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush and his team strolled in minutes later, however,
cynicism retreated. The governor seemed energized and his upbeat
air was infectious. ``Hey, there they are, the big shots!'' Bush
declared. His makeup applied, the candidate lingered in the hallway
outside the green room, clutching an extra large container of
coffee. It was clear that he viewed the interview circuit more as
required basic training than as a chance to mix it up with
inside-the-Beltway types. ``It's part of what candidates have to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has seemed a bit looser in debates of late; he says he gets
a lot of unsolicited suggestions about how to improve his
television image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very calculating person,'' he said. ``I haven't had
any coaches. I'm trying not to be theatrical.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hourlong program was devoted to Bush, who was
pressed on everything from his view on flying the Confederate flag
over the South Carolina Statehouse (it's up to South Carolina, he
said again) to a list of his favorite bands (the Neville Brothers
and Van Morrison). When it was over, the panel judged it one of his
more engaged, persuasive performances.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Zahn said she had figured out why: ``I went over
to him and asked, `You get any sleep last night?' and he said,
`Nine hours.' ''

MCCAIN TURNS UP THE HEAT A NOTCH ON BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, N.H. _ It was almost like a sentimental homecoming as
Sen. John McCain held his 114th and last New Hampshire town hall
meeting Sunday in the building where six months ago he had to give
out free ice cream to draw 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   This time more than 1,000 people packed the Peterborough Town
Hall, cheering, chanting and giving McCain a standing ovation as an
announcer boomed, ``Please welcome the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was supposed to be a coronation, which we thought we got
rid of in 1776, is going to be an election on Tuesday,'' said
former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire as the audience screamed
its agreement that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was getting a run
for his money. Rudman called on the crowd to ``turn out in droves
and send a message to the world on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's main opponents, Bush and Steve Forbes, also appeared at
enthusiastic rallies with hundreds of supporters. Although Bush
stuck to his standard stump speech, Forbes mounted a blistering
attack on the governor, complaining about what he called the
``wishy-washiness'' of Bush's $483 billion tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Forbes cited comments Bush had made about the tax
proposal in an interview on the television program ``Fox News
Sunday.'' Bush had said he hoped to accomplish the tax cut in his
first term. To that, Forbes said: ``When it comes to taxes, on
certain basic principles, you don't just hope. You've got to have
somebody who's going to fight for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance here Sunday, McCain pulled out all the stops.
He gave his microphone to an anti-tax protester dressed as a shark.
He drew cheers when he pointed out reporters to the audience and
joked that they had ``all agreed to be here afterward to explain
the liberal commie bias of the media to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a man who wanted to legalize hemp, he taunted,
``Good luck with your crop.'' Questioned about the danger of
dictators like Saddam Hussein, he said, ``I hope that Fidel Castro
has a chance to meet Karl Marx.'' That drew hisses.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked Al Gore for campaign finance abuses of 1996 and
Gore's statement, when it was disclosed that he had used a White
House phone for fund-raising, that there was ``no controlling legal
authority.'' He acted out how he would tell Gore in a debate,
``Well, I'm going to give you a legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   And he criticized Bush for supporting the current campaign
finance system. ``My friends, Gov. Bush says that campaign finance
reform will hurt our party,'' he said. ``I have throughout my
entire life had one fundamental belief: that what is good for our
country is good for our party.'' The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued to raise questions indirectly about Bush's
ability to step into the role of commander in chief. ``I am fully
prepared to lead,'' McCain said. ``I do not need on-the-job
training.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's New Hampshire primary crucial to his insurgent
campaign, McCain then journeyed to a packed VFW hall here to call
on the veterans who have rallied to his side to get out the vote
against the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started our battle with the privates, the seamen and the
chief petty officers,'' he said. ``They can have the generals and
the admirals.'' He implored, ``I need you again to go on a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday on ``Face the Nation,'' Bush was asked
about McCain's suggestions that he was not ready to assume the
presidency. Bush first pointed to his experience as governor of
Texas, saying, ``I have been in the position of setting agendas, of
making decisions, of putting an administration together and
bringing Republicans and Democrats together to achieve what's been
right for my state.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``A lot of United States senators are asking the same
question _ Republican senators _ saying, which one of the two, Sen.
McCain or Gov. Bush, should we endorse? Who should we help based
upon their leadership skills? And by far the overwhelming majority
of United States senators who are Republicans are supporting me.''

U.S.-NORTH KOREA TALKS SET FOR MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ North Korea has agreed to send a high-level delegation
to the United States in March, opening the way for talks on North
Korea's missile program, the spread of nuclear weapons and
terrorism, the U.S. State Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on North Korea was made by the State Department
spokesman, James Rubin, who arrived here Sunday morning with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for three days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin described the North Korea visit as an ``important step
forward'' in improving the hostile relations between the two
countries. The agreement came at the end of seven days of meetings
in Berlin between the United States and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that the visit in March will
lead to a permanent agreement under which North Korea would agree
to permanently stop flight tests of its ballistic missiles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed late last year not to continue these tests
while talks on improvements in relations between the two
governments continued. At the same time, Washington agreed to take
steps to lift some economic sanctions against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic
missile. It appeared to be in the final stages of another launch
last fall when the tentative agreement was reached between
Washington and Pyongyang to halt the launches.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of ballistic missiles from North Korea capable of
hitting the United States has been the prime reason behind the
Clinton administration's proposal for the deployment of a limited
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet here on Wednesday with the acting
President, Vladimir Putin, and Washington's plans for national
missile defense are high on the agenda. So far, Moscow has been
resistant to the administration's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the North Koreans in March would provide the ``best
opportunity'' to make progress on issues that are ``central to
peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific
region,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, which is governed by a harsh communist regime, had
been offered no concessions on its designation by the United States
as a sponsor of terrorism, Rubin said. In order to be removed from
that list, North Korea had to meet ``objective criteria.'' It had
so far not done so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Washington's effort to bring North Korea out of its
isolation, a high-level delegation of U.S. officials led by former
Defense Secretary William Perry visited North Korea last March. The
Clinton administration has been trying for many months to persuade
senior North Korean officials to reciprocate with a visit to
Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Berlin talks, North Korea's vice foreign minister, Kim
Gye Gwan, officially accepted the invitation, although a definite
agenda for the Washington visit still needs to be decided, Rubin
said. The North Koreans have not yet said who will lead their
delegation, but he would be of similar seniority to Perry, who is
President Clinton's special envoy to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation in Berlin was led by Ambassador Charles
Kartman, and Rubin said the two sides ``exchanged views on issues
of common concern in a constructive, businesslike environment.''

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Say it ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   With his New Hampshire poll numbers sinking and a defeat in Iowa
already on his resume, Bill Bradley decided last week that it was
time to transform himself into the man he said he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Jettisoning high-mindedness, he picked out a bargain-basement
politician's suit (tall, but otherwise typical), found that it fit
quite nicely and then spent the rest of the week running around New
Hampshire shouting ``Liar, liar, pants on fire!'' at Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't very seemly. We'll find out Tuesday if it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has strained from the outset to present himself as
somehow better than most politicians _ smarter, more honorable,
less devious. He scoffed at the use of ``tactics'' in a campaign,
and he disdained pandering. He would leave that to the Clintons and
Gores of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he changed his mind on ethanol, suddenly favoring federal
tax benefits for the gasoline additive that is made from corn, and,
yes, that flip-flop just happened to coincide with the approach of
the Iowa caucuses _ but in Bradley's view, that wouldn't be
pandering or politics as usual. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the whistle-clean former Knick and former senator amazed
the so-called experts with his extraordinary fund-raising ability,
he would earnestly lecture voters on the evils of harvesting so
much cash. He would mock the lobbyists with their cell phones and
``Gucci shoes'' and say, ``We all know that money distorts
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was above it all. He would loll back in his chair, cross
his long legs and languorously tell his audiences that he wanted to
run for president ``in a different kind of way.'' He would discuss
his grand ideas and his vision of ``a world of new possibilities,
guided by goodness.'' He was the authentic candidate, morally
upright, comfortable with himself.
</P>
<P>
   So it was amusing to see him jolted from his complacency last
week by plummeting poll numbers and the continuing torments of the
gleefully malicious Gore. The vice president, who does in fact have
a scruples gap, has always known that a run for the White House is
not a civics lesson, but an exercise in political combat that can
approach the intensity of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week Bradley seemed right at home in the world
of politics as usual. He questioned the vice president's veracity
so often he began to sound like Bob Dole in 1988 when he famously
snarled at George Bush, ``Stop lying about my record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully because he uses words in a very tricky manner,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Is the vice president tricky? Yes, he is. To a fault. But so is
Bradley, who campaigns loudly on behalf of the poor but doesn't say
much about his close ties to big chemical companies and to Wall
Street. And who brags about his role in the Tax Reform Act of 1986
without mentioning the billions of dollars' worth of exemptions
that were enjoyed by hundreds of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   You want tricky? Last December a child asked Bradley if he was
rich and he said no. Another child asked if he was a millionaire.
Bradley said, ``I guess if you added everything up, it would come
close.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator is actually worth between $5 million and $20
million, according to his federal financial disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days Bradley has been on the air with attack ads
on the issue of abortion, an issue on which there is not a
whisper's worth of difference between him and Gore. It is, frankly,
weird to watch two Democrats fighting over who is purer on the
pro-choice issue, even as a gaggle of conservative Republicans
argue over who is purer when it comes to being pro-life.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is actually very good on a number of issues of concern
to women, issues worth highlighting. But his own tricky inner
politician is sending him the message that politicians have always
embraced _ you do what you gotta do. The only difference with
Bradley is his relentless insistence that he's different.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in New Hampshire and elsewhere will decide who is more or
less tricky, more or less appealing, more or less right for the job
of president. But over the last week, Bradley has come out of his
lofty closet and shown that when the crunch comes he is perfectly
willing to dive into the type of politics he has professed to
abhor.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Meeting once a month at a rundown union hall
here, a dozen temporary workers are trying to ignite a campaign to
win for the nation's 3 million temps the benefits that most
permanent workers take for granted, like health insurance, sick pay
and paid holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey workers, along with nonprofit groups here and in
half a dozen other states, are drafting a voluntary code of conduct
for temp agencies that they say will improve job conditions for the
soaring population of temporary workers _ a segment of the labor
force that has tripled nationwide in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey temps are planning to make a major push this
March, in league with temps in New York, California, Massachusetts
and elsewhere, to promote their code in the hope that most of the
nation's 7,000 temp agencies, including 600 in New Jersey, will
adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   The code calls on agencies to give their lowest-paid workers a
``living wage'' and to provide health insurance, job training, paid
holidays and other benefits. It also opposes a practice they say is
widespread in the industry: bait-and-switch job advertising, in
which agencies give workers jobs worse than those promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to help temp workers because temping is such a
fast-growing phenomenon and because temp workers face so many
injustices,'' said Barrie Peterson, director of the Bergen County
Employment Action Project, the union-backed nonprofit group that is
heading the New Jersey efforts to develop and promote a code. &UR;  &LR; 
``They are paid 70 percent of what people doing comparable
permanent jobs earn,'' he said. ``They rarely receive health
benefits. And you have a lot of temp workers stuck in the same
assignment for years and years. That's a real abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The code's sponsors voiced confidence that they would be able to
persuade dozens of cities and counties, and perhaps a few state
legislatures, to agree to hire only agencies that subscribe to the
code _ a move that they said would pressure many agencies to sign
on.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at many temp agencies have denounced the code as
unnecessary, saying that agencies already know they have to treat
temps well if they are to attract workers when unemployment is so
low. But even these days, many temps say a code of conduct is the
only leverage they have. Forming a union for temporary workers has
proved as hard as herding butterflies, and picketing of abusive
agencies would open the protesters to being blackballed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen County Employment Action Project and a South Carolina
advocacy group were the first two organizations to create a code of
conduct, and now they are seeking to work with 35 other nonprofit
groups on a model nationwide code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to encourage agencies to take a high-road approach,''
Peterson said. ``If we can steer workers and companies to agencies
that agree to treat people better, that will presumably create
pressure on all agencies to move in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Bergen County Employment Action Project is the only
group in the nation to get temp agencies _ 27 so far _ to sign a
code of conduct, and it has sought to reward those agencies by
steering workers their way. In San Jose, Calif., Working
Partnerships, a nonprofit temp agency as well as a support group
for temps, has obtained 500 signatures to petition the county
supervisors to use only agencies that sign the code.
</P>
<P>
   As Wisconsin pushes many welfare recipients into temp jobs,
9to5, the National Association of Working Women, which is based in
Milwaukee, wants the state to use only agencies that have signed
the code. And the Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment is pressing
South Carolina's state government, which employed more than 10,000
temps in 1999, to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reward the good agencies and penalize the bad
ones,'' said Charles Taylor, co-director of the Carolina Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Temp workers are a heterogeneous group, including $7-an-hour
janitors, $14-an-hour secretaries and $50-an-hour software
designers with Ph.D.'s. Although many Americans choose to temp
because they like a flexible schedule, many temps say they prefer
the security and benefits of a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   The American Staffing Association, representing the $60
billion-a-year temp industry, has urged employers not to sign the
new code, contending that it is a union-backed plot to make the
industry look bad, raise its costs and drive temps into unions.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at many agencies assert that they already comply with
most of the code's provisions, like treating workers with respect
and not discriminating by race or sex. They say that other code
provisions, like health insurance and a so-called living wage, are
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things these people say agencies should do, we're
already doing,'' said Barry Franzino, president of Career Center
Inc., an agency in Hackensack.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``These are our employees, and we take good care of them,'' he
added. ``The labor market is very tight right now, and that makes
it imperative for us to do everything to make sure our workers are
happy, because if we don't, they'll go work elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, complaints of mistreatment abound _ about an
agency's making it hard for injured temps to get workers'
compensation, about a factory's paying female temps $1.12 an hour
less than male temps, about temps' being charged for safety
equipment for jobs held for just one day, about being barred from
consideration for permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen O'Donnell complained that during her three years of
temping in various administrative jobs in northern New Jersey she
had received no health insurance, no vacations, no paid holidays
and no paid sick days.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Vanderbeek, an engineer downsized out of a longtime job,
said that when fears of lengthy commuting made him refuse a temp
job 60 miles away, his agency threatened to deny him unemployment
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And Joseph Beattie, who worked 20 years as a corporate credit
manager before downsizing hit, said he was angry that his temp
agency refused to give him leads about permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a caste system,'' Beattie said. ``And we're the goose
that lays the golden egg for these agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lab Support, an agency with an office in Elmwood Park, N.J.,
that specializes in placing scientific personnel, has signed the
New Jersey code, concluding that it is easily acceptable because
the agency already provides vacation pay, paid sick days, a 401(k)
retirement plan and health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Lab Support pays most of the health insurance premiums. By
contrast, many agencies that boast about offering health coverage
require temps to pay far more than half the premiums, often
amounting to $3,000 or more per year, something many temps cannot
afford.
</P>
<P>
   But many agencies are unenthusiastic or hostile toward the code.
Alan Baker, owner of Horizon Personnel in Parsippany, N.J., signed
the New Jersey code, but said he was less happy about the national
model. Unlike the New Jersey one, the national code calls for
paying a living wage and providing transportation when there are no
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I provide paid holidays, but I don't provide sick days or
health benefits,'' Baker said. ``It would make my administrative
costs go up and would make my clients' costs go sky high.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the living wage is particularly divisive. Some
supporters of the code say that means paying $11 or more an hour,
while many agencies say client companies are unwilling to pay more
than $8 an hour for janitorial or clerical work.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Joerres, chief executive at Manpower Inc., the nation's
largest temp agency, said his company already satisfied most of the
code's provisions, but he still harbored serious reservations about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Agency executives say the campaign will give the industry a
black eye. But Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9to5, said, ``Some
people say they don't want the code calling negative attention to
the industry. It's negative practices, not a code, that call
negative attention to the industry.''

PLAYER HIT BY PUCK IN THROAT SENDS NOTE OF RECOVERY TO CANADIENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Montreal Canadiens forward Trent McCleary was
seconds from death after being hit in the throat by a puck Saturday
afternoon, the team's surgeon said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But now the worst is almost certainly over for McCleary, the
surgeon, David Mulder, said at a hushed news conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   McCleary remained in critical condition at Montreal General
Hospital, breathing with the aid of a respirator. But his condition
was no longer life-threatening, Mulder said. McCleary was able to
write an inspirational message to his teammates before their 3-0
victory Sunday afternoon over the Carolina Hurricanes. The news
that McCleary was out of danger was greeted with a loud ovation
from the Molson Center crowd of 19,380.
</P>
<P>
   McCleary's message, delivered by General Manager Rejean Houle to
the Canadiens' dressing room, read: ``Doing great everybody. Here's
$500 on the board for the win. Battle hard. I'll be listening. Go
Habs! Trent. (NU)6.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Coach Alain Vigneault said the players and coaches
would visit McCleary before they left for Florida on Monday.
Vigneault also said team doctors had briefed the Canadiens on
McCleary's condition before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took a lot of pressure off of the game,'' Canadiens wing
Benoit Brunet said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, McCleary, a little-used 27-year-old, had gone down
to block the slap shot of Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris
Therien during a 2-2 tie at the Molson Center. The puck, which was
shot at the left point from 8 to 10 feet away, hit McCleary
squarely in the throat and fractured his larynx.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to get to his feet and nearly made his way off the
ice on his own. But he could not breathe and his legs gave out just
after he left the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, who performed an emergency tracheotomy on McCleary
within a half-hour of the accident, said McCleary nearly died on
the way to the operating room. The only player to die from an
injury in an N.H.L. game was the Minnesota North Stars' Bill
Masterton, whose head hit the ice in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how close McCleary had come to dying, Mulder said,
``It's about as close as I think you could come.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, McCleary also suffered a collapsed right
lung, which caused his heart to shift to the right side of his
body, Mulder said. ``And that can be just as life-threatening as
the airway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after observing McCleary's condition through a night in
intensive care, Mulder was optimistic about McCleary's prognosis.
Mulder said McCleary's ability to breathe was the most important
consideration over the next 24 hours, but he thought it was under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent is still in intensive care,'' Mulder said. ``But in
terms of danger to his life, he went though that last night and his
life is not in danger at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That represented substantial progress. Mulder and Daniel
Fleiszer, the head trauma surgeon at Montreal General, performed a
tracheotomy, which involved cutting a hole in McCleary's windpipe
and inserting a tube.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, who said McCleary was conscious until the operation,
described what McCleary went through on the ambulance ride to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like drowning in your own blood,'' said Mulder, who
compared McCleary's injury to what the driver of a car experiences
in a head-on accident when the steering wheel hits him in the
throat.
</P>
<P>
   The tracheotomy was a success, Mulder said, and now it is up to
ear, nose and throat specialists to determine whether McCleary will
have surgery to repair his larynx or whether the doctors will wait
for the extreme swelling to go down in an attempt to let the larynx
heal on its own.
</P>
<P>
   McCleary will remain in the hospital for at least a week, Mulder
said. McCleary, who friends say loves to gab, cannot speak now,
which Mulder said was the thing that most frustrated the Canadiens
player. He will have to undergo voice rehabilitation, which takes a
long time, Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the resumption of his hockey career, Mulder said: ``It's
too early to predict. At this point, it's not possible to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was the latest in a series of career-threatening
injuries for McCleary, a journeyman from Swift Current,
Saskatchewan. Five years ago on Super Bowl Sunday, he nearly lost
an eye when he was hit by Boris Mironov's stick in an American
Hockey League game. Earlier this season in an A.H.L. game, McCleary
caught a skate in the eye, severing a tear duct.
</P>
<P>
   McCleary, who was not drafted after playing his junior hockey in
the Western Hockey League, has appeared in parts of four seasons
with Ottawa, Boston and Montreal. In 12 games with the Canadiens
this season, he has one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all of the shot,'' a shaken Therien said after the game.
``It was like the whole thing, the puck, everything, was in slow
motion. I could hear him breathing. It sounded like something was
stuck in his throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury reverberated with players on other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised we don't see that more often,'' Rangers
defenseman Stephane Quintal, a teammate of McCleary's last season
in Montreal, said on Saturday night. ``Thankfully, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers defenseman Rich Pilon said he had experienced a similar,
though less serious, incident earlier in his career. ``Every time
you go down to block a shot, you're just hoping it gets you in the
right place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' acting captain, Adam Graves, who was cut on the
face when hit by a puck Thursday, said: ``It's a play that happens
20 times a game. It's just scary, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare light moment at his news conference, Mulder said
surgeons did not have time to do anything but cut open McCleary's
Montreal sweater before the operation began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Trent that this was the first time I ever finished an
operation, looked up and the patient still had his skates on,''
Mulder said.  &QL;

ABC'S PREGAME PERFORMANCE IS SHORT, BUT NOT ALWAYS TO THE POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best analysts always tell you what you can't see. Not
always. Expecting brilliance every time a replay pops up is asking
too much. It can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not happen often enough with ABC's Boomer Esiason,
an area he must improve upon to reach the level of John Madden,
Phil Simms and Dan Dierdorf. Too often he tells us, in great
detail, precisely what we have just seen.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday night's Super Bowl, he described a run by
Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair over a replay:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bringing the blitz, right up the middle,'' he said.
``Nobody's panicking, the offensive line doing its job. Watch Steve
McNair. Poise, poise, poise. He looks downfield, then decides to
take off. Watch him run. He breaks a tackle there, another tackle
there and takes a defensive lineman on.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that is just what we saw.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on a replay of St. Louis offensive lineman Orlando Pace,
Esiason said: ``Pace pushing down a defender. Then, he goes after
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that is what we just saw.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Esiason employed his former quarterbacking skills
to buttress his calls. Watching St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner
smoothly slice the Titans' defense, he said: ``He goes through his
progressions, he can find his second and third receivers easily.''
Viewers would have been well-served by his use of his experiences
as a Super Bowl quarterback in 1989 to give a better sense of what
first-timers Warner and McNair were experiencing. Esiason is the
only former quarterback ever to analyze a Super Bowl for the ABC
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels, as usual, showed he is the best at his craft. He is
three-quarters play-by-play announcer, one-quarter analyst. There's
always something extra, like, ``London Fletcher pushed aside on
that play as if he were made of papier mache.'' Or, adding a light
touch, he said about Warner: ``Here's a guy in the Super Bowl who's
played in two Arena Bowls.'
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of having more technical toys at your
disposal is the desire to overuse them. The last few seasons we
have seen football directors cutting to assistant coaches, ad
nauseum, almost without regard to viewers knowing who they are. The
ABC production seemed to isolate the assistants, without isolating
enough players.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when there wasn't much to say about Mike Martz,
the St.Louis offensive coordinator, Esiason said: ``You've got to
love Mike Martz.'' Perhaps if I were Mrs. Martz the comment would
have been relevant.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise that the best segment in ABC's four-hour pregame
show was Barbara Walters hosting a special edition of ``The View.''
During six minutes of harmless fun, the Walters crew debated the
significance of football:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all about the butt,'' Meredith Viera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a bunch of guys jumping around in tights,'' Joy
Behar said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC offered several reasons to sit through the program, which
was shorter by three hours than the full load Fox laid on viewers
last year. But only on occasion did ABC deliver the emotional
impact that it promised.
</P>
<P>
   Like every Super Bowl pregame, there was a lot of filler (did we
really need Emeril Lagasse preparing jambalaya or Chris Berman's
interview with Phil Collins, a halftime performer, who doesn't
understand football, but likes the Super Bowl's ``event and
spectacle''?). But here were some high points:
</P>
<P>
   --Dan and Claire Marino's adoption of an abandoned Chinese girl
_ and her rapid inclusion into a family with four older children _
was a dramatic and moving story, augmented by home video of Claire
Marino's trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   --A profile of Fritz Pollard, a black player-coach in the
National Football League in the 1920s, with an interview by N.F.L.
Films in 1974, illuminated the brilliant life of a little-known
pioneer. But it omitted any details about his post-football life in
finance, journalism and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   --Andrea Kremer's examination of concussions typified her
stellar work. The animation of what happens to the brain during a
concussion was jarring, as was the former Giant linebacker Harry
Carson's admission about extended memory loss from concussions and
the problem it has posed for him in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But for everything else, ABC played it safe and probably tried
to do too much. The network focused its too-short player profiles
on usual suspects like McNair and Warner, and the Titans' Jevon
Kearse, and strayed from seeking out unsung or unusual stories. The
strategy is geared to a casual audience that may not know about
Warner's rise from supermarket stock boy to most valuable player,
but it demonstrated a lack of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously omitted from the program was:
</P>
<P>
   --A sense of the icy, unseasonable weather outside the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the carpetbagging history of Tennessee, a refugee
from Houston and Memphis, and St. Louis, late of Anaheim, Los
Angeles and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The overly busy format of the program did not give Berman and
Steve Young a great amount of time to develop a rapport, or for
Young to flex his nascent analytic muscles. In his usual Sunday
morning ESPN perch, Berman is a ringmaster. In Sunday's format, he
was a subdued supporting player. But as always, in his ABC work,
his hair looked far better than it does on ESPN. &QL;

(Attn: N.Y., S.C., Fla., Iowa)  (jw)

<P>
   Why, beyond respecting good government and democracy and all
that, should New Yorkers care whether John McCain can run for
president in their state?
</P>
<P>
   Because politics runs on quid pro quos. On commitments.
Promises. And candidates who don't have to think about New York as
they move out of New Hampshire won't; they can focus on California,
Georgia, Ohio and the other seven states in the Super Tuesday
primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   By locking McCain out of the Republican contest, New York makes
itself pander-proof: why would a candidate bother to woo voters if
he is either out of play or virtually assured of victory because
his party has eliminated the strongest opponent?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Republican Party's manipulation of New York's
deliberately complicated ballot process _ intended to discourage
insurgents and protect the party's choice _ McCain's name may not
appear on the presidential primary ballot in many New York
districts, while George W. Bush's name will appear everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The party, with the blessing of Gov. George Pataki (a Bush man),
is busy trying to knock the Arizona senator off primary ballots by
raising technical objections to his nominating petitions, and the
McCain camp is fighting back on every legal front. The most
prominent Bush supporter to object to his party's tactics is Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who hasn't got the standing to do more than
complain.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts don't revive McCain, where is the incentive for
the governor of Texas, the presumed front-runner, to promise us
anything? Or, to put it more decorously, to hear about and debate
the city and state's concerns? And if McCain should break through
in New Hampshire tomorrow but remain out of contention here, New
York will fall off the Republican radar screen altogether. (A third
candidate, Steve Forbes, is weak in the polls.)
</P>
<P>
   Urban America gets short shrift from national candidates anyway;
to invite their apathy takes matters to a new level. If there is
any question that candidates would court New York votes if they had
to, look at the goings-on elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, presidential contenders of both major parties fell all
over one another to pledge their allegiance to ethanol subsidies,
even though the corn-rich fuel is costly and inefficient. Only
McCain _ who did not seriously run in Iowa _ denounced the ethanol
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the Republican candidates, afraid of
offending some white voters, have turned themselves into pretzels
to avoid objecting to the Confederate flag, which flies over the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Florida and its strong Cuban-American vote.
Don't be surprised if Elian Gonzalez's fate isn't resolved until
the Florida primary on March 14 is past us.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of politicking may trouble more sensitive readers, but
that's how things work. For New York to pull itself out of play to
keep lawyers busy and gratify the Republican Party establishment is
nothing if not shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   We know what to do, given the opportunity. Presidential
candidates running in New York have had to focus occasionally on
urban issues in the past. Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter famously
visited the burned-out South Bronx (which was rebuilt, not because
of either of them, but their visits put an embarrassing focus on
that emblem of urban neglect).
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Al Gore, Jesse Jackson and others got plenty of
attention _ as well as trouble _ talking about Israel to Jewish
voters. And when Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he and his
opponent, Jerry Brown, debated urban problems for 75 minutes at
Gracie Mansion. Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   It is fun to fantasize about what Bush and McCain could be
discussing if they had any reason to show up in New York other than
to raise money or hold news conferences comparing the state's
voting system to Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   They could debate the future of the city's teaching hospitals.
Getting more help for mass transit, for our cultural institutions
and airports. Improving education. Doing more for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, if Bush wins in New York without a fight, the only debt
collectors would be Pataki and other party factotums. The governor,
besides getting a good time slot for his speech to the Republican
convention, might extract some federal goodies for New York from a
President Bush. But a personal debt is not the same as a public
commitment. You can hold politicians to their public pledges, or
try to.
</P>
<P>
   If they deign not to pander because they don't have to, what can
you do? Watch them raise the flag in South Carolina.

 &HT;    AFC NOTEBOOK: Scary hit for Bishop
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop sprained his neck in a
frightening third-quarter collision Sunday with St. Louis receiver
Ernie Conwell in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop attempted to tackle Conwell head-first after a 14-yard
reception and was motionless on the Georgia Dome floor for almost
15 minutes. Rams quarterback Kurt Warner knelt down beside Bishop
and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was removed on a stretcher and waved to the cheering
crowd as the medical vehicle reached the tunnel. He did not lose
any feeling in his arms and legs and was conscious. He was sent to
Piedmont Hospital for precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff, Bishop led the Titans in a rousing pre-game
cheer on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd replaces Thigpen
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee scratched wide receiver Yancey Thigpen before the
game. Thigpen decided before the game he would not be able to play
because of a hairline fracture in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   He broke the foot in the AFC Championship game last week against
Jacksonville and didn't practice all week. But the two-time Pro
Bowl receiver had hoped that a splint in his right shoe would allow
him to play.
</P>
<P>
   He tested the shoe a couple of hours before kickoff, talked with
Titans coach Jeff Fisher and trainer Steve Watterson and then went
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen was deactivated for the game, and Isaac Byrd started in
his place.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd caught 14 passes for 261 yards while starting six games
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Super spectators
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee also deactivated seven other players before Sunday's
game: safety Marcus Robertson, linebacker Phil Glover, cornerback
Craige Page, guard Zach Piller, third-string quarterback Kevin
Daft, running back Spencer George and defensive end Mike Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   Vicarious thrill
</P>
<P>
   Former Cleveland and Falcons linebacker Clay Matthews, who holds
the NFL record for most games played without appearing in a Super
Bowl, is getting a vicarious thrill from seeing his brother Bruce
reach Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like I'm going, and I don't have to worry about
playing,'' said Clay, who played in 278 games for the Cleveland
Browns and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm living through Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews, an offensive lineman for Tennessee, made his
first Super Bowl appearance after 17 years in the NFL. He even had
his number called in the second quarter. Matthews was penalized 5
yards yards for a false start.
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco cools off
</P>
<P>
   When Al Del Greco hooked a 47-yard field goal attempt in the
first quarter, it was uncharacteristic for the veteran kicker from
Auburn. Del Greco had been on a postseason hot streak, having made
seven of his last eight field-goal attempts in the playoffs prior
to the Super Bowl. His second 47-yard attempt early in the second
half was blocked by St. Louis cornerback Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
   Titan of a surprise
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's one element of offensive surprise was using backup
tight end Jackie Harris as a primary receiver. Harris caught two
passes for 24 yards in the first half. The Titans usually throw to
starting tight end Frank Wycheck, hero of the last-second kickoff
return (he threw the lateral) that beat Buffalo in the first round
of the playoffs. Wycheck, the team's leading receiver with 69
catches this season, went without a reception through the first two
quarters but caught a 13-yard pass on the first play of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging history
</P>
<P>
   Behind 9-0 at the half, Tenneesse became the 10th Super Bowl
team to go scoreless in the first 30 minutes. The other nine teams
lost the game. The Titans were optimistic: In three playoff games
they had overcome first-half deficits against Buffalo (one point),
Indianapolis (three points) and Jacksonville (seven points).

 &HT;    NFC NOTES: Starting status off, then on for Bush
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ St. Louis safety Devon Bush didn't get a super start
to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At one point this week, the former Falcon was expected to start
at free safety in place of Keith Lyle, who has missed eight games
with a bruised nerve in his left shoulder and neck area.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyle, who is a Pro Bowl second alternate despite the injury,
convinced Rams coach Dick Vermeil that he would be able to start.
After one series, however, Bush and Lyle switched places and Lyle
played only in obvious passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who signed with the Rams as a free agent before this
season after four years with the Falcons, knew the scenario could
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be cool with me (if Lyle starts),'' Bush said
earlier this week. ``It's his position, and I'm just playing it
while he's hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyle was the only last-minute change in St. Louis' starting
lineup. Vermeil put four players on the inactive list to the meet
the mandated 45-man roster for the Super Bowl: third-string
quarterback Joe Germaine, safety Ron Carpenter, guard Cameron
Spikes and wide receiver Chris Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   More bark than bite
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, the high-flying St. Louis offense
_ ranked No. 1 in the NFL _ sputtered at critical times in the
first half. The Rams racked up 294 yards offense over the first two
quarters, but managed only three field goals and went to the locker
room with a nine-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in last week's NFC Championship against the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, the Rams had no problem moving the ball _ until they
entered the red zone. St. Louis got inside the Tennessee 20-yard
line five times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable misses
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis kicker Jeff Wilkins has been a hot topic throughout
the playoffs. Vermeil considered putting him on the inactive list
after the kicker was bothered with tendinitis in his left knee
before the NFC Championship. Wilkins misfired on one of four
field-goal attempts against Tampa Bay last week. He missed one in
the first half Sunday, shanking a 34-yarder wide right.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also had another botched attempt on their first series
of the game. Holder Mike Horan fumbled the snap, recovered the ball
and was tackled by cornerback Donald Mitchell for no gain. Horan,
the oldest player to play in a Super Bowl (he turns 41 Tuesday),
remained the Rams' holder despite the blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky this time
</P>
<P>
   History repeated itself for the second week in a row for Rams
quarterback Kurt Warner. Just like against Tampa Bay, Warner's
first pass of the game was tipped up in the air by a defender. Last
week, it was caught for an interception by Steve White to set up a
Tampa Bay field goal. Sunday, Tennessee's Jevon Kearse tipped a
Warner toss and it ended up in the hands of St. Louis right tackle
Fred Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire? An early bet on the Rams to win
the Super Bowl would have given you a shot. The preseason odds were
200-1 against the Rams making it to Sunday's game and winning. . .
. Vermeil wasn't the Rams' No. 1 choice when they hired a new head
coach in 1997. He was the fifth pick, right behind Jim Mora.

<P>
   YANTARNY, Russia _ At the start of the death march in
Koenigsberg, they numbered about 7,000 _ the vast bulk of them
women, most quite young, all clad in wooden-soled shoes, thin rags
emblazoned with yellow six-pointed stars and telephone wire belts
on which were strung their cups and tin-can bowls.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they reached a vacant lock factory in this
nondescript seaside village, after two days and 25 miles of brutal
winter weather, there may have been 4,000 left. They remained
perhaps four days, then were herded down a bucolic cobblestone lane
and past dilapidated workers' cottages to an abandoned amber mine
on the shore of the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, 55 years ago Monday night, that Nazi SS guards
split them into packs of 50, sent them fleeing down the beach and
on to the ice-covered water itself, then mowed them down with
machine guns. Others were escorted to the mine and shot
point-blank.
</P>
<P>
   Auschwitz had been liberated four days before. ``Never forget,''
the civilized world said.
</P>
<P>
   But the world completely forgot about the massacre of Jewish
innocents at Palmnicken, now the Russian town of Yantarny, until
Sunday. Sunday, on the beach, a roaring gale whipped the sleet into
needles and raised towering whitecaps on a sea the color of wet
cement. At the base of the amber mine, a steep concrete-buttressed
cliff resembling a battlement, some 200 mourners dedicated a small
pyramid of stones and a plaque to the victims of the Koenigsberg
march and the Palmnicken massacre.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first tangible recognition that the march and
massacre had ever occurred. Until Sunday, there was no memorial to
Holocaust victims anywhere in Koenigsberg _ known now as Russian
Kaliningrad _ even though it was home to several small
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, the whole of the Kaliningrad region _ one million
people, the eldest of whom fought valiantly to defeat Hitler's army
in World War II _ was utterly unaware until a year ago that the
massacre had ever taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, no one needed this,'' Rabbi David Shvedik of
the Jewish Community in Kaliningrad said in an interview. ``For the
authorities in Yantarny and in the region, it was not at all
interesting to them to remember 7,000 dead Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the massacre, and of Kaliningrad's slow awakening
to it, is at once riveting and chilling. Put simply, the victorious
Soviet Union closed the book on Nazi atrocities once it seized
Koenigsberg from the Germans at the end of World War II. Thousands
of Germans were deported in rail cars to be replaced by Russian
immigrants; Jewish Holocaust victims were reburied as ``Soviet
heroes,'' stripped of religious identity. Red Army reports on the
massacre and on the discovery of mass graves were written, filed
and classified.
</P>
<P>
   Kaliningrad became a Soviet naval base and a closed region,
steeped in secrecy. Horrific memories half-lived into rumor, then
myth, then taboo enforced by the Kremlin's own unspoken, unofficial
anti-Semitism. Justice, delayed decades, was forever denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, not a single person was ever sentenced for
this,'' said Alexsander Aderichin, the investigative editor for the
Kaliningrad newspaper Dvornik, which helped break the massacre
story over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That Kaliningrad awakened at all may be credited to Christians _
a German and an American _ who grew up near Palmnicken and would
not suppress their own memories of the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The German, Martin Bergau, witnessed the executions of some
women and gave harrowing testimony to them in a German-language
book and in a submission to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Remembrance
Authority in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The American, Gunter Nitsch, had only heard stories of the
killings as a boy. But as an adult, he was so haunted by the
massacre's specter that he was compelled to track down the truth _
and in the process, to unleash the long-hidden accounts of what
happened during that terrifying week in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful,'' Nitsch said last week in a long telephone
interview. ``These were my people. Most of the people in my family
were members of the Nazi Party. Whatever happened cannot be
changed. But it must not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitsch, now 62, was but a 7-year-old when the Red Army stormed
through Poland and into Koenigsberg in early 1945. As the
Communists moved north, the Nazis began vacating a network of 30
camps ringing Poland's huge Stutthof concentration camp, moving
some 20,000 Jews away from the advancing army. Ninety percent were
women, mostly from Hungary and Lithuania; the men were Lithuanian
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of all 20,000 is unknown. What is clear is that roughly
7,000, by the latest estimate, wound up at a subcamp in
Koenigsberg, now the Baltic port of Kaliningrad, in January weather
so unusually bitter that ice floes stretched hundreds of feet from
the shore. On Jan. 26, Nazi guards began marching the crowd, clad
only in rags, some 25 miles northwest to Palmnicken.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 or more died along the way, either of
exhaustion or execution as they tried to flee their torturers. ``We
marched in heavy snow,'' Dora Hauptman, one of the captives, told
Yad Vashem in 1994. ``The cold was fierce, and a freezing wind blew
_ this was the weather we had to cope with. We weren't allowed to
rest at all. Every moment shots were fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The frostbitten survivors were imprisoned in the Palmnicken lock
factory and, after three or four days, marched five abreast to the
seashore. Some were taken to an open-pit amber crater. Bergau, then
a 15-year-old member of a German home-defense force, watched in
agony as they knelt and were shot in the back of the neck with
pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Other women were less fortunate. In his testimony, Bergau
recalled riding a horse in the area a week later, hearing gunshots
and sprinting in panic toward the seashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chestnut suddenly stopped short in his tracks, hesitated
and snorted,'' he wrote in 1994. ``I could not believe my eyes.
Between the ice flows, near the shore, the water was thick with
countless floating bodies. They were bobbing like swimmers in the
swell.'' He fled, he said, ``in cold horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 7,000, there were 13 known survivors. One of
them, Ms. Hauptman, had dived into the sea after a man told her
that ``someone must survive to describe their barbarity.'' Shot
once in the hand, she crawled ashore and, miraculously, was taken
in by a heroic German woman, Bertha Pulver, who hid her until the
Red Army arrived on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Nitsch saw none of this, but his Lutheran grandfather did. The
victorious Soviets commandeered German civilians that summer to
exhume the sand-covered bodies of the massacred and transport them
to mass graves and cemeteries for reburial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't believe it had happened,'' Nitsch said. ``It just
blew him apart. For the first few weeks, he couldn't talk at all.
All he did when he came home was to read the Bible. He lost a lot
of weight. And within a couple of months, he died.''

 &HT;    ABC's call was short on visuals
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were some givens about ABC's telecast going into
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures would look good. Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels
would be articulate and informative, and Boomer Esaison would be a
fine listen with his blend of candor and humor.
</P>
<P>
   All of those elements were there Sunday night, but it had the
feel of that old beer slogan commercial: Taste great, less filling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Esiason pointed out there was a lot of
miscommunication in the Rams secondary with backup Anthony Dorsett
calling signals. While the analysis was strong, there was nothing
to support it. No illustrations were offered. No replays.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason was noticeably better at reacting to plays than
explaining why they happened. But it was a strength that was much
needed during that somber time when Titans safety Blaine Bishop was
injured, a situation Esiason and Michaels handled with admirable
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, it was taste great, less filling. Reporter
Lesley Visser noted Rams quarterback Kurt Warner went over by
Bishop, knelt down and prayed, but if there was a picture of that
moment, it was too fleeting to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kurt Warner's wife, Brenda, received plenty of notice.
Although the shots of wives have become cliches, her husband's
rags-to-riches story is such a great one, and her reactions were so
expressive, it was obvious director Craig Janoff felt she had
become a centerpiece of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   On one possession by the Titans in the first half, it seemed the
only shots away from the ball were of Warner's wife. The search for
a similar centerpiece for the Oilers was not as rewarding until
late in the third quarter, when an emphasis was placed on Titans
coach Jeff Fisher, complemented by a terrific shot of Steve
McNair's wife, Mechelle, in a prayerful pose when Tennessee was
driving for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the four-hour pregame show, studio analyst Steve
Young, who was sharp and laden with timely anecdotes, raised
eyebrows with his bold prediction of, ``40 points from the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best one-liner of ABC's four-hour telecast belonged to
Rams tight end Ernie Conwell, who said after witnessing the card
tricks by magician David Blaine in one segment, ``Maybe we ought to
suit him up on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   If Conwell's line was best, the segment with the cast of ``The
View'' was the worst. This bid to cater to the women viewers had to
be embarrassing to the participants and condescending to its
intended audience with the shallow continuous references to the
tight pants worn by the players.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a bad execution of a good idea. Luckily for
sports reporters Lesley Visser and Robin Roberts, who joined `View'
regulars Barbara Walters and Co., they had opportunities for
redemption with thoughtful features on the Rams' Marshall Faulk and
Fritz Pollard, pro football's first black quarterback and head
coach in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stunning performance by a woman Sunday was ESPN
feature reporter Andrea Kremer, showing up for duty on the set of
``Sunday NFL Countdown'' at the Georgia Rail Depot after giving
birth Wednesday to a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't ESPN's idea, but the network brass was unable to
talk Kremer out of it and chose not to pull rank.

   Though a child, Nitsch worked too, weeding and painting a
cemetery where the victims had been reburied. Soon his family was
loaded into a cattle car and deported to East Germany; later, he
fled to West Germany. And in 1964, he moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not forget. Friends said he imagined the killings.
But at a German book fair in New York City, he found a volume with
a chapter on Palmnicken and, he wrote, ``felt vindicated.'' Still
later, he found Bergau's book with its eyewitness account of the
murders. Working on a still-unpublished book, he asked the Simon
Wiesenthal Center and Yad Vashem for files on the Palmnicken
slaughter, and received Ms. Hauptman's account, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he flew to Kaliningrad and asked regional officials for
help. A state archivist listened, then said he must be mistaken; no
such event could have occurred and been erased from history. Nor
was there any trace of the Jewish cemetery where he once weeded
graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing had been forgotten,'' he said last week. ``I could
accept that they didn't know where the cemetery was, but to find
out they didn't know about the massacre at all was mind-boggling.''
Not until the archivist sent Nitsch to journalists like Aderichin
of Dvornik did the truth emerge. A spate of articles led to an
observance of the massacre last year; this year, fund raisers
collected enough for a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The region's governor spoke at its dedication Sunday, something
remarkable in a society where Jewish suffering in World War II was
little acknowledged in public even a decade ago. Another speaker
called it Kaliningrad's Babi Yar, a reference to the ravine near
Kiev where SS guards massacred more than 100,000 Jews from 1941 to
1943. That atrocity went largely ignored until the poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko wrote about it in 1961 to protest plans to desecrate
the site with a sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new question now: how to investigate rumors that
8,000 more Jews were marched to the nearby town of Baltisk, sealed
in a barracks and then killed in a massive explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we gathered here instills hope that something
like this won't happen again,'' Shvedik said Sunday, shouting into
a bullhorn to be heard above the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the rundown kindergarten that is his congregation's
temple, he recalls a woman who walked past the little memorial as
it was being completed this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came by with her children,'' he said, ``and then she
asked: `Why are you putting up a monument to Jews here? Why not a
monument to the Russians?'''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In one of the most dramatic Super Bowls ever played,
the Tennessee Titans rallied from 16 points down to tie the St.
Louis Rams late in the fourth quarter Sunday, but it was a 73-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Kurt Warner to Isaac Bruce that
became the stunning and stirring game-winning play in a 23-16 Rams'
victory in Super Bowl XXXIV in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's touchdown, with 1 minute 54 seconds to play, came one
play after Tennessee had tied the score on a 43-yard Al Del Greco
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's spectacular catch and run along the sideline was a
fitting conclusion to the Rams enchanting run from last place to
Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   On their next and last possession, the Titans drove down the
field but were stopped a yard short of the end zone as time ran
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who won just four games last season, were led by
Warner, a longtime backup whose rebirth as the league's top player
came to symbolize the Rams' rags-to-riches story. Warner's passing
moved St. Louis, which won 16 of 19 games this season, into
Tennessee territory several times, setting up three Jeff Wilkins
first-half field goals. Warner later threw a third-quarter
touchdown pass to Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl victory was the first for the Rams, who lost
Super Bowl XIV when they played in Los Angeles. Their championship
Sunday also made their 63-year-old coach, Dick Vermeil, the oldest
coach to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, a franchise that moved from Houston to Tennessee
three years ago and changed its name from the Oilers, were
appearing in their first Super Bowl game. Tennessee's offense
struggled throughout much of the game but the Titans found their
stride late in the game behind the running of Eddie George, who
scored on a 1-yard touchdown as the third quarter ended.
Tennessee's attempt to convert a two-point conversion failed.
Midway through the fourth quarter, George again scored on a 1-yard
run off right tackle to cut the Rams' lead to 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that both the Jaguars and the Titans were here.
Both teams took advantage of what was a remarkably topsy-turvy but
exciting season in which there were few dominant teams. The Rams
won just four games last season, but this season with a prolific
offense they were able to overwhelm opponents, especially on the
speedy artificial turf of their home stadium. The Titans used the
opposite approach, a bruising ground game led by George and a
quarterback in Steve McNair who runs first and asks questions
later.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and St. Louis epitomized this strange season,
overcoming several crucial obstacles. For the Rams, it was the loss
to a season-ending injury of their starting quarterback, Trent
Green, who was replaced by Warner; he turned into one of the better
single-season stories in league history. The Titans, after playing
in four home stadiums in four years, finally settled in Nashville.
They beat the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs on a
lateral pass on a kick return in the the final seconds and last
week traveled to Jacksonville and defeated the favored Jaguars,
beating them for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The week leading up to the game was bizarre. The normally
warm-weather host city turned chilly, with freezing rain and
subzero wind-chill altering practice schedules, shutting down roads
and leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were ready for the game to begin, and it did in
spectacular fashion, with a series of good plays on both sides of
the ball. Warner threw nice touch passes to his wide receivers, and
the Titans' defense, as it has done all season, gave up some key
yards but was stingy inside the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee blitz on third-and-long early in the game hurried
Warner, causing him to throw an incomplete pass. St. Louis lined up
for a 27-yard field-goal try with kicker Wilkins, who has tendon
damage in his left knee that will require surgery, and the holder
Mike Horan, at 39 one of the oldest players in Super Bowl history.
The combination of an old man and a kicker with a bum leg proved
disastrous, as Horan bobbled the snap and was tackled for a loss,
and the Titans escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The fumbled snap was an obvious case of nerves as players were
clearly rattled by the spectacle of the biggest game of the season.
When later in the first quarter the Titans tried a field goal, from
47 yards by Del Greco, it was wide left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis continued to put pressure on the Tennessee defense.
Wide receiver Bruce caught a 32-yard pass to begin the Rams' second
series, which was followed by Marshall Faulk's 17-yard catch. Again
the Rams stalled, but this time Wilkins connected from 27 yards on
the field- goal try.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, meanwhile, was miserable on offense and managed only
89 yards in the first half. McNair and the passing game never
really got on track, and in the first half he completed only one
pass to a wide receiver. George had some solid runs and several big
catches, but the Rams, sometimes crowding eight or nine men near
the line of scrimmage, were able to limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Wilkins missed another field-goal attempt in the
second quarter but later connected from 29 yards and then 28 yards
for a 9-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were playing marvelous defense, but it seemed only a
matter of time before the Rams broke out of their field-goal habit.
Tennessee defensive backs sometimes looked a half-step slower than
St. Louis wideouts, unable to keep up with their speed on
underneath crossing routes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had 159 yards of offense in the first quarter alone,
the third-most in Super Bowl history, and Warner had thrown for 277
yards passing in the first half, a halftime record second to
Washington's Doug Williams 306 in Super Bowl XXII. Warner also
threw a record 35 passes in the first half, which were more than
Tennessee's total plays, 24. Warner completed 19 passes, six to
Torry Holt for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was making great reads, precise throws, and was in the
kind of groove few players experience in the Super Bowl. Still,
after five trips inside the Titans' 20-yard line, the Rams had only
three field goals to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to break, it seemed. Something was going to break.
Soon.  &QL;

 &HT;    Playing field level in NFL
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter what you might have heard, this improbable
Super Bowl matchup was not a product of parity.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, the Rams and Titans were a combined 31-6 entering the
game.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot closer to dominance than parity.
</P>
<P>
   This improbable Super Bowl matchup was not an indictment of an
economic system that allows a lot of teams to be 8-8, although the
NFL's system surely does that. It was, instead, an endorsement of
an economic system that allows any team, if well-run and
well-coached and sufficiently lucky, to win big.
</P>
<P>
   This should be the most basic tenet, the overriding operating
philosophy, of any sports league on any level: Establish rules that
give everyone an equal chance to compete and to win.
</P>
<P>
   But in major-league sports in this country, only the NFL _ with
true revenue-sharing and a hard-to-circumvent salary cap _ truly
delivers on that tenet.
</P>
<P>
   A sport that can produce a championship game matching the
nation's Nos. 21 and 30 television markets _ St. Louis and
Nashville, respectively _ is playing on a level field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this Super Bowl matchup underscores something
very important about the strength of the National Football
League,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``We have a system,
and we continue to strive to have a system, that works for all
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where they are located, no matter what size market
they are in, our system gives every team the same chance and gives
the fans serious hope that their team can make the playoffs and
make a run at the Super Bowl championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a Super Bowl is not simply a matter of who had the most
money, who is in the biggest city. . . . It is a matter of who has
an organization that can compete, build a team from top to bottom,
put a lot of outstanding talent together and have that talent work
as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball can't claim that, as you know.

FOUNDER OF GANG CALLS FOR FOCUS TO SHIFT FROM CRIMES TO THE
COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Omar Portee, known on the streets as O.G. Mack, the
O.G. standing for Original Gangster, the founder of The United
Blood Nation, or Bloods, and the best-known gang leader on the East
Coast, left prison last June with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloods gang, he thought, had become too much like what the
police had always derided it as _ a constellation of barely
connected street thugs in love with the cheap romance of coded
language and symbolic tattoos. They wore red, spouted gang slang
and slashed and held people up _ and all too often black residents
were their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Bloods on the street are young,'' Portee said in a
recent interview. ``They look in a few books or on the computer and
think they know what we are about, you know what I'm saying? This
stuff they are doing is not coming from us. We are willing to
teach, but they got to listen. Things have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Portee said he is eager to give the Bloods an ideological
orientation, to get them to practice political education and
eradicate black-on-black crime. During an interview in the Bronx _
one conducted with a great concern for secrecy _ Portee declared
his own transformation complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a stranger to who I was when I went into prison,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was in prison on Rikers Island that Portee helped found New
York's version of the Bloods, and, not surprisingly, there is no
shortage of law enforcement officials who insist that his pledge to
turn the Bloods into an outfit devoted to political and cultural
solidarity be regarded with the deepest skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about reform, it is about control,'' a senior
member of the police department's gang intelligence unit said of
Portee. ``It is about making money.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Portee's reform effort has already met with more than
skepticism. There are those within the Bloods who have rejected his
pitch as nonsense, an indication of his lost stature and, worse,
faint-heartedness. According to the police, who keep Portee under
close surveillance, there are Bloods gang members actively trying
to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   That such confusion could reign in the world of the city's No. 1
street gang is hardly shocking.
</P>
<P>
   The true dimensions of the city's gang problem, and the degree
of hierarchy and coordination that exists between and within the
gangs, has long been a subject of dispute. Some law enforcement
officials believe that the threat gangs pose is real and serious.
Others belittle the reach of gangs, saying that while real crimes
have been committed by youths conversant in gang slang and wearing
the clothes and tattoos that signify gang membership, the problem
is less sophisticated and organized than it is in places like Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So while Portee and those in law enforcement offer different
reasons for his attempt to organize the Bloods _ political
mobilization vs. enhancing drug sales _ everyone agrees that his
influence does not extend much beyond eight blocks along 183rd
Street in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real Bloods know what they got to do,'' Portee said. ``I
ain't no preacher. I'm on the street. I'm with the Bloods. I'm not
telling people to be church boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Portee, 28, was at Rikers serving a sentence for attempted
murder when he started the Bloods there in July 1993. He swiftly
gathered hundreds of inmates behind him and broke the dominance
within the prison system of the two major Latin gangs, the Netas
and the Latin Kings. His followers carried out dozens of slashings
and assaults every month in the battle to control the cellblocks,
according to correction officials.
</P>
<P>
   Typically those who joined the Bloods in New York, inside or
outside prison, first learned about O.G. Mack and how he started
the gang in Rikers ``to fight oppression.'' He became, to some, a
symbol of defiance in the face of white authority.
</P>
<P>
   There are correction officers, though, who say that much of
Portee's criminal celebrity can be attributed to mythmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept himself out of trouble most of the time he was in
prison,'' said Emmanuel H. Bailey, a deputy warden at Rikers who
was the former head of the Gang Intelligence Unit. ``He spread the
word, educated people in Blood ideology and invented codes and
sets. He was the instigator, the man who manipulated those around
him to carry out slashings and do his bidding. He became an idol.
Everyone knew who O.G. Mack was, but he didn't do much himself. He
was the great pretender.''
</P>
<P>
   Portee, 28, was raised by his grandmother and was arrested at
age 16 for armed robbery. After serving time at Rikers, he was
released at 19 and drifted out to the West Coast, spending time
with members of the Bloods gang in Los Angeles. At 21 he was
arrested again in the Bronx and was sent again to Rikers.
</P>
<P>
   Portee created his own version of the Bloods upon his return to
prison. He founded 14 ``sets,'' or independent sub-groups, with
names like Gangsta Killa Bloods or Valentine Bloods. Portee's ``One
Eight Trey'' set is named for 183rd Street. Like most sets, it has
its own elaborate secret hand signals and codes.
</P>
<P>
   There was, running through the recruitment of members and the
coded language they adopted, something approaching an underlying
philosophy _ one that mixed notions of black solidarity, a violent
pledge not to be victimized by other gangs and an elaborate
punishment system for those who violated the Bloods' protocols.
</P>
<P>
   If lacking in cohesive structure and a fully coherent ideology,
the rough notion of a gang constituted by the Bloods in New York
was enough to send the numbers of what police called gang-related
crimes soaring in recent years. With those coming out of prison
carrying with them Bloods ideology, the concept of the Bloods was
embraced by certain youths and used as a kind of rationale for
crime, many of whose victims happened to be residents of the city's
predominantly black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   That, Portee said, was a perversion of the gang's purpose. He
said he was offended that the Bloods had become small, disparate
and often antagonistic groups, all wearing the red Bloods colors
and spouting gang slang, much of it coined by him in the prison
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in prison are not about fighting against the
community,'' Portee said. ``We are not about this black-on-black
crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His heroes now are Bobby Seale, George Jackson and Huey P.
Newton, whose books he read in prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result he has, such as he can, suspended the induction of
new Blood members, outlawed the practice of gang members sleeping
with girls seeking to join and condemned slashing attacks, often a
prerequisite for membership in a set, Portee said. The axiom
``blood in, blood out,'' meaning that a gang member has to draw
blood on a victim to join and be cut up to leave, has also been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the kids roaming the streets in the Bloods'
colors, using the hand signals, gang codes or slang, are
uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   If it is hard to assess Portee's seriousness, it is harder to
gauge his chances of success, given the anarchic nature of the
Bloods in New York. His newest followers, a half dozen of whom
appeared with him one night in a Pizza Hut on Fordham Road with
black and red bandannas covering the lower half of their faces,
said the Bloods now model themselves after the Black Panthers and
hope to ``help the community.'' None, though, offered any specifics
on what that help might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on my own since I was 13,'' said a 26-year-old
woman, the mother of two children who would only give her street
name of K-Loka. ``I have been a victim of the system I am trying to
overcome now, a broken home, foster care and prison. I have a whole
arsenal of books. I study and read. I was alone before, but in the
United Blood Nation I have the power to change.''
</P>
<P>
   During the earlier interview in the Bronx, Portee, his 180-pound
frame chiseled after years of weight-lifting in prison, paced
around a small room in a housing project with restlessness that was
dizzying. His dark brown eyes were intense, anxious and
distrustful.
</P>
<P>
   Portee, who makes and sells shirts that read ``Black and Latino
Love,'' at times seemed tired of what he calls ``the gansta life.''
He often carries with him lined sheets of paper containing the
flawless penmanship in which he has begun writing his life story,
one he hopes he can publish as a book. He has also recorded rap
songs composed in prison in a small studio in the Bronx and would
like to build a career as a recording artist.
</P>
<P>
   Portee said, though, that his greatest focus was on staying
alive. The police said it is no longer safe for him to travel to
Brooklyn and that he rarely leaves his own neighborhood. Even
there, they said, he has problems.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Portee's relatives called a reporter from a pay
phone one afternoon to set up a meeting, done because Porte fears
the police have tapped the phones of his family members, gun shots
rent the air. The woman shrieked for her children to take cover,
and dropped the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war in the 'hood,'' she said later.
</P>
<P>
   Portee, aware that the authorities think his political effort is
a fraud, and conscious that reforming his wayward gang members will
not be easy, nonetheless keeps a brave, and straight, face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all my Bloods, even the ones that hate me,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: A SUPER ATTRACTION WITHOUT THE DYNASTIES HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS game result in 5th graf) 
 (ms) 
 By GEORGE VESCEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the nice things about Super Bowl XXXIV was that
neither the St. Louis Rams nor the Tennessee Titans carried the
heavy weight of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed genuinely grateful to be part of the Super
Bowl, knowing that it might only come around once, and none of them
brought an attitude of ``been here, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the blessing of parity, of which the National Football
League can never get enough. The concept of parity comes off as a
goofy stereotype until Commissioner Paul Tagliabue starts talking
about how the league shares its network television money to level
the playing field for well-run organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Then along come the Rams and the Titans, two teams that made the
right choices of players and coaches in the short run, which is
really all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Before they lost Sunday, 23-16, the Titans had never appeared in
a Super Bowl, going back to the Houston Oilers franchise that began
in 1960. The Rams had made their only appearance in a previous life
in Los Angeles back in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A number of franchises have given off the definite impression
that they belonged in the Super Bowl just about every year _ even
though their identities shifted over the years, from Dallas to San
Francisco, from Buffalo to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the biggest thing was how I always perceived teams who
made it to the Super Bowl,'' said Bruce Matthews of the Titans, in
his first Super Bowl after 17 years. ``I always thought they were
head and shoulders above other teams, or if I was ever going to be
on a Super Bowl team there would be no doubt in my mind that we
were going to make the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Matthews played on a transplanted team with an
excellent 13-3 won-lost record that survived the extra week of the
wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week our confidence grew, and I don't think until the
clock ran out in Jacksonville that I ever perceived ourselves as a
Super Bowl team,'' Matthews said. ``I think that's a quality in our
team that has helped us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bunch of hungry guys who haven't really accomplished
anything as far as a team goes in this league. We want to taste
that success. We're sick and tired of hearing, `You can't do this
and you can't do that,' and basically watching other teams in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time two franchises were in the Super Bowl for the
first time was in 1986, when the Chicago Bears and the New England
Patriots met. Leading up to that game, the Bears acted as if they
were good enough to blow away the Patriots, which is exactly what
they did, by a 46-10 score.
</P>
<P>
   This year both teams believed they were good. The Rams were
favored by roughly 7 points, and the Titans smarted a bit about
that, noting that they had already beaten the Rams, 24-21, this
season, and didn't that count for something?
</P>
<P>
   Both teams gave off the old sports cliche of just being happy to
be here.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Proehl, who caught the pass for the Rams' only touchdown
in the conference title game, said: ``I've been to every one since
I've been in the league. I come just because I'm a fan of the game.
It's just fun to come down and see a lot of the guys you play
against.'' Now he was getting paid to attend the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about it growing up playing football in the streets
with your friends,'' said Frank Wychek, the Tennessee receiver who
tossed the lateral for the game-winning touchdown in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm in my hotel room, I just think about what
is really happening this week. You have to stop and pinch yourself
because these things don't happen to guys like me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm enjoying every second of it. Just to play in the
game and set foot on the field is enough for me, but to do
something special in a game of this magnitude is just icing on the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of excitement even came from the two coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher of the Titans, who earned a ring with Chicago
although injured in the Bears' Super Bowl season, never lost his
poise in public this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil of the Rams had coached the Philadelphia Eagles in
the 1981 Super Bowl, and then left the business, citing the dreaded
``coach's burnout.'' He returned to coach the Rams three years ago
and has been generally upbeat in this sudden rush to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil did turn crabby when both teams were advised against
trying to get to the Georgia Dome for a practice last Saturday
because of the icy roads.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the nasty weather that produced an introverted
feeling of waiting for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no golf, no going around in shorts,'' noted Neil
O'Donnell, the Titans' backup quarterback, who played for
Pittsburgh in the 1996 game in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a focus, a looking forward to the game
itself. If this was to be their Super Bowl experience, they were
going to enjoy it.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In one of the most dramatic Super Bowls ever played,
the Tennessee Titans rallied from 16 points down to tie the St.
Louis Rams late in the fourth quarter Sunday night, but it was a
73-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kurt Warner to Isaac Bruce
that became the stunning game-winning play in a 23-16 Rams' victory
in Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the victory was not secured until the Rams' linebacker Mike
Jones stopped Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson on the 1-yard line
on the final play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's touchdown, with 1 minute 54 seconds left in the game,
came one play after Tennessee had tied the score at 16-16 on a
43-yard Al Del Greco field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's spectacular catch and run along the sideline capped the
Rams' enchanting run from last place to Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who won just four games last season, were led by
Warner, a longtime backup whose rebirth as the league's top player
came to symbolize the Rams' rags-to-riches story. Warner's passing
moved St. Louis, which won 16 of 19 games this season, into
Tennessee territory several times, setting up three Jeff Wilkins
first-half field goals. Warner later threw a third-quarter
touchdown pass to Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl victory was the first for the Rams, who lost
Super Bowl XIV when they played in Los Angeles. Their championship
Sunday also made their 63-year-old coach, Dick Vermeil, the oldest
coach to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, a franchise that moved from Houston to Tennessee
three years ago and changed its name from the Oilers, were
appearing in their first Super Bowl game. Tennessee's offense
struggled throughout much of the game but the Titans found their
stride late in the game behind the running of Eddie George, who
scored on a 1-yard touchdown as the third quarter ended.
Tennessee's attempt to convert a two-point conversion failed.
Midway through the fourth quarter, George again scored on a 1-yard
run off right tackle to cut the Rams' lead to 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that both the Jaguars and the Titans were here.
Both teams took advantage of what was a remarkably topsy-turvy but
exciting season in which there were few dominant teams. The Rams
won just four games last season, but this season with a prolific
offense they were able to overwhelm opponents, especially on the
speedy artificial turf of their home stadium. The Titans used the
opposite approach, a bruising ground game led by George and a
quarterback in Steve McNair who runs first and asks questions
later.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and St. Louis epitomized this strange season,
overcoming several crucial obstacles. For the Rams, it was the loss
to a season-ending injury of their starting quarterback, Trent
Green, who was replaced by Warner; he turned into one of the better
single-season stories in league history. The Titans, after playing
in four home stadiums in four years, finally settled in Nashville.
They beat the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs on a
lateral pass on a kick return in the the final seconds and last
week traveled to Jacksonville and defeated the favored Jaguars,
beating them for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The week leading up to the game was bizarre. The normally
warm-weather host city turned chilly, with freezing rain and
subzero wind-chill altering practice schedules, shutting down roads
and leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were ready for the game to begin, and it did in
spectacular fashion, with a series of good plays on both sides of
the ball. Warner threw nice touch passes to his wide receivers, and
the Titans' defense, as it has done all season, gave up some key
yards but was stingy inside the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee blitz on third-and-long early in the game hurried
Warner, causing him to throw an incomplete pass. St. Louis lined up
for a 27-yard field-goal try with kicker Wilkins, who has tendon
damage in his left knee that will require surgery, and the holder
Mike Horan, at 39 one of the oldest players in Super Bowl history.
The combination of an old man and a kicker with a bum leg proved
disastrous, as Horan bobbled the snap and was tackled for a loss,
and the Titans escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The fumbled snap was an obvious case of nerves as players were
clearly rattled by the spectacle of the biggest game of the season.
When later in the first quarter the Titans tried a field goal, from
47 yards by Del Greco, it was wide left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis continued to put pressure on the Tennessee defense.
Wide receiver Bruce caught a 32-yard pass to begin the Rams' second
series, which was followed by Marshall Faulk's 17-yard catch. Again
the Rams stalled, but this time Wilkins connected from 27 yards on
the field- goal try.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, meanwhile, was miserable on offense and managed only
89 yards in the first half. McNair and the passing game never
really got on track, and in the first half he completed only one
pass to a wide receiver. George had some solid runs and several big
catches, but the Rams, sometimes crowding eight or nine men near
the line of scrimmage, were able to limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Wilkins missed another field-goal attempt in the
second quarter but later connected from 29 yards and then 28 yards
for a 9-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were playing marvelous defense, but it seemed only a
matter of time before the Rams broke out of their field-goal habit.
Tennessee defensive backs sometimes looked a half-step slower than
St. Louis wideouts, unable to keep up with their speed on
underneath crossing routes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had 159 yards of offense in the first quarter alone,
the third-most in Super Bowl history, and Warner had thrown for 277
yards passing in the first half, a halftime record second to
Washington's Doug Williams 306 in Super Bowl XXII. Warner also
threw a record 35 passes in the first half, which were more than
Tennessee's total plays, 24. Warner completed 19 passes, six to
Torry Holt for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was making great reads, precise throws, and was in the
kind of groove few players experience in the Super Bowl. Still,
after five trips inside the Titans' 20-yard line, the Rams had only
three field goals to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to break, it seemed. Something was going to break.
Soon.  &QL;

ROCK SINGER JOSH CLAYTON-FELT DIES AT 32 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Josh Clayton-Felt, a rock singer, guitarist and songwriter, died
on Jan. 19 in Los Angeles. He was 32.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Robert Weide, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton-Felt, who grew up in Boston, took an early interest in
music because of the influence of his stepfather, Henry Felt, a
folk musician who exposed him to the records of Leadbelly, Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Los Angeles and formed the band School of Fish with
Michael Ward. Benefiting from the recent success of alternative
rock, School of Fish was soon signed to Capitol Records, which
released the band's only significant hit, ``Three Strange Days.''
After a second album, ``Human Cannonball,'' the band broke up, in
part because Clayton-Felt wanted to stretch his repertory beyond
alternative rock.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a solo deal with A&AMP;M Records, for which he recorded
the CD ``Inarticulate Nature Boy,'' playing all the instruments
himself. In 1996 &UR; ,  &LR;  Clayton-Felt toured as an opening act with
Tori Amos and released a CD of concert recordings, ``Felt Like
Making a Live Record.'' In his spare time as a session musician, he
played guitar on the Jewel CD ``Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   When Polygram, owner of A&AMP;M, was taken over by Seagram in late
1998, Clayton-Felt was dropped from the label along with 250 other
acts. He spent much of last year fighting A&AMP;M for the rights to
release his second solo album, ``Invisible Tree,'' a set of 14
songs he had spent three years working on. The album never came
out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his stepfather, he is survived by his mother,
Marilyn Felt, and his father, John Clayton, all of Massachusetts,
and a sister, Laura Clayton Baker of Santa Monica, Calif.

SENATE PRIMARIES CREATE TUMULT IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ One race is a free-for-all: five Republican
contenders scrambling to emerge from the long shadow of Gov.
Christie Whitman, New Jersey's pre-eminent political figure.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a civil war: a fight between two Democrats that is
so fractious and bitter that it threatens to split the state party
into rival camps divided by geography and social class.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York, where voters are facing a clear choice for U.S.
senator _ the Democrat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, or the Republican,
Rudolph Giuliani _ New Jersey is mired in two intriguing primaries.
The battle to succeed Sen. Frank Lautenberg is being waged in two
parties without a dominant figure, so it promises to redefine each
party as they prepare to fight for New Jersey's ultimate prize: the
governor's office in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have been dominated for seven years by Whitman,
were left reeling in September, when the governor ended her bid to
succeed Lautenberg, a Democrat. Since then, the collection of
Senate hopefuls has been raising money and trying to build
alliances to fill part of the power vacuum that will open when
Whitman leaves office in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state's Democrats, whose field has been narrowed
to two main contenders, former Gov. Jim Florio and a political
novice, Jon S. Corzine, have been struggling to keep the clash from
leaving the party irreparably divided after the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, a tireless campaigner, has been rallying the loyalists
he has cultivated during his 20 years on the party's political
scene. But the powerful party bosses in North Jersey fear that
voters will never forgive Florio for raising income taxes by $2.8
billion in 1990 and have rallied behind Corzine, a former chairman
of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaigns have exchanged barbs over bedrock Democratic
issues like gun control, education, Social Security and even the
death penalty. But behind the scenes, the fight has been a struggle
for the soul of the party, with battle lines drawn between wealthy
voters and the working class, between northern power brokers and
their rivals in the south, and between various political bosses and
rank-and-file Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have to figure out whether they can trust a new
Democrat, a candidate with liberal views, fiscal responsibility and
a fat bank account,'' said David Rebovich, a political science
professor at Rider University, referring to Corzine. ``Republicans
have to determine whether there's someone who can carry on Governor
Whitman's ability to put together a winning coalition and keep the
party from fragmenting ideologically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Rebovich said, ``they can all set their sights on
winning the real patronage trough, the governor's mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the maneuvering is a result of the fact that New Jersey
places more power in its governor's office than virtually any other
state. Except for the two U.S. senators, the governor is the only
statewide elected official and appoints powerful cabinet members
like the treasurer and attorney general, as well as influential
judges.
</P>
<P>
   With no statewide stepping-stone offices, the political
landscape resembles ``Gulliver's Travels'' _ a gigantic governor
surrounded by swarms of Lilliputians.
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans, that means the roster of actual candidates for
the Senate seat is less a political ``Who's Who'' than a ``Who's
That?''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's most powerful Republicans, Donald T.
DiFrancesco, president of the state Senate, and Jack Collins, the
Assembly speaker, opted out of the Senate race because they are
interested in succeeding Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The elder statesman of the state party, former Gov. Tom Kean,
disappointed many Republicans by not entering the fray. Steve
Forbes is still pursuing his long-shot bid for the Republican
presidential nomination and, despite the urging of party leaders in
Washington, has shown no interest in running for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the contestants are five lesser-known figures with
limited political bases: state Sen. William L. Gormley, U.S. Rep.
Bob Franks, and the Essex County executive, James W. Treffinger,
who are all moderates. Two conservatives are also running: Murray
Sabrin, a former Libertarian Party candidate for governor, and
Brian T. Kennedy, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the governor withdrew from the race,
Gormley, Franks and Treffinger have been furiously lobbying members
of the party establishment, and endorsements have been doled out
largely along geographical lines.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements by county party chairmen are crucial in New Jersey
politics, because in many counties, chairmen can choose which
candidate's name runs on the party line in the primary, giving them
a sizable advantage with the loyalists who go to the polls in
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, an ex-marine and chairman of the powerful state Senate
judiciary committee, is the sole moderate from South Jersey. Franks
and Treffinger both have political bases in North Jersey, which is
far more densely populated than the south. And all three men have
been battling for support in Monmouth County, along the Jersey
Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley has raised the most money among Republican hopefuls,
$1.5 million in donations in just 90 days. He is also believed to
have the most potential as a fund-raiser because his district
includes the casinos of Atlantic City, and he has won the backing
of the governor's chief fund-raiser, Lewis M. Eisenberg, the
chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a former state party chairman, raised $750,000 as of the
Jan. 1 filing date and has won the support of Republican officials
in Union, Warren and Burlington counties. A congressman since 1992,
he has maintained that he has the experience in Washington to be an
effective senator.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, a former Democrat who has served as Essex County
executive since 1995, has surprised many party officials with the
strength of his campaign, raising $650,000 and winning the support
of five county chairmen. Treffinger also has the backing of Mayor
Bret D. Schundler of Jersey City, a darling of New Jersey
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Treffinger and Franks continue to split the support
of North Jersey Republicans, most observers believe they are locked
in a three-way race with Gormley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Haytaian, the state Republican Party chairman, said he
expected the organizational maneuvering to overshadow any
discussion of issues until April. Then, Haytaian said, the
candidates can focus on addressing Republican voters and laying out
their differences, on a relatively narrow set of issues without a
stark philosophical rift.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say the party has been in power so long that it
needs to be reinvigorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a certain ideological exhaustion,'' said Steve
Salmore, a consultant who has worked with both moderate and
conservative Republicans in recent years. Early in the 1990s ``they
rolled over the state, took over everything. But now they're
looking for an issue to build their agenda around because there's
not a clear sense of what they stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin, the former Libertarian, hopes the three centrist
candidates continue to divide the moderate vote, and allow him to
pull together an upset by rallying right-wing voters who have been
frustrated by years of Whitman's moderate views on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin won 5 percent of the vote during his campaign for
governor in 1997, but the candidacy of Kennedy, who won a third of
the Republican primary vote for the 1994 Senate nomination, is
likely to provide strong competition for conservative support.
</P>
<P>
   If the primary becomes too divisive, or if conservatives appear
poised for a victory, Whitman has indicated she might intercede by
endorsing either Gormley or Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have little hope for any peacemaker to ease the
tension of their Senate race, which has become entwined in a feud
so bitter that seven state legislators from South Jersey recently
boycotted their own party's caucus to protest actions by the
leaders from North Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who has the support of most South Jersey political
leaders, has tried to make Corzine's vast wealth an issue, casting
the race as a test of the power of party loyalty vs. the power of
money. Although neither Democratic candidate will release exact
fund-raising figures until this week, Corzine has pledged to spend
as much of his $300 million fortune as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That spending promise has made some Florio supporters say the
Democrats should consider renaming themselves, ``The Price is Right
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party has traditionally been the party of
families and working people,'' said Florio, who charged that
Corzine is wooing party bosses with his money. ``If we allow
someone to step in and buy the election outright, there might never
again be a race where anyone but a millionaire can run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine's supporters contend that Florio sprang from the
powerful South Jersey Democratic machine, and even now enjoys the
support of the Camden County power broker, George E. Norcross, so
it is disingenuous for him to proclaim himself an outsider trying
to slay the party's bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has tried to portray himself as the Democrat of the
future, a synthesis of Wall Street credentials and social activism
to cure the ills of Main Street America. Any other Democrat who
proposed universal health care and universal college education, as
Corzine has done, might be open to criticism for being a liberal
spendthrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Corzine's done so well in the business world, it's hard to
write him off as financially irresponsible,'' said Jim McQueeney, a
Democratic consultant. ``He's selling himself as a nouveau, nouveau
Democrat, a market-driven Democrat, and as long as the stock market
is doing well, people may listen.'' A third candidate, Lloyd DeVos,
who is a lawyer, has not been a major factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, whose candidacy has the tacit support of Sen. Robert
Torricelli, the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the state
party and local Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In return, he has received the backing of chairmen in seven
counties, including the densely populated Democratic strongholds of
Essex Hudson, Union and Middlesex, where 62 percent of the state's
registered Democrats live.
</P>
<P>
   Florio says that his years as congressman and governor have
produced tangible results on the issues of gun control,
environmental cleanup and education reform. But Corzine's status as
a political newcomer offers him the advantage of having no ties to
Florio's 1990 tax increase, which enraged voters and allowed
Republicans to capture control of the governor's mansion and both
houses of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For North Jersey power brokers, like Raymond J. Lesniak, the
Union County chairman; John A. Lynch, his counterpart in Middlesex;
and Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive, backing
Corzine is also a low-risk proposition. Even if Corzine loses, his
self-financed candidacy will at least relieve party leaders of the
burden of fund raising for the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party chairmen win no matter what,'' said one Democratic
official from North Jersey, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``If Corzine wins, great, they helped elect a senator.
If he doesn't, it's no big deal. They can still focus on raising
money for the governor's race, which is all they really care about
anyway.''

AFTER 2 YEARS IN DEPORTATION FIGHT, A HUNGER STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 35 days, Nabil Ahmed Farag Soliman, an inmate at a
federal detention center in Batavia, N.Y., has refused to eat and
has rebuffed medical help in an attempt to end his 2{ years of
captivity, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Soliman, who is awaiting possible deportation to Egypt at the
Buffalo Federal Detention Center, has been in the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service since July 1, 1997, charged
with violating immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a federal immigration judge prohibited the INS from
deporting him to Egypt, saying he could face torture if returned to
his home country. A month later, the immigration service appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Soliman and his advocates say he has joined the ranks of
hundreds of indefinite detainees, people the immigration service
will neither deport nor release. Some say his case, which began as
a problem of immigration status, has become an international debate
over his identity.
</P>
<P>
   What sets him apart, however, is his determination to win his
freedom. ``It's not that unusual for people to decide they don't
want to eat for some period of time, like a few days or maybe even
a week,'' said Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the eastern region of
the immigration service. ``But this one is a lot longer than
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities, acting on information from Egypt, say they
believe Soliman, 39, may be a terrorist sought in Egypt in
connection with the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Soliman says he is no terrorist, just a truck driver with a wife
and five children in Jersey City. He says he believes the
authorities have confused him with another man, Nabil Ahmed Farag
Rezk, with whom his only connection is nine consonants and six
vowels.
</P>
<P>
   There are many gray areas in Soliman's case, and the INS and the
Department of Justice say they cannot comment on the details of his
detention. Ambassador Soheir Zaki, the consul general of Egypt in
New York, said Soliman was wanted in Egypt in connection with
Sadat's assassination, but she said she did not know whether Egypt
had pursued his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   But some regard Soliman's story as a prime example of how the
federal authorities treat many Arabs, acting as though they are
terrorists, whether or not they have evidence. Kamal Nowash, the
legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,
has pored over 300 pages of documents about Soliman's case and said
he had concluded that the government had no substantial evidence
for charging him as a terrorist. ``There appears to be a stereotype
among the INS that if you're a conservative or a devout Muslim,
then you are a terrorist,'' Nowash said. ``I can't help wonder if
this has anything to do with why he's being detained, because I
can't see anything else in his records about charges against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Soliman's dispute with immigration officials go
back 19 years and thousands of miles, to 1981 in Cairo. In
telephone interviews from the detention center, where he is being
monitored in a special medical cell, Soliman said he was an
importer and exporter in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the assassination of Sadat, the Egyptian military
went to Soliman's home, he said, looking for a suspected
conspirator in the assassination plot. Soliman said he believed
they were looking for Rezk, whose criminal record, later provided
to immigration officials by the Egyptian government, indicated that
he was a fugitive. (Soliman provided 1989 documents to a reporter
that show he had no criminal record in Egypt.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the military's visit, Soliman said, he was in
Yemen. But learning of the search, he decided not to return to
Cairo. He said that in the context of brutal Egyptian crackdowns on
extremists after the assassination, he feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under emergency law, they would have tortured me and kept me
in jail, and I could not prove I was innocent,'' he said. ``They
keep people in jail for a long time for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   From Yemen, Soliman moved to Saudi Arabia, and then in 1988 to
the United States. In 1991, he divorced his Egyptian wife, married
an American citizen and moved to Jersey City, he said. But he
separated from his American wife, and in 1997 divorced her and
remarried his first wife, who had moved from Egypt to Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, he received a warrant for his arrest and was
ordered to appear in immigration court in Newark. ``I went to the
hearing,'' Soliman said. ``I didn't know they would end up holding
me for 2{ years.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Soliman had divorced his American wife, he said, his
petition for continued citizenship was rejected, and, according to
court documents, a federal judge ordered the immigration service to
deport him in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Soliman applied for political asylum, but his request was
rejected. Last October, however, a different immigration judge
barred the INS from deporting Soliman, saying he could face torture
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service has appealed the decision, Ms. Otten
said, but she declined to comment further. Richard L. Kenney, a
spokesman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review for the
Department of Justice, which will rule on the immigration service's
appeal, said the agency could not discuss pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Reinert is director of public relations for Vive, a
refugee service center in Buffalo that has tried to help Soliman.
He said he thought Soliman might be innocent. ``The way I read it,
they have the wrong man,'' he said. ``He's a devout man, and he's
dedicated to getting his freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service is monitoring Soliman's health, which he
said had declined rapidly. He said he had fainted several times and
was unable to walk. On Wednesday, the immigration service ordered
that he be force-fed, but he agreed instead to begin drinking water
and receiving fluids intravenously, in exchange for help with his
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Otten said his health had stabilized, but did not comment on
any agreement with Soliman.
</P>
<P>
   Soliman vows to continue his hunger strike until he is free, or
dead. ``I will never stop until I'm released,'' he said. ``I'm not
accepting being in prison for no crime. It's not against law. It's
against persecution.''

EDITORIAL: CLEMENCY AND UNJUST DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 31:
</P>
<P>
   During the past Christmas season, Gov. George Pataki of New York
granted clemency to four state prison inmates who were first-time,
nonviolent drug offenders serving long mandatory sentences under
the state's harsh drug laws, known as the Rockefeller laws.
Pataki's compassionate gesture is to be applauded, but his real
task is to push for reform of the misguided laws that created the
need for clemency in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All four inmates had been sentenced to either 15 or 20 years to
life, making their sentences longer than those typically imposed on
violent criminals. Three of the inmates were released last week,
and a fourth will be released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bartlett, one of the inmates, was a single mother of four
young children when she was convicted of selling 4 ounces of
cocaine to a police informant in 1984. It was her first brush with
the law. She refused to make a plea bargain, choosing instead to go
to trial. She was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Warren, another of the inmates, was sentenced in 1987 to 15
years to life for selling cocaine in a sting operation. It was her
first and only sale.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories are not unusual. Although the laws enacted under
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller were originally aimed at major drug
dealers, many of those who have received tough mandatory sentences
under them were small-time addicts, or girlfriends of addicts, with
no criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have contributed to a fivefold increase in the state
prison population since 1973. They give judges no discretion to fit
a sentence to the circumstances, requiring instead that offenders
be given long sentences even in cases involving a small amount of
narcotics. The annual cost of incarcerating an inmate is about
$32,000. That money could be better spent on treatment and
education that would give minor offenders a chance to become
productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has expressed concern about the severity of the laws. But
his weak reform proposal last year to allow a very limited number
of defendants to appeal their sentences was not a meaningful
change. Commuting a handful of patently unjust sentences is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the state Assembly and the Senate majority leader,
Joseph Bruno, have said they support giving judges more discretion
in sentencing. Pataki needs to take up the job of overhauling these
irrational drug laws that waste taxpayer money and destroy families
left behind.

EDITORIAL: A PEACE STRATEGY FOR CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Congo's civil war is a key link in the chain of interconnected
conflicts that are ravaging a vast swath of Africa from the Horn of
Africa to Namibia. No fewer than six countries and three rebel
factions have been drawn into Congo's struggle, which also includes
militias, proxies and profiteers more interested in diamonds and
copper than national liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians have been killed, and many more are dying
from disease and hunger. Nearly a million Congolese have been
displaced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now a small glimmer of hope has emerged from last week's
intensive, American-led focus on the conflict in the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of discussions that included all six heads of state
currently involved in the conflict, the Clinton administration
announced that it will back Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal
for a peacekeeping operation that would include about 5,000 troops
in support of 500 cease-fire monitors. No American troops would be
involved. The force would be made up mostly of Africans, paid for
by U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to cost $280 million for the current fiscal year,
and the United States would be asked to contribute roughly a
quarter of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to be wary of another potentially dangerous U.N.
peacekeeping operation in one of the world's most intractable war
zones. But this proposal reflects a growing consensus by the
combatants themselves that it is in their own interest to abide by
a peace agreement they signed last July. If an environment safe
enough for peacekeepers can be established, the plan deserves
support.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Congo is split roughly in two. The government
of Laurent Kabila, the erratic warlord who toppled the longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, controls the south and west. He
is backed by the armed forces of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of eastern Congo is controlled by three fractious rebel
groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda. These groups have minimal
popular support. Indeed, some of the worst fighting today is
occurring not between state armies and rebel forces, but between
indigenous ethnic militias and the rebel factions whom they regard
as occupying armies serving outside predators. Hit-and-run
ambushes, retaliatory massacres, scorched-earth raids on villages
and widespread rape are taking place in remote regions of eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord signed by all the key actors in Lusaka, Zambia,
last July, was intended to lead to an immediate cease-fire and a
``national dialogue'' among both armed and unarmed groups on the
country's future. All sides continue to violate the accord, but
large parts of Congo _ a country the size of the United States east
of the Mississippi _ are substantially at peace.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.N. force would not _ and should not _ interpose
itself between active combatants. Rather, it would provide security
in relatively stable zones, which would allow monitors to document
violations of the accord there. The aim is to reduce security fears
on all sides and build confidence that will enable the parties
themselves to expand peaceful areas and address the more
intractable issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is the problem of how to neutralize the ethnic
Hutu militias that found sanctuary in eastern Congo after
participating in Rwanda's genocide in 1994 and have since staged
murderous raids into Rwanda and Uganda. The Lusaka accord calls for
disarming these groups, but it still is not clear how this will be
accomplished. The proposed U.N. force will have a mandate to
protect its own troops and civilians, but not to coercively disarm
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia have shown the
disastrous potential of poorly conceived, ill-defined operations
that lack the military or financial means to do the job. But there
have been successful U.N. operations in Africa. The U.N. presided
over Namibia's transition to independence and monitored elections
that brought an end to a terrible war in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   If a modest commitment of African troops to shore up a shaky
cease-fire in Congo reinforces the political will of the contending
parties to move forward with their own peace agreement, something
positive may be achieved, not just for Congo but for all of Africa.

 &HT;    Late-game play the turning point
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<P>
   ATLANTA _ What could be more fitting than a Kurt Warner
touchdown pass in the closing minutes to win a Super Bowl for the
St. Louis Rams? After a year when Warner was named the NFL's Most
Valuable Player and terrorized defensive backs all over the league,
it was his 73-yard bomb to Isaac Bruce with 1:54 left that held up
as the key play in the Rams' victory against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, though, thanks to Tennessee's amazing comeback, it
was a play almost wiped out in the end by the heroics of Titans
quarterback Steve McNair. But the Rams held on, with linebacker
Mike Jones tackling Titans receiver Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line
as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' winning drive began at their own 27 after the Titans,
revived by the defense and a resurgent McNair, had just tied the
game at 16. Suddenly, Warner unloaded down the right sideline to
Bruce. With his eye on the ball, Bruce slowed down just a bit to
snare the ball from Titans cornerback Denard Walker, then took off
for the right corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The pass pushed Warner past the 400-yard mark for the night.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, it was beginning to look like the first Super Bowl
without a touchdown. The Rams were generating their usual amount of
offense, but failing to finish off the drives. You had to wonder
whether Dick Vermeil was going to suffer another case of burnout
before his team found the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they made it there in the third quarter, taking a 16-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Rams' 43, Warner spotted Bruce, who was
sitting down in the Tennessee zone between middle linebacker Barron
Wortham and safety Anthony Dorsett for a 31-yard pass to the
Tennessee 26.
</P>
<P>
   After the Titans were stunned emotionally by the neck injury
suffered by safety Blaine Bishop, the Rams, on a third and-9 from
the 9, scored on Warner's pass across the end zone to Torry Holt,
who beat Dainon Sidney, the former Riverdale High School player.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had thrown for 277 yards in the first half without a
touchdown. The touchdown pass, at that point, was Holt's seventh
reception of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, a botched field goal attempt in the first
quarter by the Rams had the potential for prominence. And the way
the Rams were wasting scoring opportunities, losing three points
was a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The play came just after a third-and-9 pass to Isaac Bruce from
Kurt Warner that appeared to be pass interference on Sidney. But
there was no flag, and Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins came on to try a
34-yard field goal with 9:40 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The snap was perfect, but holder Mike Horan, instead of getting
the ball spotted properly for Wilkins, put the ball down on its
side with the nose pointed toward the goal post. Seeing the
precarious situation, Wilkins rushed past the ball with his leg
cocked. Horan, trying to salvage something from the botched play,
took off to his left and was tackled by the Titans' Donald Mitchell
after a couple of yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had an opportunity to get on the board on the next
series, but also blew it. After Eddie George's 32-yard screen pass
put the Titans on the Rams' 31, Warner's offense bogged down. In
came Al Del Greco, the Tennessee kicker, who missed a 47-yard field
goal with 5:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the first half, a big playmaker from the first
Titans-Rams game appeared on the scene to demonstrate a rookie
mistake. Jevon Kearse, the defensive end who pushed Fred Miller to
six false start penalties in that meeting, got too aggressive on a
the Rams; second-and-14 play from the Tennessee 20. With Warner
dashing to his right, trying to turn the corner, Kearse chased him
down. Unfortunately, instead of just pulling down the St. Louis
quarterback by his shoulder pads -- which seemed easily enough
accomplished -- Kearse also grabbed Warner's facemask with his left
hand. The result was a flagrant penalty of 15 yards which gave the
Rams a first down at the Tennessee 10-yard line. On the next play,
Kenny Holmes sacked Warner. On third down, pressured by a blitz,
Warner threw out of the end zone, trying to hit Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the Rams' fifth field goal try of the half, Wilkins,
with another good placement from Horan, kicked the ball through
from 28 yards to increase the St. Louis lead to 9-0.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a fitting end for this St. Louis Rams team of
castoffs. The quarterback, Kurt Warner, at one point was bagging
groceries. The wide receiver, Isaac Bruce, was once labeled as
soft. The coach, Dick Vermeil, once left the game because he was
burned out. Then came a miraculous play that made them all Super
Bowl heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, with just 1 minute 54 seconds left in the game,
connected on a 73-yard deep pass, one that will surely go down as
one of the most spectacular in championship history, and it broke a
16-16 tie and made the Rams 23-16 winners over Tennessee in Super
Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, while out of football, Warner was at one
point asking people if they wanted paper or plastic, but he threw
for a Super Bowl record 414 yards on 24-of-45 passing. Bruce had a
great game and Vermeil won his first title.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rams' defense held off a furious comeback by Tennessee,
which had advanced to the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds
remaining. Quarterback Steve McNair was brilliant. But on the
Titans' final play, a pass from McNair to Kevin Dyson fell a yard
short when Rams linebacker Mike Jones made the tackle that
prevented a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The game received a serious scare when in the third quarter when
safety Blaine Bishop, leading with his head, was carted off the
field after trying to tackle 265-pound tight end Ernie Conwell.
Bishop's head snapped back ferociously, and he lay on the
artificial turf for almost 10 minutes, with both Titans and Rams
players, on the sidelines, holding hands and praying. Bishop
suffered no serious neck damage _ the preliminary diagnosis was a
sprained neck _ but Bishop had been knocked unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was immobilized as a precaution, his neck strapped down,
and he was taken to the locker room, and later to an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Titans Coach Jeff Fisher, sensing his team was becoming unnerved
by the injury, gathered his players around him, and told them that
while everyone's thoughts were with Bishop, there was still a game
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Before the injury the Rams had dominated offensively, moving the
ball up and down the field almost at will, but the offense usually
stalled once the team got inside the 20-yard line of Tennessee.
Warner was fantastic, throwing for almost 300 yards in the first
half alone, yet all the Rams could manage was three field goals and
a 9-0 lead midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Warner, on third and goal at the Tennessee 9,
threaded a perfectly thrown pass to Torry Holt, and the Rams took a
16-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's McNair, only the second black quarterback in
championship history, proved to be one of the more resilient
players this year. He showed it after the Rams' scoring drive, when
on one play the ensuing series, he scampered 23 yards to the St.
Louis two. It was the longest run by a quarterback in Super Bowl
history. Two plays later running back Eddie George scored from
one-yard out. The Titans missed the two-point try, but still had
hope when the score was cut from 16-6.
</P>
<P>
   McNair continued his hot streak. After Tennessee forced the Rams
to kick their first punt, McNair, often criticized for his lack of
passing skills, made several great throws on the following drive,
including a throwback pass to tight end Jackie Harris that went 21
yards to the St. Louis 3-yard line. George, breaking three tackles,
ran the ball in again from the 1, though replays showed his knee
was clearly down before getting into the end zone. The Rams could
have challenged the touchdown using instant replay, but did not.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown concluded a 13-play, 79-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who was outstanding in the first half, froze up in the
second half, as the Tennessee defense began to dominate, and McNair
did not waste his opportunities. He led the offense on a scoring
drive again, tying the game at 16 when kicker Al Del Greco
connected with a 44-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Bruce's spectacular play, and the unknown Rams went
down in history.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that both the Jaguars and the Titans were here.
Both teams took advantage of what was a remarkably topsy-turvy but
exciting season in which there were few dominant teams. The Rams
won just four games last season, but this season with a prolific
offense they were able to overwhelm opponents, especially on the
speedy artificial turf of their home stadium. The Titans used the
opposite approach, a bruising ground game led by George and a
quarterback in McNair who runs first and asks questions later.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and St. Louis epitomized this strange season,
overcoming several crucial obstacles. For the Rams, it was the loss
to a season-ending injury of their starting quarterback, Trent
Green, who was replaced by Warner; he turned into one of the better
single-season stories in league history. The Titans, after playing
in four home stadiums in four years, finally settled in Nashville.
They beat the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs on a
lateral pass on a kick return in the the final seconds and last
week traveled to Jacksonville and defeated the favored Jaguars,
beating them for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The week leading up to the game was bizarre. The normally
warm-weather host city turned chilly, with freezing rain and
subzero windchill altering practice schedules, shutting down roads
and leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were ready for the game to begin, and it did in
spectacular fashion, with a series of good plays on both sides of
the ball. Warner threw nice touch passes to his wide receivers, and
the Titans' defense, as it has done all season, gave up some key
yards but was stingy inside the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee blitz on third-and-long early in the game hurried
Warner, causing him to throw an incomplete pass. St. Louis lined up
for a 27-yard field-goal try with kicker Wilkins, who has tendon
damage in his left knee that will require surgery, and the holder
Mike Horan, at 39 one of the oldest players in Super Bowl history.
The combination of an old man and a kicker with a bum leg proved
disastrous, as Horan bobbled the snap and was tackled for a loss,
and the Titans escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The fumbled snap was an obvious case of nerves as players were
clearly rattled by the spectacle of the biggest game of the season.
When later in the first quarter the Titans tried a field goal, from
47 yards by Del Greco, it was wide left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis continued to put pressure on the Tennessee defense.
Wide receiver Bruce caught a 32-yard pass to begin the Rams' second
series, which was followed by Marshall Faulk's 17-yard catch. Again
the Rams stalled, but this time Wilkins connected from 27 yards on
the field- goal try.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, meanwhile, was miserable on offense and managed only
89 yards in the first half. McNair and the passing game never
really got on track, and in the first half he completed only one
pass to a wide receiver. George had some solid runs and several big
catches, but the Rams, sometimes crowding eight or nine men near
the line of scrimmage, were able to limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Wilkins missed another field-goal attempt in the
second quarter but later connected from 29 yards and then 28 yards
for a 9-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were playing marvelous defense, but it seemed only a
matter of time before the Rams broke out of their field-goal habit.
Tennessee defensive backs sometimes looked a half-step slower than
St. Louis wideouts, unable to keep up with their speed on
underneath crossing routes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had 159 yards of offense in the first quarter alone,
the third-most in Super Bowl history, and Warner had thrown for 277
yards passing in the first half, a halftime record second to
Washington's Doug Williams 306 in Super Bowl XXII. Warner also
threw a record 35 passes in the first half, which were more than
Tennessee's total plays, 24. Warner completed 19 passes, six to
Torry Holt for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was making great reads, precise throws, and was in the
kind of groove few players experience in the Super Bowl. Still,
after five trips inside the Titans' 20-yard line, the Rams had only
three field goals to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to break, it seemed. Something was going to break.
Soon.  &QL;

 &HT;    Emotion's still there, but he's a new Vermeil
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget about Kurt Warner's arm or Eddie George's legs.
There also was Tina Turner doing her wonderful thing before the
opening kickoff. Oh, and halftime wasn't shabby either. Just Toni
Braxton, every Disney character known to fantasy and a full
symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, what everybody wanted to know Sunday inside the Georgia
Dome was when the breakdown would come and how long it would last.
You know, the first time. Then the second. Then all of the others,
right through the end of Super Bowl, when Rams coach Dick Vermeil
surely would cry himself a river deeper than the nearby
Chattahoochee.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen in the first quarter, when the Rams' Mike Horan
fumbled a hold on a field-goal attempt of 35 yards. Vermeil simply
chewed his gum a little faster. He also stayed composed after Jeff
Wilkins missed a 34-yarder in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Vermeil didn't lose his mind during the entire
first half after the Rams outgained the Titans 294 yards to 89
yards and managed only three field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil just waited and chewed and hoped that the Rams
eventually would help a 63-year-old coach place an exclamation
point on a miracle. They did just that, but only after Vermeil
spent the second half trying to keep his eyes from popping out of
his head.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rams watched their 16-0 lead become a 16-16 tie in the
fourth quarter, Warner found Isaac Bruce for a 73-yard touchdown
pass that caused the ultimate breakdown for Vermeil. He was that
much closer to a world championship. It didn't come official until
Rams linebacker Mike Jones stopped Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson
from scoring at the 1-yard line on a frantic pass from Steve McNair
with no time left, and then the Chattahoochee had its rival on the
Rams' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The man cried and cried. And he deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   Long before this one, Vermeil already had perfected the
impossible. Twice, in fact, starting with his Rams burying their
Lambs heritage for the first time in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   They reached the Super Bowl. They really did, but there was
something more incredulous than that for the Rams. Along the way to
a rare burst of glory, Vermeil modified his coaching style by
switching from emotional maniac to emotional maniac with an
asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Rams linebacker Mike Jones approached Vermeil
about having the team work inside their indoor practice facility on
a frigid day in St. Louis. The new Vermeil agreed. After all, the
old Vermeil didn't work during his opening two seasons with the
Rams that produced a total of nine victories. The old Vermeil was
this control freak who believed the head coach was everything, his
assistants were necessary evils and his players were robots that
needed the head coach to tell them when to breath.
</P>
<P>
   The old, old Vermeil was worse than that. Before joining the
Rams three seasons ago after a 14-year break from coaching, he
spent much of his tenure with the Eagles spending the night in his
office during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When he wasn't doing
that, he was driving his assistants and players absolutely nuts
with obsession with trying to control the world.
</P>
<P>
   So this is a new Vermeil, but only to a point. After Jones got
Vermeil's approval to practice inside that day, he went for the
jugular. He tried to get Vermeil to cancel practice.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, because some things never change. Like
Vermeil, for instance. He's became only a modified version of his
old, old self, and that almost was Super.

DENNIS SEVERS, WHO LODGED   LONDON'S GHOSTS, DIES AT 51
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: England, Calif., Ariz., Hawaii)  (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Severs, an American whose youthful passion for
storytelling led him to London, where he turned a five-story
18th-century house into a musty, magical time machine for paying
visitors, died of cancer on Dec. 27. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which existed in space at 18 Folgate Street in the
part of East London where Jack the Ripper prowled, occupied a time
somewhere in the past. It was best viewed as the fabulous fantasy
of a nimble imagination. To be sure, it was also Severs' home, one
that by intention lacked modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, who paid $50 each for evening tours in groups of
eight, were treated to surreal trips through the nearly 200-year
history of a made-up family, minutely orchestrated by Severs. The
visitors could smell scones warming on the fire and hear the
clip-clop of horses outside. All too suddenly, it would dawn on
them that the contents of the chamber pots were real.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, they were immersed in rooms that resembled
Hogarth paintings, Dickens stage sets and three-dimensional Beatrix
Potter drawings. All were arranged to appear as though somebody had
just left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bombard your senses,'' Severs said in an
interview in 1995. ``I will get the 20th century out of your eyes,
ears and everything. With every age we visit, we'll be governed by
a spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical accuracy was no more important to his presentation
than it would be in a lowbrow historical novel. The feeling of
being in a different century was what mattered to him. ``If you
want to learn, read a book!'' Severs often shouted, usually as he
physically threw out a paying customer, along with his admission
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Severs was an English eccentric by choice, not by birth. He grew
up with palm trees and sunshine in Escondido, Calif. But his heart
was captured early by the ghost towns where his father took him. If
he came across something unusual like a bottle of ink spilled over
an Oriental carpet, he would invent a story to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   He was a son of Earl and Helen Severs, who between them had four
older sons. Two brothers survive, Lee, of Honolulu, and Duane, of
Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In an unpublished guide to his house called ``The Space
Between,'' Severs recalled that as a dreamy and artistic child, he
was regarded at various schools he attended as ``exceptional'' or
``mentally retarded,'' but seldom in between.
</P>
<P>
   California could not satisfy him. ``I wanted a house with
ghosts,'' he said in 1991. ``But I'd look out the window and all
I'd see were swimming pools.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he described how the answer materialized. ``Down
deep, I always believed that one day I would travel past picture
frames and into the glow of a warmer, more mellow and more romantic
light,'' Severs wrote. ``There was one light in particular, one
that I saw in old varnish and paint, and that appealed to me as my
ideal. By the age of 11, it was identified as English.''
</P>
<P>
   He began building Tudor playhouses and saved money from his
newspaper route to make his first visit to London in 1965. He moved
there two years later, after graduating from high school. Severs
began collecting antiques, not as objects, but as ``signposts to
the thinking and feelings of other times.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing that English law might offer suitably quaint
employment, he set out to train as a barrister in the Dickensian
chambers of Lincoln's Inn, supporting himself on income from a
California service station that he had inherited. He gave up law
school when he learned that the gasoline station would not cover
his bills.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to supplement his income by conducting horse-drawn
tours through the back streets of West London. He acquired carriage
and horse and found stable and lodgings in a mews on Gloucester
Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere of these backwaters _ along with the clip-clop
of the horse _ worked as a time machine,'' he wrote, ``and I was
soon beginning to speak in the `dramatic present,' as if things in
the past were happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '70s, a developer had bought the stable, and Severs
and his horse were evicted. According to The Daily Telegraph, the
queen responded to the publicity and offered Severs a stable in the
Royal Mews. For several months, he accepted the offer and then
moved on to other things.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he found his 1724 house in Spitalfields, not far from
the Tower of London, and paid $42,000 for it. His intent was not to
restore the building, but to ``bring it back to life.'' He began by
sleeping in each of the 10 rooms, to ``arouse my intuition in the
quest for each room's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He then had a vision, that ``the material things I had been
collecting all my life were really a cast of characters, and the
house was destined to be their stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Social historian Ralph Samuel agreed, calling the house ``a
magical mystery tour which dazzles the visitor with a succession of
scenes more crowded with memorable incident than the mere facsimile
of what passes for a period room.'' Curators of historical sites,
including Kensington Palace and Williamsburg, Va., consulted with
Severs on his methods.
</P>
<P>
   Severs refrained from wearing period costumes. He called himself
a child of the 1960s and favored blue jeans rather than blazers. He
never picked up much of an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Pettet, a noted designer and potter, lived with Severs in
the house from 1983 until he died of AIDS in 1994. Before Severs
died, he sold the house to the Spitalfields Trust, a historical
preservation group, which hopes to continue the show, using
extensive tape recordings that Severs made.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult, given the highly personalized presentation
of the chunky, balding, gap-toothed and, yes, eccentric man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either get it or you don't,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: REWRITING THE REAGAN GOSPEL ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Republicans always cheer lustily when Gov.
George W. Bush declares that his presidential campaign represents
``the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.'' But if the
volatile GOP contest in New Hampshire reflects anything about eras,
it is the end of the one ushered in by Ronald Reagan, not Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That much is obvious when you hear and watch Bush and Sen. John
McCain racing frantically across this freezing state in a bid to
become the party's first standard-bearer from the post-World War II
generation. ``In 1992, the baby boomers took over the Democratic
Party,'' Bush said in a conversation on his bus the other day.
``Now it's our party's turn. We're about to find out what our
generation's made of.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is emerging in New Hampshire is more than a
generational shift in Republican leadership. Even more interesting
is the unacknowledged but pronounced move away from tax-cutting as
an all-consuming party ideology. Bush and McCain are revising the
core Reaganite doctrine of tax cuts first, last and always as the
best way to control government and get votes.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the Arizona senator represents the most radical
departure from past Republican campaigns. When he criticizes Bush's
tax cut as a threat to Social Security and Medicare, he sounds more
like Tip O'Neill than Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, while trying to club the senator with the tax-cut
issue, just as often emphasizes what he calls ``pro-active
government'' in education, health and reaching out to the poor. He
acknowledged in conversation that this line is different from the
one taken by Reagan and even the old ``thousand points of light''
emphasis on voluntarism alone put forward by his father.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the feel of the campaigns, the Bush crowds here are
sedate, curious and respectful, whereas the McCain people are
boisterous, sometimes contentious and perhaps a little scruffier.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain bus is on a Mr. Toad-like wild ride with rollicking
nonstop conversations and swapping of jokes, one-liners and
locker-room razzing with reporters and aides. Bush also loves to
banter about sports or politics, though he keeps reporters more at
bay. But both candidates come across as tightly wound men whose
egos would not adapt easily to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain rejects the idea that his opposition to Reagan-style tax
cutting is left-wing, as Bush has begun to charge. ``The dynamics
of American politics have changed,'' he said on his bus. ``I will
be the first Republican president since Eisenhower with big budget
surpluses. It's conservative to use those surpluses for Social
Security, Medicare and paying down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   He says polls show that most Republicans agree, and he has made
shoring up the retirement systems long term central to his appeal
for younger voters. But as the conservative Weekly Standard noted
recently, if he wins, Republicans will have to throw out two
decades of campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts championed by Bush are certainly an echo of the
Reagan era. But Bush gives equal emphasis in speeches to his call
for government to mobilize the ``armies of compassion'' to help
children and society's dropouts. True, his ideas are not coherently
explained in his speeches, but in tone they are a far cry from what
one has heard from Republican leaders these past years.
</P>
<P>
   In his freewheeling conversation, Bush insisted that tax cuts
are ``the issue du jour right now _ that's how I'm going to win in
New Hampshire.'' Indeed, McCain's admission in the last New
Hampshire debate that his own tax-cut plan was similar in magnitude
to President Clinton's has given Bush an opening that he has worked
hard to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor also insisted that once the general election
gets under way, he plans to shift gears and make clear that his
approach is a combination of tax incentives and government spending
to help the disadvantaged involving a much more aggressive role for
government than what Republican leaders in Congress may be
comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides deride this ``compassionate conservatism'' as a
sop to the guilty feelings of wealthy Bush donors. But that glosses
over the ideological revisionism inherent in both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton redefined liberal orthodoxy by calling for
balanced budgets and welfare reform, Bush and McCain are defining a
Republican third way that blends support for focused tax cuts with
a new emphasis on Social Security, health care and other
traditional Democratic issues.

 &HT;    We won't forget ending any time soon
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It only took 34 tries, but the NFL managed to stage a
Super Bowl that outdid its hype. Now, this isn't to say that Super
XXXIV was a full-blown classic _ unless you like batted passes and
bad field-goal kicking and defenses that line up offside, it wasn't
_ but the game was infinitely better than its buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl week featured freezing rain and zero name
recognition. The participants flew here having only just arrived in
their respective base cities, which is great for the
tradition-hungry among us. The Rams were in Anaheim as late as
1995, and as late as 1997 the Titans were based in Memphis and
known, curiously, as the Oilers. Now they were playing in the
planet's most-watched spectacle, which had half the planet asking:
Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Figure more than a few million earthlings leaned forward in
their seats at roughly 9:30 p.m. EST Sunday, which is when the
Titans from somewhere tied the Rams from California inside the
game's final three minutes. Know how many Super Bowls have been
tied with two minutes to play? Exactly two. This would have been
the third, except that Isaac Bruce ran through the Titans secondary
and scored before the refs could signal the two-minute warning.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, not many of us earthlings will recall that the
first 50 minutes of Super XXXIV were fairly tedious, just as nobody
but us Atlantans will remember that the week of the game was
utterly horrid: Freezing temperatures for the Titans' Wednesday
press conference; freezing rain on Saturday, a frigid reception for
the qualifiers. But maybe this is how the NFL should do it every
year: Give us two faceless teams, scratch the extra week between
the conference championships and just let the game happen.
</P>
<P>
   This game happened as strangely as any in Super Bowl annals. The
inflatable Vince Lombardi Trophy deflated during pregame
introductions. The Rams operated as if under orders from on high to
keep the game cosmetically close. The Titans looked to be the first
option team to play for a championship since Nebraska. It was 16-0
halfway through the third quarter, at which point you thought,
``Eh, just another crummy Super Bowl,'' at which point the darndest
thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans powered their way back by virtue of power. Their
first touchdown, with 14 seconds left in the third period, was no
cause for great notice. A two-point conversion failed, leaving them
still 10 points down, and how would this plodding team ever score
twice in the span of a quarter? Why, by plodding still more.
</P>
<P>
   If this wasn't the best-ever Super Bowl, it was for sure the
best-ever last five minutes. Tennessee moved to the tying field
goal not by throwing to its wide receivers but by having one
wideout, Isaac Byrd, recover Jackie Harris' fumble. Tied with 2:12
to go, and suddenly nobody out there in TV land was worrying about
the quality of the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rams did in one play what they hadn't been able to do
all game -- throw long. Bruce flashed past Denard Walker to gather
in Kurt Warner's pass. Now the Titans were well and truly finished,
right? Not quite. A stunning drive ended one yard short. And a
forgettable week ended with a flurry not of wintry precipitation
but of something bordering on glory.

RACIAL TENSION OVER OFFICER'S SHOOTING GROWS IN R.I. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI AND ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Three days after a black off-duty police officer
was shot and killed by fellow officers who mistook him for an armed
suspect, Providence's grief Sunday was mixed with a mounting
tension over race.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the black community said their phones had been
ringing from early morning until late at night, with callers
wanting to vent their anger over the shooting of 29-year-old Cornel
Young Jr., who was attempting to assist fellow officers when he was
killed. Meanwhile, Mayor Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci took to the
airwaves to urge citizens not to view Young's shooting as an
example of racism.
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming feeling in Providence Sunday was that a
groundswell of anger is being held back _ at least until after
Young is buried on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking everybody in the community to relax,'' said the
Rev. Marlowe V. N. Washington, pastor of Allen AME Church, during a
service in which congregants interlocked their hands and surrounded
Young's father and grandmother in a ring of embrace. ``We're going
to get the answer. God is going to provide the answer for us in
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Young _ the son of Major Cornel Young Sr., the highest-ranking
black officer in the department's history _ was shot early Friday
morning at a restaurant that is popular among off-duty police
officers. Overhearing a fight in the parking lot, Young told the
restaurant's patrons to get down and went into the parking lot,
where 30-year-old Aldrin Diaz was allegedly waving a gun. Young had
drawn his gun, and several witnesses said they heard him identify
himself as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   But officers responding to a 911 call _ Carlos Saraiva and
Michael Solitro III, sources close to the case said _ did not
recognize Young as a fellow officer and shot him in the chest,
head, and stomach. Diaz is being held on a charge of felony murder,
on the theory that he initiated the events that resulted in Young's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Providence police would not comment on the race of Saraiva or
Solitro Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's girlfriend, 27-year-old Christa Calder, was charged
Saturday with possession of an illegal firearm and held at the
Adult Correctional Institution on $10,000 cash bail, according to
department spokesman Major Martin Hames. Calder will be arraigned
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Washington, D.C., meeting of the US Conference
of Mayors, Cianci urged citizens to view the shooting as a tragedy
for the entire city, rather than an act of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is this was an adrenaline-charged atmosphere where
a split-second decision was made. This was a case of mistaken
identity,'' Cianci said after meeting Sunday with ministers,
members of Young's family, and Cliff Monteiro, director of the
Providence NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when it's all done, it was a gun _ a weapon was
pointed at two police officers who didn't know a fellow officer was
pointing it. Let's not make this anything more than it is,'' Cianci
said. ``Let's not make it divide our community.''
</P>
<P>
   But within the minority community, some leaders said Cianci's
quick assurances would only infuriate blacks who believe that race
was a factor in the shooting. Balbina Young said that never in her
11 years on the City Council has she felt such a wave of dispair
over race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my community are saying that Cornel Young Jr. was
assassinated, that he was murdered,'' said Young, who represents
Ward 11, which is 70 percent black and Latino. ``They believe had
he been a white officer he would not have been killed. It's not
that they feel it, they know it as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Aponte, who represents Ward 10, said the response to
Cianci's comments about the shooting ``range from being offended to
being in disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test'' for Cianci, Aponte said. ``This situation is
going to draw lines. It will place people on one side or on the
other, and people are curious to see what side he'll be on.''
</P>
<P>
   With citizens turning to local organzations for guidance on how
to respond to Young's shooting, community leaders made it clear
that the matter is as much of a balancing act for them as it is for
Cianci. Monteiro, head of Providence's NAACP, said although Cianci
made his own judgment about the incident based on information from
the police, the NAACP would not be able to determine whether racism
was an element in the shooting until Attorney General Sheldon
Whitehouse's office weighs in on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro said the tension probably would not ease any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting phone calls at 10 o'clock at night, at 7 in the
morning,'' he said. ``I'm trying to calm people down and make sure
they don't do anything foolish . . . I would be adding fuel to the
fire if I shared with you the calls I'm getting.''
</P>
<P>
   But even at the Allen AME Church service, where ministers urged
patience, there was no way to separate the anger from the grief.
During Sunday's service, Washington urged parishioners to have
faith that ``the truth will set us free.'' But he also encouraged
them to sign a petition expressing ``sorrow at the murder of Cornel
Young Jr.'' A group called Direct Action for Rights and Equality is
circulating the petition.

 &HT;    Rams defense beaten, but not before a good fight
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The St. Louis defensive unit came to Atlanta as a
group of nobodys with somebody ambitions. It left this morning just
as obscure _ and even more thankful for the popular and explosive
offense. And for linebacker Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After a first half in which it solved the powerful duo of
quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George, the Rams'
defense got pounded. Staked to a 16-0 lead with 7:20 left in the
third quarter, Tennessee treated the Rams' defense like patsies,
running over, around and through it to shift the flow of the game
to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and George wore down the Rams' defense and scored 16
unanswered points to draw even a few minutes to play. The goat
label was all prepared to be the underpublicized defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was granted a reprieve when quarterback Kurt Warner hit Isaac
Bruce with a 77-yard touchdown for a 23-16 lead on the first play
after Tennessee tied the game. So, it came down to the defense that
was heroic in the first half and dominated in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans started the final drive on the 12-yard line, with one
time-out and 1:05 left in regulation. McNair got things started by
getting a first down on two plays and then earning a first down
plus 15 yards on a facemask penalty at the end of a 12-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense was beaten, exhausted. McNair and George were
far more fresh, and Tennessee continued to move the ball. On
third-and-5 from the St. Louis 27, McNair showed his determination
by avoiding a sack by Pro Bowler Kevin Carter, regaining his
footing and hitting Kevin Dyson for a 17-yard gain to the Rams' 10.
</P>
<P>
   Only six seconds remained. After the Titans' last time-out, the
Rams' defense honed in for one last play. A stop would grant the
team the championship and make all their failures of the second
half moot. A touchdown for Tennessee would tie the game _ and
further destroy the defensive unit's dwindling confidence for
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   McNair dropped back and fired to Dyson on a slant pattern. He
caught it at the 5 and headed for the end zone. Jones, an
eight-year linebacker from Missouri, clutched Dyson's legs and did
not let go. Dyson fell at the 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were champions, and the defense was relieved of the
burden of scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   It ended the season as the best in the NFL against the run, but
was hardly given much credit for the team's sudden success. The
size of the defense was questioned, as well as its strength. Those
shortcomings were hardly evident in the first half, when Tennessee
could not mount much of an attack against a hustling, fresh Rams
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams nullified George in the first half with a swarming,
gang-tackling scheme. He had just 18 yards on seven carries. Just
as significant was the way St. Louis limited McNair to just two
rushes for 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear then that the St. Louis defense was gaining
confidence in its ability to defend the Titans. On their last
possession of the half, Tennessee did not move the ball an inch.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after halftime. George and the offensive line got
stronger, wore down the Rams' defense and pushed it on the brink of
being the major factor in another improbable Tennessee postseason
success.'
</P>
<P>
   But on the last play of the game, a guy with a common name _
Mike Jones _ made a play that saved the game and face for the
defense. The unit will remain obscure. But at least it'll be
champions.

 &HT;    Rams' victory fulfills feel-good Warner story
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world's most renowned stock clerk has reached the
very top shelf. Kurt Warner completed his remarkable
up-from-the-produce-aisle story at the Georgia Dome on Sunday,
taking with him the rest of the itinerant Rams and the city that
took them in.
</P>
<P>
   This 34th Super Bowl served the purpose of giving St. Louis its
first NFL title. An almost higher calling of this game was to
provide the happily-ever-after to the Warner tale, one that had
wandered through so many levels of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the point total _ 23-16 Rams over Tennessee _ was
somewhat modest, Warner's numbers weren't. He was the inspiration
behind a fantastic Super Bowl game, with a last-quarter assist from
a veteran Ram sufferer, receiver Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw for a Super Bowl record 414 yards, and he needed
every one of them. On the other side, the Music City Miracles were
just a yard short of taking this one into overtime. Had Tennessee
receiver Kevin Dyson been able to shake St. Louis linebacker Mike
Jones, had Dyson's reach been just a little more as time expired,
we might still be in the Georgia Dome. And no one would complain,
this game having evolved into one you didn't want to see end.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams won because, for as much as the Titans controlled the
ball in the second half, they couldn't keep it away from Warner
forever. He watched on the sidelines as Tennessee rallied from a
16-0 deficit to tie the game. But the tie lasted only as long as it
took Warner to wind up for one more marvelous heave. He threw it
long down the sideline and let Bruce shake Titans cornerback Denard
Walker for a 73-yard connection that won the night.
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw often and everywhere. His first six receptions
found six different sets of hands, including a reluctant tackle,
Fred Miller, who had gathered in a tipped ball.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Warner was done distributing the ball, surely every
Ram receiver had at least one catch. And not just the present-day
batch. So many balls in the air, certainly Elroy Hirsch, Jack Snow,
Harold Jackson, Henry Ellard and Tom Fears all must have
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis victory was wrapped around a subplot of
frustration. This victory could have been so much more definitive.
It could have marked the Rams offense as one of the most dangerous
to ever take the Super stage, if not for its curious aversion to
the endzone. The practice that the Rams missed Saturday because of
ice must have been the one where they were to install all the red
zone plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams would have been fine all along, if they were paying by
the mile. By the end of the first quarter, their offense had
amassed 159 yards, the third best opening output in the 34 Super
Bowls. And another 125 before the end of the half. Warner's 35
first-half pass attempts was a Super Bowl record, and his 277
passing yards wasn't far from one. And only nine points to show for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Five St. Louis possessions in that first half. Each one enjoyed
a first down inside the Tennessee 18-yard line. But none of them
led to touchdowns. Just the kind of inefficiency that should put a
company out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no mere cold corporation. Tennessee had tried on
the title of ``team of destiny.'' But, of course, St. Louis had the
ultimate answer to that sort of talk _ Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had to win this one, because the quarterback's story
had to run its inevitable course.

JOHN GAHERIN, NEGOTIATOR   FOR NEWSPAPERS AND BASEBALL, DIES AT 85
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mass., N.Y., Pa., Minn., Conn., Colo., Mass., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John J. Gaherin, a negotiator who represented New York newspaper
publishers and the owners of Major League Baseball in the 1960s and
'70s and helped write baseball's first labor contracts and pension
plan, died Jan. 24 at Cape Cod Hospital Extended Care in Hyannis,
Mass. He was 85 and lived in Cotuit, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease, his wife, Rita, said.
</P>
<P>
   In a labor relations career that spanned the last half century,
Gaherin also represented railroads, airlines and other industries
and was a private arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   He was president and chief negotiator of the New York Newspaper
Publishers Association from 1964 to 1967, representing seven
newspapers against 10 unions in a turbulent era of strikes,
slowdowns and battles over wages and labor-saving automation that
saw the demise of three of the city's daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   And he was chief negotiator for organized baseball from 1967 to
1978, when the rights of owners and players were changing
significantly. He and Marvin J. Miller, executive director of the
players association, negotiated Major League Baseball's first basic
labor contract in 1968, providing for minimum salaries, and a year
later negotiated baseball's first pension plan for players.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Gaherin was involved in talks over baseball's reserve
clause, which kept players tied to one team unless they were traded
or sold. But after club owners rejected his proposal to negotiate,
an arbitrator threw out the reserve clause, giving rise to free
agency, which has enabled star players to negotiate
multimillion-dollar contracts with the highest-bidding clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues recalled Gaherin as a tireless and astute
negotiator, with a firm grasp of complex issues, a repertoire of
jokes to break tensions and a calm demeanor in a crisis. Because he
spoke for large groups with diverse interests _ 11 or more
railroads, seven newspapers and 20 or more baseball club owners _
he often had to devote as much time to seeking consensus among
management as he did to bargaining with unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the management people I dealt with in baseball, he
clearly was the most knowledgeable and skilled,'' Miller said of
Gaherin. ``He had the most integrity. In addition, he had a
wonderful sense of humor. He had a seemingly endless store of funny
stories, and he told them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaherin was born in New York City on Nov. 24, 1914. He attended
Pratt Institute but did not earn a degree. As a young man, he
worked on railroads as a clerk, assistant station master and
patrolman. By 1949, he was assistant personnel manager on the Long
Island Rail Road, and by 1954, he was the line's personnel manager.
Three years later, he was director of labor relations for the New
Haven Railroad. He later negotiated contracts for the Eastern
Carriers Conference, a group of 11 Eastern railroads.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure with the publishers association, there were
strikes, including a 25-day walkout at The New York Times in 1965,
and a 140-day shutdown of the fledgling World Journal Tribune _ an
amalgam of The Herald Tribune, The Journal-American and The
World-Telegram &AMP; The Sun _ which itself died in 1967. Wages rose,
but there were no breakthroughs on automation.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years with organized baseball, Gaherin represented
airlines and other industries, and in recent years was a private
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; one son, John Jr., of San Diego; six
daughters, Pamela Watson of Gladwyne, Pa., Stephanie Keane of
Edina, Minn., Pegeen Gaherin of Westport, Conn., Maryann Murphy of
Fairfield, Conn., Tara Gaherin of Aurora, Colo., and Seana Gaherin
of Sandwich, Mass.; and seven grandchildren.

 &HT;    Forget drab and boring; this one's for the ages
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scratch one old Super Bowl tradition, one not to be
lamented. Score one for the Warner, for a guy named Jones, and the
St. Louis Rams, new champions of the professional football world.
The Super Bowl had engraved itself on the hearts and minds of
Americans as an antidote for insomnia. It seemed that the
combatants usually left their game on the battlefields of the
playoffs. They performed as if sleepwalking. The games were
thrill-less.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. The Rams and the Tennessee Titans brought the
thrill back to the Super Bowl at the Georgia Dome. It couldn't get
any closer than this one got. The score was 23-16, but don't
believe it. It was this close:
</P>
<P>
   In the last desperate moments, as the seconds ticked down to
double zero, Kevin Dyson, a crafty wide receiver from Utah, caught
Steve McNair's 36th pass of the night, struggled futilely to reach
the end zone, and in the final scene, while he flailed like a
drowning man, Mike Jones, a ninth-year Ram linebacker, had him in a
death grip. It was a fierce wrestle of two men with the verdict in
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The play had started on the Rams' 10-yard line, last play of the
game. McNair caught Dyson crossing toward the end zone. Dyson and
Jones and ball came together and went down in one huge human
bundle, and as he hit the turf, Dyson desperately reached for the
goal line with the ball in hand, but came up short.
</P>
<P>
   It was over. As suddenly as a crash. For a split second, the
panting thousands held their breath until it was apparent that
Dyson hadn't made it, that the Rams were champions of the National
Football league. Then the smoke-filled dome exploded, Rams in glee,
Titans in groaning misery. One yard from a touchdown, and one more
chance in overtime. Georgia had come to Georgia and Mrs. Frontiere
would go home with a championship trophy, a kind the Rams hadn't
owned since the days of Norm Van Brocklin when the Rams were in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a finish like never before seen in a Super Bowl. Drab and
boring are out. Thrill and suspense are in. It was surely the most
exciting one ever seen by these old eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had run roughshod over the Titans between the 20-yard
lines in the first half, but once inside what is known as the ``red
zone,'' they choked down. They squandered yards by the gross and
settled for field goals. The half was played without a touchdown
for the first time since San Francisco beat Cincinnati in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Once they finally got a touchdown on the board, an(alpha) ran
the score to 16-0, they were looking like a lock. Then came the
resurrection of Steve McNair, and if Jeff Fisher made one damning
mistake, it was going for a two-point conversion after the Titans'
first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   As the balloting came out for the outstanding player, the final
crowning chapter in the fairy tale of Kurt Warner was written. The
yardage, the completions, the touchdowns are submitted as evidence
here, but let's say that if there had been a co-MVP, it would be
Isaac Bruce. He topped, reached back, pulled in Warner's
under-thrown bomb, then ran it in for the deciding touchdown, as it
came out. It brought back to life a team that was dying.

PAY HIKE AHEAD FOR FISHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jeff Fisher is on his way to becoming one of the
highest-paid coaches in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the Titans owner Bud Adams and the
representative for Fisher began several days ago in an attempt to
reach a new contractual agreement. Fisher has one year remaining on
his deal.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are believed to have been beneficial in that Adams
made it clear how much he values Fisher and that he is willing to
pay top dollar for his services. It is likely that Fisher and Adams
will reach an agreement for a long-term deal in the weeks after
Super Bowl XXXIV, which the Titans lost to the Rams, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   There are some minor sticking points, however, according to
several league officials. Last year Adams told Fisher that if the
team did not at least get to the playoffs this season, that Fisher
might lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   Adams also then wanted some changes, including the dismissal of
at least one member of Fisher's coaching staff. Fisher stood up to
Adams and the coach kept his job. Adams, the league officials said,
is again balking at paying that coach, and Fisher is again
defending him.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the assistant coaches and Adams is a
tenuous one. Adams is considered by some of them to be extremely
difficult to work for and is notorious for not paying them well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Adams will likely pry open his wallet for Fisher. It is
believed the two will eventually agree on a multiyear extension
worth at least $2 million a season. Fisher makes around $800,000 a
year now.
</P>
<P>
   If Fisher gets $2 million a year, he would be among the top five
highest-paid coaches in the league, and maybe in the top three if
coaches with the additional title of general manager are not
included. Before retiring from his coaching duties, the Jets' Bill
Parcells made about $2.5 million a year in his dual capacity as
coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is valuable to the Tennessee franchise not only because
of his coaching skills, but also because he is cherished by the
players and highly respected by almost everyone in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would agree that if it was not for Jeff's
coolness under pressure,'' running back Eddie George said, ``we
would have never made it to the Super Bowl.'' _ MIKE FREEMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THESE TITANS AREN'T NEW YORK'S &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Jets' fans. These Tennessee Titans are not named for the
once-upon-New York Titans. Those Titans were an original American
Football League team, most of which left an unusual legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that the Titans (nee Oilers) were
the last of the original eight A.F.L. teams finally to get to a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But while that is strictly true, the fact is that four of those
original eight cities never got to see their team in the Super Bowl
_ by the time the teams made it to the championship, they were
playing in another city. And most had changed their names.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, of course, originally were the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets started life as the Titans, before changing their name
after being rescued from bankruptcy court. But at least they stayed
put before capturing Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers started life in Los Angeles before moving south to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs originally were the Dallas Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots first played in Boston before winding
up in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, only the Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, Buffalo
Bills (who moved to the suburbs) and the Jets rewarded their
original fans with a chance to see them in the ultimate game. _

   THE VERMEIL REGIMEN
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, Dick Vermeil's Eagles got to a Super Bowl
against the Raiders, and the Eagles were uptight against a team
that used to come late to its own meetings and never heard of
curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermeil of that era dressed all his coaches in warm-up suits
for the flight to New Orleans _ so they could feel athletic and
have a sense of urgency about what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   And Vermeil also wanted his coaches to jog between assignments
during the week, much like the plebes at West Point have to
double-time-it everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in a jogging suit and actually jogging was the
septuagenarian quarterback guru Sid Gillman. He was one of the most
innovative minds in the history of the passing game, and Vermeil
had brought him in as a coach for Ron Jaworski.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter interviewing Gillman had to jog along with him as he
ran from one place to another before a practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy,'' Gillman said, speaking of Vermeil, ``will kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Vermeil was also tough on his players, who were
drilling twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, Vermeil _ while hardly lax _ has put his
players through more normal routines. And none of his coaches (at
least publicly) has complained about the hours or the sweat. _

</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Bill Bradley were in New
Hampshire Sunday campaigning for the Democratic nomination for
president just two days before the primary here. But their hearts,
and perhaps their minds, were in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV paired teams hailing from the candidates' home
states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is from Carthage, Tenn., and Bradley was born and raised in
Crystal City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign had a Super Bowl party Sunday evening in
Manchester, billing it as an opportunity for Bradley to cheer for
``his hometown St. Louis Rams.'' But hometown team may be a
stretch; the Rams moved to St. Louis from Los Angeles five years
ago, after nearly 50 years in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Missouri,'' Bradley said Sunday morning on the ABC
program ``This Week.'' ``I grew up 35 miles south of St. Louis and
so I'm pulling for the Rams.''

   Gore and his staff watched the game with other Tennessee Titans
fans at a restaurant in Nashua. Gore's team is also new to his
state _ moving to Tennessee from Houston for the 1997 season. Marla
Romash, a spokewoman for Gore, said that he is a big fan of the
team, and cheered strongly for Tennessee. He has attended at least
one Titan game this season, Romash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been fighting hard for the voters of
New Hampshire, and he'll be using some of that energy to cheer on
the Tennessee Titans,'' Romash said. ``And then he'll go back to
fighting for New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is also campaigning in New Hampshire,
attended a Super Bowl party in Portsmouth. When asked who he
thought would win the game, Bush said, ``the Houston Oilers.'' The
Oilers moved to Tennessee and became the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, another candidate combining the game and
politicking with a party in Amherst, said that he was ``uninformed,
but partial to St. Louis.'' -- JOHN FILES &QL;

LIKE THE GAME, ABC'S PERFORMANCE FINISHES STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the breathless fourth quarter of Sunday's Super Bowl, ABC's
Boomer Esiason came alive. Until then, the game had few
scintillating plays, little to challenge Esiason. And he hadn't
stepped up, falling into the habit of describing the obvious to us,
telling us what we clearly saw in the replays.
</P>
<P>
   On a first-half run by the Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair,
Esiason, the second-year analyst, said: ``They're bringing the
blitz, right up the middle. Nobody's panicking, the offensive line
is doing its job. Watch Steve McNair. Poise, poise, poise. He looks
downfield, then decides to take off. Watch him run. He breaks a
tackle there, another tackle there and takes a defensive lineman
on.'' Well, that's exactly what we had just seen.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on a replay of the St. Louis offensive lineman Orlando Pace,
Esiason said, ``Pace pushing down a defender. Then, he goes after
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, we had just seen that.
</P>
<P>
   But when the fourth quarter made Sunday night's game one of the
most memorable Super Bowls, Esiason's insights became crisper. He
described line play better, forecast plays and strategies with more
savvy, noted who was committing penalties before they were called
and stopped describing the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee's Jackie Harris caught a crucial pass to take the
Titans to the Rams' 2-yard line, Esiason said excitedly, ``What a
great call by Les Steckel. Number ninety-eight Grant Wistrom sees
it. He reads it. He senses exactly what's happening. Watch him
stop! Oh! Ho! What a great throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he exhorted the Titans' center, Kevin Long, as if he were
shouting at him from a sandlot sideline: ``C'mon Long, let's go.
Kevin Long is just kind of jogging in the park. Let's go! We've got
to get in the end zone!''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before, with the Rams on offense, and the game tied at
16, Esiason made a fortuitous remark. ``Now, the MVP, Kurt Warner,
comes into a situation that every kid dreams about. When you were a
kid, you dreamed of broadcasting the Super Bowl. I was thinking of
how to win the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   On cue, Warner threw the game-winning 73-yard touchdown to Isaac
Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels' call was a dandy one. With the camera cutting from
the Rams' owner to the field, he said, ``Georgia Frontiere. Heart
pounding. Warner to throw. Throwing deep downfield. Adjusting for
it is Isaac Bruce. And Isaac Bruce threads his way for a touchdown.
Seventy-three yards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michaels' most memorable call _ a stark, staccato narration
_ came on McNair's desperation run-and-throw with seconds left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels: ``Three receivers set to the right. McNair. Stepping
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason: ``Oh, oh, got him. Got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels: ``Rolling. Needs help. Stays on his feet somehow.
Throws. Eleven-yard line. It's caught! First down. They saved their
timeout. They have it here. They stop the clock. Kevin Dyson made
the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   With Michaels, there is always something extra. He's
three-quarters play-by-play announcer, one-quarter analyst. Upon
seeing Frontiere _ whom the ABC cameras frequently found in better
light than it could espy the Titans owner Bud Adams in _ he said,
``There's Georgia Frontiere. She took the name of her seventh
husband after inheriting the team from her sixth husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The production of the game usually matched the level of ABC's
best work on ``Monday Night Football.'' But it overused sideline
and booth shots of assistant coaches, which seldom escalated
tension; for that one shot of a frustrated Mike Martz, the Rams'
offensive coordinator, we saw too many lingering, inconsequential
shots of Pete Giunta, the Rams' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The two irresistible sideline shots were of St. Louis Coach Dick
Vermeil's wife, Carol, and Brenda Warner, Kurt's wife. ABC rightly
played up Warner's tale of supermarket stockboy to Super Bowl
quarterback _ and he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ABC's four-hour pre-game show delivered. Not
always, and not as emotionally as its top producer promised. The
high points include:
</P>
<P>
   --The surprisingly loopy special edition of ``The View,'' the
Barbara Walters-hosted daytime show. During six minutes of harmless
fun, the Walters crew debated the meaning of football:``It is all
about the butt,'' Meredith Viera said. Added Joy Behar: ``It's
about a bunch of guys jumping around in tights.'' (When the game
ended, the victorious Rams proved that.)
</P>
<P>
   --The tale of Dan and Claire Marino's adoption of an abandoned
Chinese girl, was a beautiful story, told sensitively by Jimmy
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   --The profile of Fritz Pollard, a black player-coach in the
National Football League in the 1920s, illuminated the life of a
pioneer. But it omitted details of his post-football life in
finance, journalism and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   --Andrea Kremer's report on concussions typified her stellar
work. The animation of what happens to the brain during a
concussion was jarring, as was the former Giant Harry Carson's
admission about memory loss caused by 15 concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent were a sense of icy weather outside the
Georgia Dome, a feature on the carpetbagging pasts of Tennessee and
St. Louis, and the daring to profile unsung and lesser-known
players on the teams.
</P>
<P>
   As studio host and analyst, Chris Berman and Steve Young made a
comfortable team. The overly busy format (we didn't need the magic
tricks or the interview with Phil Collins) prevented them from
being seen too much, but Young showed an active intelligence and a
sense of humor that elevated him above most active athletes turned
into instant analysts.

 &HT;    Highs and Lows: Warner-to-Bruce is play of the day
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What went right for the Rams
</P>
<P>
   The Kurt Warner-to-Isaac Bruce 73-yard pass for the winning
touchdown with 1:54 to play. Tennessee had completed a 16-point
comeback to tie the game on an Al Del Greco field goal on the
previous play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams totaled 294 offensive yards in the first half, while
grounding Air McNair and the Titans, holding them to 89. The Rams'
offensive line made Jevon Kearse a non-factor in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Warner completed his Cinderella story by winning the Super Bowl
MVP award after passing for 414 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong for the Rams
</P>
<P>
   The Rams allowed the game to turn in the second half, largely by
an inability to stop Eddie George. After limiting him to 18 yards
on seven carries in the first half, George had 77 yards on 21
carries in the second, including both Tennessee touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams marched inside the Titans' 20 on all five of their
first-half possessions but led only 9-0 at halftime. What could
have been a 35-0 shellacking at best was still very much a game. It
stayed that way until the final play.
</P>
<P>
   Twice St. Louis field-goal attempts failed, once on a botched
hold by Mike Horan, the second on a Jeff Wilkins miss from 34 yards
that sailed right.
</P>
<P>
   On the botched attempt, the snap appeared to be a good one, but
Horan bobbled it and didn't get the ball down in time for Wilkins
to make contact. Wilkins ran past it as Horan picked the ball up
and was tackled easily by Donald Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Warner failed to complete a pass on 10 attempts inside the 20.
Otherwise in the first half he was 19-for-25 for 270 yards. He had
problems throughout the game with batted passes from the Tennessee
defensive line, which swatted away four overall.
</P>
<P>
   What went right for the Titans
</P>
<P>
   Outside of his 52-yard pass play on busted coverage, the Rams
shut Marshall Faulk down. He was held to 12 yards on five rushing
attempts in the first half and 17 yards on 10 carries for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' offense materialized just in time to make a game of
it after being shut out in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong for the Titans
</P>
<P>
   The knock against the Titans' offense was its lack of big-play
ability, its overreliance on short passes and dumps to the running
backs and tight ends. Maybe it's only fitting the game ended on one
final play from the Rams' 10, when Steve McNair threw to wide
receiver Kevin Dyson, who'd run a route that had him catch the ball
underneath the defense and shy of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had more passing yards that McNair _ 414 yards to 214 _
and it was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco had a couple of 47-yard field goal tries fail, the
first in the first half when he missed it wide left and the second
on a breakdown on the right side of the line allowed Todd Lyght to
burst through unblocked and smother the kick on the Titans' first
possession of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Best pass play
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Warner to Bruce for the game and the championship. Bruce
ran a deep pattern along the right sideline with cornerback Denard
Walker in hot pursuit. Warner, with Jevon Kearse applying a blow to
his chest, appeared to just unload hoping Bruce could come up with
something big. Let's just say he answered. The ball was underthrown
but Bruce waited on it, cutting behind Walker and once he caught it
he made a move to avoid one tackle from and then took off for the
end zone. Safety Perry Phenix made one last diving try at stopping
Bruce and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Best run play
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George's 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, his
second touchdown run of the second half, which cut into the Rams
lead 16-13. George had bounced outside after drawing some contact
from Kevin Carter and then took to grinding his way into the end
zone. He had to get past 6-3, 300-pound defensive tackle Jeff
Zgonina first, which he did with a powerful legwork and some help
from the officials. Television replays showed George had bounced
his left knee into the turf before he crossed the goal line, but in
live action the way his legs were moving it would have been
difficult to see.
</P>
<P>
   Best tackle
</P>
<P>
   Rams linebacker Mike Jones came up with not only the best tackle
of the game but maybe the best of the season and best of his life.
With a Super Bowl championship on the line, the 8-year veteran
wrapped up receiver Kevin Dyson a yard shy of the end zone on the
final play to secure the Rams' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Worst play
</P>
<P>
   Faulk completely baffled the Titans defense late in the first
quarter when he took off wide to the right out of the backfield to
catch a swing pass from Warner completely unhindered. He turned it
into a 52-yard gain before Denard Walker caught up to him and
shoved him out of bounds at Titans 17. Otherwise, it would have
been a 10-0 lead on a touchdown, but still it set the tone for the
kind of things the Rams would be able to do to Tennessee's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Scariest moment
</P>
<P>
   When Titans hard-hitting safety and emotional leader Blaine
Bishop crashed into Rams tight end Ernie Conwell head first and had
not only the impact from Conwell's but from fellow defender Anthony
Dorsett .
</P>
<P>
   Best Hit
</P>
<P>
   Titans' defensive end Kenny Holmes gave Warner a Super Bowl
memory with a blow to his back on a sack that had Warner letting
out a grunt which the field microphones caught for the millions of
TV viewers. That sack, which was among the most vicious of the
game, came at a pretty opportune time with the Rams sitting at
second-and-goal on the 10 at the end of the first half. They had to
settle for a field goal two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   Worst Hit
</P>
<P>
   Kearse had finally shed some blockers and was on his way to
wreaking some havoc _ aka chasing down Warner _ but when he caught
him he brought him down with his facemask. So instead of a sack,
Kearse was hit with a 15-yard facemask penalty, which gave the Rams
a first down on the Titans' 10.
</P>
<P>
   Oops
</P>
<P>
   Referee Bob McElwee appeared to be making up new rules when he
mistakenly called a delay of game penalty against the defense with
the Titans driving inside St. Louis territory in the first quarter.
He changed his call moments later to the chagrin of the Titans,
whose drive was all but thwarted from a first and long situation
they couldn't convert. The drive ended in a failed field goal try.
</P>
<P>
   Deja Vu
</P>
<P>
   Warner had to wonder what was going on when, for the second week
in a row, his first pass attempt on St. Louis' first play from
scrimmage was batted by a defensive lineman. Last week it was the
Bucs Steve White who batted the ball and intercepted it, setting up
a Bucs field goal in the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Titans defensive tackle Josh Evans batted the ball at
the line, but offensive guard Fred Miller caught the batted ball
for a 1-yard loss.

ROCKETS BEAT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ All the pomp and circumstance fitting the occasion was
there Sunday. The music blared, the dancing girls danced and the
lights shone brightly. But as a Super Bowl warm-up act, the Los
Angeles Lakers proved less compelling than an hour of Boomer
Esiason analysis and a bowl of warm guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   They watched a rookie carve them up like seven-layer dip. They
took shots that had the accuracy of a shanked punt. And they made
the woeful Houston Rockets look like Titans in front of a home
crowd still enthralled with its former Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   So coach Phil Jackson didn't hide his disgust after an 89-83
loss at Compaq Center that may have been the Lakers' worst of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an embarrassing performance today of our basketball
club,''he said. ``I was very disappointed in our effort.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of embarrassment to go around as the
Lakers lost for the fifth time in eight games, lost on national
television and lost to a sub-.500 team for the first time in two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Sabotaged by their own shooting ineptitude _ 36 percent, the
Lakers' fourth worst effort this season _ they hardly put up a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant was 6 for 22, Shaquille O'Neal 12 for 27 and Glen
Rice 1 for 7 (with just one shot in the second half). Ron Harper
was 3 for 7 and Derek Fisher missed all six of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant could only shake his head and smile, but was admittedly
frustrated by his personal worst shooting performance of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you get pretty good looks at the basket. We
just weren't making them,'' he said. ``People say sometimes that
happens, you have nights like those, but I want to figure out
why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers opened with a 16-point first quarter, matching their
slowest start of the season, and closed with a 17-point fourth,
only briefly taking a seven-point lead in between.
</P>
<P>
   Then they lost to a Rockets team no longer built around Dream
Teamers named Pippen, Barkley and Olajuwon, but around a flashy
rookie named Francis and a lot of guys named Role Player.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis led a continuous whirlwind of speedy young Rockets
and was held to a mere 17 points by his own foul trouble. While he
was out, second-year guards Cuttino Mobley (15 points) and Bryce
Drew (10 points) took turns gliding unfettered to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   How could the the Lakers defense allow easy penetration, time
and again? ``That's exactly what I asked them,'' Jackson said. ``We
just never really had control of Drew, whatever his name is, the
kid that was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-identify guard almost single-handedly erased the
Lakers' last significant lead, a 54-47 advantage in the third. Drew
hit a runner,a layup and a floater over O'Neal's outstretched arm
to fuel a 10-2 run, and the Lakers never regained the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That killed us,'' Rice said of the Rockets' layup line, and
the Lakers' recent trend of allowing such displays. ``We can't
afford to let guys to keep penetrating and breaking us down and
getting easy shots and dropping it off to guys that are popping
jumpers. That's definitely something we've got to improve on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, the Lakers couldn't even rely on their best
weapon. O'Neal finished with a game-high 27 points but missed 15
shots and had two big ones blocked by Kelvin Cato.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just timed it real well. He's known for his
shot-blocking,'' O'Neal said. ``We just missed a lot of shots. ...
I missed a couple of chippies there. We've just got to play through
it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MCNAIR NEARLY TURNS OUT THE RAMS' LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Lucille McNair can remember her son
Steve crying and laying his head on her shoulder was nine years ago
when McNair was a high school senior in Mount Olive, Miss. A
teacher had accused McNair of turning out the lights in her
classroom. McNair said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher insisted he had. After a testy debate, she
threatened to slap him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really got Steve upset,'' Lucille McNair said. ``And he
was still upset about it when he told me the story. He said:
`You've whipped us, but even you never tried to slap us. I could
have taken a paddling even though I didn't do anything wrong, but
it was going to be a fight if she had slapped me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She sent Steve to the principal's office and I received a
disciplinary note at home. It was the only one Steve ever got in
his 12 years of schooling. It hurt him. And that was the last time
he ever cried and laid his head on my shoulders. It was the last
time I ever saw him so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, Steve is like me,'' his mother explained Sunday
morning before watching McNair work in Super Bowl XXXIV. ``He does
not show his emotions very easily. He is not frigid. He never
complains. Steve in college and as a pro has always taken matters
into his own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe after this oh-so-close miss, this gripping finish that
must have broken his heart, who could blame McNair if, one more
time, he privately sought his mother, cried and laid his head on
her shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   This time, against the St. Louis Rams in the biggest game of his
life, McNair helped to turn Super Bowl XXXIV into a circus-like
affair. St. Louis scored the first 16 points as McNair struggled.
Then McNair sparkled and led Tennessee to 16 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes, the Rams scored on a dramatic bomb.
Rams ahead, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   But back came McNair, driving the Titans to the 1-yard line
before the clock struck zero. In an emotional aftermath, Coach Jeff
Fisher consoled McNair on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   McNair so close. McNair with flair.
</P>
<P>
   He is used to the spectacular. It was the norm for him at Alcorn
State, shunning bigger schools that wanted him to play defensive
back. He paved ground at Alcorn State to become one of college
football's most productive passers. With the Titans, he has grown
from being a backup his first two years and then becoming a starter
in the last three.
</P>
<P>
   Late in Super Bowl XXXIV, McNair took matters into his own
hands. He scrambled for crucial yards, passed for pivotal gains and
nearly squeezed life from the Rams. He completed 22 of 36 passes
for 214 yards and ran 8 times for 64 yards, a Super Bowl rushing
record for a quarterback. His point _ that he is as fine a
quarterback as can be found, a passer, a runner, a winner. That he
has a hunger to always be a winner and a champion.
</P>
<P>
   His road to stardom has been littered with others' doubts. There
has always been the novelty of being one of the few black
quarterbacks. Some pro scouts doubted whether he could mentally
master an offense. There was the notion that he was a runner first
and a passer second. Some experts said he played against college
competition that was too soft.
</P>
<P>
   This Super Bowl was a chance for McNair to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute and final one.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting at his 12-yard line with 1 minute 48 seconds
to play and with only one timeout, McNair could drive the Titans
only 87 yards. His 9-yard pass to Kevin Dyson finished one-yard
short of a touchdown as the clock struck zero. Linebacker Mike
Jones made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-on-one play and they made the play,'' McNair
said. ``I thought we were going to get it in. That is the
excitement you have. He ran a couple of yards with it and you
expect the score. But we came up short. And that's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has gone from the bottom to the top,'' Lucille McNair
said. ``And he knows how to work for what he wants and how to earn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille McNair, 50, raised her four sons _ Fred (31), Tim (29),
Jason (28), Steve (26) and Michael (12) _ in that manner. Growing
up in Mount Olive, McNair learned about farming, house chores and
responsibility. About respect, especially for his mother, whom he
calls Lucy Mae.
</P>
<P>
   She worked long hours and long years to rear her sons. She had
help from family and friends in the neighborhood. ``Back then you
helped raise all the kids around; if any of my sons misbehaved, the
neighbors could whip them and I didn't have to know about it,''
Lucille McNair said. ``Maybe a day or two later they would tell me,
but my kids wouldn't. They knew that they would be getting another
whipping from me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, disciplined life, she said, in their modest
three-bedroom, one-bathroom, $14,000 home built in 1971. She had
been reared in a simple, disciplined way, too, and remembers
picking cotton as a child.
</P>
<P>
   So, once McNair signed his first pro contract in 1995, he bought
the land in Collins, Miss., near Mount Olive, where his mother once
picked cotton. He bought that land and much more around it, a total
of 643 acres. On half of it are pine trees. On the rest are 110
cattle, 7 horses, 7 ponds stocked with catfish and bass and an area
where hay is grown and sold. He and his wife and children live in
the ranch house, and on the land he built another house, one for
his mother, a six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom home complete
with a movie theater and one of her favorite rooms, a trophy room
displaying all of her sons' athletic achievements.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that McNair did not just buy land anywhere for his
mother, for his family, but land also stocked with family history.
His plan then and now is to rewrite history.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, some of his teachers would post his football
articles on the bulletin board, but McNair would never read them in
front of his peers and teachers. To many, he seemed uninterested.
But one teacher recalls coming back to a room after school to pick
up forgotten supplies and seeing young McNair inside, scanning the
board, reading the news.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair is slyly perceptive of all around him, aware of
this Super Bowl chance that slipped past him, of his place in
history as only the second black quarterback to start in a Super
Bowl. His intent was not to win a Super Bowl _ he was certain he
could win several. But the clock struck zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to Steve to show people what he can
accomplish,'' Lucille McNair said. ``The black quarterback thing,
the way people think of him as a quarterback; he is going to
convince people they have to rethink their position. I drove here
from Mount Olive on Thursday, and I've only seen Steve three brief
times. On Saturday, I hugged him and told him to pray before the
game and keep God first and do your best and you'll come out a
winner regardless of the score. And he held my hands and said,
`Thank you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is married with three sons now. During college, he was a
young man. Now he considers himself a man, a husband, a father, a
leader. He wants to be a role model. He's settled. Sometimes when
he comes back to Mississippi, to the ranch, I can't find him. I
call around and then I remember exactly where to find him; he's at
the old house in Mount Olive. We've kept it. There are too many
memories there to just get rid of it. He'll just go in and sit and
talk with his brothers. I go there a lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One day McNair might return to the Super Bowl and finish the
job. Maybe he will win the game's most valuable player trophy. And
if he does, his mother will put it in a perfect place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for a while, I'd like to put it in my trophy room,'' she
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucy Mae, Steve McNair would gladly turn on the light. And
let it shine. &QL;

GEORGE'S SECOND HALF COMEBACK FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An astonishing collapse of the Titans' offense almost
was reversed in the second half of Super Bowl XXXIV Sunday as Eddie
George began to pound the Rams inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort fell short, with the Titans stopped 1 yard away
from a touchdown as time ran out in the Rams' 23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half George carried the ball 21 times, he scored
two touchdowns, he amassed 77 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't begin to tell you how I feel,'' said the running
back, who had gained more than 2,500 all-purpose yards during the
season. ``I'm going to take the best of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced repeatedly with second-and-long situations in the opening
half, failing on four of five attempts on third downs, the Rams
were stacked against George.
</P>
<P>
   He carried only seven times the first half, had only 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how Eddie George played this year,'' said coach Jeff
Fisher later. ``He was carrying the load and after a while he was
going to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Titans knew the Rams were going to stack the
defense to halt George. Other teams had tried and were stymied when
quarterback Steve McNair successfully passed.
</P>
<P>
   But McNair's passes were dropped often until late in the game.
Also, McNair was looking for quick, short completions _ 14 of his
22 connections went to players who weren't wide receivers. There
wasn't much yardage there, and the Rams were glad to give it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, George started to pick up yardage, winding up with 95
yards on 28 carries. He added 35 on two receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agnew's handling of Titans' center Kevin Long was pivotal to
the Rams' defensive incursions and ability to halt George.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew, the defensive left tackle, often acts as a nose tackle.
Against the center, whose job is to zone-block so George can pick a
hole, Agnew gave him little time to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the second half, though. Down by 16-0, the
Titans, said Fisher, ``started to get first downs. And we made up
our mind we were going to pound them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those first-half carries of George _ Fisher claimed it
was simply a question of possession time. The Rams had 5 minutes 10
seconds more time of possession. But by the end of the game the
Titans enjoyed an advantage of almost 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to deal with what they were giving us,'' explained
George about the first half. ``When they take away the run, we
pass. But it wasn't working. We had to put ourselves in position
the second half. We did a great job with that in the second half,
getting some yardage on first down.''
</P>
<P>
   George, a 6 foot 3 inch, 240-pound runner, put the Titans on the
scoreboard with a 1-yard run in the third quarter after McNair had
dashed 23 yards to breathe some life into the offense.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, George scored again to narrow the margin
to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   And while he was polite as he stood in a booth in the post-game
interview area, the longer he spoke the sadder he became.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to forget this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher, who told McNair to remember how close they had come,
the work on next season ``starts tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For George, it seemed to have started Sunday night.

HOPIS' ENDURANCE ROOTED IN RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is sure where they came from, or when.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps 1,000 years, the Hopis have been building stone
houses atop three mesas that rise like fortresses from the oceanic
vastness surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi origins are shrouded in prehistory. Scholars say they are
related to the Anasazis, the ``ancient ones'' whose ruins are
scattered across much of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Their language is part of the Uto-Aztecan group, which is spoken
by tribal peoples as far south as Central America and as far north
as Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their origins, the Hopis have endured like few others.
This village, founded around A.D. 1100, claims to be the oldest
continuously occupied community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis say they have endured because of their commitment to
their religious practices and because of their sturdy spiritual
will bred by long struggle against drought and famine.
</P>
<P>
   They believe their land was entrusted to them by the god
Masau'u.
</P>
<P>
   Life's blessings, they say, particularly the precious rainfall,
come through the aid of the kachinas, supernatural beings who live
and dance in the villages from December through July.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining those blessings is literally a matter of life or
death, anthropologist Laura Thompson noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orthodox Hopi believe not only that man can positively affect
the functioning of the world of nature,'' she wrote, ``but in the
measure that he fails to do so, its harmonious functioning will be
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Hopi Chairman Ferrell Secakuku said Hopi beliefs required
them to reject Navajo attempts to buy the disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we sold the land, that would mean we have committed a fraud
on Masau'u,'' Secakuku said. ``. . . If that happened, according to
Hopi belief, all life on this Earth would die.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe also hasn't touched the $5 million it received in the
1960s from the U.S. government as compensation for loss of
aboriginal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an interest-bearing account, the money has grown to
more than $25 million. Traditionalists warn that to touch it would
be to sell the land _ and betray Masau'u.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful intricacy of the Hopis' ceremonial life has won
the admiration of the world. But their tenacious traditions have
also exasperated federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been known to be four days preparing for a dance,
two days dancing and two days recovering from the effects of it,''
Indian Agent Leo Crane wrote in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Hopi) is the sort of man who complains that he is being
driven to the wall by an energetic, crafty, hustling neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1900s, however, &UR; some Hopis sought to
develop a livestock industry. They moved away from the villages to
graze their herds _ and came into conflict with Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   The late tribal Chairman Abbott Sekaquaptewa and other
``progressives,'' led by ranching families, told Congress that Hopi
survival would be endangered unless Congress evicted the Navajos
who settled beyond open spaces beyond the mesas.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of relocation claimed that the land vacated by Navajos
would used mostly by livestock owned by a few Hopis. Secakuku, a
cattleman himself, doesn't disagree. But he says that is irrelevant
to Hopi rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still our land,'' he said. ``How would you feel if
someone moved into your back yard just because you weren't using it
at the time?'' &QL;

LA'S MANAGEMENT RATED LOWEST OF CALIFORNIA'S CITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- Los Angeles did poorly in a nationwide survey
that examined the management of America's 35 largest cities,
getting the grade of C.
</P>
<P>
   While Phoenix and Austin, Texas, got A's and more than half of
the cities surveyed got B's, Los Angeles fell below the national
average in the five areas studied. It also fell behind the four
other California cities surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The report card, to be released today, is billed as the most
comprehensive study to date of city operations and performance. It
was compiled and issued by the Maxwell School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials took solace in the city's best grade,
which was a B-minus in financial management.
</P>
<P>
   But L.A.'s C-minus ratings for human resources, information
technology and managing for results, coupled with a C-plus grade in
capital management, dragged the city's's average down to a C.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rankings, City Councilman Mike Feuer
acknowledged the need to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that a report like this does spur a discussion
as to the best way to deliver services, then it can be helpful,''
said Feuer, who is chairman of the council's Budget and Finance
Committee and vice chairman of the Government Efficiency Committee.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley secession leaders said the city's grade
bolsters their contention that breaking up Los Angeles into two or
more smaller cities would improve delivery of public services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study shows that the dissatisfaction of the public in Los
Angeles is warranted,'' said Richard Close, chairman of Valley
Voters Organized Toward Empowerment. ``The evidence keeps mounting
that L.A. is just not an effective government and that smaller
cities tend to be more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, who culled data through surveys of local officials,
follow-up interviews and contributions from Wall Street municipal
finance experts, determined the final grades by rating the cities
in financial management, human resources, information technology,
capital management and managing for results.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government Performance
Project, stressed that the report and grading system for cities are
designed to be instructive. ``This study provides city leaders with
tools to identify what's working and what is not in city
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, which received high praise from researchers in all five
categories, topped the survey with an overall grade of A. Austin,
Texas, placed second with an overall A-minus rating.
</P>
<P>
   The two lowest-rated cities, both with overall grades of
C-minus, were Buffalo and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A factor common to the cities that scored high in management
-- and those with momentum -- is strong leadership,'' Ingraham
said. ``Where there is strong leadership, there is a well-run city
that attracts residents and visitors and revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said Los Angeles city's finances are well-managed in
a number of areas including use of debt, cash management and
financial reporting. But the city's ability to estimate
expenditures has been less than impressive.
</P>
<P>
   James T. Sobject, chief administrative analyst for the city's
Finance Division and a participant in the Government Performance
Project's surveys, cited problems such as rapidly rising overtime
costs in the fire and sanitation departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles city Fire Department woes were pinned to a
variety of causes, including a sexual harassment scandal that
temporarily put all hiring on hold and an unexpectedly high
attrition and retirement rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the human resources area, researchers found fault with a Los
Angeles hiring process that can take from three to six months and a
distinct lack of accurate data on the size and scope of the city's
work force.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was also found lacking in the area of information
technology, where shortcomings were pinned to management and
technical problems. The report card cited numerous self-imposed
restrictions on purchasing, including whether vendors have a
reasonable child-care policy and don't do business with certain
foreign countries, such as Myanmar, formerly Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' capital management efforts were judged adequate.
The city was cited for its move to provide grass-roots monitoring
of major projects through the establishment of a Citizen's
Oversight Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the same category, the city's capital outlays to attract new
business were considered effective, while those aimed at upgrading
the city's infrastructure were found to be lagging. The report
specifically noted that Los Angeles repaved only 220 miles of its
6,500 miles of roads in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' efforts at managing for results were also judged as
below average, with researchers stressing that the city has no
overall strategic plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city needs to be doing a better job in identifying our
priorities and organizing government to address those priorities,''
Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that the mayor and the City Council get
ahead of the curve together,'' he explained. ``We were elected for
one reason, to solve problems. We need to address needs before they
become crises.''
</P>
<P>
   All other California cities graded beat Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s neighbor, Long Beach, which has had to remake its local
economy in the wake of post-Cold War Navy base closings and
aerospace industry cutbacks, earned an A-minus score in the area of
financial management. It was one of the highest grades in that
category for any city in the survey. San Diego rated a B and San
Jose a B-minus overall. San Francisco earned a C-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Full results of the report, which was financed with a grant from
the Pew Charitable Trusts, are to be published in the February
issue of Governing Magazine, a trade journal for local government
managers and elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the third issued by the Government Performance
Project. In 1998, the project applied their five criteria to a
survey of all 50 states. California rated a C-minus. Topping the
list with A-minus grades were Missouri, Utah, Virginia and
Washington. Alabama was given a national-low grade of D.

George W. Bush of Texas was joined Saturday by his father, former
President George Bush, during an appearance in Hampshire Hills.
Three days before the nation's first primary in New Hampshire and
with some polls showing Bush closing on Arizona Sen. John McCain,
the Texan looked and acted like a winner as he and his extended
family took the stage before almost 2,000 chanting, foot-stomping,
placard-waving supporters. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)

ago, or the can't-miss programmer who in the late 1980s built the
Fox network into a challenger to television's traditional Big

SPORTS COLUMN: MCNAIR NEARLY TURNS OUT THE RAMS' LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to fix slug; story was previously sent as(ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Lucille McNair can remember her son
Steve crying and laying his head on her shoulder was nine years ago
when McNair was a high school senior in Mount Olive, Miss. A
teacher had accused McNair of turning out the lights in her
classroom. McNair said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher insisted he had. After a testy debate, she
threatened to slap him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really got Steve upset,'' Lucille McNair said. ``And he
was still upset about it when he told me the story. He said:
`You've whipped us, but even you never tried to slap us. I could
have taken a paddling even though I didn't do anything wrong, but
it was going to be a fight if she had slapped me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She sent Steve to the principal's office and I received a
disciplinary note at home. It was the only one Steve ever got in
his 12 years of schooling. It hurt him. And that was the last time
he ever cried and laid his head on my shoulders. It was the last
time I ever saw him so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, Steve is like me,'' his mother explained Sunday
morning before watching McNair work in Super Bowl XXXIV. ``He does
not show his emotions very easily. He is not frigid. He never
complains. Steve in college and as a pro has always taken matters
into his own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe after this oh-so-close miss, this gripping finish that
must have broken his heart, who could blame McNair if, one more
time, he privately sought his mother, cried and laid his head on
her shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   This time, against the St. Louis Rams in the biggest game of his
life, McNair helped to turn Super Bowl XXXIV into a circus-like
affair. St. Louis scored the first 16 points as McNair struggled.
Then McNair sparkled and led Tennessee to 16 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes, the Rams scored on a dramatic bomb.
Rams ahead, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   But back came McNair, driving the Titans to the 1-yard line
before the clock struck zero. In an emotional aftermath, Coach Jeff
Fisher consoled McNair on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   McNair so close. McNair with flair.
</P>
<P>
   He is used to the spectacular. It was the norm for him at Alcorn
State, shunning bigger schools that wanted him to play defensive
back. He paved ground at Alcorn State to become one of college
football's most productive passers. With the Titans, he has grown
from being a backup his first two years and then becoming a starter
in the last three.
</P>
<P>
   Late in Super Bowl XXXIV, McNair took matters into his own
hands. He scrambled for crucial yards, passed for pivotal gains and
nearly squeezed life from the Rams. He completed 22 of 36 passes
for 214 yards and ran 8 times for 64 yards, a Super Bowl rushing
record for a quarterback. His point _ that he is as fine a
quarterback as can be found, a passer, a runner, a winner. That he
has a hunger to always be a winner and a champion.
</P>
<P>
   His road to stardom has been littered with others' doubts. There
has always been the novelty of being one of the few black
quarterbacks. Some pro scouts doubted whether he could mentally
master an offense. There was the notion that he was a runner first
and a passer second. Some experts said he played against college
competition that was too soft.
</P>
<P>
   This Super Bowl was a chance for McNair to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute and final one.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting at his 12-yard line with 1 minute 48 seconds
to play and with only one timeout, McNair could drive the Titans
only 87 yards. His 9-yard pass to Kevin Dyson finished one-yard
short of a touchdown as the clock struck zero. Linebacker Mike
Jones made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-on-one play and they made the play,'' McNair
said. ``I thought we were going to get it in. That is the
excitement you have. He ran a couple of yards with it and you
expect the score. But we came up short. And that's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has gone from the bottom to the top,'' Lucille McNair
said. ``And he knows how to work for what he wants and how to earn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille McNair, 50, raised her four sons _ Fred (31), Tim (29),
Jason (28), Steve (26) and Michael (12) _ in that manner. Growing
up in Mount Olive, McNair learned about farming, house chores and
responsibility. About respect, especially for his mother, whom he
calls Lucy Mae.
</P>
<P>
   She worked long hours and long years to rear her sons. She had
help from family and friends in the neighborhood. ``Back then you
helped raise all the kids around; if any of my sons misbehaved, the
neighbors could whip them and I didn't have to know about it,''
Lucille McNair said. ``Maybe a day or two later they would tell me,
but my kids wouldn't. They knew that they would be getting another
whipping from me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, disciplined life, she said, in their modest
three-bedroom, one-bathroom, $14,000 home built in 1971. She had
been reared in a simple, disciplined way, too, and remembers
picking cotton as a child.
</P>
<P>
   So, once McNair signed his first pro contract in 1995, he bought
the land in Collins, Miss., near Mount Olive, where his mother once
picked cotton. He bought that land and much more around it, a total
of 643 acres. On half of it are pine trees. On the rest are 110
cattle, 7 horses, 7 ponds stocked with catfish and bass and an area
where hay is grown and sold. He and his wife and children live in
the ranch house, and on the land he built another house, one for
his mother, a six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom home complete
with a movie theater and one of her favorite rooms, a trophy room
displaying all of her sons' athletic achievements.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that McNair did not just buy land anywhere for his
mother, for his family, but land also stocked with family history.
His plan then and now is to rewrite history.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, some of his teachers would post his football
articles on the bulletin board, but McNair would never read them in
front of his peers and teachers. To many, he seemed uninterested.
But one teacher recalls coming back to a room after school to pick
up forgotten supplies and seeing young McNair inside, scanning the
board, reading the news.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair is slyly perceptive of all around him, aware of
this Super Bowl chance that slipped past him, of his place in
history as only the second black quarterback to start in a Super
Bowl. His intent was not to win a Super Bowl _ he was certain he
could win several. But the clock struck zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to Steve to show people what he can
accomplish,'' Lucille McNair said. ``The black quarterback thing,
the way people think of him as a quarterback; he is going to
convince people they have to rethink their position. I drove here
from Mount Olive on Thursday, and I've only seen Steve three brief
times. On Saturday, I hugged him and told him to pray before the
game and keep God first and do your best and you'll come out a
winner regardless of the score. And he held my hands and said,
`Thank you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is married with three sons now. During college, he was a
young man. Now he considers himself a man, a husband, a father, a
leader. He wants to be a role model. He's settled. Sometimes when
he comes back to Mississippi, to the ranch, I can't find him. I
call around and then I remember exactly where to find him; he's at
the old house in Mount Olive. We've kept it. There are too many
memories there to just get rid of it. He'll just go in and sit and
talk with his brothers. I go there a lot, too.''

<P>
   One day McNair might return to the Super Bowl and finish the
job. Maybe he will win the game's most valuable player trophy. And
if he does, his mother will put it in a perfect place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for a while, I'd like to put it in my trophy room,'' she
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucy Mae, Steve McNair would gladly turn on the light. And
let it shine. &QL;

For more than two decades, Barry Diller, 58, has been among the

Today, Diller's career has come to a crossroads and he is no longer

ago, or the can't-miss programmer who in the late 1980s built the
Fox network into a challenger to television's traditional Big

COLLISION, AND TIME STANDS STILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The noise of more than 72,000 fans was muffled, even
stilled, for almost 10 minutes during Super Bowl XXXIV on Sunday.
In a scary, familiar scene, a player was on the ground with a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Blaine Bishop appears to be recovering _ in fact, said
Tennessee Coach Jeff Fisher, Bishop wanted to go back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a 5-foot-9-inch, 203-pound strong safety, charged
head-first into the back of Rams tight end Ernie Conwell in the
third period. Bishop's head snapped back after he hit the 265-pound
ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher went over as doctors from both teams ministered to him.
Players stood about 10 yards away. Fisher then spoke to the Titans,
who were on the other side of the field. Meanwhile, the Rams
huddled in an impromptu prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, Fisher said: ``There's nothing final about his
condition, but we're going to take him back. The X-rays are
negative. He was moving his arms and legs and wanted to play again.
But he still had some tingling in his fingers, and when we go home
we're going to take him for a CAT scan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he had told his players what was happening while
Bishop was on the turf because it looked serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a player down for any length of time, you
want to tell the team how he's doing,'' Fisher said. ``I could tell
that it wasn't a critical situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bishop's head and body were strapped onto a stretcher and
he was lifted onto what appeared to be an elongated golf cart that
had flashing lights.
</P>
<P>
   As it headed for the exit, the crowd began to roar and Bishop
got a huge ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The roaring did not stop after he was gone from view, though.
Play had continued, and the noise went from cheers of relief and
respect to cheering for the game.  &QL;

BENCHING DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH COLD RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Glen Rice took seven shots from the field Sunday and
made just one. But he wouldn't call that a bad game, per se.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad shooting half for me,'' he said. ``I can't go out
on a limb and say (it was a bad shooting) night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers in fact lost an afternoon game to the
Houston Rockets, but Rice wasn't making a day-night distinction.
His point was that his poor shooting effort was only the product of
one half. In the other half, he barely shot at all.
</P>
<P>
   After going 1 for 6 in the first half, Rice took just one shot
the rest of the game, and clearly wasn't pleased. Not enough
touches in the second half?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's putting it plain and simple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooters got to get an opportunity to get it going,'' Rice
said, ``and as for myself, the opportunities weren't there in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice missed a 19-foot jumper to start the third quarter, and
never took another shot. Three free throws accounted for all of his
second-half scoring, and he finished with seven points _ his lowest
total in the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Then coach Phil Jackson went to a three-guard lineup to counter
the Rockets' quickness, and Rice simmered on the bench, for more
than six minutes spanning the end of the third and start of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough for me to sit. I'm not an assistant coach,''
he said. ``Anytime you sit that long, it's going to take you a
minute or two to get warmed up. But that happens. I try and do the
best to go out there and be ready when called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Showdown: As the coach for the Western Conference All-Star team,
the Lakers' Phil Jackson was guaranteed to go against an old rival,
as the coaching race in the East came down to Miami's Pat Riley and
New York's Jeff Van Gundy. Neither have friendly relations with
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his thoughts on facing either one, Jackson took a long
pause, then he took a pass on stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel sorry for the person that has to travel that
distance,''he said. ``Riley's great at those games. He's probably
coached more of them than any other coach in the NBA. Van Gundy
probably deserves a shot at it because he's sat on the perimeter of
this now for a while, and he got to the Finals last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy clinched the spot later in the day, when the Knicks
beat the Sacramento Kings.

WARNER FINDS PERFECT ENDING TO STORYBOOK SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Kurt Warner came on the Georgia Dome field for
the last time Sunday, he wondered what happened to the game he
thought his St. Louis Rams had under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it was the Super Bowl, and we had been up 16 points,''
Warner said. ``And now it's tied. And their fans are going nuts. Of
course, I thought about some things. I wouldn't call them doubts,
but you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's last complete pass had been in the third quarter. The
Rams had gained 2 yards in the fourth quarter. And the Tennessee
Titans, who had been chasing the St. Louis Rams for a half, had
finally caught them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's moments like those when you draw back on your success
through the whole year,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rams specialized in this season was attacking and
throwing the ball down the field. And though the Titans had just
tied the game, Warner went for it all on the next play, the Rams'
first snap after the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Warner found wide receiver Isaac Bruce along the right sideline,
using a technique that has been around football for decades but is
very much in vogue again. Warner threw toward the back shoulder of
Bruce, who stopped and caught the pass as cornerback Denard Walker
_ unable to stop his momentum _ drifted past him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce cut back and out-raced a handful of defenders to the end
zone, scoring the stirring, game-winning touchdown in the Rams
23-16 victory in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Titans came within a yard of being an extra point
away from tying the game, a NFL season that has seemed like a
five-month-long victory tour for the Rams concluded with a very
Rams-like championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of it all was Warner, who was named the game's
Most Valuable Player after completing 24 of 45 passes for 414
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who also threw a third-quarter touchdown pass, set a
Super Bowl record for passing yards. The old record was set by Joe
Montana in 1989 with 357 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Warner. ``It's everything you
try to accomplish when you start playing football as a kid. I
couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said the Bruce touchdown was actually a play the team had
called earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the ball in the right place then even though
Isaac had him beat,'' Warner said. ``I knew he could beat him
again. I have a lot of confidence in him. I think our confidence
had a lot to do with the way things ended. We were in the huddle
saying, `We got two minutes. That's plenty of time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several Tennessee players said they expected the Rams to go deep
in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been doing it that way all season,'' said Walker. ``I
actually got in good position. I figured he might come at me. I
just got my legs tangled up and I lost the ball for a few seconds.
That's all it takes in the league now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Titans coach Jeff Fisher: ``I was very worried about Warner
in that situation. He's beat a lot of people like that. Kurt had a
marvelous game. He took a pounding. We hit him and hit him. But he
stood in there and ultimately made that big play like he has all
year. That's how they got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Warner was sacked just once, he was frequently under
pressure from Tennessee's active front defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That young man has a lot of fortitude,'' said Rams coach Dick
Vermeil. ``He's a great example of persistence. He is what we'd all
like to be. This guy is a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner started the game strong, leading the Rams to three field
goals when he had 277 passing yards in the first half. The Rams
also missed one first-half field goal and botched another when
holder Mike Horan dropped the snap from center.
</P>
<P>
   Warner had to carry the Rams because the Titans were doing such
a good job stopping St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk, who had
just 17 rushing yards in the game on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, Warner hit Torry Holt for a 9-yard
touchdown pass to extend the Rams lead to 16-0. It was a crossing
route, a pattern that Warner throws especially well and went to
repeatedly in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, things looked pretty good for a while,'' Warner said.
``When we were up 16-0, I was hoping we'd get one more touchdown
and then maybe that would be enough to close it out from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were fighting back. In some ways, I'm glad they did.
Because we had to reach back. And that touchdown was a perfect
ending for our season.''

KINGS GET LITTLE RELIEF
</HEADLINE>

By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lowly New York Islanders might seem the
perfect team to play after the Kings' heartbreaking loss Saturday
night in Toronto. But after seven consecutive losses, the Islanders
have swept the first two games of their three-game California swing
that continues tonight against the Los Angeles Kings at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never count out a team like that,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said. ``Their guys are playing hard, looking to keep jobs
for next year. There is plenty of motivation in their dressing
room.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Kings, who gave up three third-period goals
to the Leafs, including the game-winner with 18.9 seconds left?
</P>
<P>
   They arrived back in Los Angeles at 3:30 a.m. Sunday and
participated in a light workout in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing we can do is let the (Toronto) game
go and move on with the season,'' defenseman Garry Galley said.
``You can't let something like that fester. We have to come out
(tonight) like we beat the Maple Leafs and want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight marks the only time the Kings and Islanders meet this
season. It also is the first time the clubs have played since last
summer's major trade that sent Ziggy Palffy, Bryan Smolinski,
goaltender Marcel Cousineau and a fourth-round draft choice (Daniel
Johansson) to the Kings in exchange for Olli Jokinen, Josh Green
and Martin Biron.
</P>
<P>
   A strange statistic that seems to be going around the league
this season is losing the first game at home after a trip of three
games or more.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cup champion Dallas was 0-5 before beating the Kings 3-1
last Wednesday. The Kings are 0-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a trend this year, but it's hard to explain,''
Murray said. ``I don't anticipate us being flat. I never do. We
know what happened on the trip. Against Dallas we didn't take
advantage of scoring chances. Against Toronto we let in late goals.
We talked about those things today. But our effort is still
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-line winger Donald Audette, who hoped to return for the
Toronto game after missing a month with a sprained left ankle, will
miss tonight's action but hopes to be back Thursday against
Detroit.

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a fitting end for this St. Louis Rams team of
castoffs. The quarterback, Kurt Warner, at one point was bagging
groceries at a small store in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The wide receiver,
Isaac Bruce, was once labeled as soft, his injured hamstrings
making the news more than his touchdown catches. The coach, Dick
Vermeil, succumbed to burnout, leaving the profession for almost
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a miraculous play, made on the biggest stage in the
world, and suddenly the three men were not the punchline to a joke.
Instead, they were Super Bowl heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, with just several minutes left in the game, connected on
a 73-yard deep pass to Bruce for the game-winning touchdown, a play
that will surely go down in championship lore. It broke a 16-16 tie
and made the Rams winners over Tennessee in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis then held on, by the skin of its teeth, as Tennessee
made a thrilling last-second drive, only seeing a pass from
quarterback Steve McNair to wide receiver Kevin Dyson fall about a
yard short of being an extra point away from sending the game into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the most exciting Super Bowls ever, culminating a
year in which no-name players like Warner turned from pumpkins to
Pro Bowlers and non-traditional teams like the Titans and Rams went
from an embarrassment to championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, while out of professional football, Warner
was busy asking people if they wanted paper or plastic, but Sunday
night he threw for a record 414 yards, breaking Joe Montana's mark
of 357 in Super Bowl XXIV against Cincinnati in 1989. Warner, who
was compared to Montana by Vermeil last week, was voted the game's
most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it is sort of a storybook ending,'' Warner said.
``When you think about where I was and where I am now, it seems
pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of players in this game who were great is long. Bruce
had 162 yards on six catches, while Rams receiver Torry Holt set a
rookie record with 109 reception yards. McNair, only the second
black quarterback to ever play in a Super Bowl, was at times
breathtaking, going 22 of 36 for 214 passing yards. He set a record
for rushing yards by a quarterback with 64. Tennessee running back
Eddie George, a bruiser who dominated the second half, finished
with 95 yards on 28 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Vermeil, who at 63 years old becomes the
oldest coach to win a Super Bowl. At one point, Vermeil was hated
by Rams players for his brutal practices, but after consulting with
them and changing his ways from a stern disciplinarian to a more
laid-back approach, he earned their respect and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel so good and so proud of this football team
and organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spectacular plays and outstanding personal stories
came a scary moment when in the third quarter safety Blaine Bishop,
was carted off the field after attempting to tackle 265-pound tight
end Ernie Conwell. Bishop led with his head on the play, and it
snapped back ferociously, and he lay on the turf for almost 10
minutes, with both Titans and Rams players, on the sidelines,
holding hands and praying. Bishop suffered no serious neck
damage-the preliminary diagnosis was a sprained neck _ but Bishop
had been knocked unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was immobilized as a precaution, his neck strapped down,
and he was taken to the locker room, and later to an area hospital
for further examinations, while a crowd of 72,625 at the Georgia
Dome sat in stunned silence. About an hour after the game, Bishop
rejoined his team.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher, sensing his team was becoming unnerved by the
injury, gathered his players around him, and told them that while
everyone's thoughts were with Bishop, there was still a game to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this stadium and around the country was
concerned,'' said Fisher. ``I wanted to let my team know that he
was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold reality of professional football is that game goes on
despite what can be grotesque injuries. The Titans, in wake of
Bishop's injury, were left without both of their starting safeties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the injury the Rams had dominated offensively, moving the
ball up and down the field almost at will, but the offense usually
stalled once the team got inside the 20-yard line of Tennessee. All
the Rams could manage were three field goals and a 9-0 lead midway
through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Warner, on third and goal at the Tennessee
10-yard line, threaded a perfectly thrown pass to Torry Holt, and
the Rams took a 16-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   McNair proved to be one of the more resilient players this
season. He showed it after the Rams' scoring drive when during
Tennessee's drive he scampered 23 yards to the St. Louis two. It
was the longest run by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. Two
plays later George scored from one-yard out. The Titans missed the
two-point conversion, but still had hope when the score was cut to
16-6.
</P>
<P>
   McNair continued his hot streak. After Tennessee forced the Rams
to kick their first punt, McNair, often criticized for his lack of
passing skills, made several great throws on the following drive,
including a throwback pass to tight end Jackie Harris that went 21
yards to the St. Louis three. George, breaking three tackles, ran
the ball in again from the one, though replays showed his knee was
clearly down before getting into the end zone. The Rams could have
challenged the touchdown using instant replay, but did not.
</P>
<P>
   That score concluded a 13-play, 79-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who was outstanding in the first half, froze up in the
second half, as the Tennessee defense began to dominate, and McNair
did not waste his opportunities. He led the offense on a scoring
drive again, tying the game at 16 when kicker Al Del Greco
connected with a 44-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The play to Bruce had been called by offensive coordinator Mike
Martz earlier in the game, on the opposite sideline, but it was
unsuccessful. After the Titans scored, there were just 2 minutes
and 12 seconds left. Most teams would have been conservative,
attempting to eat up the clock, and maneuver into field goal range.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams are extremely aggressive offensively, and Martz
blurted into Vermeil's headset, ``Let's put the ball in the hands
of Isaac Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Good idea. Quick strike. Long ball. Touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the safety overrun me, and I ducked under him, and after
that it was a race to the end zone,'' said Bruce. ``I wasn't going
to lose that race.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair wasn't done, though. He took the helm and led the Titans
from their 12-yard line, all the way to the St. Louis 10 with six
seconds left. Along the way, he made several key runs that kept the
drive alive, including one where he spun free of two defensive
lineman like a magician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him right in my grasp,'' said the Rams' Kevin Carter,
``and he slipped away.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on what would be the final play of the game, McNair again
rolled out, and under pressure, threw a strike to Dyson at about
the five-yard line. But in what is surely the most important tackle
of his life, linebacker Mike Jones wrapped up Dyson. The wide
receiver stretched as far as he could, but his reach ended about a
yard short. The clock wound down to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a touchdown,'' said McNair. ``But you have
great athletes on both sides of the ball and they made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vermeil: ``When I saw the ball in the air, I was
terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   The terror lasted only for a second. It was replaced by joy, and
probably a small feeling of vindication.

BRUINS COULD USE SOME HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA got the split it needed this weekend to stay
on pace for an NCAA Tournament bid. Now, the Bruins need a little
help from their foes.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a seventh seed and an eighth seed, for
instance, might be their power rating, and that's determined by
record, schedule strength and opponent performance.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's time for the Bruins to root for North
Carolina, Gonzaga, South Florida, DePaul, Purdue and even
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, I look at the ticker (on Headline News or ESPN2)
as the scores flash up,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``(The
power rating is based) not just on our game, but on all the other
games (opponents) play. You don't dramatically overreact (to
scores), but you are aware.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins (12-6, 3-4) are on the bubble on Selection Sunday,
if they're 17-13 and mired in fifth place, then their power rating
could determine whether they get a bid.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here's a look at how UCLA's foes have fared.
</P>
<P>
   __North Carolina, which recently lost four straight, is 13-8
after defeating Maryland and Georgia Tech this week.
</P>
<P>
   __The Bruins aren't getting much help from DePaul. The Blue
Demons are 13-7 after defeating Florida and losing to
Alabama-Birmingham this week.
</P>
<P>
   __South Florida is struggling. The Bulls lost to Cincinnati and
are 12-8 with no impressive victories.
</P>
<P>
   __Lavin's former boss, Purdue coach Gene Keady, is doing his
part. The Boilermakers are 13-7 overall and 4-3 in the rugged Big
Ten.
</P>
<P>
   __Gonzaga staggered through a brutal December schedule, but the
Bulldogs are rolling this month. They hammered Portland on Saturday
to improve to 16-5.
</P>
<P>
   __Pepperdine is 16-5 and tied with Gonzaga for first place in
the WCC.
</P>
<P>
   __The Bruins should root for the top teams in the Pacific-10, as
well. If they finish fifth, they'll benefit from each victory by
teams above them.
</P>
<P>
   Even USC.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down: UCLA guard Ray Young scored a career-high 22 points
Thursday at Oregon State. He was 0 of 8 and scoreless in Saturday's
73-58 loss at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Words to remember: What were Oregon coach Ernie Kent's
second-half instructions?
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) wanted us to put a dagger in their hearts,'' forward
Bryan Bracey told The Oregonian. ``He wanted us to not just win,but
to hurt them. Make them know they were blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice adjustment: Trailing by 10 points late in the first half,
the Ducks changed their defense on UCLA forward Jerome Moiso and
snuffed the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started double-teaming him, and that forced him to make
decisions,'' Ducks forward A.D. Smith said. ``We got a couple
steals, and that let us get our fast break going.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso scored eight points on 3-of-8 shooting in the first half.
In the second, he took two shots.

 &HT;    Marchers outside Super Bowl protest Georgia flag
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Standing beneath flags honoring America, the Super
Bowl and Georgia, about 100 people marched outside the Georgia Dome
on Sunday to protest the state's lingering symbol of the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, state
Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta) and the Coalition to Change the
Georgia Flag, the marchers sang civil rights songs.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's flag ``stands for white supremacy and slavery,'' said
Lowery, former president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. ``A state flag ought to be a uniting force, not a
dividing force.''
</P>
<P>
   The marchers urged members of the General Assembly to take
action. Lowery said Georgia political leaders had been noncommittal
about starting talks to remove the Confederate battle emblem from
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not now, when?'' Lowery asked the crowd. ``We're committed
to utilize every nonviolent means available to see that the flag is
changed, including a boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, South Carolina has been the target of a tourism
boycott called by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. The NAACP vows to keep up the economic pressure
until the Confederate battle flag is removed from the Statehouse
dome there.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowery and Brooks said they hoped a boycott would be a last
resort. Brooks said civil rights leaders have been meeting with
Georgia business leaders to discuss what could be done to change
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   One marcher, Atlanta educator John Michael, said Georgians have
tolerated the flag long enough. ``This is a despicable symbol of
not only racism but a refusal for politicians to make the law
work,'' he said. ``They know it was put on as a symbol of defiance
that should have been acted on long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Georgia legislators placed the Confederate battle
emblem on the state flag as an act of protest against school
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Most onlookers acknowledged the marchers with well wishes and
support. One man, however, taunted the marchers, saying he was a
son of the Confederacy.

LOSS OF LARRY BIG BLOW TO NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andre Larry was the Cal State Northridge men's
basketball player who probably benefited most last season when Rico
Harris walked away from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now Larry is gone. Through a phone call to coach Bobby Braswell
last week, he asked to leave the program.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a basketball decision.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said: ``I can't get into specifics, and the only thing
I can tell you is it is of a personal nature, and (Larry) asked us
to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Harris, who quit because he wasn't getting along with his
teammates and the coaches, Larry was one of the most popular
Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is still our boy,'' junior guard Carl Holmes said.
``He's not an outcast. Andre knows we're not going to turn our back
on him. You'll see him behind the bench next (home) game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry, a 6-foot-9 senior, surged last year when Harris quit. He
averaged 17.2 points in Northridge's last five games _ almost
double his season average (9.6).
</P>
<P>
   Larry was CSUN's second-leading scorer (13.9) when he quit, and
he had a combined 37 points in his last two games, including 21
against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he liked to shoot 3-pointers, Larry's absence means
the Matadors are going to become a guard-oriented team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're losing a big 6-9 guy who is your second-leading scorer
and he's grabbing a lot of rebounds for you every game,'' Braswell
said. ``We told Marco (McCain) and Carl, Denny Ogden and Lionel
Benjamin, those four guys have to come up with between 15 and 18
rebounds a game if they can. Some of these guys are now going to
have an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   One Matador who is challenging himself is junior center Brian
Heinle, the team's leading scorer at 16 per game. Heinle, who is
6-9 but only 225 pounds, says he needs to become more forceful
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be up to me to step up and pick up the slack,''
Heinle said. ``It's a big loss for us. (Larry) is a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry, 22, is majoring in Pan-African studies at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing with Andre for three years,'' Heinle said.
``It's going to be tough. It was a surprise to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive sign: An ambitious fund-raising project undertaken by
CSUN's development office _ called ``Northridge Rising'' _ may
ultimately benefit Northridge's football program, according to
coach Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, who signed a four-year contract in December to become
CSUN's fourth football coach in the last six years, said he's been
told the success of Northridge Rising which has already raised $5
million could lead to efforts to raise money for an on-campus
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquated North Campus Stadium is scheduled for demolition in
the summer of 2001 to make way for the second phase of a
bio-technology office park.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Interim president Louane Kennedy) has said the next priority
for her ... will be the stadium,'' Kearin said. ``She has given the
green light to go ahead and start raising money to build a stadium.
From that office, that's the biggest commitment I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be wishful thinking on Kearin's part, however. Athletic
director Dick Dull, who reports directly to Kennedy, said he hasn't
heard Northridge Rising mentioned in the same breath as athletic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe (Northridge Rising) is designed toward
benefiting athletics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, no one asked, but ``CSUN Rising'' has a better ring
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Adding talent: The football team is close to getting a top
transfer in Ramsey Venner, who was a promising defensive lineman at
Fresno State last season before he quit the team.
</P>
<P>
   Venner, a 6-foot-6 freshman who also was a walk-on to the
Bulldogs' basketball team, was at Northridge's home game against
Montana on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the airwaves: The sudden appearance of CSUN men's and
women's road basketball games on campus-based KCSN-FM is going to
cost the athletic department $15,000 for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Finney, CSUN's assistant athletic director in charge of
sports information, said the decision to broadcasts the games was
made at the top, by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president stepped up and approved it,'' Finney said. ``She
OK'd the expenditure.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's football road games were carried by KCSN last
season, but the basketball programs haven't been on radio for at
least four years because of the athletic department's shrinking
budget.

 &HT;    Pass-happy Rams stifle Titans' last gasp
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<P>
   ATLANTA _ All week, the city was criticized for its chilly
weather. But when the smoke cleared at the Georgia Dome on Sunday,
Atlanta had played host to the most exciting Super Bowl in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams won the game 23-16, when Titans receiver Kevin Dyson
was pulled down at the 1-yard line as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by a touchdown with less than two minutes remaining,
the Titans started the game's final drive at their 12. But
much-maligned quarterback Steve McNair led a meticulous two-minute
drive, getting his team to the Rams' 27 with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-5, McNair was flushed from the pocket and nearly
tackled by defensive ends Jay Williams and Kevin Carter for an
apparent 11-yard loss. But McNair broke their tackles and planted
his left hand on the artificial turf to maintain his balance before
firing a 17-yard completion to Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans took their final timeout with six seconds left to set
up the final play. Dyson, lined up wide on the right side, went in
motion toward the middle of the field, then broke back.
</P>
<P>
   When McNair took the snap, Dyson ran a slant toward the middle
of the field. He caught McNair's pass near the 5, but couldn't
break linebacker Mike Jones' tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The play stunned much of the crowd of 72,625, who hopefully saw
the play through a cloud of smoke left behind by pregame and
halftime fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, the former Arena League star who was stocking groceries
in Iowa only five years ago, broke a Super Bowl record with 414
passing yards and was named the game's MVP. Warner completed 24 of
45 attempts with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner was largely shut down in the second half. After the
Titans tied the score at 16 with 2:12 remaining, the Rams' big-play
offense finally struck.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the Rams' final drive, Warner threw a
73-yard touchdown to receiver Isaac Bruce for a 23-16 lead with
1:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, working against cornerback Denard Walker down the right
sideline, came back for an underthrown pass and broke Walker's
tackle before bursting into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the play earlier,'' Warner said. ``Isaac came back
and said he could beat (Walker). Isaac's our go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce had six catches for 162 yards, the third-highest total in
the game's history. Rams receiver Torry Holt, a rookie from N.C.
State, had seven receptions for 109 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed the game was heading into overtime for the
first time in history. After trailing 16-0, the Titans tied the
score on Al Del Greco's 43-yard field goal with 2:12 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had trimmed St. Louis' lead to three points with 7:21
left. In a drive that took more than seven minutes, McNair threw a
cross-field screen pass to tight end Jackie Harris, who gained 21
yards to the Rams' 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, running back Eddie George ran around left
tackle and pushed defensive tackle Jeff Zgonina across the goal
line. Al Del Greco's extra point cut the Rams' lead to 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 16-0, the Titans got back into the game. After McNair
broke loose for a 23-yard run to the Rams' 2, Eddie George scored
on a 1-yard run. The Titans tried a two-point conversion, but
McNair's pass was incomplete, leaving the Rams a 16-6 lead with 14
seconds left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who scored the third-highest point total in league
history in 1999, became the first team in Super Bowl history to
fail to score on its first five trips inside an opponent's 20-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   But they finally broke through on their first drive of the
second half. Facing third-and-goal at the Titans' 9, Warner, who
missed his first 12 pass attempts in the red zone, fired a 9-yard
touchdown pass to Holt. Jeff Wilkins' point-after gave the Rams a
16-0 lead with 7:20 remaining in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams moved inside the 20-yard line five times in the first
half, but came away with nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who has been bothered by patella tendinitis in his
left, nonkicking knee for more than two months, kicked three field
goals, missed one and had another thwarted by a muffed snap.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed field goals on their opening drives. The Rams
finally took a 3-0 lead on Wilkins' 27-yarder with three minutes
left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who was nearly replaced with 43-year-old Nick Lowery
twice in the postseason, missed a 34-yarder wide right on the third
play of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins later kicked field goals of 29 and 28 yards, giving the
Rams a 9-0 lead at halftime.

   With football out of the way, we can finally concentrate on a
real sport _ yachting. This isn't just any three-hour cruise. If
AmericaOne doesn't get its sails together and go nautical on the
Italian vessel Prada, which is already up 3-1, then the America's
Cup will be challenged by two foreign boats. And what sense does
that make? America's Cup semifinals, Race 5: AmericaOne vs. Prada,
ESPN2, 9:30 p.m. (tape delayed). Also: Tuesday at 9:30 p.m.,
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8:30 p.m.

   Here's what we know about Zimbabwe: It's summer right now in
this Southeast Africa country, the exchange rate is pretty
favorable ($1 U.S. to $12 of theirs), and Pete Sampras has no
desire to visit. Lucky for him, he was able to escape this Davis
Cup/National Geographic safari because of a hip injury he suffered
during his semifinal loss to Andre Agassi in the Australian Open.
``To tell the truth, I don't think Pete really wanted to make the
trip in the first place,'' said U.S. captain John McEnroe. ``Would
he have been with the team if he'd won that fourth-set tiebreaker
against Agassi?'' Depends on what would have happened in the
finals, right? Davis Cup opening singles matches: U.S. at Zimbabwe,
ESPN2, 9 a.m. (tape delayed). Also: ESPN2 has the doubles match
Saturday at 7 a.m. and the two reverse singles matches Sunday at
10:30 a.m.

   Tiger Woods has some win streak going what is it, zero-in-a-row
at Pebble Beach when Bill Murray gets a bigger gallery than he
does? Murray apparently won't be at the clambake this year, so the
annual celebrity-mugs-for-TV day of the four-round tournament might
now allow Tiger to lay low. This is an important tournament they'll
be back in June to play the 2000 U.S. Open here, when the weather's
more agreeable. Golf: AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, third round,
Channel 2, noon. (Also: USA Network has the first two rounds
Thursday and Friday at 3 p.m. on tape; CBS has first and
second-round highlight shows Thursday and Friday at 12:35 a.m. CBS
has the final round Sunday at noon.) SUNDAY

   The No-Hits-Allowed All-Star Sunday starts in Toronto with that
goalie-be-gone North America vs. The World hockey matchup, where
even the fans aren't completely sure why some guys are on one team
and not on another. Our guess is North America's team, which
includes the Kings' Rob Blake, will get most of its players from
Canada and the U.S.; don't expect any help from Mexico. Later, it's
off to Hawaii, where tackling is optional. NHL All-Star Game,
Channel 7, 11:30 a.m.; NFL's Pro Bowl, Channel 7, 2:30 p.m.
