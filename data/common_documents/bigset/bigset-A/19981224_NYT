OMBUDSMAN CALLS FOR CHANGES IN ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A review of the state's actions in the Wenatchee child
sex-abuse cases has found enough questions and problems that an
independent ombudsman is calling for changes in the way social
workers and police investigate such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Better training, tighter supervision and new laws are needed to
prevent investigators from making the kinds of mistakes that are
alleged to have happened in Wenatchee, said Vickie Wallen,
ombudsman for the state's Office of Family and Children.
</P>
<P>
   She issued a 61-page report Wednesday after a seven-month
investigation of Child Protective Services' handling of child-rape
and molestation allegations in 1994 and 1995 that involved more
than 80 adults and at least 55 children. Ultimately, 43 people were
charged. Of those convicted of crimes involving sexual abuse
against children, several have been freed after their sentences
were overturned on appeal. Appellate judges often have criticized
the quality of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Wallen's carefully worded report paints a vivid picture of
children being pressured by social workers and police into accusing
their parents and neighbors of rape and molestation.
</P>
<P>
   But CPS so poorly documented its work that it was ``impossible
to determine what actually happened in these cases,'' Wallen said.
Available documents do show hundreds of investigatory errors and
examples of incorrect or inappropriate professional judgment, she
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the examples of investigative error cited in the report
were first reported by the Post-Intelligencer in February.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he had not seen the report when it was
released early Wednesday, Gov. Gary Locke said he was directing the
Department of Social and Health Services ``to review and respond to
the ombudsman's recommendations, which in part are consistent with
the directions the department already has been pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Oreskovich, assistant secretary for the Children's
Administration, which includes CPS, said she was pleased by the
report, saying it ``confirms that there were no findings against''
the CPS staff in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Wallen agreed the report does not establish clear-cut violations
of law or policy but said it ``neither vindicates nor condemns any
of the families of the children allegedly abused, nor CPS
investigators involved in the Wenatchee cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Wallen notes that Oreskovich earlier this year
ordered a ``comprehensive, internal record review of the Wenatchee
cases'' that reportedly found no significant problems. The
ombudsman, who examined the same records, questioned that finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to determine how the department could
meaningfully assess the Wenatchee cases without knowing more about
what occurred in the child interviews,'' the report reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``CPS' investigative process was not documented well enough to
allow our staff to ascertain whether investigative mistakes
occurred that led to errors in the accuracy of how the
investigators were understanding what the children were actually
saying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot hold the system accountable without knowing more
about what happened,'' Wallen said.
</P>
<P>
   What her investigators did find was troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CPS and police records document hundreds of clear and
significant errors dealing with the leading and suggestive
questioning of the children,'' Wallen said. ``There was an obvious
existence of the preconceived notion by CPS and police that the
kids were abused.''
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the investigations, the ombudsman expressed
particular concern about the manner in which children were
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interviews of Wenatchee children were never documented in a
format that indicated exactly what questions were asked, by whom
and what the answers were.''
</P>
<P>
   While using only pseuedonyms for the victims and the police, the
report faults the use of leading and suggestive questioning,
particularly by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Several examples were cited where children denied they had been
abused and were told by police and social workers that their
parents had already confessed, or siblings were counting on them to
tell the truth, or that the investigators knew they were lying.
</P>
<P>
   The report also questions actions of state-contracted mental
health therapists. For example, several children who repeatedly
denied they had been abused were diagnosed by the appointed
therapists as having post-traumatic stress disorder or
disassociation.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a review of the records, the ombudsman ``is concerned
whether these diagnoses were clinically appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the report questioned the conflicting roles of the
Wenatchee therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the mental health service providers to the
Wenatchee children were sometimes confused about their roles in
working with child abuse victims,'' Wallen said. ``The record
clearly indicates that some treating therapists were more focused
on investigating the allegations than on the therapy they were
contracted to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallen said it is possible the abuse occurred as alleged, or
that something went wrong in the child abuse investigative system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we will never know for sure which of those
possibilities are true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those expected to address problems cited by Wallen include state
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeanine Long, R-Mill Creek, chairwoman of the Senate Human
Services and Corrections Committee, called the CPS investigator's
common practice of destroying notes taken during interviews, as
described in Wallen's report, to be ``appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will likely be a bill that will require that written
notes be retained,'' introduced in the upcoming legislative
session, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Long also called for not only better general training of all CPS
workers but the establishment of a group of people ``very specially
trained'' to be brought into cases where child sexual abuse is
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a big concern about what it would cost,'' Long
said, ``but add up what Wenatchee has cost and it would be
phenomenal, and that's just the monetary costs, not the emotional
costs.''

<P>
   How earnest and public-minded it sounded when tobacco company
executives warned early this year that the attempt to jack up
cigarette prices through the pending national tobacco bill would
inevitably lead to smuggling and a black market. No less than
Steven Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco,
warned that it was virtually impossible to stop a determined batch
of smugglers, given that 14 million cigarettes can fit into a
single truck. Goldstone called it ``irresponsible'' to ignore the
smuggling that neighboring countries had experienced when they
raised cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it turns out that Goldstone was assuredly right about
the dangers of smuggling. The only problem was, he pointed his
finger in the wrong direction. This week a marketing subsidiary of
his own company pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid $15
million for actions that enabled others to smuggle cigarettes into
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was hatched after the Canadian government raised
tobacco taxes in an effort to cut smoking. Those taxes applied only
to cigarettes sold in the Canadian market, not to exports. So
cigarettes were shipped from a Reynolds plant in Canada to the
United States, avoiding the Canadian levies. The guilty Reynolds
subsidiary aided the filing of false statements by distributors
that the cigarettes were to be shipped on to Russia and Estonia, a
maneuver that exempted them from American taxes as well. In
reality, the cigarettes were diverted into New York and ultimately
back to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary has admitted only to customs violations, not
smuggling. But in truth, says U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Maroney, the
subsidiary knew that the cigarettes were destined to be smuggled
back into Canada, in this case through an Indian reservation in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco says it ``very much regrets'' the episode and calls
its subsidiary's actions ``inconsistent with the way Reynolds does
business.'' It has closed the subsidiary and is taking steps to
prevent a recurrence. But the apologies seem a bit late. The
tobacco industry has long been accused of looking the other way
when it comes to smuggling. Now we know it is even worse. The shame
of this episode is that a subsidiary of America's second-largest
tobacco company actually helped the criminals.

The end is near.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   If no significant progress is made toward a new
collective-bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the National
Basketball Players Association by Jan. 7, commissioner David Stern
will recommend canceling the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   The league has a Board of Governors meeting scheduled that day
and will hear a report from the owners' negotiating committee on
how the labor talks with the union are progressing.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said that should he and
Stern think the two sides are making sufficient progress toward an
agreement, then negotiations probably will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on where we are,'' Granik said Wednesday, Day 176
of the lockout. ``We will get a report from the labor-relations
committee, and if the report is that we're not close (to an
agreement) and don't expect to have a deal, they will likely have
to vote on canceling the season, and David and I will recommend it
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said there are members of the Board of Governors who
think the season already should have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several (who feel that way),'' he said. ``But I
think that in the end, if there's a fair deal by that date, they'll
go with the rest of the group (and allow the season to go on).''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Arn Tellem, who represents Reggie Miller and Kobe Bryant,
among others, thinks cancellation might be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my view that if the owners are unwilling to move from
their current proposal, the season will then be canceled,'' Tellem
said. ``I believe that ultimately when the players analyze this,
there is no way they will ever take the deal on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the season be canceled, it would be the first time a
major professional sports league in North America lost an entire
season for any reason. Major-league baseball has had eight work
stoppages since 1972, including a 232-day strike that wiped out the
1994 World Series, but it never has lost an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is inching closer to just that.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter is in Oakland, Calif., for
Christmas; Stern is vacationing in Aspen, Colo., so no negotiations
are scheduled in the near future. But Granik said he expects there
will be at least one formal meeting between the negotiating
committees before Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll have a meeting or meetings (with the union)
before then,'' Granik said. ``I can't believe we'd let it evaporate
without one or two (meetings). But there's no reason to think
they'll end any differently than the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some close to the union question Stern's decision to take off
for the ski slopes rather than sit down and negotiate, as the
league teeters on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our whole negotiating committee in New York this past
weekend,'' said one union source. ``We met with everybody Monday,
so if they (the owners) wanted to meet, they knew where we were.
They knew, but they chose to do what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whispers that the union's rank and file might demand
a secret ballot on the owners' latest proposal, mailed last week by
Stern to every NBA player, continue to circulate. Karl Malone
started the ball rolling by saying Saturday that the proposal was
``fair'' and needed only minor changes to be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Other players have joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mitchell, Minnesota's player representative, said: ``If
there is to be a cancellation of the season, every guy should see
those numbers (in Stern's letter) and make their decision. But
we're crazy if we don't play this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rocket Kevin Willis said, ``The majority would vote for
the owners' latest proposal just to start playing ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hakeem Olajuwon disagreed with the notion of a secret
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``I think if that was the case,
that should have been done in the beginning. Now, we've got to
finish it. We've got to stick with (union leaders). This is what
the owners are banking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what he (Willis) is saying. It's a difference of
opinion. It's nothing against him. We need to stick together. It
(appears to be) a good idea, but when you look over all the
particulars, it's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Many disagree with Olajuwon's opinion. Some close to the
negotiations are saying a secret ballot by the union would pass the
new proposal by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be 2-1 in favor of signing,'' said one agent.
``It might be 70-30 in favor of the owners' proposal, but some
people think I'm being optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said he has heard all the talk about strong union support
for the proposal should there be a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a number of people have told me that,'' he said. ``But
again, Billy (Hunter) has said that he will not put it up for a
vote or anything like that. Obviously, the NBA doesn't have a right
to demand a vote, so it has to come from the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can understand and expect some players, perhaps a
lot of players, would like to make a deal. But the reality from our
end is that we have to deal with union leadership, so until
something changes on the part of leadership, it (support from
players) doesn't make a difference to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders dispute all the talk about the possibility of
players lobbying for a secret vote on the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing about all these players who want a vote,'' one
source said. ``The papers are writing that this player or that
player or several players want this secret vote, but then when we
talk to them we hear, `Oh, that's not what I said.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'm sure if there was a majority of guys who
wanted to vote on this deal, it would be voted on. But until that
happens, it (a secret ballot) is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough contact with every guy in the league to know
where they stand.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the stalled negotiations and rampant rumors of union
rumblings, Olajuwon said a different approach might be needed to
save the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need an arbitrator,'' he said. ``That's why we have
judges. There should be a middle ground. Both parties should work
to be fair. It should go to an arbitrator to decide on what's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in a deal that is fair; you don't have to get
everything you want. Now, we're playing a losing game, the owners
and the players. That's doesn't benefit anything. You don't want to
get in a game of who can lose the most. That's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the business to lose money. It's said the owners
can afford to lose it more. I don't agree. They're not in the
business to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has requested mediation on several occasions, only to
be turned down by the NBA. Jesse Jackson has volunteered his
services in an effort to break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to help,'' Jackson said. ``I want to see these
players back on the court again. I think it would be a great thing
to, between now and New Year's, get these players back to work
again.''

SPECTACULAR 67-MILE CHASE ENDS WITH SHOOTING OF TRUCKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ga.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSTADT, N.J. _ In an intense barrage of gunfire, New Jersey
state troopers shot and critically wounded a truck driver Wednesday
after he led them on a 67-mile chase on the New Jersey Turnpike and
then drove into seven police vehicles trying to block him at a toll
gate here, state police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, identified as Andre Battle, 28, of Atlanta, was shot
at least three times in the neck and chest and was reported to be
in critical condition Wednesday night after three hours of surgery
at the Hackensack University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   A state trooper, Matthew Finnegan, 33, was shot twice in the
left foot, either by himself or another trooper shooting at the
truck, said Col. Carl Williams, superintendent of state police.
Finnegan was reported in satisfactory condition at University
Hospital in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The chase and shooting tied up traffic on the turnpike for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the entire incident began with a routine stop for
a traffic violation in Springfield Township in southern New Jersey
about 9:25 a.m. Trooper Anthony Duckett ``clocked'' Battle
traveling north at 73 mph in the outside lane and pulled him over,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle got out of his vehicle, talked briefly with Duckett and
then went to the truck to get his license and registration,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   When Battle did not leave the cab, the trooper walked over and
told him to come out, according to Williams. Instead, Battle opened
the door and kicked the trooper in the head, knocking him onto the
roadway, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to Williams' account, Duckett went to his patrol
car to summon help as Battle drove off.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, several other state police vehicles converged on the
truck as it headed north. The big rig and state police cars reached
the toll plaza here shortly before 10:30 a.m. Almost immediately,
Battle was caught in the lines of motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Battle was shot after he ignored a detective's order to stop his
truck and then crashed it into the vehicles, one after another,
that troopers had arrayed to prevent Battle from making a U-turn at
the plaza and escaping, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle managed to get the truck turned around. But he drove it
only about 200 yards from the plaza before the hail of bullets
stopped him. Williams said state police investigators had not
established late Wednesday afternoon how many troopers shot at the
truck or how many bullets were fired.
</P>
<P>
   But the windows of both front doors of the gleaming white
18-wheel rig were blown out and the windshield was pockmarked by at
least five bullet holes. An unmarked beige state police van that
Battle drove into was also hit by several bullets. Williams said it
was still unclear who fired at the van.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and the state's attorney general, Peter
Verniero, attended the news conference with Williams to praise the
performance of the troopers. Whitman said a ``great number'' of
motorists could have been injured if Battle had managed to drive
the truck from the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly the season of miracles,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero, New Jersey's chief law enforcement official, said he
had ordered a comprehensive investigation of the incident,
including the gunfire by the troopers. He said that newly installed
video cameras in some of the patrol cars had recorded much, but not
all, of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But, he emphasized, he was satisfied that the troopers had not
violated his office's guidelines on the use of deadly force by
police. ``One thing is very clear, and that is there could have
been a great tragedy on the turnpike today that was avoided because
of good police work, because of good training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The burst of gunfire at the toll plaza brought a chaotic end to
what officials described as a harrowing hourlong chase at speeds
ranging from 25 to 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At times, as many as nine state police cars, sirens screaming
and rooftop lights flashing, were involved in both trying to stop
Battle and to prevent any crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said some of the cars raced ahead of the truck,
ordering motorists to stay to the right so a lane would be clear.
Other state police vehicles created roadblocks at entrance ramps to
the turnpike's northbound lanes, while others stayed abreast of the
truck and still others followed it.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the chase, troopers issued orders to stop
over the loudspeakers in their cars, Williams said. All were
ignored, he said. At times, Williams said, Battle swerved his rig
toward police cars in the adjacent lane.
</P>
<P>
   Several motorists were waiting to pay tolls at the plaza when
the phalanx of trooper vehicles and the 18-wheeler arrived and
Battle tried to reverse his direction, touching off the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   One man caught up in the turmoil called WCBS News Radio 88 in
Manhattan, describing a wild scene as terrified motorists scurried
to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were diving out of their cars,'' the man told the
station. ``They were running to the side of the road. They didn't
want to get caught in the crossfire. There was shooting all over
the place. It was just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Williams said it was unclear whether
Battle was armed or whether he had fired at the troopers either
during the chase or at the toll plaza. By late afternoon, he said,
state police had not obtained a search warrant to inspect the cab
of the truck thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   The chase and shooting forced the New Jersey Turnpike Authority
to close the western leg of the turnpike between Exit 14, near
Newark International Airport, and the toll plaza at 11:14 a.m. This
created major traffic snarls throughout the afternoon and early
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The western leg's northbound lanes were reopened shortly after 7
p.m. The southbound lanes on the western leg, from the toll plaza
to Exit 16W, about five miles south, remained closed throughout the
evening as investigators continued studying the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The rig is owned by Salson Logistics, a trucking company based
in McDonough, Ga. Officials there said Battle was a part-time
driver with both good performance and driving records.

L.A. FIRST-GRADERS LAUGH WITH LENO AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Like old troupers relishing their encore, the
kids from Sandy Toth's first-grade class at Balboa Magnet
Elementary School in suburban Northridge zipped through their licks
like pros Wednesday on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-graders who performed a skit and sang on the show on
Thanksgiving eve were back on stage with Leno on Wednesday with a
Christmas act and song as part of a lineup that included actress
Roma Downey and the Rockettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said Marisa Rader, 6, an aspiring movie star who
dismissed any notion of stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was on the show, I was really nervous. I'm not
nervous at all now. You don't have to be. It's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Two appearances on the nation's top-ranked late night network
talk show in less than a month? Not bad for a group of pint-size
stars who don't even have their Screen Actors Guild cards yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like they're veterans now,'' said music teacher
Mandy Brigham, who led the 16 squirming children through their
paces.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing colorful paper hats and equipped with musical
instruments, the children recited their lines and sang a song
called ``The Marvelous Toy.'' And when technicians had to adjust
cameras and sound, the children remained kneeling quietly -- or as
quietly as first-graders can.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I take this off?'' inquired one boy as he plucked at
the tiny microphone attached to his shirt collar.
</P>
<P>
   The only rehearsal mishap occurred when a boy's slide whistle --
integral to the song -- broke and had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting one because it wasn't loud enough, the prop
department finally found a whistle loud enough and easy enough for
a 6-year-old boy to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one we'll hear,'' the stage manager said approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie Ancel, segment producer for ``The Tonight Show,'' also
praised the children. ``That was great, you guys!''
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, students from Balboa Magnet have
appeared on the show, starting with a group of second-graders who
demonstrated their own inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Students from other campuses in Southern California's suburban
San Fernando Valley such as Riverside Elementary School in Sherman
Oaks and Thomas Jefferson School in Burbank also have appeared on
the program but ``Tonight Show'' producers said they've come to
rely on Balboa Magnet when they need tykes in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always come through and they happen to do really good
things,'' Ancel said. ``It's become a nice working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break in rehearsal, students got a chance to reflect on
their newfound fame.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing himself on television for the first time, Jakov
Peric decided he wants to stay out of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my family to tape the show,'' the 6-year-old
said. ``They show it to other people. Then I get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Willem Patterson, 6, said he was intrigued with his newfound
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. It's like you're inside the TV,'' said
Willem, who played Santa Claus in Wednesday's skit.
</P>
<P>
   The first-grader also noted the differences between staging a
school play and a television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more stuff -- more activity,'' Willem said, struggling
to describe the myriad stage managers, directors, producers and
camera technicians who were on hand before the taping to make sure
the show went smoothly. ``There's so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   And what's his advice for breaking into show business? He
couldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's `advice'? '' he asked.

   EURO-CITIZENS (The Chunnel, England-France) _ The year 1999 is
the official start-up date of the Euro, the common European
currency that will unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout
Europe, a different kind of integration has already taken root. A
new generation of Europeans _ mobile, fluent in several languages
and aggressively non-nationalistic _ are already living the kind of

year, Pacificare's nonvoting class B shares are up an impressive 49
percent. But some analysts and investors are not convinced that
Pacificare is quite as exceptional as it may appear. Others believe

persistence of this riot-proofing is a sign that retailers, like

   NEA-ROBBINS (Undated) _ After years under congressional siege _

who has said that he believes the endowment should be as important
as the Department of Defense, the NEA is marching, not slinking, to
the front lines in its support of the arts. On Tuesday, Ivey

a national treasure, like the tea ceremony. By Jessica Siegel.

rented an office (preferably ground floor) in a fancy location, put
some easels around the room, stuck up architects' renderings and
handed out embossed brochures _ and coffee. But now there's virtual
reality _ the catchall term for computer-generated videos that
mimic a visit to an existing or still-imagined building. It is
becoming part of a growing number of sales pitches. By Tracie
Rozhon.

   HOMEMADE-WINE (Minneapolis) _ Looking at a wish book from
Semplex of U.S.A., one of the country's leading specialty houses,
serving amateur winemakers since 1962, I spied a $154.25 trilevel
Steam Juice Extractor imported from Finland and used to crush
grapes painlessly and efficiently. I also noticed the $389 Buon
Vino Super Jet Filter, an Italian import capable of pumping 80
gallons of wine an hour. But no way was I buying any of it. My
family has its own claptrap tin wine press, which my uneducated
country-boy grandfather quixotically lugged across Europe and to
the United States three generations ago. By Neal Karlen.

UCLA STRUGGLES TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Schedule a game on Dec. 23 and this is what you
get: a sparse crowd, no noise and less atmosphere than Pluto. Even
Tyra Banks' presence behind the visitor's bench failed to inspire
the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Hold a series of grueling practices, including a game-day
workout, and this is what you get: sluggishness and sloppiness,
turnovers, bad shots and even worse defense.
</P>
<P>
   For those who ventured out two nights before Christmas, UCLA and
American delivered one of the most forgettable games at Pauley
Pavilion in years, a 66-56 Bruins victory in which UCLA's leading
scorer, Baron Davis, had a whopping 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Looking exhausted from consecutive three-hours practices, the
Bruins sputtered and stuttered all night _ edging to a double-digit
lead in the first half, snoozing through most of the second, then
repelling the 24-point underdogs in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Tyra left early.
</P>
<P>
   Only Davis gave the somnolent crowd reason to cheer. In one
fabulous sequence, Davis stole the ball, outran the Eagles and
converted a windmill dunk; then he grabbed a rebound, dribbled
downcourt and passed the ball off the backboard to himself for a
lay-in.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also made the game-clinching play, snatching a loose ball
and speeding 75 feet for a three-point play that gave UCLA a 57-48
lead with 2:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the starters contributed little except bad defense
(Jerome Moiso), bad shots (JaRon Rush) and turnovers (Earl Watson).
</P>
<P>
   Reserves Sean Farnham, Ray Young and Matt Barnes once again
played well, which was no surprise considering Farnham and Barnes
didn't practice Tuesday and had enough energy to combat American,
which lost to USC 74-59 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: This was American University-United States, not American
University-Puerto Rico, which recently forfeited a game against
Oklahoma because of fighting.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are now one victory (Loyola Marymount) from sweeping
December _ a development that will count most in March when the
NCAA Selection Committee reviews their win total. Unlike previous
seasons, when UCLA could count on 12-15 Pac-10 victories, the
combination of a young roster and rugged conference will make 10
wins a tough task.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, UCLA needs every nonconference win it can get,
and Wednesday night's was No.7.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also need all the practice they can get, and coach
Steve Lavin knows it. He conducted three-hour practices Monday and
Tuesday, then held a rare game-day workout Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the conference is coming up so soon... with a young
team, we need to have a crash course,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   He has two points of emphasis: transition defense and ball
movement. Assistant coach Steve Spencer, who scouts opponents,
always identifies the opponent's best 3-point shooters, but somehow
his instructions get lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives Spencer crazy,'' Lavin said. ``He's going to tell
them not to guard the 3-point shooters, and they'll probably guard
them. But that's within the realm of reasonable issues for a young
team at this point in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the ball movement dilemma. UCLA's offense functions best
when three things happen: the ball is passed inside to a big man,
back to the perimeter, then swung to the opposite side. The cycle
causes the defense to shift, which creates penetration lanes.
</P>
<P>
   While the coaches don't keep statistics on such matters, Lavin
says production improves dramatically when the ball moves inside
and outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense collapses like an accordion,'' he said. ``We just
have to make sure we don't settle for jump shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric did not play because of
tendinitis in his knees. His availability for next week is
undetermined. ``We want to use this seven-day stretch to get him
some rest,'' Lavin said.

DEVILS DEFEAT BLUES, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the world of the Devils, where
defense is often top banana, a hat trick is a rarity. There was
only one for New Jersey last season and none in the first 30 games
this season. Bobby Holik ended that spell on Wednesday night by
scoring the Devils' last three goals and leading them to a 4-2
victory over the St. Louis Blues at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Holik's hat trick gave him 15 goals for the season and helped
the Devils to their first victory in three games. Scott Niedermayer
scored the other goal for the Devils, who regained the top spot in
the Eastern Conference with a record of 19-8-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt more responsible how the team did tonight,'' said
Holik, who was made alternate captain for the game because the
captain Scott Stevens missed the game with back spasms. ``When
you're wearing the A, it's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko and Denis Pederson are the two regular alternate
captains.
</P>
<P>
   Holik has been playing noticeably better since his two-game
suspension by the league last month. During the ban, Holik took the
time to work with the assistant coach Slava Fetisov on his shot
release and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had almost a week to relax and practice hard with no
pressure of being ready for the game,'' Holik said. ``I just
regrouped myself. It may be a coincidence to the outsider but not
for me. I looked at the suspension as a time to get myself
together.''
</P>
<P>
   His three goals tonight gave him a total of 15, tops on the team
and five more than the next players, Petr Sykora and Dave
Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you step on the ice and you work hard, things
happen,'' Holik said. ``It's the result of hard work and effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third career hat trick for Holik and his first
since 1992. Holik, who had 29 goals last season, had no hat tricks
in Jacques Lemaire's five-year tenure as coach of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a few more,'' Sykora said. ``We have a lot of
guys who are capable to get a hat trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur played goal after missing practice with pain in
his ribs and improved his record to 15-7-4 with 23 saves. The only
Blues players to beat him were Pavol Demitra and Todd Gill, both in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens practiced the last two days and took part in the morning
skate before Wednesday night's game, but his back stiffened up
before the game and he was a late scratch, forcing him to miss his
first game this season. Stevens injured his back after being hit
with a shot by Montreal's Jason Dawes in Saturday's tie in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   With Stevens out, Coach Robbie Ftorek was forced to shuffle his
defensive pairings. Dean, who usually plays with Stevens, was
teamed with Lyle Odelein. The other defensive pairings were
Niedermayer with Brad Bombardir and Daneyko with Sheldon Souray.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer opened the scoring for the Devils with his third
goal of the season and it came the Devils' first manpower
advantage. Taking a pass from Patrik Elias, Niedermayer beat Grant
Fuhr 6 minutes 30 seconds after the opening face-off.
</P>
<P>
   After Demitra matched Niedermayer's goal and Gill brought the
Blues back following Holik's first goal of the night, Holik gave
the Devils the lead again at 3-2 with his second goal of the night,
8:09 into the second period. He completed his hat trick with 9:50
left in the third period, when he beat Fuhr with a rising shot from
the right circle.

   NEW YORK _ The New York Rangers' defensive woes of the previous
two games disappeared on Wednesday night after three days of hard
practices and a number of lineup changes. But there was no solution
for a lethargic offensive effort in a game that they let slip away.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rarely threatened until the final minutes in falling
quietly to the Carolina Hurricanes by 1-0 at Madison Square Garden.
It was the Rangers' fifth loss in their last six games, but perhaps
the most painful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This game was one the Rangers had pointed to as essential. They
start a four-game road trip after the two-day Christmas break. But
the improved effort was not enough to make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally the wrong way you want to go into any kind of
holidays, in this kind of mood,'' Ulf Samuelsson said. ``We've been
pumping ourselves up so much for this game. It meant so much, and
it sort of knocks the wind out of you. It's hard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The holiday might represent the Rangers' best chance to put this
behind them. Coach John Muckler had put the team through long
skates after two consecutive embarrassing performances last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you don't have a choice,'' goalie Mike Richter said.
``You have to put it behind you and go on. We didn't dwell on the
last two, and they were worse efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers surrendered 13 goals in their previous two games, a
6-3 loss at New Jersey and a 7-4 defeat at Toronto. Richter, who
had been playing sensationally before this recent struggle, was in
the net on Wednesday night for his 12th straight game, and from the
start this one was far different from the previous two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richter made four spectacular saves in the opening period,
almost singlehandedly squashing Carolina opportunities. In the
second period, he continued to excel, and the Rangers held an 18-16
advantage in shots through the first 40 minutes. But in the third
period, it took just 38 seconds for the shutout to be lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carolina right wing Ray Sheppard settled the puck along the
boards outside the right circle and, with a clear look at the net,
drilled a shot over Richter's right shoulder into the top of the
net on the near side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win, but it's not just a snap of the fingers
that's going to pull you out of a slump,'' Muckler said. ``There's
a lot of things that go through everybody's mind on your way to
getting out. The only way you're going to get out of a slump is
hard work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A scoreless tie through two periods may have been the last thing
either side expected after the Rangers' recent troubles. And the
Hurricanes had problems of their own. They took the ice with a
shortage of defensive help, playing without Steve Chiasson (back
spasms), Sean Hill (bruised ankle), Nolan Pratt (back spasms), and
Dave Karpa (knee surgery on Dec.2). Curtis Leschyshyn played
despite a bruised sternum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Carolina defense was hardly tested, and in the second
period, when the Hurricanes went on a power play, they played with
five forwards on the ice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who had converted 8 of their last 16 power-play
opportunities entering on Wednesday night, had two chances in the
first period but could not take advantage. When Carolina's Marek
Malik was whistled for interference at 9 minutes 29 seconds of the
first period, the Hurricanes nearly scored.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paul Ranheim made a run up the right side after the puck
skipped past Brian Leetch as he attempted to settle it with his
glove just outside the Hurricanes' zone, but Richter was able to
stop the shot. Then Keith Primeau skated past Petr Nedved for an
open shot at Richter from directly in front of the net. But Richter
again make the stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just 47 seconds after the Hurricanes defended that power play,
Carolina's Kent Manderville was sent off for boarding the Rangers'
Marc Savard. This time the Rangers had their chances, with Mathieu
Schneider blasting a shot from just inside the blue line that
goalie Arturs Irbe caught with his glove. Then, with six seconds
left in the man advantage, Niklas Sundstrom deflected a Nedved slap
shot in front, but Irbe again smothered the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play has been a good reason that our offense has
scored goals'' Leetch said. ``At some point, you need to get some
five-on-five conversions and tonight we got neither. It's a game
that we really had to win, wanted to win.'' &QL;

UCLA STRUGGLES TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Schedule a game on Dec. 23 and this is what you
get: a sparse crowd, an indifferent host and less atmosphere than
Pluto. Even Tyra Banks' presence failed to inspire the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Hold a series of grueling practices, including a game-day
workout, and this is what you get: sluggishness and sloppiness,
turnovers, bad shots and inept defense.
</P>
<P>
   For those who ventured out two nights before Christmas, UCLA and
American delivered one of the most forgettable games in memory, a
66-56 Bruins victory Wednesday before 7,442 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Looking exhausted from consecutive three-hours practices, the
No. 12 Bruins sputtered and stuttered all night _ edging to a
double-digit lead in the first half, snoozing through most of the
second, then repelling the 24-point underdogs in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor performances across the board,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin
said. ``If we were going to grade ourselves, I'd give us a failing
grade in every area.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Tyra left early.
</P>
<P>
   Only Baron Davis gave the somnolent crowd reason to cheer. In
one sequence, he stole the ball, outran the Eagles and converted a
windmill dunk; a few seconds later, he grabbed a rebound, dribbled
downcourt and passed the ball off the backboard to himself for a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also made the game-clinching play, snatching a loose ball
and speeding 75 feet for a three-point play that gave UCLA a 57-48
lead with 2:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the starters contributed little except for bad
defense (Jerome Moiso), bad shots (JaRon Rush) and turnovers (Earl
Watson). Playing without center Dan Gadzuric (tendinitis), the
Bruins were outrebounded 41-32, committed 17 turnovers and shot 57
percent from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't forget: Arizona visits in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys had probably already left the gym looking ahead
to getting home on the red-eyes,'' guard Rico Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Bruins are now one victory (Loyola Marymount)
from sweeping December _ a development that will count most in
March when the NCAA Selection Committee reviews their win total.
Unlike previous seasons, when UCLA could count on 12 to 15 Pac-10
victories, the combination of a young roster and a rugged
conference will make 10 wins a tough task.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, UCLA needs every nonconference win it can get,
and Wednesday night's was No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also need all the practice they can get, and Lavin
knows it. He conducted three-hour practices Monday and Tuesday that
left players gasping and dehydrated, then held a rare game-day
workout Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were a little tired,'' forward Sean Farnham said.
``We're ending school and we've had some long practices, but at the
same time those are not excuses. Our heads were on Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has two points of emphasis before conference play begins:
transition defense and ball movement. Assistant coach Steve Spencer
always identifies the opponent's best 3-point shooters, but somehow
his instructions get lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives Spencer crazy,'' Lavin said. ``He's going to tell
them not to guard the 3-point shooters, and they'll probably guard
them. But that's within the realm of reasonable issues for a young
team at this point in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the ball movement dilemma. UCLA's offense functions best
when three things happen: the ball is passed inside to a big man,
back to the perimeter, then swung to the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle causes the defense to shift, which creates penetration
lanes. While the coaches don't keep statistics on such matters,
Lavin says production improves dramatically when the ball moves
inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: The Bruins failed to do just that during an eight-minute
stretch in the second half when they scored just four points and
allowed American to rally. But they executed well in the final
minutes, scoring on five of six possessions to repel the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Lavin) would think they played like a top-10
team tonight,'' American coach Art Perry said.

AIR FORCE OUT TO SHOW WASHINGTON SIZE DOESN'T MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Does size matter?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it does _ if you're a surfer. Lifeguards had to pluck
three boardheads from the coral reefs this week on Oahu's North
Shore partly because of mammoth waves along the famous Banzai
Pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to college football, the word on Waikiki Beach
is that size does not matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what else would be expected to be heard from Air
Force Academy players?
</P>
<P>
   Little players, little school (4,100 cadets), smallish town,
lightweight conference. The Falcons have heard it all.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions their heart, courage and brains, of course. But
the snug cockpit of an F-16 fighter plane doesn't have room for the
massive body parts mandatory in football.
</P>
<P>
   So the natural expectation for Friday's inaugural Oahu Bowl is
that the Falcons will be tossed about by the Washington Huskies
much like reckless Pipeline surfers. The Falcons can hardly wait
for the Huskies to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they're all 6-5 and 300 pounds,'' defensive
tackle Bryce Fisher said defiantly. ``We go up against bigger guys
all year, and we won 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I want to make sure everybody knows is we do not
have lesser athletes at the Air Force Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher offered up his blunt assessment unsolicited, not
bothering to wait for obvious questions at a Falcons media briefing
at their hotel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded irked, and at 6-2 and 275 pounds, the Western
Athletic Conference's Mountain Division defensive player of the
year makes his case physically as well as orally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every press conference, we hear we should be just happy to be
playing Washington,'' he said, chin out. ``We should be in awe. But
we know we can play anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence (11-1 record, 16th-ranked in the AP poll, sixth
nationally in scoring defense, 14th in scoring offense, fourth in
turnover margin) is compelling. Air Force is easily the most
successful football program among the service academies, and this
season has produced the highest academy ranking in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it remains a WAC school that also played a soft
non-conference schedule (Wake Forest, Army, Navy) and, for the
league championship, beat a mediocre BYU team 20-13 that a mediocre
Washington team defeated 20-10 in September.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Falcons remain a viable diss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are guys that nobody expected much from,'' Fisher said.
``Air Force is always picked for the second division in the WAC,
and we are always having to prove ourselves to others.''
</P>
<P>
   No better individual example exists than Fisher, who finds some
extra passion in this game because he was dissed before he reached
Colorado Springs _ he was an all-league lineman at Seattle Prep who
was ignored by Husky recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   The Renton native attended the UW's summer camp and received the
standard ``Dear Student Athlete'' questionnaire form. But as a 6-1,
215-pounder, there was no visit, no interest, no shot for the big
time.
</P>
<P>
   For which he is now deeply grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gone to the UW, it would have been the biggest
mistake of my life,'' said Fisher, whose uncle, Levi, played
basketball for the UW in the 1970s, and brother, Roy, played hoops
at Cal. ``I never would have gotten a chance to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I could have done can compare to my experience at Air
Force. It's the only place where I've ever had fun in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun is not normally a word connected with the demands of the
academy, where there are no girlfriends to write papers, no booster
cash and definitely no pampering. But Fisher, a senior who is among
980 remaining in his class that began with 1,500 cadets, is one who
figured the rigors were worth the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' starting center, Brad Hutt, spent two years at Air
Force, then transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious it was not for me,'' he said. ``The strains
they put you under are tough. I mean, these guys every day put on
uniforms, then go into the service and bomb Iraq. I like things a
little more relaxed, where you wear what you want and can live in a
house instead of a barracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the view is a popular one among most Huskies, it is not
unanimous. Quarterback Brock Huard gave the academy a
consideration, but their option style of offense was no fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the ideas of respect, discipline and accountability at
the academy,'' he said. ``But I'm right where I'm supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be in the pocket, throwing deep.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, too, appears to be where he belongs, although it won't
be in a cockpit. The Air Force has many non-pilot jobs, and as a
business major, he is contemplating a service career in contracting
or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has some football business to clear up. Fisher and his
teammates were humiliated in last year's Las Vegas Bowl by Oregon,
41-13, making for three straight postseason defeats as well as more
ammo for academy-football bashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're practicing a lot harder this time, even during finals,''
he said. ``Oregon really put it to us, so we want to show last year
was a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough for the Huskies that the little guys don't like to be
told no. Now they've been embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   And there's just so much sand here to kick in the face of a
bully.

BRUINS GIVE IN TO FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They are viewed as the creme de la creme of the
National Hockey League. The Philadelphia Flyers have size, speed,
scoring ability, depth, and _ finally, some would say _ the
goaltending necessary to win a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night in front of a sellout crowd at the FleetCenter,
the Bruins threw a great many things at the Flyers, including
another stellar performance from goalie Byron Dafoe, but
Philadelphia nonetheless won the game, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended the Bruins' winning streak at three games. The
Flyers extended their unbeaten skein to six games (3-0-3).
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Bruins stood up to the Flyers, their coach felt
they gave up too much. ``You want to try to let their defense play
the game, not their forwards,'' said Pat Burns. ``We kept on giving
the puck to the forwards all night long. The game plan was to put
the puck in behind the defense and let them carry the play up. We
tried to make plays coming out of our own end a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Burns didn't appreciate the efforts of his
players. ``We worked hard and tried hard _ I'm not saying it was an
all-around poor performance _ but you can't give Eric Lindros, John
LeClair, or Rod Brind'Amour the puck,'' he said. ``You can't do
that, because you're not going to win. Our guys had trouble
handling those big guys, especially around the net.''
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't for Dafoe (30 saves), said Burns, the loss could
have looked a whole lot worse. ``He saved us _ that's probably why
I'm not too excited about the score,'' said the coach. ``Byron
saved us quite a few times. The score could've been a lot more
lopsided than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers took more than five minutes to put their first shot
on Dafoe, but they scored on their second. On the play, LeClair
started behind the net, skated in front to Dafoe's right, and
roofed a shot from the lower edge of the left circle. It flew in
and out of the net so fast that referee Stephen Walkom waved it off
though the goal judge had flipped on the light. Video replay showed
that LeClair's shot had made it into the net, however, and the
Flyers were up, 1-0, at 6:49 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable shot,'' said Dafoe. ``That's why that
guy gets 50 goals every year.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dafoe was keeping his team in the game, second-year center
Joe Thornton was turning in his best performance of the season. He
was physical, he was involved, and he was all over the Philly end.
</P>
<P>
   At 14:50 of the first, Thornton had a good scoring chance when
he beat defenseman Luke Richardson down the right circle and tried
a forehander from the doorstep, but goalie John Vanbiesbrouck
quashed it.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton found the net early in the second. At the start of the
period, the Bruins came out strong and played the Flyers even, and
six seconds after a Boston power play expired, Thornton made it 1-1
at 16:10.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Steve Heinze skated out of the right corner and
wristed a backhand shot from the right circle that Vanbiesbrouck
stopped. The puck bounced, and after defenseman Dan McGillis tried
to bat it away and missed, Thornton, parked in the crease, whacked
at it twice. His second attempt went under the goalie for his
fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could have had another soon afterward as Jason
Allison set up Kyle McLaren. But McLaren, who had two goals Monday
night against Tampa, was surprised by the pass and couldn't get off
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied going into the third period, and the Flyers
tallied the winner at 6:51 when Eric Desjardins found the net with
a little help from Lindros and LeClair. It was LeClair's perfect
pass from the left-wing boards to Desjardins going down the slot
that enabled the defenseman to lure Dafoe out of the cage and slip
a backhander by him for the 2-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't read that rush very well,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said it was a well-executed three-on-two. ``Desjardins
jumped in from the red line, and they made a great play over to
him,'' said Dafoe. ``I came across hoping he'd go wide, but he made
a nice move cutting in and I got my pad on his leg but I missed the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   The homestand over at 3-1-0, the Bruins now head out onto the
road for four games.

FATHER OF OCTUPLETS ACCUSED OF ASSAULT ON DAY BABIES NAMED 

</HEADLINE>

and LISA TEACHEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The father of the first known set of surviving
octuplets is scheduled to be tried in February on a charge of
assaulting his 63-year-old mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The charge became public on the same day that the Nigerian-born
couple named the eight babies, formerly known as babies A through
H.
</P>
<P>
   Iyke Paul Louis Jr., 41, also known as Iyke Louis Udobi, was
charged Sept. 22 with misdemeanor assault for attacking Janet
Chukwu, according to court documents and police reports. Louis, a
respiratory therapist, is accused of striking and biting his
mother-in-law and hitting her with a chair.
</P>
<P>
   The case is set for trial Feb. 8. The charge is a Class A
misdemeanor punishable by a $4,000 fine and up to a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Louis' attorney, Rick Castleberry, had only a brief statement:
``Iyke is completely innocent of what he's been charged with.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wednesday, her parents, now U.S. citizens, announced
the names they have chosen for the infants.
</P>
<P>
   The names reflect the faith and heritage of the babies' parents,
and perhaps the infants' fragile state. Formerly known as baby E,
the tiniest girl, who weighed 10.3 ounces at birth, has been named
Chijindu Chidera, which means ``God has my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of pure oxygen the girl, nicknamed Odera, has been
receiving was reduced to 80 percent Wednesday, down from 100
percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of small, steady progress we hope for in the
NICU,'' said Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas
Children's. ``However, with babies this premature and this small,
the pendulum can swing the other way and back again in a matter of
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said pure oxygen is given when the body can't get enough
oxygen on its own through ordinary air, possibly because of a
problem with blood flow to the lungs. Premature infants frequently
have heart and lung problems.
</P>
<P>
   The other newborns remained in critical but stable condition in
the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. The mother, who had
surgery to correct abdominal bleeding Monday, continues to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the names of the seven others, one delivered naturally
Dec. 8, and the rest born Dec. 20. All have the last name Louis.
</P>
<P>
   _ The girl born Dec. 8, formerly known as Baby A, has been named
Chukwuebuka Nkemjika, which means ``God is great.'' Nickname:
``Ebuka.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The first child born Dec. 20, a girl previously known as Baby
B, has been named Chidinma Anulika, which means ``God is
beautiful.'' Nickname: ``Chidi.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby C, a girl, has been named Chinecherem Nwabugwu, which
means ``God thinks of me.'' Nickname: ``Echerem.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby D, a girl, has been named Chimaijem Otito, which means
``God knows my way.'' Nickname: ``Chima.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby F, a boy, has been named Chukwubuikem Mduabuchi, which
means ``God is my strength.'' Nickname: ``Ikem.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby G, a boy, has been named Chijioke Chinedum, which means
``God is my leader.'' Nickname: ``Jioke.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby H, a girl, has been named Chinagorum Chidiebere, which
means ``God is merciful.'' Nickname: ``Gorom.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has declined to talk to reporters, but Chido Nwangu,
a Houstonian who publishes USAfrica Online and is in contact with
the family, said Louis asked him to relay this comment about the
assault charge:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an allegation. It has not been proven and pushing that
allegation in the middle of the effort by Africans and Americans
... while they are welcoming his children, did not seem charitable
at all to him.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Prosecutor Danny Dexter declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to Houston police arrest records, Louis was arrested
in the early hours of Sept. 22 after officers were called to his
southwest Houston home about 11:25 p.m. CST Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Officers said Louis assaulted Chukwu, who lived with Louis and
his then-pregnant wife, Nkem Chukwu, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Louis told officers he and his wife were arguing when she began
to follow him around the home nagging and pinching him. Janet
Chukwu became involved in the argument, he said, and began hitting
and biting him. Louis told officers he defended himself by hitting
and biting her, then hitting her with a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Chukwu told officers a different story.
</P>
<P>
   She said the three were sitting in the living room about 10:30
p.m. when Louis told her he was going to break his wife's hands and
kick her in the back. When Janet Chukwu told her pregnant daughter
to get away, Louis became angry. Janet Chukwu said he jumped over
the couch, cracked a chair over her head and began to beat and bite
her.
</P>
<P>
   Louis posted a $1,500 bail Sept. 29 and was released.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hay of Harris County Children's Protective Services said,
``The potential is there for CPS to do some sort of investigation,
but nothing has been discussed. No report's been made. I looked,
and there's no history (of previous incidents).''
</P>
<P>
   She said a domestic violence arrest is enough to justify an
evaluation of a home but said in this case there is plenty of time
before the babies leave the hospital to assess the situation.

THORNTON FLEXES HIS MUSCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Long before he scored his fourth goal of the season to
temporarily tie Wednesday night's game against the Flyers, center
Joe Thornton had already caught the eye of Bruins coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that alley back (of the bench), you can see who's going and
who's not in the first five or 10 shifts of the game,'' said Burns
after his team's 2-1 loss. ``And Joe was on his game tonight. He
wanted to play, and he got the ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid. If you're going to play like that, you're
going to play a lot. And if you're not going to play like that,
you're not going to play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Thornton's conversion of a Steve Heinze rebound
late in the second period that made the night for the 19-year-old
selected first in the 1997 entry draft. There were a pair of bursts
around the Flyers defense early on, which caused traffic jams
around the net. And there were his impressive displays of puck
control down low, when Thornton used his size and strength to keep
the puck in the Bruins' possession.
</P>
<P>
   All that and a few body checks.
</P>
<P>
   One game doesn't a career make, of course, but this one didn't
hurt Thornton's self-confidence. ``It helped a lot _ the goal, the
hits,'' he said. ``I got in a couple of hits on my first shift, and
from then on I felt good. On my goal, the puck just popped out and
I slapped it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who centered for Heinze and Anson Carter, said
Philadelphia's physical style of play and team size prompted him to
get involved. ``You know it's going to be a hard-hitting game
against them,'' he said. ``I've got two good wingers with me, we
had some good chemistry, and that's going to help me out in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's second professional season has had its ups and downs,
but over his last 12 games he's scored three times and added three
assists. Wednesday night's goal was his second in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to work hard and be consistent. ``I'm working
harder in practice and in games and I'm getting more physical,'' he
said, ``and I'm putting more pressure on myself now than a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 198 points in 125 games in juniors, and becoming
the youngest member of the Team Canada squad that won the 1997
World Junior Championships, Thornton was put under the microscope
upon his arrival in Boston as a rookie last season.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McLaren, Boston's No. 1 pick (ninth overall) in 1995, was
also 18 when he broke in with the Bruins, but the pressure was
different. ``I wasn't the No. 1 pick in the draft, like Joe,'' said
McLaren. ``My hope then was to just make the Bruins. I didn't feel
the pressure then that he felt last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His two years here, he's been on a roller coaster. He's played
well at times and he's sat at times. But this year I've seen him
more on a consistent basis go out and play well _ skate, hit, and
do the things that he has to do. When he's doing all that, he's a
good player. I believe he's going to be an all-star in this league.
He's just got to put his mind and heart into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from the best in Ray Bourque, and there's no
reason that Joe can't learn from him and from other guys on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, all 6 feet 4 inches and 220 pounds of him, Wednesday
night made an impression, literally, on Flyers defenseman Eric
Desjardins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heavy guy,'' said Desjardins, who had the winning goal.
``He fell on me, and I could really feel it. Joe seems to be
skating better this year, and the best thing for the Bruins is that
he's still very young.''
</P>
<P>
   And still learning on the job.

A LITTLE EXTRA WORK FOR BIG FLYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was more ice time than Eric Lindros had seen this
season. With Mikael Renberg having to leave the game in the first
period after hurting his shoulder, Lindros was double-shifted for
much of the night and finished with 26 minutes 10 seconds of
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off, as the big forward had assists on each of the
Flyers' goals in their 2-1 victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been our big guy all year, and just lately that line
hasn't been scoring _ they usually have two or three goals a
game,'' said Flyers coach Roger Neilson, referring to the top line
of Lindros, Renberg, and John LeClair. ``He played a hard game in
playing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros most often faced Boston's checking line of Rob DiMaio,
Chris Taylor, and P.J. Axelsson, which paid plenty of attention to
the 6-foot-4-inch, 238-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bruins even tried something different with their checking
line,'' Neilson said. ``Sometimes they even had (Jason) Allison out
there against Eric, and that was a different type of wrinkle. The
Bruins have a good checking line.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing new for Lindros to draw such attention. ``Eric is
in great shape,'' said Neilson. ``Whenever he plays, he plays such
a hard game. Sometimes it's hard to double-shift him, because he
goes so hard. He's a big man. We played him a lot, but we've had a
couple days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros's two points give him a league-leading 42 (17 goals, 23
assists).
</P>
<P>
   He loved all the ice time. ``It's like anything else _ any time
you get a lot of ice time, you get right into it,'' he said. ``It's
fun to play. Everybody likes to play, and I'm no different. We had
some injuries, so I had to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his two assists, Lindros had two outstanding
opportunities to score. With seven minutes left in the first
period, he had a backhander bounce off the post. Then, in the
second period, he had an open net against Byron Dafoe, with Ray
Bourque chasing him from the back side. ``Raymond was able to sweep
me away on that,'' Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was also impressed by the play of Dafoe. ``He was
especially strong on kick saves,'' said the Flyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros felt it was important that the Flyers forged ahead on
the road. ``You just know that you're going to get your chances
here and there,'' he said. ``I beared down in trying to do the
right thing with the puck. Sooner or later, you have the feeling
that you're going to score and you also have to play good defensive
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers had a meeting of the minds on that topic during the
intermission between the second and third periods. They employed a
strategy of having four forecheckers, one of them playing high, and
it worked. This was the first time the Flyers had maintained a
third period lead since Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gained some confidence in ourselves in that third period,''
Lindros said of the period in which the Bruins had eight shots, the
Flyers' seven.

ERICKSON'S SO-SO SUCCESS DOESN'T FIT OWNER'S WIN-NOW DEMANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports analysis piece)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson will be fired
next week, not because he failed, but because he did not meet the
expectations of his new bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Those now running the Seahawks' franchise for new owner Paul
Allen are results-oriented products of the computer revolution.
They want things done yesterday, not today and definitely not
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is a stay-the-course type, a trait that has served him
and others in the coaching profession well. But that approach is at
odds with those who control his destiny, and is becoming outdated
in the win-now world of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   As Erickson approaches the 64th and, according to sources, final
game of his stint with the Seahawks, his record is 31-32. Others in
Erickson's coaching class of 1995 have done worse _ Philadelphia's
Ray Rhodes (29-33-1) and Carolina's Dom Capers (29-34), who also
are expected to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Others have done better _ Denver's Mike Shanahan (46-17) and
Jacksonville's Tom Coughlan (34-29).
</P>
<P>
   Erickson has been average. And average is not enough. Not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have been eliminated from playoff contention for a
fourth time under Erickson, and the 10th straight season overall.
It would take an upset of the defending Super Bowl champion and
13-2 Broncos in Denver on Sunday for the Seahawks to secure their
only winning record under Erickson, and the franchise's first since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   This was all supposed to change in 1995, when Erickson wasn't
just the obvious choice, he seemed the best choice to coach the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, who grew up in Everett and had coached at Washington
State, was coming home. And the excitement generated by his hiring
was just what was needed for a franchise that had deteriorated in
three seasons under Tom Flores and the ownership of the Behrings.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson had a reputation for innovative offense and an
energetic personality that had helped the University of Miami win
two national championships in his six-year tenure. It was expected
that these same traits would allow him to lead his hometown NFL
team back to prominence and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Why didn't Erickson turn things around with the
suddenness and panache that was expected? Why is it that the club's
new management group will not allow him to return for the final
year of his contract?
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, things have been stacked against Erickson since he
first arrived, wide-eyed and wildly optimistic. In other ways,
Erickson has been his own worst enemy, clinging too long to
policies and people that had helped him rise to the top of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Three things to remember:
</P>
<P>
   (insert bullet) Erickson could have been fired after last
season, if club president Bob Whitsitt's unsuccessful search for a
general manager had led to the hiring of someone who did not want
to work with Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   (insert bullet) Erickson's original contract was for four years,
with the club's option for a fifth. But the option was guaranteed
in 1996 during then-owner Ken Behring's failed attempt to move the
franchise to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   (insert bullet) Through the past month of growing speculation
about Erickson's future, management has offered nothing more
definitive than saying his status will be evaluated after the
season. No vote of confidence. Nothing to quell the mounting
uncertainty. It has left Erickson with a false sense of just how
bad the situation has become.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of this mismatch between Erickson's style and
that of his bosses is his emphasis on loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the assembling of his first staff. Too many of
Erickson's assistants were, like him, from the college ranks _
defensive coordinator Greg McMackin, then-assistant head coach
Gregg Smith, special teams coach Dave Arnold, quarterbacks coach
Rich Olson and defensive backs coach Willy Robinson. All had been
on Erickson's staff in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of first-time NFL coaches was too high and
prompted one club official to grouse the following season that some
of Erickson's assistants were in over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, special teams gaffes cost the Seahawks at least four
victories in their 8-8 season. Arnold eventually was fired after
the season, but the move should have been made before the season
had become a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson's loyalty cost him again during the process to find
replacements for three other coaches who left after the season _
line coach Howard Mudd, running backs coach Clarence Shelmon and
linebackers coach Mike Murphy, who had previous NFL experience and
were not part of Erickson's circle of college coaching cronies.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Whitsitt wanted to be impressed by the
replacement candidates Erickson could deliver, Erickson continued
to make a pitch to find Arnold a job somewhere in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when Erickson knew the offense had become too
predictable and the defense needed to play more aggressively, he
failed to intervene because of his loyalty to and faith in
offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski and McMackin.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson the man undoubtedly earned some points with his crew.
But Erickson the coach didn't make any points with his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The one time Erickson went against his principles, he cut Ronnie
Harris after fumbling a punt return in a loss to the Oakland
Raiders. Right idea. Wrong player, one who was popular with his
teammates, many of whom felt resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that hurt Erickson this season was sticking with
Warren Moon as long as he did. It is difficult to fault Erickson
for going with the future Hall of Fame quarterback when his options
were the inexperienced Jon Kitna and John Freisz, whose confidence
has wavered since the club made its commitment to him two years and
two serious injuries ago. But Kitna has provided a needed spark the
past month, making it easy to second-guess Erickson for not making
the move sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The players also have sensed that something needed to be done.
They like Erickson. They play hard for him. But as several pointed
out after their rout of the Chargers two weeks ago, they played
hard for themselves, not as a show of solidarity for the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, there has been a lack of discipline and the lack of
accountability that Pro Bowl linebacker Chad Brown talked about
earlier this season. His comments set off a series of closed-door
meetings, a week of hand wringing and a commitment to more-tightly
scrutinized practices.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the same linemen who were guilty of false
starts in games jump offsides in practice and the same receivers
who couldn't catch the ball in games drop passes on the practice
field, Erickson would try to tell reporters that the workout had
been crisp and the problems corrected.
</P>
<P>
   As this season has dragged on, practices have become shorter and
players can often be seen laying down when their unit is not on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson deserves better than this, and the fate that awaits him
next week.
</P>
<P>
   He points to improvement, like the team's 6-2 home record and
the fact that the Seahawks have not been blown out in a game this
season. He knows that if not for the blown call by the officials
against the Jets three weeks ago, his team would be playing this
week for a 10-win season and a chance to host a playoff game. He
remembers his first two seasons under the Behrings, trying to get
by on a shoe-string budget and operating out of a hotel room during
the attempted move of the franchise. He wonders why he wouldn't get
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   It is just too late. He has made too many moves that won't be
forgotten or forgiven.

SUMMARY -- No. 414 -- Dec. 23, 1998 We are offering the following
articles for sale. Please contact us for availability your country.
Best regards, Karl Horwitz
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. EGYPTIAN DIRECTOR'S IRONIC HYMN TO LIBERTY Egyptian director
Youssef Chahine put his creative juices into overdrive for his 33rd
feature, ``Destiny'' (El Maseer,) a drama with music that centres
on the persecution of a philosopher in 12th-century Andalusia.
``Destiny'' is the first film by the Arab world's most accomplished
director to receive American distribution. Chahine, a slight man
with a forceful yet gracious personality, spoke about the genesis
of this historical film that has contemporary relevance. Scrupulous
in his research, Chahine studied sects from all over the world,
including the sect in Waco. ``I wondered, how do educated people
give up their personality and talk according to the way of the
guru?'' By Betsy Sherman. BPI. 1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
NO HOLDS BARD : JOSEPH FIENNES TACKLES SHAKESPEARE They may soon be
calling Ralph Fiennes ``Joseph Fiennes' older brother.'' With his
period drama ``Elizabeth'' already a critical hit and the romantic
comedy ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the younger Fiennes is well on the
way to matching his brother's success. In this interview, Fiennes
talks about his new films, the challenge of playing a character as
mythic - but as little-known - as Shakespeare, how he approached
his torrid sex scenes with Gwyneth Paltrow and why his brother's
success actually makes him less enthusiastic to become a major
star. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
PALTROW AND THE BARD Like the fiercely independent young woman she
portrays in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Gwyneth Paltrow has always
chafed against the peculiar prison of public perception. As the
daughter of acclaimed actress Blythe Danner and producer-director
Bruce Paltrow, she was considered another example of how having the
right name can open all the right doors. By the time she began to
win more substantial movie roles, she was mainly known as the
girlfriend of actor Brad Pitt. When that relationship went up in
flames, more people were concerned with what went wrong than the
fact that Paltrow was developing into a smart young actress.
Interview by Renee Graham. From The Boston Globe. 1,700 words +
photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
SEAN PENN AT PEACE In film after film, Sean Penn has played bad
guys : from a convicted rapist on death row in ``Dead Man
Walking,'' to a drug dealer turned traitor in ``The Falcon and the
Snowman.'' Now he is adding to that gallery his World War II
soldier under fire in Guadalcanal in the upcoming film ``The Thin
Red Line.'' Penn says his succession of angst-filled roles has
never been a conscious career choice. ``I'm much more interested in
a tiny bit of enduring emotional truth,'' he claims. Interview by
Jay Carr. From The Boston Globe. 2,000 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
DIAGNOSIS : DICK VAN DYKE While no one was looking, the CBS program
``Diagnosis Murder'' has become a surprise hit. And no wonder - the
series, now in its sixth year, stars a true TV icon, the one and
only Dick Van Dyke. In this interview Van Dyke, 73, talks about his
contempt for much of present-day television, his memories of the
glory days of ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' and what he said when he
finally met his childhood idol, silent-movie star Stan Laurel of
Laurel &AMP; Hardy. By Andrew Ryan. From TV Guide Canada. 1,400 words +
photo.
_______________________________________________________________6.
READING TOM HANKS' ``MAIL'' Tom Hanks is having a series of very
good years. After his Gary Cooper-esque heroics in this summer's
smash hit, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Hanks now takes on a role
originally played by Jimmy Stewart in ``You've Got Mail,'' one of
the holiday season's biggest films (the story of two very unlikely
lovers who come together by chance, thanks to the Internet and
e-mail.) The romantic comedy reteams Hanks, Meg Ryan and director
Nora Ephron, who together charmed the world with ``Sleepless in
Seattle.'' Interview by Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________7.
JOEL SINGS A SONG OF RETIREMENT No artist wants to be a parody of
himself (think of Elvis Presley in his twilight years.) That's not
what musician Billy Joel has in mind for his career, so he's taking
himself out of the running. He's now on one of the longest
unofficial farewell tours in memory, but he expects to end it
before his 50th birthday, on May 9 next year. ``It's getting to
that time and, yeah, I don't want to be a parody,'' he says. By
Steve Morse. From the Boston Globe. 1,300 words + photo.

 &HT;    Georgia turns to automation for probation
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Georgia struggles to balance the increasing cost of
its burgeoning Corrections Department, it is trying a new approach
with people on probation: trust.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, Athens and Albany, the state is allowing its
best probationers to work on the honor system by reporting not to a
person but to a machine with the friendly name of PAM _ for
Probation Automated Monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The probationer goes to a kiosk, usually in a state building or
a county courthouse, inserts a card similar to an ATM card and
places a hand on the machine so fingerprints can be verified. The
parolee then responds electronically to a series of question, such
as whether he or she has used drugs recently. Although the program
is in its second year, the state has no accurate measure of its
success because the state tracks probation recidivism on a
three-year cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the criminal justice system think the kiosks
are a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have really hands-on supervision of these folks,''
said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Cynthia Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal contact is very critical because all the kiosk
can tell you is the offender is still in town and checking in,''
said Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project in Washington. ``They
could be selling drugs day and night and still be smart enough to
check in with the kiosk. Just like a parent talking to a kid can
pick up on signals that there is a problem, it's the same for a
probation officer. You just can't get that through an electronic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   However, probation officials expect few problems with the 3,000
or so people who choose this route. Because there is an extra $10
monthly fee for this type of probation reporting system, the people
who do it have to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Wicklund, executive director of the American Probation and
Parole Association, said New York City had been using the kiosks
successfully for a few years. A few other cities and states are
considering it. As is the case in Georgia, New York City selects
only those most likely to succeed, so there are virtually no
revocations of probation, Wicklund said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their answers to the electronic questions,
probationers either are cleared and told to report back at the next
scheduled time or required to meet with a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Georgia gets tougher on sentencing inmates and
requiring them to serve more of their sentences, probation rolls
continue to swell. Some researchers have said the rise is simply a
result of demographics, the large numbers of young men in the prime
crime years of the mid-teens to late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   While officers supervising high-security probationers have
relatively lower caseloads, those with only standard cases, which
require probationers to report monthly, supervise an average of 250
to 300 people. In Atlanta, the caseload is more than double, with
one officer supervising an average of 650 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   By using the kiosks, the Department of Corrections is taking
some of the pressure off the officers, so they can pay more
attention to those who need a bit more watching.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing prison population and the number of probationers
has sent the Department of Corrections budget from $525.5 million
five years ago to a proposed $952 million for next year. That
increase, in turn, has made state officials look harder at
controlling costs in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hanness, chief of the Atlanta probation office, said all the
answers are verified, so if probationers lie, their probation is
revoked and they are sent to prison. The probation officer calls to
verify the information, such as employers and residence, so a false
answer will be discovered, Hanness said.
</P>
<P>
   For probationers whose court order requires random or regular
drug testing, the office likewise would be notified if a person did
not report for the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Hanness. ``It's the only way we can
manage the size of the caseload we have. The probationer doesn't
report to the officer unless there's a reason to do so. We were
looking for ways to manage our standard caseloads because that's
the only caseload we don't have a cap on.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The joy of Clinton-hating
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Each president inspires his own brand of
dislike, special to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan inspired intellectual condescension and easy
dismissivness. ``A maitre d' in a bad restaurant,'' as comedian
Mort Sahl summed him up to knowing applause.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush inspired ridicule for loopy speech habits. The left
and the right could unite in exasperation at his lack of program.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clinton has inspired a special kind of hatred. The kind
of that we haven't seen since the days when we had both Richard
Nixon and Lyndon Johnson to kick around. We haven't seen this kind
of hate since the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   One would think Clinton's documented failings would be rich and
varied enough to satisfy anybody. No way. Committed Clinton haters
need more. For them, he is guilty of murder, treason and
conspiracies so vast that books, Web sites and videotape series are
devoted to sketching only the broadest outlines of his evil.
</P>
<P>
   In this, Clinton joins the elite ranks of presidents who
provoked a special kind of personal, focused, and all-encompassing
hatred. The kind that becomes a hobby, a unified political theory,
a way of describing the world and all its workings.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon could inspire something close. The Kennedys as a family.
So could Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt-hating was legendary, heartfelt and almost devotional
in character. You can still find traces of it after a half century.
When conservative humorist P.J. O'Rourke evokes the image of FDR
being wheeled into the flames of hell, it can still ignite roars of
appreciative laughter and hearty applause from Republican
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   There's a trace of that in Clinton hating. Like
Roosevelt-hating, Clinton-hating is more than political opposition.
It is A Way, an anchor in confusing times.
</P>
<P>
   It puts a puffy, pink human face to an impersonal world, a world
swirling with evil and complex conspiracies, awash in cultural
decay, bad music and foreigners. Clinton brought us the coarsening
of American life. The Clinton illuminati made possible Jerry
Springer, Puff Daddy, New Age religion, the Y2K computer bug, euro
dollars, girls with tattoos, personal watercraft, the self-esteem
movement and those wretched Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Republican speeches during the House impeachment
vote, many representatives appeared to be laboring under the belief
they were voting to impeach the '60s, moral relativism, secular
humanism and a world too nasty to tell little kids about.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now the kind of topic that makes people edge slowly
out of the room. Like abortion, gun control, fluoridation of
drinking water and notch babies' Social Security checks, he has
become one of those issues you avoid at the table because its mere
mention can reignite old arguments, strike names from
Christmas-card lists and ruin everyone's desert.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, sometimes wish the president had resigned. Not because
he isn't doing his job, but because I wonder what Clinton-haters
will do after he leaves. Will they be feel loss and emptiness
before moving on with their lives?
</P>
<P>
   Or is this field too rich ever to give up? Will the fixation on
Clinton linger like the weather-beaten ``Impeach Earl Warren''
signs that you could still find along the back roads of the South
years after the chief justice left the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect so. And he'll be a youngish ex-president, so for
decades his hidden hand will be glimpsed in wrong-doing covered up
by a pliant media.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the curse of interesting times. For it seems the
presidents who have inspired the richest, most personally
satisfying hatred were always those who presided over times of
great change. Whether it was Calvinists who believed Jefferson
would confiscate Bibles or isolationists who believed FDR
engineered the Pearl Harbor attack to advance international
communism, the president was the ringmaster in a dark circus of
unpleasant change. Hating a person, rather than the world's
uncertain forces, always feels better.
</P>
<P>
   But share it on the Internet and not family gatherings.
Nonbelievers just don't understand.

 &HT;    When you hear the bell it is definitely ringing for you
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ It was about 6:15 Friday night when I noticed
that the lady on the cell phone was giving me a look.
</P>
<P>
   No, not as in looking me over (though I'm pretty sure you knew
that, didn't you?), but a look as if I was getting on her last
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the bell.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing outside Wal-Mart in the chilly wind and just out
of the reach of the bitterly cold rain collecting money for the
Salvation Army. Someone had given me a bell to ring and, by golly,
I was going to ring it for all I was worth. No little
tinkle-tinkle. I was hoping to achieve a full clang. I was, if I do
say so myself, exceeding all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not particularly good news for the lady on the cell
phone who was in a tough spot. Two steps one direction and she was
inside the store where her phone wasn't picking up the signal. Two
steps in another direction and she would have been standing in a
driving rain.
</P>
<P>
   So she was stuck in the middle with me and my bell.
</P>
<P>
   And I was having a high old time.
</P>
<P>
   Cold and wet though it may have been, I enjoyed every second.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all I enjoyed the faces of the people who gave money to
the cause, and there are few better causes than the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The givers ranged across the spectrum. There were a few dozen
children who took money given to them by their parents to drop on
in the bucket. Their faces showed a pride in what they were doing.
It is the same feeling everyone gets when they are helping their
community.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Hispanic man who gave me two nickels after
carefully counting
</P>
<P>
   them out of his pocket. Behind him marched his wife and five
children. I figure that 10 cents was probably more than he could
afford to give.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charlie the mechanic, or, if his name wasn't Charlie
he was wearing someone else's work shirt, who stopped in the rain
to pull out his wallet and give me a $1 bill. There was the man of
maybe 23 years with a gold hoop earring who walked back through the
rain after passing me to put in an entire pocket full of change
that totaled several dollars. There were a dozen working Joes who
didn't hesitate to drop money in the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will I forget the man who, after putting a bill into the
bucket said, ``Who knows, maybe someday I'll have to make a
withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, black and white, they put money into my bucket
and we shared a ``Merry Christmas'' as they did so.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, young and old, black and white, they passed up
putting money in the bucket, too.
</P>
<P>
   Early on I decided to assume that everyone who did not put money
into my
</P>
<P>
   bucket had dropped some coins in some other Salvation Army
receptacle. I never felt the slightest twinge of a bad feeling for
those who passed me by.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit, though, some people will go to remarkable lengths
to pretend they don't hear a clanging bell. If they weren't acting
then we definitely need some hearing aid retailers in this area.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps you think I should have slacked off for the woman
using the cell phone next to me. Sorry, but there wasn't even a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the people who pretended not to hear my bell Friday, most
of us don't want to think much about hunger and poverty in this
holiday season. We would all like to pretend that everyone lives
like us, opening presents around the tree while singing Christmas
carols and nibbling off the party tray.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is far different. Even if we are able to put a
plate on everyone's table for Christmas Day, on the day after, or
the week after, those plates will be just as empty as ever before.
</P>
<P>
   When the ringing bell gets on your nerves just a bit, think of
how would be if, instead of hearing that bell, you were constantly
feeling the pang of hunger.
</P>
<P>
   As long as people are hungry in this country, there ought to be
someone clanging a bell in our living rooms. We should never be
able to escape our responsibility to help our fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   If the bell bothers you there is a simple solution: Do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas would actually be a brighter time without the bells.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Tracking time in a young boy's sense of preparation
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A multicolored string of lights over our porch had
a bad bulb. Unable to find one that matched the string, I fished
one from a disabled set and screwed it in _ all by myself, I might
add.
</P>
<P>
   As Christmas bulbs go, it's a throwback. Instead of having
tinted glass for the bright shine of its new neighbors, its glass
is painted blue, producing something more faint. In the daylight I
had to cup my hand to make sure it was working.
</P>
<P>
   That night, checking the total product, I looked for the faint
blue bulb and found myself transfixed by its almost-velvet
softness. I instantly knew why.
</P>
<P>
   This was the color of Christmas when I was a child.
</P>
<P>
   I had spent a lot of formative hours prone on the floor with
colors like this bathing my face, close enough to feel their heat.
</P>
<P>
   For my sons, other hues will tug when they've grown. And for
them, like me, they will be the colors of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Like a chart on the door, growth is marked by how a child
handles the Christmas wait.
</P>
<P>
   No one in our family will ever forget the Christmas eve when
youngest son Rob, then 7 or 8, was absolutely frantic to get home
from a restaurant meal.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us were inclined to go drive around and see
Christmas lights. Rob found himself alternately shooting glances up
in the sky and hiding his eyes in high anxiety. He was absolutely
certain that it was time for Santa to arrive. If he didn't get home
and into bed, we'd get missed on the red man's rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go home,'' he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax. The night is young,'' we assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. Go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhh. Shhh.''
</P>
<P>
   Deer in headlights?
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he saw something overhead. Undoubtedly it was a
reflection from passing traffic in the window. Rob, however, was
certain he'd seen a sleigh in friendly air space.
</P>
<P>
   He began stomping his feet. This was a five-alarm Santa alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no. I saw him. I saw him. Hurry. Hurry,'' he said
frantically.
</P>
<P>
   We accelerated home. It was about 7:30. He ran from the van to
the front door, and to the dresser drawers, and to bed _ where he
tossed and turned for the next two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Just past midnight after finally having succumbed, he stumbled
down the hall and tapped on his sleeping mom's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's morning. Wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not quite. Go back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m.: ``Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   4 a.m.: ``Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. ``Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Christmas morning photos show us with faces bleached
of circulation and hair headed back down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rob is growing up. At 11, he has Santa figured out as a creature
of the muse, not as someone who can navigate through a vent. But
the anticipation does not abate.
</P>
<P>
   Regular under-the-tree inventories continue, as do strategy
sessions about Christmas morning. In particular, this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'm going to do,'' he announced the other day,
``will be to put on my clothes and comb my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures. I don't want to look so dumb in the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see if he has the discipline and focus tomorrow morning to
follow through on that.
</P>
<P>
   My bet is that the magnetism of anticipated joys will drag him
right past the bathroom and into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   May his anticipation, and yours, always feel like velvet.

 &HT;    Jones follows heart to Hawaii
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the day June Jones signed with the Atlanta
Falcons in 1977 as an undrafted free agent, he tried to convince
himself that he really belonged in the NFL, but he knew that he was
simply an accidental tourist in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, with his brain still begging him to remain on the
NFL merry-go-round for just one more ride, Jones finally heeded the
message of his telltale heart.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Jones, a former Atlanta Falcons coach, to fill
the vacancy at the University of Hawaii instead of staying on with
the San Diego Chargers is a mystery to some. It's more like poetic
justice, though, to those who long ago realized that Jones operates
his life from a values system that barely includes ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``With just about anyone else, you'd ask, `How does a guy turn
his back on the NFL? Isn't this what everyone aspires to?''' said
former Falcons center Roman Fortin, who plays for the Chargers.
``But with June, you understand. When he told the team what he was
doing, no one was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his own set of priorities, you know?'' said Joe
Haering, a longtime friend and former Falcons assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Just five days before what figures to be his last NFL
appearance, Jones was just as concerned that it was only three days
until Christmas and that he had more gift-buying than game-planning
left to accomplish. And he fretted over the need to get his
youngest daughter, Nikki, enrolled in school on the islands and
about the urgency to purchase a new home in what has become a
buyer's market on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he doesn't finish plotting to sabotage the Arizona
Cardinals' playoff plans in time to make it to the mall, Jones
already has delivered a Christmas gift of sorts, by reuniting his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones accepted the position of quarterbacks coach with the
Chargers 11 months ago, the clan has been far-flung. Wife Diane and
the three youngest of the couple's four children had remained
behind in Cumming. That separation was made even tougher by Diane's
continuing recovery from non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the
15-by-10-centimeter mass in her chest discovered only two weeks
after Jones was dismissed by the Falcons in January of 1997. And
Jones certainly missed son June IV, age 4, whose exuberance had
helped him survive those last dismal months with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Diane continues to have a clean bill of
health, her checkup Friday indicating no sign of the cancer's
return. The better news is that the June Jones long-term master
plan for his career and his family has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job out here, we wanted to make sure Diane
stayed under the same doctors' care for a year,'' he said.
``Really, I came to help Kevin (Gilbride) and, of course, when he
got fired, things changed for me. But part of the decision to come
to San Diego was to get closer to Hawaii. At least figuratively
closer. I felt like if I was out of the game for two seasons, I
might not get the job there if it came open. And the people who
know me know how interested I was in going back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he played one season in Hawaii during an itinerant
college career and served as an assistant there in 1983, Jones has
longed to return full-time. In his time at Suwanee, he would
confide to friends that he could land the job any time it became
available, and he never sold the condominium he bought there years
ago just in case the opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've always discussed,'' Diane said. ``And the
timing is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Jones went into the interview with Hawaii athletics
director Hugh Yoshida, he was prepared to stay in San Diego. Jones,
who was so respected by Atlanta ownership that the franchise
actually gave him a raise after firing him, was ready to reimburse
the contingent from Hawaii for making the trip to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bobby Beathard, who desperately wanted Jones to
stay, had lobbied to keep him. ``He knew the job was his,''
Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers, Jones confirmed, were going to offer a four-year
extension and afford him the time needed to turn around a team that
will finish last in the AFC West for the second season in a row. As
it turned out, Jones' competitiveness and desire to lead the
Chargers back to a Super Bowl were overshadowed by the call of the
islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have loved to have him back, because he really pulled
the team together for us,'' Chargers president Dean Spanos said.
``But any time a guy follows his heart and he does what's best for
his family _ you have to admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the Hawaii interview, Jones knew he would
take the job. Using the same notes he'd made several years ago when
he had the opportunity to go to Hawaii, Jones got all the answers
he needed. Three hours later, he had a oral agreement to coach the
Rainbows. Not surprisingly, money never became an issue; quality of
life for his family and him was the overriding priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be less stress (for Diane),'' said Jones, who
will earn $400,000 per year, far less than he would have made in
San Diego. ``It's a special place, and it always has been for me. I
don't look at this as turning my back on the NFL, although I doubt
I'll ever coach in the league again. It's just an opportunity I
always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get things going there, it will be the place I
retire from.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be no better place to live than Hawaii and no worse
place to coach football. Turning around a Hawaii program that
requires progress simply to reach shambles status will be a
daunting task, even for the optimistic Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Warriors were 0-12 in 1998, have lost 18 consecutive
games and were 5-31 the past three seasons under Fred vonAppen.
Hawaii travels at least 2,500 miles for every road game and its
league, the Western Athletic Conference, is disintegrating around
it. There are said to be budgetary problems within the athletics
department, and the academic standards at the university make it
difficult to keep the top players on the islands from matriculating
on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   None of that dissuaded Jones, 45, from signing a five-year
contract with an option for a sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun is in the challenge,'' Jones said. ``I have a plan for
getting things done there. As a coach, you get jacked up about the
possibility of taking over something that's at rock bottom and
pushing it up the hill. It's not an impossible situation. I've seen
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The close friends who watched him deal with Diane's cancer, and
who witnessed the way Jones threw himself into that once-dire
situation, aren't about to bet against him beating the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Herock, the former Falcons vice president who now captains
the Oakland personnel department, recently recalled calling Jones
during Diane's battle and trying to take his mind off the real-life
fight by talking a little football. Instead, Jones began a lengthy
dissertation on the medical volumes he had checked out of the
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``June said, `Kenny, read everything you can about cancer,
because sooner or later it's going to affect someone close to
you,''' Herock remembered. ``He doesn't go halfway into anything.
He'll do fine over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has remained close with high school coaches on the
islands. His name still has clout. A few years ago, a friend of
Jones took his family to Hawaii and saved a couple hundred dollars
in cover charges merely by using his name. Because the expectations
for the program are so blunted, it won't take annual bowl games and
undefeated seasons to create a lot of excitement with the
knowledgeable fans.
</P>
<P>
   Seven wins and the exciting offense Jones certainly will have
could be enough to make it a lifetime job with the Rainbows. The
university's regents have promised to examine closely the
application requirements, and that could keep some talent at home.
Jones is ready to recruit hard in California and shouldn't have
problems wooing players who are eager to be in a big-time passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a quarterback or receiver, who else would you rather
play for?'' former NFL quarterback Jim Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is among those not surprised at Jones' early exit from the
NFL. As with many jobs, Jones discovered that the reality of having
been to the summit didn't measure up to the anticipation of the
arrival. In Hawaii, he intends to coach during the day, enjoy his
family at night and never have to update his resume again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, I'm different from some (coaches) in that I get
close to the players and the people I work with,'' Jones said.
``It's never been about money or prestige or power for me. The
thing I love best is the interaction. That's the essence of
coaching at all levels, and I'll be able to enjoy it just as much
in Hawaii as in the NFL. The (coaching) business has changed so
much; I don't know if it's free agency or what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I'm going to be happy getting back to the basics of
what led me into coaching in the first place.''

 &HT;    Movie stirs up bitter memories for Boca firm
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ W.R. Grace &AMP; Co.'s old wounds are about to
open on movie screens throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, Disney's Touchstone Pictures will release ``A Civil
Action'' starring John Travolta as the real-life lawyer who
represented families who sued the chemical company 16 years ago for
allegedly contaminating their drinking water and, ergo, killing
their children. Boca Raton-based Grace settled out-of-court in
1986, paying the families $8 million, but never admitted guilt in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' is based on the 1995 award-winning book of
the same name by Jonathan Harr. It traces the four-year court
battle between Grace, corporate giant Beatrice Foods, and the
families from the working-class Boston suburb Woburn where Grace
ran a machine manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Grace brandishes a modern weapon in this old
publicity battle: the Internet. At www.civil-action.com, Grace
outlines evidence gathered since 1986 which supports the company
claim that it was not the source of contamination in the families'
drinking water. On the site there are links to the reports by the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to retry the case on the site,'' said Grace
spokeswoman Jane McGuinness. ``We just wanted to give our side of
the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace is hoping its site will catch browsers visiting the more
than 10,000 movie pages on the Web. Touchstone Pictures' official
Web site for the movie has an address almost identical to the Grace
one: www.classaction.com (no hyphen).
</P>
<P>
   The Grace site opened just before Thanksgiving, but no accurate
data is available on how many visits it's had, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has been planning its response since Robert Redford, a
producer of ``A Civil Action,'' bought the book's movie rights in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Grace repeatedly contacted Disney to report inaccuracies in the
book or to point out developments since the settlement, but Disney
never responded, McGuinness said. Disney officials in New York and
Los Angeles did not return phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Grace executives don't know anything specific about the film _
no company officials have been invited to any advance screenings _
except to expect a supremely unflattering story.

   ``It's certainly not a picture of Grace today,'' McGuinness
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is a specialty chemicals company with 6,300 employees and
revenues last year of $1.5 billion (after a downsizing from $6
billion annually.) It produces for manufacturers things like silica
gel for toothpaste or chemicals that reduce emissions in gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Grace had a machine manufacturing plant in Woburn from 1960 to
1988. In the course of the Woburn suit, the company admitted to
dumping some solvents including trychloroethylene (TCE) on the
grounds, but asserted that it could not have entered the families'
drinking water systems. An EPA report later upheld that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Also since the settlement in 1986, scientific thought on TCE and
cancer clusters has changed. There are many now who question
whether TCE is a carcinogen, and whether clusters of cancer cases
always must have an outside cause.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hollywood, though, and the movie _ minus these points _
premieres Dec. 25 in New York and Los Angeles. It arrives locally
two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think I'll run out and see it the first day,''
McGuinness said.

 &HT;    Game for the ages
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amid the colorful ribbons, gleaming trophies and
polished plaques that adorn the wall of Art Donovan's game room in
suburban Baltimore, a black-and-white photograph still stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Neatly framed, hung in a position of prominence and dusted
daily, the picture shows the grainy and somewhat out-of-focus
likeness of Colts fullback Alan Ameche blasting 1 yard over right
guard for the winning touchdown in the 1958 NFL championship game
on Dec. 28, 1958. That dramatic overtime contest, a 23-17 victory
for the Colts against the New York Giants, laid the foundation for
the league's unequaled popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, there remains a certain irony to the fact it
took a sudden-death game to breathe instant life into a
then-floundering NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who played in what has been labeled as the greatest
game in league history acknowledge that it was not an aesthetic
success; they insist that other games in 1958 produced superior
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had to beat the Browns two weeks in a row, and one
of the games was in a blizzard, just to get to the championship
(game),'' recalled New York running back Frank Gifford, whose two
fumbles in the title matchup led to 10 points for the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, who drove his team 73 yards in
the final 1:56 to set up the field goal that sent the game into
overtime, recalled a regular-season victory against San Francisco
in which Baltimore overcame a 28-7 halftime deficit. ``Sure, there
were better games,'' he said. ``It's probably a (misnomer) to label
that '58 game the greatest ever played. But it was probably the
most significant game ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, none of those other games were televised to a national
audience just cutting its teeth on professional football, and few
had all the exciting elements included in the Colts triumph against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   With television in its formative years, the matchup of the
Colts' league-leading offense and Giants' top-rated defense drew
viewers away from their holiday turkey leftovers and onto their
sofas. Sports fans whose idea of a key matchup was watching Bob
Feller try to get his fastball past Ted Williams leaned forward in
their chairs as Ameche and L.G. Dupre attempted to run through New
York middle linebacker Sam Huff, whose scowling countenance graced
the cover of Time magazine a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Because the game was in New York, it created unprecedented media
coverage. Because the game was blacked out in New York, the crowd
was standing room only. The contest included 15 players and coaches
-- including Vince Lombardi, offensive coordinator for the Giants
-- later elected to the Hall of Fame. And no pro football game
before it had gone into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas and players from both teams, in fact, were clueless about
what would transpire after the game ended 17-17 in regulation.
Captains from the teams looked confused as they were led to
midfield for the overtime coin-toss, field judge Chuck Sweeney said
recently. Even the game officials, Sweeney said, were nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The game announcers, Chris Schenkel for the Giants and
Baltimore's Chuck Thompson, each had called a half and argued about
who would broadcast the sudden-death session. After some heated
words, they flipped a coin, and Thompson won.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew,'' Colts offensive tackle Jim Parker said, ``was
that there was a couple of thousand dollars difference between the
loser's share and what the winning team was to get, . . . and I
needed that money even if I had to work overtime to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the champion Colts received $4,718 per player.
The Giants players got $3,111.33. But the payoff was priceless for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Giants owner Wellington Mara said the late commissioner Pete
Rozelle ``always told me the reason pro football took off was
because that game happened just at that time, in that season, on
television and in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-time Giants season-ticket holder Art Modell, who two years
later purchased the Cleveland Browns franchise, recalled the
atmosphere as ``magic'' and noted that as the game wore on he
realized he was an eyewitness to history. ``It wasn't the birth of
the league, but it certainly was its coming-out party,'' Modell
said last week. Modell helped negotiate the NFL's first national
network TV contract three years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the moment sports became something the networks had to
carry,'' said Barry Frank, the noted television negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dec. 28, 1958 is recognized as the day professional
football shook the country's sports landscape with a seismic tremor
rarely caused by one game. ``Before that game,'' Donovan recalled,
``I could be standing outside Mr. Goldberg's candy store in the
Bronx, and he'd see me and say, 'Donovan, you big bum, are you out
of work again?' He had no idea that I played football. The league,
it was in its infancy then. The '58 game took the NFL out of
diapers, really. Up until then, we operated in a vacuum of sorts. A
couple years after that game, we were in every living room in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation of Baby Boomers still recalls the ghostly
black-and-white images of the Colts and Giants wallowing around in
the mud at Yankee Stadium as its first real exposure to football.
Young men whose only perspective on sport came during the daily
game of ``catch'' with their fathers in the front yard got hooked
on football that dreary December afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation that later huddled around the TV set as the
world teetered on the brink of a nuclear holocaust, watched soberly
as a funeral cortege escorted the body of its slain president and
held its collective breath every time a rocket lifted off the pad
at Cape Canaveral, the '58 championship game was both respite and
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game,'' author David Halberstam said this week, ``was a
watershed event for professional football, for sports in general,
for this country. It is not hyperbole to say our lives changed
forever that afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after that game, most boys woke up to find shoulder
pads or a football under the Christmas tree. Kids all over America
climbed into barbers' chairs and ordered flat-top haircuts so
they'd look like Unitas and Huff. Wives who grudgingly watched the
game bought Westinghouse washers because they had seen the
company's handsome pitchman, Gifford, playing in the contest. The
mavens of Madison Avenue, who shaped the consumer conscience of the
country, signed dozens of NFL players to endorsement deals in the
weeks after the '58 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been better games, but that one was the marriage of
professional football and TV,'' Colts defensive back Johnny Sample
said. ``Fans who for years sat around their radios started calling
their neighbors and telling them to come over and watch this NFL
game on television. It was special, and the overtime just added to
it. For weeks after, it was all anyone talked about. People in the
television industry throw around the term 'water-cooler show' now.
Hey, that game was the original 'water-cooler show.' Everyone got
hooked on the NFL that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam and sociologist D.K. Wittinghouse emphasized that
baseball was in a state of flux at the time -- the Dodgers and
Giants both had bolted New York for new homes on the West Coast --
and that the NBA registered only a blip on the sports radar screen.
Hockey, with only six franchises, was viewed as primarily a
Canadian pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football existed on the fringe, classier than in its
barnstorming days, but it still was regarded by many as
second-fiddle to the college game.
</P>
<P>
   All of that changed, however, on Dec. 28, 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years,'' Colts halfback Lenny Moore said,
``people still tell me that was the first (pro) game they had ever
watched. And that's probably the truth.'' Gifford, who had paid
dearly to fly his father in from the Alaskan oil fields for the
title game, said, ``We weren't out trying to make history, just win
a championship. The history part of it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than three minutes left in regulation, the underdog
Giants were clinging to a 17-14 lead and faced a third-and-four at
their 40-yard line. Coach Jim Lee Howell sent in a running play,
``47-Power,'' for Gifford. The Giants star burst upfield but was
tackled by defensive end Gino Marchetti and linebacker Don
Shinnick. As the play ended, Colts tackle Gene ``Big Daddy''
Lipscomb fell on Marchetti, breaking his right leg. The shriek from
Marchetti, some Giants contend to this day, distracted referee
Charlie Berry so much that he mismarked the placement of the ball,
and Gifford came up inches short of the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lipscomb put five of his own players out of (commission) that
day by piling on at the end of plays,'' Donovan said. ``So all this
hollering is going on, and Gifford's laying on the ground saying,
'I made the first down! I made the sticks!' Hell, he didn't even
get back to the line of scrimmage is the way I remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing punt by Don Chandler gave the Colts the ball at
their own 14-yard line and provided Unitas a stage he would use to
stake his claim to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Out of timeouts and behind by three points, the quarterback took
one glance downfield before stepping into the huddle. ``The goal
posts were so far away, they looked like they were back in
Baltimore,'' Unitas said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But with characteristic precision, the analytical Unitas carved
up the Giants defense. Taking advantage of deep drops by Huff and
fellow linebacker Harland Svare, he simply kept throwing underneath
to Raymond Berry, perhaps the most technically proficient wide
receiver in league history. In the eight-play drive, the two
connected for gains of 15, 22 and 25 yards. With seven seconds left
and the ball at the New York 13-yard line, Steve Myhra forced the
overtime with a 20-yard field goal, as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   As the Colts defense huddled on the sideline, Donovan exhorted
his colleagues simply to get the ball back for Unitas, and they
did. The Giants won the overtime toss, failed to move to a first
down and Chandler punted to the Baltimore 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we ran onto the field, John just had this kind of detached
look like, 'OK, let's go get this thing over with,' `` Berry said.
``In those situations, he was the best, and everyone on both
sidelines knew it.'' Huff recalled: ``There was a sense of
impending doom because you didn't want Unitas with the ball in that
situation. In our hearts, it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it took Unitas 10 plays. Twice more he threw to
Berry, the first time his 20-yard bullet on third-and-15 overcoming
an 8-yard sack by Dick Modzelewski.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas ``knew where to attack a defense,'' Giants defensive back
Carl Karilivacz said. ``He found a weakness, and he went after it,
exploited it for everything he could get.'' ``Look at the
play-by-play of that game, and it's Unitas-to-Berry time after
time,'' Huff said. ``I mean, after 40 years, that still rings in my
ears: 'Unitas complete to Berry.' We simply couldn't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the drive wasn't dramatic enough, it was interrupted, as
televisions all over the country went black when fans in the lower
bleachers accidentally loosened a cable. An employee from NBC
pleaded with game officials to delay the contest until power could
be restored. In his headset, Thompson heard a producer ordering him
to do radio-style play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew pro football was growing up right in front of everyone
on that afternoon,'' said Sweeney, the field judge. ``I gave the
guy another minute beyond the usual 90 seconds and hoped for the
best.'' The cable was repaired and viewers missed just one snap.
</P>
<P>
   Dupre gained 17 yards on four carries in the final drive and
caught a pass for 8 more. Ameche ran twice for 24 yards, and tight
end Jim Mutscheller caught a 6-yard pass that moved the ball to the
New York 1-yard line. With a third down, neither Unitas nor Colts
coach Weeb Ewbank ever considered kicking a field goal for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ameche bulled into the end zone, into the record books
and onto Art Donovan's game-room wall.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Nutter, the Baltimore center, wrestled the ball away from a
security guard and delivered it to Marchetti, who had listened to
the final minutes on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore locker room, the players celebrated by drinking
orange soda. ``Nowdays guys use champagne for shampoo,'' Donovan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas, who finished with 361 yards passing, hugged Berry and
then headed for a warm shower. Ameche quickly signed a $500 deal to
appear on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' that evening and raced to catch
a cab. Across the hall, a distraught Gifford wept openly over his
two fumbles and had to be consoled by Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, the near-sighted receiver with one leg shorter than the
other, finished dressing, pulled on an overcoat and headed out for
the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Yankee Stadium, just standing alone on the sidewalk
as dusk settled, was commissioner Bert Bell,'' said Berry, who had
12 catches for 178 yards. ``Here was a guy who had midwifed the NFL
and shepherded it through all its tough times. I walked up to shake
his hand, and he had tears in his eyes. He knew what that game
meant. The rest of us, we had no perspective on the big picture.
But the commissioner, he knew his baby grew up that day.''

 J REEVES25-COX &HT;    Coaches respond to crises, teams take it in stride
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ They stuck to the schedule like it was an ordinary
Wednesday. Same morning meeting. Same lunch break. Same afternoon
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons, this Wednesday
was far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't include head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the day that two of the NFL's highest
profile coaches _ Miami's Jimmy Johnson and Atlanta's Dan Reeves _
gathered their players and began preparing them for the
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, four days before that game, both were dealing with
problems that eclipsed football.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was in an Atlanta hospital, recovering from the quadruple
bypass surgery he had 10 days earlier. Johnson was in Groves,
Texas, attending his mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Allene Johnson, 77, died Sunday after a long battle with kidney
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sympathies are with coach Johnson,'' Dolphins tight end
Troy Drayton said. ``But at the same time, I'm sure Coach Johnson
is saying, `Hey, the show must go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson worked Monday, guiding the Dolphins to a 31-21 upset of
Denver. Wednesday, though, he turned the team over to his
assistants, boarded a team plane and flew home to Texas. He was
accompanied by Dolphins president Eddie Jones and media relations
director Harvey Greene. Meanwhile, back in South Florida, the
Dolphins went about the business of preparing for a team that
hasn't lost since October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different not having him around,'' Drayton said. ``But
it's Week 17. We know the routine by now.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary change, the players said, was that Johnson wasn't
there to open the morning meeting. Instead, the team jumped right
to the next step, when the assistant coaches take over and begin
breaking down the gameplan for each unit.
</P>
<P>
   No one assistant took control. Instead, it was a group effort
from Johnson's 17-man staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared for something like this,'' receivers coach
Robert Ford said. ``Jimmy is the kind of coach that gives us a job
and lets us do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dolphins know their head coach will be back on the
field today, the Falcons are uncertain when theirs will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful he'll be back for the first playoff game,'' said
defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, who is acting as interim coach.
``At this point, that is in jeopardy, quite honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who guided the Falcons to their first AFC West title
since 1980, began experiencing chest pain on the flight home from a
27-17 victory at New Orleans on Jan. 13. The next day he had
quadruple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He left Piedmont Hospital last Friday, four days after the
surgery and held a teary press conference where he talked of trying
to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to distract our team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he suffered a relapse and had to return to the
hospital. That day the Falcons won 24-17 at Detroit to improve 13-2
_ guaranteeing the best regular season in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This right here is the culmination of Dan's hard work,''
running back Jamal Anderson said. ``We won this game for Dan and
his family. He came in here and built a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Falcons have tried to change as little as
possible in Reeves' absence. For instance, last weekend at Detroit,
Brooks could have moved onto the field to run the team. Instead, he
opted to stay in the press box. When he had to make decisions _
such as whether to accept or decline a penalty _ relayed it to
general manager Harold Richardson on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive play-calling remained the same. Quarterbacks coach
Jack Burns called a play and relayed it to the sideline. Backup
quarterback Steve DeBerg relayed them to starting quarterback Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference was that it wasn't filtered through Dan,''
Brooks said. ``Dan ultimately had been making the decision on
whether he would send it in or change it. I have a switch in the
box and have the authority and the ability to overrule any of the
calls, which I did not in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The players insist that everything is running smoothly without
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's changed is we don't have as many
jokes,'' Anderson said with a laugh. ``We used to talk bad about
Dan's knees. Now that he's not here, we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes? Dan Reeves?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Reeves might be thought of as one of the league's
more staid coaches. But this season the Falcons have shown that he
has another side. After all, this is the team that, three days
after the fiasco involving a coin flip, had linebacker Jessie
Tuggle walk to midfield with a sign that read, ``HEADS.'' It also
is the team that has given us the latest touchdown celebration
dance, The Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has made progress since being re-admitted. Wednesday, the
doctors allowed him to be a part of the morning team meeting _ via
speakerphone.
</P>
<P>
   His voice was a welcome sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more than anything we miss Dan, the personality and
person,'' Anderson said, before adding a get-well wish. ``The
coaching part of it (the assistant coaches) are handling. Just take
care of yourself right now, Coach Reeves. When we need you is when
the playoff run comes.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he comes back, will there be a ceasefire on the jokes
about Reeves' knees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Anderson said. ``We'll probably give him a
48-hour mercy period, then the jokes fly again.''

   XMAS-BDAYS _ Eula Mae Johnson has always made one thing clear to
her family: Her birthday is on Dec. 25th. Not the 24th or the 26th.
So instead of being overshadowed by Christmas celebrations,
Johnson's family is planning a big celebration in honor of her
100th birthday. She is not alone. Contrary to popular belief, many
metro Atlantans say they don't feel shortchanged by having
Christmas birthdays -- their families still make them feel special.
Story talks to many metro Atlantans about how they juggle the
Christmas/birthday dilemma. (There are at least three children's
books about Christmas birthdays.) (AHill, Atlanta

   BIRTHORDER _ As the family gathers around the Christmas tree or
lights the menorah, remember this: you never outgrow your birth
order. ``If I get together with my brother and sister and they're
in the car, they still want to sit in the back seat and put me in
the middle,'' says psychologist Kevin Leman, 55, author of the
newly updated bestseller ``The Birth Order Book.'' ``And that same
older brother or sister who told you how to run your life as a kid
is in the kitchen telling you how to make the stuffing.'' Family
get-togethers bring out the best, the worst and the child in
everyone, Leman says. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 29.

not only made such a vow last year, but managed to carry through on

   LINKS TO LINK-RULES. Robin Netherton on those jewellike gatefold
photo proportion calculators:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wish I had one too! We were still using them at the Iowa
City Press-Citizen when I left there in 1984. I should have stolen
one while I had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they were called link-rules. We called them
`fences.' If you wind up with a source, please let me know. I would
actually have a use for one in my own graphic work. I still use a
proportion wheel. Have you ever seen the cropping frames that
consist of two L shapes connected by a diagonal metal rod? They're
heavy transparent plastic (mine were orange). The rod is fixed to a
rotating base on one L, and slides through a rotating base on the
other L. You fit your frame to the photo hole, twist the screws on
the bases to stop the rotation, and then slide the frames to as
small or large a size as you wish; the rod preserves the
relationship of the frames so that the rectangles you generate are
all proportional to the original. Much better than the cheap
cardboard free-standing L's we used in journalism school. (Mizzou,
of course.)''
</P>
<P>
   JACOBY WEIGHS IN. Alfred JaCoby, conscience of the Copley chain
in San Diego, Calif., scoffs, ``You used a proportion rule?
Sissy-boy stuff. Out in the hustings, where the reporter-photog
also ran the Fairchild, wrote captions and got his own IDs, we used
a line gauge, held oh-so-high above the print to get the colm width
and then rotated the print slooooowly clockwise to get the depth.
(You had to put your thumb nail right at 12 picas to get the column
measure. Which tells you how long ago that was.)

</P>
<P>
   Sure, Al, we're relaxing our limit of one Missouri mention per
edition just this once. It frees up next week's BONG Bull, the
500th edition, a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   Al couldn't resist adding, ``As for sex in the frate elevator
(God bless your memory, Col. McCormick!), how about in the
temporary newsprint storage room, during the press run, with
pressmen getting supplies at the other end of the room, very
quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the stairway to the composing room, at the Long Beach,
(Calif.) Independent, of blessed memory, the stairway-fire escape
from the composing room was reserved for the printers' nightly
beer-drinking sessions. At the Independent, too, the Linotype
operators were responsible for style (caps, etc) on wire copy. The
late man on the desk took the INS copy, marked grafs, cut the story
to length (nothing more than 6-7 inches due to wartime paper
rationing) and the copyboy, who also kept the morgue-clip file,
carried it to the composing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``(For the benefit of the children among us, wire copy on those
70-word-a-minute teletypes came all-caps and desk men marked
caps.)''
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING TIP. Rick Schwein suggests: ``If you know anybody on
the photo staff at the Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader you might be
able to run down a Link-Rule. They still used them when I left
there eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll leave it to the Lexington folks to offer a remnant sale,
but the suggestion is that few if any editors use any form of
proportion calculator in the age of computing. Slap that baby into
a scanner, diddle some keys and mouse her into the hole. Photo
sizing is on its way to extinction, along with head counting.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF HEAD COUNTING. Do they do it at Chinese and Japanese
copy desks? Do they have rules against ending a line with a
preposition? Do they use acronyms and initials? Would they call
Eisenhower ``Ike?''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST IN WAR, FIRST IN PEACE, AND THIRD TO THE PHOTO DESK. Stan
Wellborn of the Annie E. Casey Foundation alleges:
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the sixties, a young and earnest
photographer-in-training at the Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal was
known around the world as the world's fastest human. That's because
his name was Jim Ryun, and he held the world record in the mile.
Ryun was a mild and pleasant guy who worked summers with the
vaunted, Pulitzer-winning photo staff at the Capital-Journal.
Trouble was, Ryun was not recognized by reporters as anything close
to fast when it came to getting to photo shoots on time. Reporters
finally resorted to arranging backups for most Ryun assignments,
noting that `unless he is on an oval track, he can't find his way
to the finish line.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Ryun is following a much less exalted and noble career
path: He's a member of Congress.''

   COMIX SECTION. The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed''
Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial
Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.
</P>
<P>
   PANEL ONE: At the office Christmas party, Speed and Typo ponder
their take in the gift exchange as Speed observes, ``A
Perrier-monogrammed insulated water bottle holder, Typo! Just what
I always wanted!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo suggests, ``It also works for other beverages, Boss! Just
don't use it at the Bait Shop while we're keeping a low profile
until your bar tab is arbitrated!''
</P>
<P>
   PANEL TWO: Speed uses his present to brush lint off his
trenchcoat, a deathbed gift from an ancient mystic wire service
executive editor on a fog-shrouded eastern island, and enquires,
``So what was your gift, Typo?''
</P>
<P>
   Typo reports, ``A combination paperweight and wastebasket fire
starter molded from pencil-sharpener dust into a bust of Absentee
Publisher Gimlet Peen, Boss! Same as last year!''
</P>
<P>
   PANEL THREE: Speed notes, ``Look at what Features Editor Hyperba
Lee got, Typo!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo marvels, ``An individual-sized 12-pound fruitcake! What
luck, Boss! She can save that for the gift giving next year!''
</P>
<P>
   PANEL FOUR: A hubbub arises from the Sports end of the buffet
table and Typo warns, ``Duck into the Photo Lab, Boss! The guys who
run the football pool are expressing opinions about their gifts!''
</P>
<P>
   PANEL FIVE: Safely barricaded behind the print washer, Speed
counsels his pal, ``Those Sports guys should be more charitable,
Typo! Don't they know it's the thought that counts?''
</P>
<P>
   Typo agrees, ``I think they know that, Boss! What I wonder is
how they found out that those stockings hung by the chimney with
care are the ones we got out of the locker room laundry bucket!''
</P>

IF NOTHING ELSE, THE YEAR WAS FULL OF STRANGE TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the end of 1998 in merciful sight, I've concluded that
people in the news _ especially a certain president _ stayed up
late coming up with cockeyed things to say. As proof, here are my
favorite quotes of the year: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.'' _ Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef, convicted mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The correct answer is nothing.'' _ ABC's Ted Koppel on
qualifications needed to become an American journalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``As long as there are toilets, there'll be newspapers.'' _
Chicago Sun-Times executive Mark Hornung. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.'' _ Guess Who. And, no, it doesn't depend on what I mean
by ``Who.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was
not appropriate.'' _ Who, again, slip-sliding closer to the truth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I misled people, including even my wife.'' _ Who, again,
this time apparently using the past tense of the archaic verb
``misle,'' which has no known meaning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I made a bad mistake.'' _ Who, again, differentiating
between bad and good mistakes, the latter of which don't result in
getting caught. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I think she's burdened by some unfortunate conditions of her
upbringing but she's basically a good person.'' _ Who, again, on
Monica Lewinsky. By the way, Who himself did not have what you
might call the most fortunate of conditions in his own upbringing.
Hmmmm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I would give anything to go back and undo what I did.'' _
Who, again, though not, as I first thought, talking about his
zipper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He is an enormously gifted and richly qualified leader for
our nation but someone who is exasperatingly stupid in his personal
life.'' _ Former White House spokesman Mike McCurry on Guess Who. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I was under that desk 35 years ago, and I could tell you
there's barely room for a 3-year-old.'' _ John F. Kennedy Jr. on
sex in the Oval Office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'll never wash it again.'' _ Lewinsky on her ultimately
crucial semen-stained dress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Look, I will deny it so he will not get screwed in the case,
but I'm not going to get screwed personally.'' _ Lewinsky on
truth-telling, also issuing an apparently accurate sexual
prediction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Comparing him (Saddam Hussein) to cancer gives a bad name to
cancer.'' _ The gentle Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It doesn't say what's going to happen. But as of right now,
I think it is significant for this moment.'' _ Robert Foy, a
Southern Republican Leadership Conference delegate, hedging his
bets on the meaning of a presidential straw poll there led by Gov.
George W. Bush. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You have to understand that males are made up differently
from women, and I try to be sensitive to women. Men compete, get
along and move on with few emotions. But women break down, get
emotional, get so much more out of the game. These are entirely
different sports cultures.'' _ Mega-sensitive Big East commissioner
Mike Tranghese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It
doesn't work.'' _ Alan Metzler, Carnegie Mellon University
economist, suggesting abolishing the International Monetary Fund to
stop its annoying habit of trying to fix world economic crises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The president is the president and he speaks for our
government.'' _ White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, proving
why he got the job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He's too young and stupid to understand what he just did.''
_ Cubs' infielder Mark Grace explaining why pitcher Kerry Wood
didn't grasp the significance of striking out 20 players in one
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The only thing that changes some scientists' opinion is
death.'' _ Louis A. Frank, a University of Iowa physicist often
attacked by other scientists for his snowballs-from-space theory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He spoke too long and, in common with other congenitally
prudent bishops, he is not a burning bush.'' _ Tim Unsworth,
writing in the National Catholic Reporter about Cardinal Francis
George of Chicago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 percent
approval rating, you shouldn't be surprised if the election goes
against you.'' _ Republican Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, on why
the November elections were so disappointing to his party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``God, I'd like to forget all of this. I mean, who needs it?''
_ Rep. Henry Hyde on impeachment, who then made sure no one would
ever forget it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Depend on God to knock the dreams out of their empty
heads.'' _ Official Iraq Revolutionary Command Council and Baath
Party statement on what they called ``American-British
aggression.'' No response yet from God. &QL;
</P>

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the legal and political imbroglio in
Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual misconduct. In
a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only under oath and to
the public but also to his cabinet and White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting news commentaries on loyalty to the president can
be divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general
is an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in the cynical, materialistic 1980s and '90s, few
pay attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping the
bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends _ and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; books by recent administration
officials have not all been discreet, much less supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions.
Loyalty is derided as an instrument of ``political serfdom'' that
stifles disagreement within an administration and keeps appointees
from either resigning in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over the Clinton follies should not blind us to the
long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is indispensable to an
organized society and to orderly and effective governance. No
American president can provide consistent direction in foreign
affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his trust to also
accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. If loyalty does not require
zealotry, neither does it require sycophancy. Neither the president
nor the presidency is well served by a toady intimidated by the
atmosphere of ``fear and fawning'' surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
led to one's appointment in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters than a president who has consistently shown
``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring them
in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress or the
press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's decision involves so overriding a principle
that you can no longer in good conscience continue to believe in
his leadership, much less implement that particular decision, then
it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly submit a
resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it. If you leave a president's side, you
increase the weight of those who advised him differently than you,
and you leave shorthanded those in the administration who share
your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

be divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general
is an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in the cynical, materialistic 1980s and '90s, few
pay attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping the
bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends _ and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; books by recent administration
officials have not all been discreet, much less supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions.
Loyalty is derided as an instrument of ``political serfdom'' that
stifles disagreement within an administration and keeps appointees
from either resigning in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over the Clinton follies should not blind us to the
long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is indispensable to an
organized society and to orderly and effective governance. No
American president can provide consistent direction in foreign
affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his trust to also
accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. If loyalty does not require
zealotry, neither does it require sycophancy. Neither the president
nor the presidency is well served by a toady intimidated by the
atmosphere of ``fear and fawning'' surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
led to one's appointment in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters than a president who has consistently shown
``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring them
in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress or the
press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's decision involves so overriding a principle
that you can no longer in good conscience continue to believe in
his leadership, much less implement that particular decision, then
it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly submit a
resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it. If you leave a president's side, you
increase the weight of those who advised him differently than you,
and you leave shorthanded those in the administration who share
your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

   CANBERRA, Australia _ Iraqi officials have said that United
Nations weapons inspectors will never set foot in their country
again, and the U.N. Security Council has just begun what is likely
to be a lengthy debate on the future of Unscom, its special
commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   So when I left Iraq last week with the rest of the Unscom
inspectors, it may have been for the last time. Now seems an
appropriate moment to ask: Did the American air strikes last week
achieve what Unscom could not _ the disarming of Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the mission's objective was to reduce
Iraq's ability to make chemical and biological weapons. Officials
have reported that about 400 cruise missiles were fired at 100
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets were nine missile development factories, a
petrochemical plant and a biological research laboratory, as well
as military and intelligence establishments, the Republican Guard
headquarters and the building housing the Military Industrial
Commission, which oversees Iraq's special weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the list may appear impressive, the damage done to Iraq's
weapon-making ability was probably marginal. It is almost certain
that no missile hit hidden stockpiles of chemical or biological
bombs (not desirable anyway because of the contamination that would
result).
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors working for Unscom had searched for years for
such arsenals; if the inspectors had not found them, it is unlikely
that the United States, even with its impressive intelligence
resources, would know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the air strikes hit were ``dual purpose'' plants _
that is, sites that have nonmilitary functions but also have the
potential to contribute to the weapon programs. These would include
electronics plants that might be able to make missile guidance
components, steel works that could fabricate warheads and
refineries that could produce chemicals for nerve agents.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, such factories were used
for these very purposes. In uncovering Iraq's biological weapons
program in 1995, our Unscom team found a vaccine plant that Iraq
had converted to the production of biological warfare agents. More
than 5,000 liters of botulinum toxin, a horrific food poisoning
agent, had been produced there in less than two months. After the
war, the plant was converted back to vaccine production.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Unscom was monitoring these dual-purpose sites
closely. Until we evacuated just before last week's bombing, we
routinely inspected 63 factories that could contribute to a missile
program, 120 chemical-related plants and 93 biological plants. At
many of these sites, we had installed cameras, air samplers, heat
sensors and other devices to make sure no banned activity was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The Unscom inspection effort may have had its problems, but this
was one part of our work that was effective. If Iraq was rebuilding
its programs, it was not at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   So although the latest bombings surely destroyed some
dual-purpose operations, that was hardly a crippling blow. And even
those sites that were destroyed won't stay that way. Shortly after
the gulf war, I visited the vast Taji steel works on the outskirts
of Baghdad. Hardly a building remained standing; the devastation,
it seemed, was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I visited it last year, the plant had been completely
rebuilt, with some of the large machines, although pockmarked with
shrapnel, operating as before the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis had learned from their war with Iran to have plans
for the evacuation of vital equipment in times of crisis, and
certainly this was widely practiced in the gulf war. On one of my
early inspections in 1991, I found more than 100 pieces of
equipment for making chemical weapons hidden in a sugar factory at
Mosul, about 185 miles from the Al Muthanna weapons plant from
which they had originated. In short, buildings may have been
obliterated in last week's bombing, but not necessarily vital
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest blow Iraq suffered in the recent bombing
was to its missile development efforts. The cease-fire resolution
ending the gulf war required Iraq to eliminate missiles with a
range of greater than 150 kilometers, or 93 miles. Iraq was
permitted to develop shorter-range missiles, and since the war has
done so under Unscom monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that these shorter-range missiles could be
readily modified, by ``stretching'' the fuel tanks and improving
the guidance systems, into missiles with a range of 600 kilometers
_ sufficient to hit Tel Aviv or Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom has evidence that Iraq is still hiding missile fuel, an
issue that Iraqi officials have refused to discuss in the past
year. Because of this, many of last week's missiles were aimed at
missile manufacturing, launching and test sites. Since there
probably wasn't time to evacuate most of the heavy equipment from
these sites, the bombing has almost surely set back Iraqi missile
development, perhaps for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The news for Iraq's neighbors, and the world, is not so good
regarding Iraq's chemical and biological programs. It is clear,
even from the little information filtering out, that few of the
many plants capable of contributing to these programs have been
destroyed. I believe Iraq could be producing significant quantities
of biological agents within six months. For chemical agents like
nerve gas, the time range is one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver these agents continues to pose a problem for
Iraq, but Unscom has information that Iraq still has about a half
dozen Scud missiles hidden. And if Unscom inspectors or other
monitors are not permitted to return to Baghdad to keep an eye on
Iraq's dual-purpose factories, this threat will grow over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now for the Security Council and the world is how
to contain Iraq. President Clinton has not ruled out future
bombings, but this is no solution, and no one wants a permanent
state of war. The administration also wants to bring down the Iraqi
government, but Saddam Hussein seems remarkably resilient and the
opposition divided and weak. In any case, if Hussein is simply
replaced by his son Uday, the world may be no better off, and some
would argue it will be worse off.
</P>
<P>
   What is required is some creative thinking, but the Security
Council is polarized. Chances have to be taken with any solution,
and perhaps now is the time to consider the phased lifting of
sanctions _ say, over a period of seven years. This is not to
reward Iraq but to provide an incentive for it to accept strict
monitoring to ensure that its industries are not used to rebuild
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply would result in the freezing of sanctions at a
particular phase and restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could
sell. At the same time, tough import controls would be applied to
restrict what it could spend its vast oil wealth on. Through a
combination of carrot and stick, it is possible, just possible,
that Iraq could be brought back to the community of nations.

 &HT;    Bumgardner bounces back for Aggies
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Bumgardner's immediate reward for making the biggest catch
of his career was a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   It figures.
</P>
<P>
   Bumgardner, Texas A&AMP;M's junior wide receiver from Luling, has
been injured so often during his star-crossed football career that
offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe has joked that the Aggies'
training room should be named after him. But a sore ankle was a
small price to pay for the catch that helped sustain A&AMP;M's
remarkable season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also made up for a lot of frustration for me,'' Bumgardner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overshadowed by the hoopla surrounding the Aggies' 36-33
double-overtime victory over Kansas State in the Big 12
championship game was Bumgardner's remarkable catch. Without it,
quarterback Branndon Stewart and tailback Sirr Parker might never
have had the opportunity to become the anointed heroes who led A&AMP;M
to a Sugar Bowl date against third-ranked Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   With A&AMP;M trailing by eight points and in a first-and-25 hole
from the 50-yard line with about 2 1/2 minutes left, Bumgardner ran
a streak route and used his 6-foot-1-inch frame to establish
position on 5-10 cornerback Jerametrius Butler. Stewart lofted a
rainbow over Bumgardner's head that appeared to be long, but the
former track star at Luling stretched out parallel to the ground
and made a diving, blind catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as fine a catch as I've seen in a long time,'' A&AMP;M
Coach R.C. Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a career-long, 36-yard reception for Bumgardner,
not to mention a sore ankle after Butler fell on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't even feel it until I got back to the sideline,''
Bumgardner reported. ``The adrenaline was really pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   After all Bumgardner's been through, a throbbing ankle doesn't
even register on the radar.
</P>
<P>
   His injury problems began his senior season at Luling. After
catching 56 passes for 1,152 yards and 19 touchdowns as a sophomore
and junior, Bumgardner lasted only until the third game of his
senior year before he was sidelined for the rest of the season with
a torn hamstring in a game against Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his inactivity, Bumgardner continued to be recruited by
several schools, including A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma and Texas,
where his grandfather, Max, was a wide receiver for the Longhorns
in the late 1940s. Matt picked A&AMP;M, where Max had served as Coach
Emory Bellard's academic supervisor in the 1970s. The younger
Bumgardner thus became the first Luling athlete to sign with an
NCAA Division I school since tailback Willis Ray Mackey signed with
the University of Washington in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took him based on his junior year, and the fact that we'd
had him in our (summer) camp and knew how fast he could run,''
Slocum said. ``He's a guy who I've thought the whole time he's been
here could be a good player for us if he can ever stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bumgardner has spent an inordinate amount of time running to
the training room. Last year, he caught 10 passes for 127 yards
before missing the Big 12 title game against Nebraska and the
Cotton Bowl against UCLA with a deep thigh bruise. This season, he
caught an 8-yard pass in the opener against Florida State, but
suffered a high ankle sprain in practice the next week that
sidelined him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cleat stuck to ground while I was coming back to catch a
ball,'' he said. ``I was pretty devastated by it. I hate missing
football. And it's hard enough to play at this level even when
you're 100 percent healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumgardner has been productive since his return. He has caught
just nine passes this year, but they've been for 173 yards _ a
healthy average of 19.2 yards. He grabbed his first career
touchdown pass at Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Bumgardner wants to coach. But because injuries have
deprived him of playing opportunities, he wants to play as long as
he can, although he admits to being aware of the possibility of
another injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of my mind because you just never
know,'' he said. ``I know there is only a certain amount of time I
have left to play, so it's so frustrating to miss practice and
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love football. I can't see myself getting away from it.
I want to play until they take my pads away from me. I'm going to
play until I can't play anymore.''

 By MARTY RACINE  
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The would-be paleontologist pondered the question
posed by the inquisitive reporter. After a moment of reflection he
reached his conclusion: ``I'm hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the scientific hotshot is in reality an 8-year-old boy,
rambunctious, precocious, given to matters of great urgency. And
his refined interest in the natural world, formed since the age of
2, does not preclude a childlike presumption that he is at the
center of it.
</P>
<P>
   Meet, if he will keep still long enough, Alexander Lin-Moore of
the Houston-area city of Bellaire. Alex is a dinosaur whiz. He can
name them, size them, explain when, where and how each type lived.
He can even draw them, to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Alex recently parlayed that knowledge into winning a national
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The online challenge, which spanned several months, presented a
series of clues based on paleontology and general trivia that
indicated the location of a buried dinosaur bone.
</P>
<P>
   Alex answered the dinosaur questions. Those were easy. His
parents David Moore and Judy Lin contributed to the others. That
was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working hard there toward the end, it took us awhile
to get some of the last ones,'' says David, a molecular biologist
and professor of cell biology at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They got it right, beating by three hours another entrant who
also answered all questions correctly. When notified by e-mail,
Alex ran around the house jumping and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   His prize is a rare cast, or replica, of the world's largest
dinosaur bone _ a backbone of the Argentinosaurus. At 100 tons, the
Argentinosaurus was the world's largest plant-eating dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot high, 4-foot wide hollow cast, valued at $5,000, was
presented to Alex recently at the Maryland Science Center in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the honors were Argentine paleontologist Rodolfo Coria,
who named the Argentinosaurus after it was discovered by a farmer
in Patagonia, and contest organizer ``Dino Don'' Lessem, a
consultant to Steven Spielberg and Universal Studios for ``Jurassic
Park'' and its sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted it was a kid who won,'' said Lessem, ``even if
Alex is half my size and twice as smart about dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The bone cast will remain in Baltimore until David Letterman's
people decide on a possible appearance by Alex on ``The Late
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in Bellaire, it will briefly reside in Alex's room. Then
the family hopes to loan it to a local museum until Alex turns 21
and can decide what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Alex got to be Alex by visiting museums when the family lived in
Boston, David's hometown. ``To keep him away from Nintendo,'' says
Judy, an ophthalmologist from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not surprise that on a nice, normal street in
Bellaire one boy's collection of videos is heavy on National
Geographic specials. Hot topics like ``Dinosaur Hunters'' and
``T-Rex Exposed,'' which rattle loose when Alex opens the cabinet
and impulsively spreads cassettes on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He jumps over to another drawer containing a tangled pile of
plastic and rubber dinosaur models _ one hesitates to call them
toys _ scaled to size and purchased at museum stores. He piles onto
the couch and ruthlessly tosses them about the coffee table,
explaining the properties of each.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite? ``He has rotating favorites,'' Judy says with a
mother's patience.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Alex has seen ``Jurassic Park.'' He was too young
during its theater run, so when he was about 5 he viewed it on home
video. ``We only saw it essentially in fast-forward,'' says Judy.
``He would say, `This is boring.' Or, `This is scary.' ``And he
would say, `That's not right.''' Hollywood can't fool him. Nor can
school automatically teach him. In his third-grade class at
Bellaire's Horn Elementary they do study science and dinosaurs and
stuff, Alex says, shrugging his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I already know everything.''

NEW HOST OF `THE DAILY SHOW' IS NO LONGER A RUNNER-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He is not an author, but he wrote a book. He is
not an actor, but he is in movies. He is a stand-up comic, but he
doesn't do that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And Jon Stewart is not a talk show host. Well, actually, he is.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like not to be good at anything, so I keep hopping around,''
he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, Stewart will take over ``The Daily Show,'' Comedy
Central's 11 p.m. weekday satirical alternative to the nightly
news. It's something of an odd choice in light of the man he is
replacing: Craig Kilborn left the show Dec. 18 for CBS, where early
next year he will take over for Tom Snyder on ``The Late Late
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are different: Kilborn is 6-feet-5-inches, blond, cocky
and sardonic. The strength of his humor is that he and the viewers
are in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 36, is short, dark and self-deprecating. The strength
of his humor is that he and the viewers are the butt of the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am probably more neurotic,'' Stewart said of the comparison,
during a recent telephone interview. ``I will probably be drunk for
the first month.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he hadn't gotten the ``Daily'' chair, Stewart would
still be on a roll. He appears in two upcoming movies (``The
Faculty'' and ``Dancing About Architecture'') and wrote the
recently published ``Naked Pictures of Famous People,'' a
collection of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he won't give himself his due props.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in a movie you are an actor but you are not an
actor,'' Stewart said. ``I could be in 20 movies and I would not be
Rip Torn. Whatever I'm in I want to be competent.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had an inflated opinion of himself, it would have been
punctured by the last several years as an also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up to Conan O'Brien for the NBC ``Late Night.'' Runner-up
to Kilborn for the Snyder slot. Like real life, he was a runner-up
to no one to replace Garry Shandling on ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
The HBO comedy was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had moved in with Garry,'' Stewart said of possibly
continuing the show, in which he played a young guest host looking
to unseat Sanders. ``It was a lot of two-in-the-morning giggling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart agrees it was right not to continue the show:
``Everyone had the foresight not to put themselves into an `After
MASH' situation. Everybody sort of understood this was a
gold-standard show.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Daily Show'' is as topical as any mainstream
daily news show. Writers begin poring over newspapers and working
on material by 9 a.m. By early afternoon, the show begins forming,
a process that evolves right up until taping at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who hosted an MTV talk show in 1994 and 1995 but failed
in a later syndicated gabfest, said television talk shows had
changed from the days of Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real difference is the speed in which entertainment has to
occur,'' he said. ``They have to fill it with a shiny light ... or
someone from `Baywatch.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere of the shows have changed,'' he continued.
There is a real casual comfort to the old Carsons which don't exist
today, and maybe couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show'' is fast. It's topicality was evident Dec. 16:
U.S. and British forces attacked Iraq at around 5 p.m. Eastern, but
Kilborn was able to put a ``Perversion Diversion '98'' package
together for that night. So it's sort of useless for Stewart to
script out a show now. He is not even sure what format changes will
be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper it is the exact same show,'' Stewart said. ``It's the
natural evolution of the show. It will end up being different.''
</P>
<P>
   One change is the name _ to ``The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of weeks we are adding `Exalted ruler of funny,'''
he said. For someone who comes across as the anti-Kilborn, humble
and unassuming, the name seems forced.
</P>
<P>
   On that Dec. 16 show, Stewart appeared as Kilborn's guest (He
nailed each of the ``Five Questions,'' when the host asks five
off-the-wall questions). Stewart seemed at times comfortable, at
other times on the edge of his seat. It goes back to some advice
Kilborn gave him about the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look anybody in the eye,'' Stewart recalled.
``Apparently everybody is a little jittery.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart looked ill-at-ease, it was because he was sitting in
the wrong chair. Once he takes over Kilborn's, he'll be fine.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The world is now digesting the grave consequences of the use of
force by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. By
arrogating to itself the functions of prosecutor, judge and court
marshal, the United States has dealt a heavy blow to the United
Nations _ and to the hopes of establishing a just and effective
international legal order.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, most believe Russia's opinion on the U.S. air strikes
was simply ignored. Many politicians, even such serious ones as
Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, are now saying that as a response to
this show of power, Russia should be rebuilding its own economic,
political and military might.
</P>
<P>
   By using military force, Washington was not defying just Russia
alone. The United States also dismissed the viewpoints of China,
India, France, Italy and the League of Arab States, all of whom
subsequently objected strongly to the bombing raids. The reaction
in Russia, at this time, is symptomatic. It follows naturally from
what has happened to the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the failure of Boris Yeltsin's political and economic
course has been laid bare. One crisis after another this past year
has dramatized the consequences of his misguided policies. The
financial collapse that started last August has hit even those
Russians _ the 10 percent to 15 percent of the population _ who
actually had benefited from the ``reforms.'' As for the majority of
Russian citizens, even Yeltsin himself has had to admit that, yes,
they live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these pseudo-reforms, which have done great harm to
Russia's economy, to its health and education systems, to its
science and culture, were applauded by the West. There was pro-U.S.
euphoria in Russia at one point; but today this has given way to
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our people are wondering: ``Why does the United
States so much like the policies that are so bad for us?''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, Washington's reactions are just wrong. When, for
example, the failure of Russia's previous governments forced yet
another change and the appointment of the cabinet of Yevgeny
Primakov, Washington's response was wrong. By freezing the loans
promised to the previous Russian cabinet, the International
Monetary Fund followed suit and made things even more difficult _
all of this at a time when Primakov is desperately trying to
stabilize our situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the West and in the Russian media, his cabinet is often
called pro-Communist and anti-reform. As I have said time and
again, this is far from the truth. In fact, the new Russian cabinet
is made of pragmatic, no-nonsense people. Its leaders are far from
being fly-by-night trend-setters; they are not fooling around. They
are wise men who are concerned about the country's future and
understand that there can be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of cabinet that gives Russia a chance
to gradually extricate itself from a post-Cold War crisis that dims
the bright future we envisioned just a short time ago. It is
Primakov's kind of cabinet that will give this country a chance to
integrate into the global economy and establish long-term
cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are not going to simply jump on the bandwagon and
support without reservation whatever the United States might do,
nor should the rest of the world expect such thoughtless
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that, but for the U.S. attack against Iraq, the
Primakov government would have secured the Russian parliament's
ratification of the START II treaty. It has collected dust in the
Duma since 1993; after promising work by Primakov, the talks were
likely to resume. After what has happened, this will be an uphill
task. As it is, one aide to President Yeltsin has already stated
carelessly that ``one may well give up'' on the arms-control
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   How disappointing on the eve of the 21st century, when peace and
diplomacy are the only right road.
</P>
<P>
   On trying to secure ratification of the treaty, as on many other
issues, the Russian cabinet has to contend with interference from
all kinds of quarters. What is needed is something quite different
_ to help this government and thus help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Americans often ask me: Why should we help Russia? Often the
question is posed sincerely and in good faith. But other times one
detects the barely submerged tone of a self-proclaimed ``victor''
in the Cold War. There is no victor; I believe it is plain that
moving into the future, we all must stand together.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of America's omnipotence, now so
common among U.S. politicians, will one day vanish and it will
become clear that in today's world NO ONE can have a monopoly on
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the bombs rained on Iraq, new centers of
economic power and political influence were continuing to emerge.
Alliances may shift; Russia could become a strong and friendly
partner to the West. But today many people regard such a prospect
as highly unlikely, and recent U.S. actions have not brought it any
closer.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a major effort by both sides in the coming year to
put things back on course.

<P>
   The world is now digesting the grave consequences of the use of
force by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. By
arrogating to itself the functions of prosecutor, judge and court
marshal, the United States has dealt a heavy blow to the United
Nations _ and to the hopes of establishing a just and effective
international legal order.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, most believe Russia's opinion on the U.S. air strikes
was simply ignored. Many politicians, even such serious ones as
Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, are now saying that as a response to
this show of power, Russia should be rebuilding its own economic,
political and military might.
</P>
<P>
   By using military force, Washington was not defying just Russia
alone. The United States also dismissed the viewpoints of China,
India, France, Italy and the League of Arab States, all of whom
subsequently objected strongly to the bombing raids. The reaction
in Russia, at this time, is symptomatic. It follows naturally from
what has happened to the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the failure of Boris Yeltsin's political and economic
course has been laid bare. One crisis after another this past year
has dramatized the consequences of his misguided policies. The
financial collapse that started last August has hit even those
Russians _ the 10 percent to 15 percent of the population _ who
actually had benefited from the ``reforms.'' As for the majority of
Russian citizens, even Yeltsin himself has had to admit that, yes,
they live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these pseudo-reforms, which have done great harm to
Russia's economy, to its health and education systems, to its
science and culture, were applauded by the West. There was pro-U.S.
euphoria in Russia at one point; but today this has given way to
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our people are wondering: ``Why does the United
States so much like the policies that are so bad for us?''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, Washington's reactions are just wrong. When, for
example, the failure of Russia's previous governments forced yet
another change and the appointment of the cabinet of Yevgeny
Primakov, Washington's response was wrong. By freezing the loans
promised to the previous Russian cabinet, the International
Monetary Fund followed suit and made things even more difficult _
all of this at a time when Primakov is desperately trying to
stabilize our situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the West and in the Russian media, his cabinet is often
called pro-Communist and anti-reform. As I have said time and
again, this is far from the truth. In fact, the new Russian cabinet
is made of pragmatic, no-nonsense people. Its leaders are far from
being fly-by-night trend-setters; they are not fooling around. They
are wise men who are concerned about the country's future and
understand that there can be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of cabinet that gives Russia a chance
to gradually extricate itself from a post-Cold War crisis that dims
the bright future we envisioned just a short time ago. It is
Primakov's kind of cabinet that will give this country a chance to
integrate into the global economy and establish long-term
cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are not going to simply jump on the bandwagon and
support without reservation whatever the United States might do,
nor should the rest of the world expect such thoughtless
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that, but for the U.S. attack against Iraq, the
Primakov government would have secured the Russian parliament's
ratification of the START II treaty. It has collected dust in the
Duma since 1993; after promising work by Primakov, the talks were
likely to resume. After what has happened, this will be an uphill
task. As it is, one aide to President Yeltsin has already stated
carelessly that ``one may well give up'' on the arms-control
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   How disappointing on the eve of the 21st century, when peace and
diplomacy are the only right road.
</P>
<P>
   On trying to secure ratification of the treaty, as on many other
issues, the Russian cabinet has to contend with interference from
all kinds of quarters. What is needed is something quite different
_ to help this government and thus help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Americans often ask me: Why should we help Russia? Often the
question is posed sincerely and in good faith. But other times one
detects the barely submerged tone of a self-proclaimed ``victor''
in the Cold War. There is no victor; I believe it is plain that
moving into the future, we all must stand together.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of America's omnipotence, now so
common among U.S. politicians, will one day vanish and it will
become clear that in today's world NO ONE can have a monopoly on
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the bombs rained on Iraq, new centers of
economic power and political influence were continuing to emerge.
Alliances may shift; Russia could become a strong and friendly
partner to the West. But today many people regard such a prospect
as highly unlikely, and recent U.S. actions have not brought it any
closer.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a major effort by both sides in the coming year to
put things back on course.

DREAMIN' OF AN UN-PC CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This Christmas there are many reasons to be
joyful. For one thing, we can call it Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan,
Kwanzaa, a bad time to try to park, Furby hell, 'tis the season for
impeachment, or anything we want.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to call it ``the holidays'' when, in fact, we get
no rest. We don't have to call it a ``season'' when it's just the
most expensive part of one.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to say ``the winter solstice'' and sound like
pagans, which so many of us are, as proven by our heathen trees
propped in pans of water.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we have received one big present in 1998, and we're very
thankful: This is the year political correctness became incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   We still ought to be thoughtful and polite. But we don't have to
be self-consciously sensitive and sound like Hillary Rodham Clinton
giving a December speech in the Rose Garden when all we're doing is
thanking a sales clerk.
</P>
<P>
   So I call it Christmas, referring not to Christianity, but to
the most sacred day in the religion of American materialism. Until
the middle of the last century American Puritans considered the
celebration of Christmas blasphemous _ one of several good points
about my much-maligned Puritan ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Count all our new blessings, now that PC is DOA.
</P>
<P>
   During the cold snap this week, my wife walked all over downtown
San Francisco. She wore her fur coat, the first time she's worn it
in the city since I grudgingly bought it for her 11 years ago when
she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die, the foxes can skin and wear me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, she didn't die. And fortunately, last week we
didn't walk past a demonstration of paint-throwing anti-fur nuts in
front of a department store.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, punk, we wear fur and leather, and we believe in
the right to keep and bear grudges, so get lost.
</P>
<P>
   We ate veal shank at that festively decorated La Rondalla for
the rich, Le Central. It's a bistro patronized by many Republicans,
including our leading lifestyle Republican, San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown. That's another thing. In San Francisco, you can like
Republicans again. Not only are Republicans almost extinct here,
but they've destroyed themselves in Washington, too.
</P>
<P>
   The people who brought us the Defense of Marriage Act gave a
standing O to a congressman who committed adultery. Right-wing
political correctness has gone down the tubes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking was outlawed in California bars. The war on drugs
certainly teaches us the effectiveness of making things illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Bars have done what comes naturally. Some are non-smoking bars,
while others have remained smoking bars. The latter cater to those
too young to care about dying, or those already embalmed on their
bar stools.
</P>
<P>
   We've reached a truce. If you don't like smoke in a bar, walk on
to one with clear air. You don't dial 911 when you detect
secondhand smoke. The cops have enough to do protecting people from
firsthand bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco police don't want to sort out cigarette
smokers from those legally smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Male chauvinists finally are safe from feminists in San
Francisco and other hotbeds of the cold shoulder and frosty stare.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem issued impassioned defenses of
an executive who cheated on his hard-working wife by having bad sex
with a 21-year-old employee.
</P>
<P>
   The executive claimed she was having sex with him, but he wasn't
having sex with her, and the feminist elite defended him.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, guys, I'd say anything that isn't actually
illegal goes. As long as you don't get slugged, of course.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to be as multiculturally sensitive as we used to
be. There's even a group in San Francisco called the Wonderbread 5,
a ``Jackson 5 Tribute Group'' of white guys in Afro wigs, with a
white wig for the one who plays Michael Jackson. They'll be at the
Velvet Lounge on New Year's Eve, and we'll see if they live.
</P>
<P>
   What other joys are there? We can eat hunks of red meat. We can
drink Manhattans or chug Bud. We're recovering from the recovery
movement. As someone told me, ``You don't have to go into recovery
until you hit bottom, and I'm still going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, you can be unapologetic about giving your children
violent toys, and I don't just mean ones that do violence to sanity
like the Furby.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, violent video games always take place in a
futuristic Los Angeles, which is fine with me. There is no other
kind of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A video game called Future Cop, L.A.P.D. involves zapping
``mutant crooks packin' thermo nukes, bio-agents, and other bad
mojo (who) are laying siege to the City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not so bad, compared to the mutant shoppers at the malls
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the violence in toys occurs trying to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   If I get that BB gun I've always wanted for Christmas, just wait
until you hear my riff on guns. It'll put your ear out.

IS ANDREW YOUNG DEAF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There was a time when Andrew Young had no difficulty
recognizing persecution. There was a time when he lifted his voice
for victims and made no excuses for oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   But the civil rights movement in which Young rose to prominence
ended long ago. His mentor, Martin Luther King, has been gone these
30 years. And the moral stature Young acquired in his youth he
seems willing to squander as he approaches old age.
</P>
<P>
   Young recently traveled to China with a small delegation from
the National Council of Churches, of which he is president-elect.
China is in its fourth year of a brutal government crackdown on
Christian religious activity; more than 140 underground church
members have been arrested in just the last few weeks. Young might
have been expected to speak out on their behalf and condemn the
Communist regime for its cruelty. He might have been expected, for
example, to demand justice for Cheng Meiying _ an evangelist from
Hunan Province who was arrested on Oct. 26 and taken to the prison
in Wugang, where the police beat and whipped her so ferociously
that she became brain-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   What Young said, however, was: ``We found no sign of religious
repression.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Did we find religious freedom in the US sense? No. But we
found no . . . active persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``There are a lot of nuts in Atlanta that we've put in jail
for preaching on &UR;  &LR; street corners and disrupting traffic. How can I
. . . make judgments about a nation this large, with more than a
billion people?''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it is no crime to be a Christian in the People's
Republic of China _ so long as you worship in an officially
registered ``patriotic'' church, with ministers who have been
approved by the Communist Party and who renounce all ties to any
overseas entity. Which means that it is a crime for a Chinese
Catholic to proclaim the authority of the Pope. It is a crime to
hold a prayer meeting in an unofficial ``house church.'' It is a
crime to travel the country and preach the Gospel. It is a crime to
speak in tongues, to baptize children, to teach of a second coming,
or to condemn abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Has the National Council of Churches anything to say about this?
It does. ``Christians in China,'' declares the NCC's general
secretary, Joan Brown Campbell, ``are terribly offended at the tide
of rumor that there's widespread, terrible persecution and asked us
to advocate for a more accurate portrayal of their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   House churches, in which the vast majority of China's Christians
worship, are under heavy pressure to register formally with the
government Religious Affairs Bureau. According to Nina Shea,
director of the Center for Religious Freedom at Freedom House,
their leaders have been warned that they will be ``eradicated''
unless they give in. Stand fast, and they may be arrested, beaten _
or worse. Submit, and they risk their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing makes no secret of its antireligious bigotry. Ye
Xiaowen, head of the Religious Affairs Bureau, calls house churches
``evil, illegal organizations that undermine social order.'' But
Young and the NCC leadership, blind to the suffering of their
fellow Christians, give their seal of approval to the world's
largest dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government,'' Young maintains, ``has recognized
the role of religion in stabilizing and encouraging people to live
moral and responsible lives.'' Adds Sharon Maeda, the NCC's deputy
general secretary: ``It is clear that the government of the
People's Republic of China welcomes the good citizenship and
community leadership of Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Winchell remarked in 1938 that the reason Neville
Chamberlain flew to Munich to see Hitler was because ``you can't
lick a man's boots over the phone.'' It is not hard to figure out
why Andrew Young flew to China.
</P>
<P>
   The bootlicking of totalitarians is an old story with the NCC.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 it published ``China: Search for Community,'' which
described the Cultural Revolution _ a time of heart-stopping
savagery, when Mao's Red Guards imprisoned, tortured, or killed
tens of thousands of victims _ as an ``outstanding campaign'' for
``moral renewal'' that ``emphasized community interest,
anti-elitism, commitment to revolutionary social goals, dignity of
manual labor, equality of women and men, and education for the
common people.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later an NCC official told Congress that North Koreans
_ then ruled by Kim Il Sung, a Stalinist tyrant _ ``are proud of
their beautiful cities, schools, health facilities, apartments,
immigration projects, dams, and locks.''
</P>
<P>
   A mission to the Soviet Union organized by the NCC in 1984
ended, The New York Times recorded, ``with praise for the status of
religion in the Soviet Union and condemnation of the US role in the
arms race.'' NCC leaders complained ``that the harmony of their
visit had been marred when two demonstrators, demanding religious
freedom, held up banners during a Baptist church service.'' The
sign holders were promptly hustled off; one was later sent to the
gulag. The NCC did not object. ``In the United States,'' the
mission leader said, ``a situation like this would have been
handled by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   So nothing has changed at the NCC, where the incoming president
compares persecuted evangelicals in China to ``nuts in Atlanta''
who disrupt traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas, millions of Chinese Christians will at great
risk celebrate the birth of their savior. May God watch over them
and shield them from harm. The National Council of Churches surely
won't.
</P>

LARRY FLYNT'S PARTNERS IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months ago, Salon magazine reported that ``diehard Clinton
loyalists'' were spreading the word that ``a long-ignored but
fearsome tactic has now resurfaced as an element in the president's
survival strategy: The threat of exposing the sexual improprieties
of Republican critics both in Congress and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the Doomsday Machine here,'' a close
Clinton ally told the on-line publication. ``Once the Doomsday
Machine is set in motion, there will be no stopping it. The
Republicans with skeletons in their closets must assume everything
is known and will come out. So the question is: Do they really want
to go there?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, they really did want to go there. And in the
end, they built a strong enough case to compel a majority of the
House of Representatives to impeach President Clinton on one count
of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice. They were not
deterred by blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   But the Doomsday Machine _ or something like it _ did its
damage. The fact that Representative Dan Burton had fathered a son
out of wedlock was exposed and duly reported in the press.
Representative Helen Chenoweth's affair with a married man was
exposed and duly reported in the press. House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde's extramarital affair of 30 years ago was
exposed and duly reported in Salon, which justified publication by
saying ``ugly times require ugly tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston's
extramarital affairs cost him his job and his political career.
Livingston delivered the news himself, in advance of what he knew
would be certain publication on Hustler magazine's Web site.
``Desperate times,'' said Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, ``deserve
desperate actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt injected himself into the impeachment process two months
ago. He ran a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post
offering a reward of up to $1 million for anyone who could prove
having had an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member of
Congress or a high-ranking government official. The real purpose of
the ad, Flynt said, was to gather dirt on GOP legislators to derail
the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is the publisher of what may be the most nihilistic and
misogynistic magazine in America. He is also a self-described
partisan Democrat, a fan of President Clinton's and a friend of
Clinton political strategist James Carville. Many Republican
legislators believe he is an active cog in the Doomsday Machine or
something like it. But they offer no hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt chooses his words carefully when asked if the GOP charges
are true. ``I can assure you I've had no contact with the White
House,'' he told Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post. ``I don't get
my marching orders from them.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without White House marching orders, Flynt's desperate
actions will continue. Interviewed Tuesday on National Public
Radio's ``Fresh Air,'' Flynt said he would publish the names of as
many as 12 politicians whose infidelities he could document. Asked
when exactly he would make this information available, Flynt
replied: ``In the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, after he became the first elected president in
American history to be impeached, Clinton piously intoned: ``We
must stop the politics of personal destruction. We must get rid of
the poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity
and uncontrolled anger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the president's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, was
asked if the president would call Flynt and request that he desist
from publishing the names of Republican legislators who may have
had extramarital affairs. No, said Lockhart, he would not.
</P>
<P>
   And so the politics of personal destruction continue apace.
Assuming that Flynt has enough evidence to go forward with
publication, the reputations of as many as 12 more politicians will
be destroyed for the stated purpose of enabling one man to keep an
office he has disgraced.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the vote on impeachment, the president's defenders
are now doing everything they can to discredit that vote. In this
effort they have been so far surprisingly successful. The
president's job approval ratings are at record highs. Two-thirds of
the electorate opposes his removal from office. Sentiment for some
kind of censure resolution is building in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But their efforts reveal the moral bankruptcy of their politics.
They have become partners in the politics of Larry Flynt. They are
burning the village to save it. And with each passing day, their
conduct and complicity in this ongoing disgrace makes censure less
likely and conviction more possible.

   LINCOLN, Mass. -- The time is soon coming when ``modern'' or
``contemporary'' houses built in this half of the 20th century will
be candidates for preservation. And for the same reasons that
people prize 18th- and 19th-century houses. They are often better
constructed than today's contractor's special. If commissioned from
an architect, they are part of design history. The best of them are
still very livable.
</P>
<P>
   When a house designed by Hugh Stubbins in 1952 recently became
available, Michael and Shelley Peyette McGarry only needed one
look. ``We fell in love with the property and the house,'' says
Shelley. ``On the first visit, we peeked in the windows, and it was
so neat.''
</P>
<P>
   A good thing too, because most real estate people figured the
house for a ``tear down.'' Great land, they could hear clients say,
but my dear, the bathroom! (there was just the one), and the
kitchen's a joke. Better to lose the house and begin again.
</P>
<P>
   The McGarrys were happy with the house as it was. But they faced
one enormous hurdle. The 6 acres on which it sat had been
subdivided. New homes were already under construction on two of the
2-acre parcels. The Stubbins house was within the reconfigured
property line but not quite enough to satisfy the law. The McGarrys
decided to do what 18th- and 19th-century homeowners did: They had
the house jacked up and moved on rollers. Moreover, Gordon Building
Movers of Hingham, Mass. used the traditonal way of lifting the
house _ by giant wooden screws turned by bars. There were 10 screws
and the crew gave each a quarter turn, inching the house up and
over the bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studied Stubbins's plans
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moving and saving ``was cheaper than building a new house,''
Mike McGarry told a recent visitor. He laughs and adds, ``it should
have been quicker.'' An engineer by training, he acted as the
renovation designer; for reference he had Stubbins's own plans,
from the archives at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where
Stubbins had been Walter Gropius's assistant and later the
department chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln there's an awful lot of Mother Nature in the form of
boulders and ledge. Stubbins put this to good use, butting the
easterly ``Boston'' end of the house into the hillcrest and decking
the westerly ``Worcester'' end with steps down to the gardens.
Repositioning exactly reverses that. Because the McGarrys moved the
house 94 feet (toward Boston) they had to put in new water and gas
lines and a new leach field, and that meant blasting and more
blasting. ``It was slooow,'' Shelley McGarry agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The family spent the summer on site, living in a trailer in a
grove off the driveway. The hammock is still there, and the two
tree houses. They just made it into the new house for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The McGarrys had been looking to leave Cambridge and move
farther out, perhaps as far as Southborough. They wanted good
schools for Owen, who's 6, and Marina, 5, and Lincoln has those.
They like the country, and Lincoln, with its conservation land,
guarantees plenty of that. That Hugh Stubbins had actually designed
the house was awesome. If you're the daughter and sibling of
architects _ Shelley's father is Thomas Peyette _ you grow up
knowing Stubbins's contribution to the cityscape.
</P>
<P>
   To name but three: There's the Federal Reserve building in
Boston (``one of my favorites,'' Stubbins said in a phone interview
from retirement in Florida). There's the CitiCorp. building in New
York City. And there's the tallest building in Japan, a 70-story
tower in Yokohama topped by a 600-room hotel overlooking Tokyo Bay
and, on a clear day, a view of Mount Fuji. This was Stubbins's last
project, and when he and his wife, June, stayed there recently he
``was treated like a king,'' he says, sounding pleased.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lots of glass
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was all ahead of Stubbins in the early 1950s, when Mr. &AMP;
Mrs. Arthur Baggs, he an engineer and she an artist, approached him
to design a house for a hilly pasture in Lincoln. Elsewhere in
suburbia developers were buying up old fields and planting them
with ranch houses or Capes; in common with ranches, the Stubbins is
a rectangle, about 24 by 48 feet, and on one level. There the
comparison ends. No picture window but lots and lots of glass. Each
end of the house is glass. In the living room, it goes from the
floor all the way up the gable; at the bedroom end, from waist-high
to gable. Most rooms have a band of windows. Not exactly New
England, you might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that any building should have a regional
character,'' Stubbins says. He was born Jan. 11, 1912, in
Birmingham, Ala., went to Georgia Tech, and got his master's in
architecture at Harvard's GSD. The Cambridge firm he founded
continues as the Stubbins Associates. ``There's a New England taste
to the houses I built,'' he says, ``certainly the later ones.'' New
England, for him, means high ceilings in living rooms. With the
dining alcove, the Lincoln living room runs the width (24 feet) of
the house, but by taking the ceiling up to the rafters, Stubbins
pumped air into space and made the room light and buoyant. It has a
big feel to it. Nor is your eye stopped by walls. While the house
is not an open plan, there are vistas. If you face the living room
fireplace, there's light to the left from the stair entry and an
immediate connection to arriving guests.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Shelley reports, especially loves the window design.
As an architect, Thomas Peyette specializes in hospitals, medical
centers, labs, and schools. ``My father is very interested in
light. He feels it's important to be able to look out a window and
locate yourself in space. He's a very outdoorsy person, and he
loves this house. We think it's even better now that it has been
moved. The repositioning has made it much more intimate. You look
up into the trees, especially the entertaining end of the house. It
feels like a tree house.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the McGarrys lack for flowering shrubs. ``The place is
loaded with lilacs,'' Mike says. ``There's tons of honeysuckle, two
dozen crab apples, and cedars along the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's furniture took to the new house at once. Shelley
Peyette had grown up with modernist furniture. She then got
interested in Arts &AMP; Crafts. ``I got Mike started. His father,
Robert McGarry, collects early American and native American. The
Arts &AMP; Crafts we have is perfect for here: The wood warms the place
up. Mike loves wood, he's a wood man, he's a wood collector.'' From
curly maple he made a baby's chair; the living room couch is his
creation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passion for built-ins
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stubbins says he always liked doing built-ins, and the McGarrys
have the benefit of that. The cleverest is the common wall between
the entry stair and the first bedroom. On the entry side is a coat
closet with sliding door. (Arthur Baggs trumped Stubbins by making
the door into gallery space for his wife's art and made a hall into
another gallery.) On the bedroom side is a wall of built-ins. No
door or drawer knobs but big, burnished brass circles, subtle and
insistent, that say: ``Pull me, pull me.'' Pull one, and a desk
flaps forward.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the house is clear-heart redwood, vertically
grained, which Stubbins treated with a Cabot bleaching stain to
weather it a New England gray. He used the same wood for some
interior walls. ``Bringing the outdoors indoors,'' he calls it.
Another way of blurring the boundary between the built and the
natural is ending the roof rafter in a lattice. As houses go, this
one looks tiny, when compared with its new neighbors, the hulking
three-garage ``custom Colonials'' down slope. A cunning economy
gives it amplitude. ``Borrowing space from something else,''
Stubbins says.
</P>
<P>
   The McGarrys have followed suit. When the house was moved, space
under the living room was freed up. Here the McGarrys have built a
family room with fireplace and another bathroom, as well as a
utility room and a cavern for storage. Parts of the kitchen will be
refitted. The 1952 plans simply indicated where a dishwasher might
go. Stubbins is all in favor of improvements. ``A lot of kitchen
equipment didn't exist when I designed the house.'' The McGarrys
like the original birch cabinets with their obscured-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, traffic made it impossible for the McGarry
children go anywhere alone, says their mother. ``Here, they play
outdoors all the time. They go adventuring. They're discovering
animals. A little girl from one of the new houses has come to play.
The really new thing is having their own bedrooms. They're really
experiencing what it is to be grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perfect match
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing,'' Shelley McGarry continued, ``is a perfect
match for us. I'm just tickled how the move met every single need
of mine. It's the country, but I have friends. The children love
their schools. I have a studio.'' For many years, a graphics
designer who worked on museum and zoo installations, she has moved
into jewelry design. Michael McGarry is an engineer with the
Primary Group of Boston; his most recent project was the new
federal courthouse on Boston's Fan Pier. ``The house is great for
Mike. He's intrigued with the way the structural and the aesthetic
work together. My father loves the way Mike takes a challenge and
makes something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarry has plans to grow the Stubbins house. He stood the other
day on rock outcropping that is a prime candidate for an alpine
garden. The rock is pocketed with holes for future piers for a new
building that will run alongside the original. A bridge will
connect the two. ``Son of Stubbins'' (so to speak) will have the
new living room and dining room and kitchen with a mechanical room
underneath. There is no timetable for this, McGarry says. But a
date to shoot for is 2002, when the original turns 50.

SECRETARY COHEN, LEAVE THE KID ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is now official US policy that it's OK to bomb the Iraqis,
but not to write anything on the bomb casing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon this week found it necessary to apologize for some
graffiti scrawled on the side of a 2,000-pound laser-guided bomb
being loaded aboard the carrier USS Enterprise for delivery during
the 70-hour air assault on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Among other messages, the bomb bore the inscription: ``Here's a
Ramadan present from Chad Rickenberg.'' After the Associated Press
moved a photo of the bomb, the Defense Department said it was
``distressed'' at the ``thoughtless graffiti'' referring to the
Holy Month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious intolerance is anathema to the Secretary of Defense,
William S. Cohen, and to all Americans who respect the right to
worship freely,'' said Ken Bacon, Cohen's spokesman. The US
appreciates the contributions of Muslim Americans to the military,
he added. ``This incident is a rare exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the ``gotcha'' mentality of Washington and the military,
not to speak of the news media, one hopes that Navy man Rickenberg
is not eating bread and water for his Christmas dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I think official praise for the contributions of Muslim
Americans and respect for Ramadan is a fine thing. But does the
brass have to land like a ton of bricks on a young man, far from
home at Yuletide, doing a very dangerous job, serving his country?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cohen is a topnotch public servant; he and wife Janet
Langhart made a flying holiday tour to Kuwait and two US carriers
for the purpose of saluting the 20,000 American servicemen and
women in the theater, including Lieutenant Kendra Williams, 26, who
flew her FA-18 fighter-bomber off the Enterprise, one of 16 woman
combat pilots aboard. And one careless jibe by an ordnance-handler
scarcely ranks with the destructive power of a 2,000-pound laser
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if the GIs who won World War II fought under similar
politically correct instructions, I consulted Bob Healy, the
retired Globe political columnist, who at age 18 joined the US
bomber crews that flew out of England to rain destruction upon
Hitler's armies.Did Healy ever see graffiti on bombs destined for
the Axis crowd? ``Sure. It was done all the time. Some of them were
pretty obscene, very hostile. They'd paint stuff on the bombs. In
those days, they'd take your picture for Yank Magazine. There was
no political correctness then. It was us-vs.-them. Now? Forget it.
We've gone overboard on this political correctness, haven't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Healy was a ball-turrent gunner on B-17s, four-engine long-range
bombers that could carry two 1,000-pound bombs, or four
500-pounders, as well as sticks of smaller bombs, or firebombs. ``I
was also an armament guy,'' said Healy, who survived 35 combat
missions. ``So when a bomb would get stuck in the bomb bay, or a
stick got hung up, you'd have to go down there and kick 'em out. I
wasn't one of those guys who painted things on bombs. I always
figured getting back was more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But he saw plenty of nasty messages directed to Hitler and his
helpers. ``Some of the planes had nicknames or stuff painted
outside the cockpit that was pretty raw. It all depended on the
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy has complete sympathy with the young ordnanceman who is
risking his life, handling dangerous munitions, on orders from the
highest reaches of his government. The whole purpose is to prevent
Saddam from getting up another head of steam in the unstable Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' said Healy, who just completed a
diplomatic hitch in the US Embassy in Ireland, where fighting over
religious symbols has been a bloody pastime for 800 years. ``I can
understand the objection to what he wrote. But he's over there
fighting for his country. They don't have to pat the kid on the
back. But they shouldn't kick him in the ass. That's his way of
saying why he's over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighters who risk all defending the American way of life at
century's end catch hell if they have illicit love affairs, are gay
and admit it, or run afoul of the rules or get accused, fairly or
unfairly, of sexual or racial indiscretions. At some point, the
country is going to need as many fighters as it can lay hands on at
any given moment. And punishing fighters who are doing their job
adequately for the sake of politically correct rules is not a trend
that, in the long run, will bolster our fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a modicum of education and cultural awareness can
understand why religious symbolism is a powerful motivator.And the
news photo of an American bomb with a Ramadan reference will
undoubtedly give offense, just as the routine TV news footage of
the burning of American flags is intended to give offense. Our
laser bombs, and the 400 cruise missiles at $1 million a pop, did a
great deal more damage than one jibe painted on a bomb casing can
do to religious sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   I say leave Chad alone. If the brass doesn't like explaining
wisecracks scrawled by young men doing a dangerous job, then keep
photographers away from the bomb-loading. And please, Secretary
Cohen, make sure Chad gets his share of Christmas turkey.

 &HT;    
 By PATTI DAVIS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (Editors: Because of its timeliness, we are moving this article
in your Centerpiece package early. Happy Holidays!) 
 &HT;    __ What do you give a man who has Alzheimer's disease? Ronald
Reagan's daughter gets an unexpected answer. __
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    Christmas is supposed to be about giving _ not so much the
material kind, but giving of the self, the soul, the heart. Giving
at any time is supposed to be about that, but it's easy to forget,
particularly at Christmas. The concept gets buried beneath Neiman
Marcus catalogues, lists, bills.
 &HT;    My grandmother understood the essence of giving and never forgot
it. In the '40s and '50s, Nelle Reagan regularly visited
tuberculosis patients at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar,
Calif. She had little money, but believed that giving to others is
a vital part of life. She always brought the patients something,
even if it was just a card or a pencil.
 &HT;    But when people close to you are ill, especially if death is
whispering in their ears, you want to give them impossible things _
more time, less pain, an escape from long nights of fear. A friend
of mine recently found out that cancer has conquered vast regions
of his body. His chemo treatments are a race against time. Many of
his nights are spent sitting in a chair, fighting pain.
 &HT;    ``It's so quiet then,'' he said. ``When it gets so late and
everyone's asleep.'' Alone with his pain and his fear, the hours
crawl slowly.
 &HT;    Although my father is not in pain, he loses more of himself each
month to Alzheimer's. For him, as for anyone who has this disease,
time is the enemy. It becomes jumbled, confused, compressed and
emptier all the time _ hollowed out.
 &HT;    My brother Michael and I meet at our father's office with gifts
for him _ ours and our brother Ron's. Ron wasn't sure when he'd be
down from Seattle and we wanted to give our gifts all at once. My
sister, Maureen, had made other arrangements for hers.
 &HT;    We have all thought along the same lines: What will he like to
look at, what will hold his attention or, even better, tug at his
imagination? We've brought picture books, mostly of nature scenes,
and chocolates _ a forbidden treat.
 &HT;    And a snow globe. When I saw it, I remembered that when I was a
child my father would describe white, snowy Christmases,
transporting me from the brilliant sunshine of a California
December. It seemed perfect to give him a miniature replica of
Christmas, a fantasy encased in glass.
 &HT;    My father's office is high above Los Angeles. Blue sky and
rooftops are the view from his windows. He still goes there for a
couple of hours on weekday mornings. There isn't much for him to
do, but that isn't the point. It's a routine, and with Alzheimer's
routines are important. They structure time, fill the hours.
 &HT;    There is something comforting about cluttering up his desk with
gifts and cards. These days, it's mostly empty. A yellow pad that's
never written on is always in the same place, and has been for
months. I watch his hands as he tries to be careful, peeling tape
from the wrappings. Then he just tears it, giving in to impatience,
perhaps. His eyes light up at the chocolates; for a moment, we're
co-conspirators, bringing him a delicacy he rarely gets.
 &HT;    ``Those are all for you, Dad,'' Michael tells him. ``You don't
have to share them with anyone.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, good,'' he says playfully, pulling them toward him.
 &HT;    He becomes engrossed in the books, the photographs of lakes and
meadows and mountains. He turns the snow globe and smiles at the
tiny winter wonderland. I tell him that when he tires of the
sunshine outside the window, he can just look into the snow globe
and change the season.
 &HT;    He looks straight into my eyes and says flatly, ``OK.''
 &HT;    And I wonder, as I often do, if he knows that sometimes I search
for amusing things to say to him.
 &HT;    I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving. And for the time we are there, so do
Michael and I. We are removed from the madness of shopping malls
and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

 &HT;    __ What do you give a man who has Alzheimer's disease? Ronald
Reagan's daughter gets an unexpected answer. __
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    Christmas is supposed to be about giving _ not so much the
material kind, but giving of the self, the soul, the heart. Giving
at any time is supposed to be about that, but it's easy to forget,
particularly at Christmas. The concept gets buried beneath Neiman
Marcus catalogues, lists, bills.
 &HT;    My grandmother understood the essence of giving and never forgot
it. In the '40s and '50s, Nelle Reagan regularly visited
tuberculosis patients at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar,
Calif. She had little money, but believed that giving to others is
a vital part of life. She always brought the patients something,
even if it was just a card or a pencil.
 &HT;    But when people close to you are ill, especially if death is
whispering in their ears, you want to give them impossible things _
more time, less pain, an escape from long nights of fear. A friend
of mine recently found out that cancer has conquered vast regions
of his body. His chemo treatments are a race against time. Many of
his nights are spent sitting in a chair, fighting pain.
 &HT;    ``It's so quiet then,'' he said. ``When it gets so late and
everyone's asleep.'' Alone with his pain and his fear, the hours
crawl slowly.
 &HT;    Although my father is not in pain, he loses more of himself each
month to Alzheimer's. For him, as for anyone who has this disease,
time is the enemy. It becomes jumbled, confused, compressed and
emptier all the time _ hollowed out.
 &HT;    My brother Michael and I meet at our father's office with gifts
for him _ ours and our brother Ron's. Ron wasn't sure when he'd be
down from Seattle and we wanted to give our gifts all at once. My
sister, Maureen, had made other arrangements for hers.
 &HT;    We have all thought along the same lines: What will he like to
look at, what will hold his attention or, even better, tug at his
imagination? We've brought picture books, mostly of nature scenes,
and chocolates _ a forbidden treat.
 &HT;    And a snow globe. When I saw it, I remembered that when I was a
child my father would describe white, snowy Christmases,
transporting me from the brilliant sunshine of a California
December. It seemed perfect to give him a miniature replica of
Christmas, a fantasy encased in glass.
 &HT;    My father's office is high above Los Angeles. Blue sky and
rooftops are the view from his windows. He still goes there for a
couple of hours on weekday mornings. There isn't much for him to
do, but that isn't the point. It's a routine, and with Alzheimer's
routines are important. They structure time, fill the hours.
 &HT;    There is something comforting about cluttering up his desk with
gifts and cards. These days, it's mostly empty. A yellow pad that's
never written on is always in the same place, and has been for
months. I watch his hands as he tries to be careful, peeling tape
from the wrappings. Then he just tears it, giving in to impatience,
perhaps. His eyes light up at the chocolates; for a moment, we're
co-conspirators, bringing him a delicacy he rarely gets.
 &HT;    ``Those are all for you, Dad,'' Michael tells him. ``You don't
have to share them with anyone.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, good,'' he says playfully, pulling them toward him.
 &HT;    He becomes engrossed in the books, the photographs of lakes and
meadows and mountains. He turns the snow globe and smiles at the
tiny winter wonderland. I tell him that when he tires of the
sunshine outside the window, he can just look into the snow globe
and change the season.
 &HT;    He looks straight into my eyes and says flatly, ``OK.''
 &HT;    And I wonder, as I often do, if he knows that sometimes I search
for amusing things to say to him.
 &HT;    I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving. And for the time we are there, so do
Michael and I. We are removed from the madness of shopping malls
and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

DEMISE OF THE ABL A SURPRISE TO MOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the receptionist at the Hartford Civic Center walked into
general manager Marty Brooks's office Tuesday afternoon to say that
she'd gotten several calls asking what happened to the New England
Blizzard, he wondered what was up.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks logged onto the Internet and learned from the American
Basketball League web site that the professional women's basketball
league had folded and was filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   First he was shocked. Then he was upset. He still is. The Civic
Center is the site of the Blizzard's home games, and the team was
scheduled to play 14 more this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point, I have not had any official communication from
the Blizzard or the league,'' Brooks said Wednesday. ``This is
unacceptable. People are judged by how they handle pressure and
react to a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to the Blizzard office reaches a recording that
directs callers to the league office in Palo Alto, Calif. A call to
the ABL office reaches a recording saying that the league has
closed its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was not the only one left out in the cold when the
nine-team league disbanded just two months into its third season.
</P>
<P>
   Sports agent Andrew Brandt of Woolf and Associates returned to
Boston from out of town to be greeted by 27 voice mail messages
``mostly from my clients and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt represents three ABL players, including Kara Wolters of
the Blizzard. He said the players had been hearing rumors all
afternoon, and Wolters eventually received a message from coach
K.C. Jones confirming that the league had folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Brandt said. ``I thought the trouble would be
this summer, but once the season got started it would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brandt said he knew things were bad when ABL cofounder and
chief executive officer Gary Cavalli recently appealed to players
to give back part of their salaries to be used either for marketing
the league or purchasing tickets for the underprivileged. He said
the league got a 60 percent response.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said Wolters wants to ``sit back and relax for awhile.''
He said top-level players such as her and teammate Jennifer
Rizzotti shouldn't have a problem finding a job with a team in the
WNBA _ the other professional women's league _ but that ``it's the
second level'' who will have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Levy, an agent at Levy &AMP; Associates in New York who
represents nine ABL players, wasn't optimistic, either. ``I knew
they were in trouble,'' he said, ``but I had assumed the league
would continue through the All-Star Game (Jan. 24).''
</P>
<P>
   And like the others, Levy said he was caught off guard. ``It's
been a long time since we didn't know something like this,'' he
said. ``And on Sunday we were at the Philly-Columbus game and there
was no sense that this was imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet was that one of the players there was Markita
Aldridge, a client whom Levy had recently convinced to sign with
the Columbus Quest as a temporary replacement rather than go play
in Eurpope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged her, and after the game Sunday she thanked me,''
he said. ``I had said, `As long as you play two months, it will be
worth it.' But who thought it would be three weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he was at his office until 1 Wednesday morning
fielding calls from players and the media. When he got home, he was
on the phone for another four hours with European teams looking for
openings for his newly unemployed clients.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pray, a spokesman for the WNBA, insists that the rival
league is not celebrating the demise of the ABL. ``We always
thought it was better when there were two leagues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pray did not offer any hope that the WNBA might add a franchise
in Hartford, which was one of the ABL's most profitable markets.
``Our long-term goal is to have a team in each NBA city,'' he said.
The 10-team league will expand to Minnesota and Orlando, Fla., next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt and Levy both suggested that one way to retain the
Hartford fan base would be to have the WNBA start a Boston
franchise and co-opt some of its games to Hartford, the way the
Celtics used to.
</P>
<P>
   Which would make sense to Pam Batalis, former general manager of
the Blizzard who was promoted to vice president of sales for the
ABL. ``We are living proof that New England, and especially
Connecticut, is an extremely viable women's sports market,'' she
said. ``I think it would be foolish to not realize that business
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The motto of the WNBA has been ``We Got Game.'' Now they really
do.
</P>

YEARS LATER, HARE TAKES LEAD OVER TORTOISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack vs. Ed. Ed vs. Jack.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an enduring, friendly rivalry in the little world of
Boston advertising for three decades. Then within a month of each
other, the two big kahunas of Boston advertising, Ed Eskandarian
and Jack Connors, sold their agencies to big national players.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Connors sold his Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos,
Boston's second largest agency, to the world's largest advertising
company, Interpublic Group for $115 million. One month later,
Eskandarian followed by selling the city's biggest ad agency,
Arnold Communications, to Snyder Communications for $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town that keeps score, and the end of the year is a
time for toting up the results.
</P>
<P>
   Who's ahead? Jack Connors, by a gaudy $47 million.
</P>
<P>
   That, in short, is the difference between what Connor's own
stock in Interpublic has gained _ $30 million _ and what
Eskandarian's has lost _ $17 million _ since both Boston ad
agencies completed their deals with their big publicly held
partners.
</P>
<P>
   While both Arnold and Hill Holliday have had banner years adding
clients, the partners they picked have fared far differently in the
stock market this year. Interpublic's stock is up 40 percent since
the acquisition of Hill Holliday was announced Feb. 24; Snyder's
stock is down 29 percent since the Arnold deal was done March 25.
</P>
<P>
   The market, of course, can turn for either Interpublic or
Snyder, and certainly money is only one measure of any deal. But as
Skip Pile, president of Pile &AMP; Co., a Boston marketing consulting
firm, notes, money ``is one of the major scorecards in life.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to think these guys do not care who's on
top. Years ago The Boston Globe ran a story about the tortoise _
Eskandarian _ gaining on the hare _ Connors. The story featured
Eskandarian's face imposed over the picture of a turtle and Connors
in a bunny suit. Eskandarian went all over town passing out
porcelain turtles; Connors, to put it mildly, was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables are again reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Says Connors: ``While both companies are going very well, their
success is now measured by the success of the companies that own
them. One is hot as a pistol, one is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskandarian did not return our calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arnold and Hill Holliday have long been the class of
Boston's ad community. Eskandarian built his agency on a series of
acquisitions, and has a client list that includes Volkswagen of
America and franchisees for McDonald's Corp. Connors has eschewed
the acquisition route, and instead grown internally with clients
like Fidelity Investments, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to sell out to Interpublic, Connors opted for a
company that had first approached him 15 years ago. Today New
York-based Interpublic is a giant of the industry with a market
value of $10.5 billion, and the roster of agencies that include
such heavyweights as McCann-Erickson Worldwide, and Ammirati Puris
Lintas and Lowe Group.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, with a market value of $2.2 billion, is a spunky comer
that broke into the business a decade ago by handing out samples of
cereal and Advil. The Bethesda, Md.-company has grown rapidly by
helping drug giants market to doctors and patients in hospitals,
and by handing out free product samples for companies like Procter
&AMP; Gamble and Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Only recently has it started buying
up more traditional ad agencies like Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interpublic is almost in a different league than Snyder,''
says AdWeek's Judy Warner. ``It is a league Snyder very much wants
to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's stock has slipped as it has moved beyond its direct
marketing niche in the hospitals and begun looking more like
everyone else in the ad industry, albeit smaller. Pile, the
advertising consultant, thinks industry analysts still don't
understand the Snyder business model and that has hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody understands who Daniel Snyder is,'' says Pile. ``It all
feels like a hot market, highly leveraged play.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all six analysts who follow the company rate it a buy.
William Warmington, who covers Snyder for Robinson-Humphrey, thinks
the stock could double in six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Eskandarian shopped his company to many potential buyers before
settling on Snyder. Among them: Omnicom Group, Interpublic's
archrival, but the two sides are said not to have been able to
agree on a price. Omnicom's stock is up 25 percent since the
Snyder-Arnold deal closed.
</P>
<P>
   One of Eskandarian's handicaps was that he had grown too large
and had too many accounts that might have overlapped with an
acquirer. Clients in the auto and fast-food business are
particularly sensitive of conflicts, and two of his biggest clients
were Volkswagen and McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Eskandarian found a partner where that wasn't a
problem. ``Ed got full valuation because there were no conflicts
and he didn't have to resign any business,'' says Pile.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, have to live with Snyder's stock price.

WITH TOE IN WATER, KERRY EYES PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Kerry has gone to the mountain in search of revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced at his wife's vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho,
Kerry is mulling whether to undertake his most difficult challenge
since . . . well, since the days of his Vietnam War heroism, when
as a young Naval officer with glory in his gaze and ice-water in
his veins, he fearlessly piloted a swift boat through the
enemy-infested fingers of the Mekong Delta _ filming himself all
the while.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge? Whether to run for president. When he returns
east, Kerry expects to have crossed a fundamental threshold. It
will come after some serious family councils and telephone
consultations with as many as 200 fund-raisers, activists, and
party leaders from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to have a pretty good sense in my mind whether I
think this is the time and whether I am prepared to do what is
necessary to really put my feet it in,'' Kerry said in a telephone
interview from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he'll open an exploratory committee and begin the kind of
organizing and travel necessary to launch a national run.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding whether to hit the campaign trail in earnest and
actually achieving credibility as a candidate could prove to be two
very different things. And in some ways, Kerry's idealism could
make things harder: His public comments that he won't dip into his
wife Teresa's $800 million fortune to finance a campaign eliminates
an asset that could otherwise establish him as the most serious
challenger to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably personally rule it out,'' he said. ``I don't think
that's the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry still carries a $500,000 debt from his bruising 1996
re-election fight against Bill Weld, an obligation he could cancel
with one check from his wife. Instead, he has chipped away at that
debt _ which once totaled $2.5 million _ with concerted
fund-raising in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say expediency couldn't win out; after all, in
1996, Kerry broke his nationally acclaimed
campaign-spending-limitation pact with Weld and borrowed against
the fortune to bail out his cash-starved campaign in the crucial
final month.
</P>
<P>
   Another major problem for the 55-year-old senator is his failure
to secure his political base in Massachusetts, which has allowed
Gore to make serious inroads here. Belatedly realizing the
potential public-relations disaster that could create for his
candidacy, Kerry has launched a rear-guard action in the past few
days to try to shore up that base.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late. Gore, aided by ace operative Michael
Whouley (who, adding insult to injury, is a former Kerry aide),
could score a coup by winning the bulk of support from those
political figures who know Kerry best. Knowledgeable sources say
that half or more of the state's congressional delegation may well
end up with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, sources say Richard Neal, Martin Meehan, John
Tierney, and Joseph Moakley all have stronger ties to Gore than to
Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   No one is declaring presidential allegiances yet. Still, the
hints are there. Neal, who labored mightily for Kerry's re-election
in 1996, put it tactfully: ``There is not a lot of evidence that a
sitting vice president who desires the nomination of his party can
be thwarted.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Moakley gave Kerry some blunt advice: It will take a
concerted effort to win his own delegation. ``He can't just sit
back and get them by osmosis,'' Moakley said. ``He is going to have
to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Meehan: ``He'd better hurry. Gore's quickly wrapping this
thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that dynamic a studiously uncommitted Ted Kennedy and a
Tom Menino who leans toward Gore, and you see just how difficult
things will be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though Kerry concedes Gore has a head start, and
that former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley (who formed an
exploratory committee earlier this month) takes takes up some space
he'd like for himself, he says his early soundings indicate there's
room for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reality check comes when you actually get on the phone
and ask people, `Would you be there for me and would you be
prepared to raise X amount of dollars?' '' Kerry said. ``That is a
different task from the initial task of surveying the political
landscape and making a judgment about whether or not you would like
to do the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Translate X into at least $250,000 a week through 1999, and you
have an idea of just how daunting the challenge is. But knowing he
can raise the cash, Kerry said, is the threshold he'll have to pass
before he decides to join the Democratic presidential campaign.
Recent history has shown that without adequate funding, even a
candidate with a toehold in New Hampshire stands little chance
against a frontrunner like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Tsongas came out of New Hampshire (in 1992) and didn't
have a dime and didn't have a strategy,'' Kerry said. ``Gary Hart
came out of New Hampshire (in 1984) and didn't have any money. He
had Walter Mondale off-balance, and if he had had some money, it
might have been a different result.'' Instead, in both cases, the
better-funded candidates _ Bill Clinton in 1992, Mondale in 1984 _
battled back from New Hampshire losses to overtake the victors and
ultimately win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If political considerations count heavily, so will his family's
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he'll be sitting down with his wife, Teresa Heinz;
her three sons, John, 30, Andre 27, and Christopher, 25; and his
daughters, Alexandra, 24, and Vanessa, who is about to turn 22. No
one quite has a veto; but individual objections will weigh
strongly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry admitted that at his back he's starting to hear Gore's
campaign chariot hurrying near _ and conceded that he may be behind
even in wooing the Massachusetts congressmen he serves with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I behind? The answer is yes,'' he said. ``I am behind where
I would like to be, and where some people say I ought to be, but I
am finding that notwithstanding that, the response has been quite
positive. Now I have to touch base directly to find out what the
realities are.''
</P>
<P>
   One man he hasn't touched based with yet could tell him: former
governor Michael S. Dukakis, the party's 1998 nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's chances?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long shot,'' Dukakis said. ``But it was a long shot
for me, and given the general atmosphere, there is no way of
knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would he tell Kerry if he called?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the toughest thing you will ever embark on,'' Dukakis
said. ``And I think it is far more punishing now than it was 10
years ago because of all the mishegas in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Dukakis means the no-holds-barred politics and
no-limits reporting that increasingly means a candidate's every
indiscretion ends up in the news. Kerry, however, professed not to
be bothered by that _ not after his 1996 re-election campaign,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say you guys did a pretty extensive effort of
vetting,'' he said of the scrutiny he has already endured. It was a
Globe profile of Kerry during that campaign that detailed how he
had carried around a Super 8mm camera in Vietnam to film his
exploits.
</P>
<P>
   So how does it all shift out? Several people who have talked
with the state's junior senator say he really wants to run. The
anxious ambition of middle age and the opportunities of an open
election have collided to make it seem particularly pressing for
Kerry, they say.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those who haved studied history and thus know
how hard it is to deny a sitting vice president his party's
nomination _ the last time it happened was 1952, when Vice
President Alben Barkley lost the Democratic nod to Adlai Stevenson
_ think Kerry will ultimately decide that 2000 is not his year.
</P>
<P>
   So what would Kerry tell a bettor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them to hold their powder,'' he said, mixing his
metaphors. ``I wouldn't advise anybody to bet, period. It is
against the law, isn't it?''

HOMEMADE FORMULA CLEANS BRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My antique brass trivet has tarnished badly. It is not
lacquered. I tried using Noxon without success. What can I do to
shine it up?
</P>
<P>
   RHODA CLARKE, from the Bay State
</P>
<P>
   A. Noxon usually does a good job in polishing brass, but it has
to be buffed with a power buffer; you can do a good job with a
buffing bonnet on your electric drill. A homemade formula that some
claim works wonders with less effort, is this: Mix 1 cup vinegar, 1
cup salt, and 1/4 cup flour into a paste and wipe on the metal. Let
dry and wipe off.
</P>
<P>
   Others to try are Maas, Twinkle, Goddard's Long Shine, and
Top-Brite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some polyurethane varnish spilled onto the wallpaper, making
yellowish streaks. Is there a way to get them off?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT DORSON, Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Possibly, particularly if the paper is vinyl coated. If it is
a water-based polyurethane, you can try Goof-Off, which is designed
to remove latex spills without spoiling the original finish. If it
is oil-based polyurethane, try any kind of oil; paint it on the
stains and let it sit there 15 minutes or more, wipe with a rough
cloth, then wash off the oil with detergent and water. If that
fails, paint the whole wall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having my floors sanded, and plan to finish them. But
how can I fill all the holes left in the floor after I pried up a
carpet-tacking strip?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT COMMITO, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, that is one of the handyman's favorite tricks: filling
the holes without smearing the filler material all over the floor.
Buy a filler material to match, or closely match, the color of the
finished floor. Apply one coat of varnish or whatever finish you
will use, then fill the holes; that way, any smearing on the floor
can be cleaned up with a wet sponge. The first coat keeps the
filler from penetrating the bare wood, after which it is very hard
to remove. The filled holes will show some, but since they are next
to the wall they will be virtually unnoticeable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have radon in my basement, and hope someday to have a
radon-dispersement system installed. But I also have insulation in
the basement ceiling, backed by metal foil stapled to the ceiling
joists, so the metal foil shows. I understand that the metal foil
helps keep radon out of the house. But I also have mice, lots of
them, which make their cozy homes and runways above that foil. I
don't know how to best get rid of the mice; I don't want to take
down the foil. Any solutions, compromises, or other actions I can
take?
</P>
<P>
   P.F., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That is a dilemma, but there are things you can do that might
help. Keep after the mice with D-Con or traps. Keep the D-Con away
from humans and pets. For some radon control, ventilate the
basement; open windows and keep them open all year long. They don't
have to be opened very much; an inch or less will do. Put a fan on
the basement floor to get the air moving in and out. The basement
will be cold, and you have to be alert to prevent freezing of water
pipes, but the insulation on the ceiling is at least reducing the
loss of heat from warm house to cold basement.
</P>
<P>
   And, you can reverse the insulation; your current setup with the
foil showing is technicallay wrong. The foil (a vapor barrier)
should be against the floorboards above rather than on the bottom
of the joists. This will eliminate the cozy space the mice are
enjoying now, and if the foil is tightly against the floor above,
this will be nearly as effective in keeping radon out of the house
as the foil is in its present position.
</P>
<P>
   If the radon stays high in the basement under these conditions
(reversed foil and ventilation), it would be prudent to put in some
kind of dispersement system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the metal on the inside of my microwave door is
showing, and I'd like to paint it to match the regular cream color.
Is this possible, and permissible? I called the manufacturer, who
referred me to an appliance company who could paint it.
</P>
<P>
   ANNE AHERN, Tewksbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If an appliance company can do it for a fee, you can do it
for the cost of the enamel, and a little of your own time. If that
bare metal is exposed to the inside of the microwave when the door
it is closed, I suggest using an HHR (high-heat resistant) spray
enamel, which comes in an aerosol can. You won't be able to get the
exact color with the HHR enamel. If you want a color match, use an
oil-based spray or brush enamel. Mask off ares you don't want to
paint, and use thin, thin coats.

THE NIGHT THE TREE FELL, AND OTHER HOLIDAY DELIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By P. CLEMENT HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tumult and fury is over, or at least the end is in sight.
The tree is trimmed and all aglow. Now it's a matter of thinking
peace and happiness, basking in the fireplace's glow and in the
love that Christmas brings.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, reading aloud Clement Moore's ``A Visit From St.
Nicholas,'' which the Globe thoughtfully runs every Christmas Eve,
and under its correct title, too, not that Johnny-Come-Lately ``The
Night Before Chrismtas.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in honor of Clement Moore that I call myself P. Clement,
which is my middle name.
</P>
<P>
   But why is it that disasters occur only at holiday time? There
is always that possiblity lurking in our minds, as illogical as
that may seem.
</P>
<P>
   Disasters do occur, and often at other holidays than Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   One of my Christmas disasters is worth telling, another is best
unsaid. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The night the tree fell &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first one was the night the tree fell, more than half a
century ago, when I was a tad and responsible for lighting the tree
while big sis and bro had the fun part of putting on all the
baubles.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the cat _ his name was Mephistopheles, named by my
rather romantic mother _ nearly ruined everything, includng
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The devil must have made him do it, because the cat, batting
some of the baubles hanging down, caught a front paw foot between a
wire and the tree. He let out a squawk heard 'round the world and
took off, pulling the tree on top of him with a whoosh! &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Chrismtas miracle, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It must have been a Christmas miracle. The cat survived, paw and
ego bruised, and so did the tree.
</P>
<P>
   We lost surprisingly few of those fragile baubles, but three of
them, heavy glass balls that my grandmother brought from Germany,
survived their fall and went back on the reset tree, minus a few
baubles and 10,000 needles. I found out years later that they are
called kugels.
</P>
<P>
   We can laugh about it now, but it was no laughing matter then. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mortar, mortar everywhere &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Christmas disaster was more recent, maybe 20 years ago,
in my own house. And it was disaster only to the Handyman's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the world would bring a wheelbarrow full of mortar into
the living room in front of the fireplace _ on Chrismas Eve?'' she
asked, her eyes smoking over, something to be feared.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but the handyman, who figured the remortaring of the
hearth had to be done in time for Christmas. It was, and the
wheelbarrow disappeared before midnight, but that didn't make it
less of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, when everything was done, everything was forgiven. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fire! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say that any house 50 years old or older has had at least
one fire.
</P>
<P>
   The great Mother's Day fire was the first for our ancestral
house, and, I hope, the last.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disaster, all right, not at Christmas but on a double
holiday, Mother's Day, May 12, 1946, and Pop's 57th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Pop liked to burn cordwood in the old coal boiler, and would put
the wood on top of the boiler to dry it out before burning. The
cordwood was green as grass, and took a lot of drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world would you have the boiler going on May 12? If
you ever lived in Northern Michigan (the great Upper Peninsula),
you wouldn't have to ask the question. That's ``home,'' where there
never has been a green Christmas, and often has been a white
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the fire started Saturday night, but didn't end until
the holiday. Saturday night it was; I was in the tub, and the folks
had gone to bed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smoke, but no fireplace &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then I smelled smoke; it was not very strong and was actually
pleasant, like the faint aroma of wood smoke from a fireplace.
Except we didn't have a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   I heard Pop go downstairs, coughing all the way, and realized
this was more than smoldering wood. I leaped from the tub, not
bothering to drain it (that is significant to the story and
probably saved Mom's life), grabbed a robe, and trotted to the
basement, where I found Pop with a bowl of water, flicking it onto
the blazing wood on top of the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   And, man, it was blazing; the ceiling already had caught fire,
and flames were spreading further along the ceiling and up the
interior walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really efficient, Pop,'' I said in my 18-year-old
wisdom, ready to grab a garden hose and put the fire out.
</P>
<P>
   But we were interrupted by a shriek from Mom, who had seen smoke
coming from virtually every room in the house, thicker and thicker.
She managed to get down the stairs in her nightgown and call the
fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Then, realizing that she was somewhat unclothed, actually went
back upstairs to get a robe in which she could greet the firemen
with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the firemen, led by Chief Trombley, arrived with
their hoses and axes and went to work. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The lifesaver &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Mom realized she couldn't make it to get her
robe, and staggered to the bathroom, where she dipped a washcloth
into my bath water, and staggered down the stairs, the life-saving
wet cloth clamped over mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone help that woman,'' Trombley shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no woman,'' I yelled back, ``that's my mother!'' I
think I really said that, but perhaps 52 years dims the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Another propitious happening, other than the bath water, was the
fact that I never had a chance to hose down the fire; if I had
hosed up the burning wall cavity, the old knob and tube wiring
could have electrocuted us all.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. We kids referred to Chief Trombley as ``Front
Door Trombley'' because that is all we thought was left after he
handled a fire.
</P>
<P>
   With the house scorched but intact and the fire out, I didn't
call him that any more.
</P>
<P>
   The house smelled for months, but eventually the odor went away,
and Mom had a chance to remodel. She also had an oil burner
installed, and Pop didn't have to dry out any more wood. I think he
missed burning wood in the old coal burner.
</P>
<P>
   And, for many years, Mom remarked about getting $100 insurance
for the big oak sliding doors between living and dining room, which
were burned beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   That other Christmas disaster? It's too embarrassing to retell
now. I could let my big bro tell it, but that wouldn't work because
he laughs so much that he just can't get the words out.
</P>
<P>
   But these words are out, from Clement Moore: ``Merry Christmas
to all and to all a good nght!''

IRON REGISTERS SPRUCE UP HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an old house with forced hot air heat and some ugly
vent covers and grilles. I have to find some metal grilles more
appropriate for the house. I have in mind the rather elaborately
decorated and scrolled cast iron covers, but I don't know where to
look. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Dover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Search no further; you have come to the right place, or the
right person, for the handyman has replaced all his ugly vent
covers and grilles with Reggio Registers. He even asked for, and
received some, as Christmas presents some years back. They are
heavy-duty cast iron grilles, handsome, elegant, and appropriate
for old and new houses. They come in many sizes and shapes, varied
enough to fit your needs. They also are expensive, but what isn't
these days? You can also get aluminum grilles that can be painted,
solid brass, and a limited number of styles in wood. Call the
Reggio Register Co. of Ayer (the founder and president of the firm
is named Reggio, which is appropriate for a register company). Call
978-772-3493.
</P>
<P>
   There are other uses for the grilles and vent covers. The
handyman has used them for basement vents. They add a certain
elegance to an otherwise plain (1768) colonial, even though they
are not colonial in design or style.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two rooms on the second floor of an old Cape-style
house. There are no dormers, and the rooms have two low knee walls
front and back. I checked the crawl spaces behind those knee walls,
and found that the nail points coming through the roof are raining
water. I know I have to ventilate, but how? I have no roof
overhang, so there is no soffit to put vents into.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL MOORE, Orange, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two ways to ventilate that space behind the knee
walls. One is to install large, square, louvered vents in the gable
wall at each end of the crawl space. The gable wall is a triangular
shape formed by the roofline at each end of the house. The vents
would go at the bottom right and left of that triangle. Look around
your neighborhood or anywhere in Massachusetts and you will see a
few of these vents or windows in old Cape-style houses.
</P>
<P>
   The second way is to install eave vents. Cut a slot at the top
of the fascia board, just under the drip edge. The eave vent is a
special type of drip edge that fits over the existing drip edge of
the roof, allowing air to enter the space and eliminate the rain
from the nail points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get the musty, rather dank odor out of my garbage
disposal?
</P>
<P>
   LARRY O'CONNOR, Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Grind through pieces of lemon, orange, lime, or grapefruit,
including rind. Sprinkle baking soda into dispsal once a day.
</P>
<P>
   For further treatment, remove rubber baffle, and with a paper
towel dampened with bleach, reach under rim and remove scum. Wear
skin and eye protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a treatment, for maintenance: Once a week, put two trays
of ice cubes and half a cup of washing soda in disposal and let 'er
rip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a bluestone stoop last June, over an old brick
stoop. Now, I see black on the bluestone. I tried scrubbing it off,
but it didn't work. I understand bleach will handle mildew, if that
is what it is, but won't that lighten the bluestone? I'd like to
keep the blue color.
</P>
<P>
   BOB MAZZA, Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Bleach may lighten the stone, but it can't be helped;
besides, the bluestone will darken with age fairly quickly, and any
light part will blend in in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mix one part liquid bleach and three parts water and paint this
on the black; it should lighten up within five seconds. If it
doesn't, it is not mildew, so scrub the stone with detergent and
water with a cup of bleach added to the wash water. Wear skin and
eye protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   To make the stone a little more resistant to mildew, apply one
thin coat of a masonry sealer. This will not change the color of
the bluestone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some handsome wood-hued cherry kitchen cabinets, with
raised panels. I plan to paint them, sanding and washing first,
then using an oil primer and finally an oil enamel. How can I
prevent the raised panels from shrinking so much that an unpainted
line shows beteween panel and frame?
</P>
<P>
   CLINT CABAN, Medfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can't, really. The panels are floating in their frames,
and expand when they gain moisture, and contract when they lose it.
In winter, usually, they lose moisture and shrink, and open the
seams. If you tried gluing the panels, they are likely to explode
with a sharp report as they shrink next spring.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the showing of this unpainted strip, do all painting
in the dead of winter, or at least during the heating season, when
the wood is at its smallest. A disadvantage to this is that the
paint bead on the joints will crack as the wood dries out, making
the joint ragged, and uglier than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

questions. Write him at the Boston Globe, Boston, Mass., 02107. The

POCKETS OF THE PAST LITTER THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Baldwin didn't set out to be an on-line ghost-buster: It
just sort of happened.
</P>
<P>
   His story begins on a summer night in 1996, July Fourth, to be
exact. He was drifting in Long Island Sound on a pleasure craft
that belonged to his ex-wife's parents. (Yes, CyberLinks, she was
his ex-wife at the time _ apparently, he got along with the
ex-in-laws.) Anyway, the captain and crew had fallen asleep,
leaving Baldwin at the steering wheel. Now, Baldwin is a webmaster,
not a shipmaster: In other words, he didn't have a clue. ``I had
this sense of peril, and all of a sudden, I started thinking about
the Internet,'' he recalls. ``I was working at Pathfinder (Time
Warner's erstwhile pioneering Web site) at the time, and I suddenly
realized that everything we were creating is immortal. It all
crystallized for me: Web sites are like ghost ships, like the
Flying Dutchman. Unless you keep a crew on board, they'll drift
like haunted phantoms in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorical musings aside, Baldwin had a slightly more pressing
problem in the real world. He was steering straight for a jetty.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, the captain woke up just in time to put the
ship back on course. Baldwin got off the boat, retired his deck
shoes, and set up Ghost Sites, a site that offers a whimsical
chronicle of abandoned Web sites gathering cobwebs in cyberspace.
It is a sort of on-line mausoleum, with witty commentary about
sites that continue to broadcast the ``latest'' news from, say, two
or three years ago. Baldwin seeks out mothballed pages and rates
them with a little ghost system (three ghosts for a site that is
``dead, but well-preserved''; five for a site that is ``stuffed,
embalmed and ready for Internet museum.'')
</P>
<P>
   A few examples: The ``official'' site hawking Woodstock '94,
featuring pages counting down to the day of the event; posted in
the infancy of the Web, they are quaint displays of simple text and
images that give you the same feeling you get when reading an essay
you wrote in grade school. There's also a site commemorating the
death of Jerry Garcia, offering the ``latest'' photos of tie-dyed
mourners. One site connects you to breaking news on the Blizzard of
'96; another celebrates the 100th running of the Boston Marathon _
too bad it happened two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is amusing stuff for on-line archeologists, but these
specters represent a deeper problem. What happens to a site once
the novelty wears off and the creator just lets it slide (or
forgets the password required to update the content)? The answer
is: nothing. Such sites drift aimlessly. And they can be annoying
obstacles for folks who use the Internet for research, slowing
users down when ghost sites haunt search results.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, the Internet is decentralized, without an official
archivist or librarian. That's part of its chaotic beauty _ and a
source of its frustration. ``This isn't the Dewey Decimal System;
it's a very imprecise way of finding information,'' Baldwin says.
The best way to avoid surfing ghost sites _ albeit an imperfect
solution _ is to use the advanced options available on some search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   One search engine has even made dead sites part of its national
advertising campaign: The television spots for Hotbot.com feature a
bunch of old cronies offering investment tips: ``I've got a hot
one,'' a gray-haired suit advises. ``Asbestos. It's a new miracle
fiber.'' You get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew DeVries, director of marketing and communications for
Wired Digital, Hotbot's parent company, says the ads aim to stress
the fact that the search engine updates its database every three to
four weeks to weed out ``dead links'' that lead users to a
``Document Not Found'' message. It doesn't do anything about the
ghosts, though. ``Those sites show you the triteness from the
beginning of the Web, when everybody went out and created a site
and then realized it's actually a lot of work to maintain them,''
DeVries says. ``You end up with all these little islands in
cyberspace that no one has any interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin stalks those islands to get a good laugh, but he's also
a strong proponent of a serious project to archive the Internet _
phantoms and all _ for historical purposes. Founded in San
Francisco by a pioneer named Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive
(www.archive.org) aims to preserve the ever-changing world of
cyberspace, and it has already documented sites from the 1996
presidential election in an archive housed at the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ghost Sites, it's had a rather spotty life itself since
the idea was spawned that fateful night at sea. Baldwin let it
fossilize for about six months last year, but now it's up and
running again at a cool zine called Disobey. &QC; 
com. ``It's an almost unpardonable sin,'' Baldwin concedes about
the period when he let Ghost Sites become, well, a ghost site. He's
no longer working at Pathfinder, one of the first publishing
experiments on the Web that has lost its early promise. Baldwin is
freelancing these days. His primary gig? He's a ghost writer for
Time Digital.

   Vic Polk, meet Joan Blades.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston lawyer has never actually met the Berkeley, Calif.,
entrepreneur, but since September, they've been computer compadres
working tenaciously toward a mutual goal. Blades and her partner,
Wes Boyd, started moveon.org, an on-line ``flash campaign'' urging
Congress to censure President Clinton and get the whole thing over
with, once and for all. Polk, a partner at Bingham Dana &AMP; Gould,
joined the effort after he received an e-mail from a friend, and he
is one of scores of volunteers all over the country. ``It's
high-tech political activism at a low cost,'' Polk says.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots organization gathered more than 300,000
signatures against impeachment, which, by all accounts, is the
biggest on-line petition in history. At press time, it didn't
appear that moveon.org made any difference, but its effort
represents a gigantic stride in on-line political organization.
Minnesota governor-elect Jesse Ventura proved that even a
professional wrestler can muscle his way into office by mobilizing
his forces on the Internet. And moveon.org was a valiant attempt to
empower regular citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this Web site for $89.50, and we had our socks
knocked off by the response,'' Blades says. She's not too thrilled
about the likely outcome of this one-issue project, but she
predicts that on-line activism is about to blossom. ``It's about
consensus building,'' Blades says. ``The Internet is a place where
people can become active in politics.'' Win or lose, moveon.org has
taken a step forward.

   Disney has opened a preview of its new portal, Go Network. (The
preview is at www.beta.go.com.) It sports a few nifty features,
including ``follow-me-tabs'' that enable you to adapt content as
you move through the site, without having to backtrack. It also has
a built-in content filter for parents (this is Disney, folks).
Other than that, it looks a lot like Yahoo, except that it's driven
by Disney-created content, including ESPN, ABC News, and Mickey and
friends. The Kids page, of course, takes you ``behind the screens
at `A Bug's Life' '' and links you to ``More Fun at Disney.com.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that's entertainment. But does the Internet really need its
own Academy Award-style ceremony? The folks behind the Webby Awards
seem to think so. The third annual ceremony is slated for March in
San Francisco, and the celebration promises to be a glittery
gathering of the digerati. The nominees will be announced Jan. 6.
By the way, all of last year's winners are still going strong; no
ghosts in this group.

MUSEUMS CHALLENGED BY WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web poses a difficult challenge for museums _ one that few
are handling well. Some museums use their Web sites as glorified
brochures. They try to entice Web surfers to come to the museum and
they provide limited directions. They might even provide a
downloadable membership form, which visitors are encouraged to
print out, fill in, and send to the museum using an envelope and
stamp. Most of the time this is frustrating because most Internet
users will never be able to physically visit the museums they can
easily click to on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other museums have taken a different approach. Deciding that
their primary mission is education, and not fund-raising, these
museums have produced dramatic Web-based exhibits that have more
depth and information than anything you would ever see in a
gallery. These exhibits can be quite captivating if you have a
high-speed Internet connection, such as a cable modem or a DSL
line. Unfortunately, for people with a conventional dial-up modem,
a multi-media extravaganza can be more frustrating than uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising, I think, is the relatively small number
of museums that have taken a middle road and built Web sites that
complement their exhibits. This path is perhaps the hardest and the
most expensive to follow. Unlike a brochure, the Web site needs to
be rich with information. But since a complementary Web site must
be relevant to people who have seen the actual museum and those who
have not, such a site frequently needs original content, which
costs more money.
</P>
<P>
   A museum that has been extremely successful in pulling off this
balance is the Salem Witch Museum, with a Web site at
www.salemwitchmuseum.com. The site has general information about
the museum, including detailed maps that describe how to get there
both by public transportation and by car. There is information
about the witch trials of 1692. But there is also an on-line tour
of Boston communities with maps from 1692, drawings, contemporary
photographs, stories, and biographies of historical figures. This
site really involves the visitor, and it provides a lot of
information to a broad cross-section of Internet users that
couldn't really be conveyed in another way.
</P>
<P>
   Another museum that has pulled off the mix of the virtual and
the physical is the Computer Museum, with its Web site at
www.tcm.org. The site has information about the museum's current
exhibits; it also has on-line puzzles and activities that match the
exhibits at the Boston museum. And the Web site has a lot of
historic information about the history of computers, including a
``This Day In History'' page that changes every day. The real
problem with the Computer Museum's Web site is that many of the
site's features are buried and hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum (www.nasm.edu)
is a tremendously valuable on-line resource, with photographs of
aircraft, video clips, and lots of technical information. Many of
the photographs are large, detailed images that can take 30 seconds
or longer to download over the Internet. The museum has rightfully
realized that when people care deeply about the subject matter,
they are more than willing to wait for a big download.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of museums, the Smithsonian is worried about the
potential of theft from its Web site: one way the Smithsonian earns
revenue is by selling publication rights to its photographs. To
deal with this problem, the Smithsonian has put a watermark in the
corner of many of the high-resolution photographs on its site. The
watermark looks like those ``flying logos'' that are increasingly
shown on television channels. They don't prevent theft, but they
make it easier to track down copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Boston Museum of Science's Web site
(www.mos.org) comes up somewhat short. Although there are brochures
for the exhibits and calendars of special events, the museum could
do so much more. For example, the museum could have slide shows or
video clips that preview the Omni theater films; even better would
be an electronic commerce system that would let people purchase
tickets and reserve seats over the Internet. The Web site has
resources for science teachers, such as easy-to-create experiments.
But once again, the site doesn't push the power of the Internet:
most of the experiments are described just with text, rather than
with diagrams or photographs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see the future of on-line museums, click to
www.imj.org.il, and take the Israel Museum's on-line tour. The Web
site uses a browser plug-in called WebGuide to give you a
virtual-reality tour through three galleries that pertain to the
Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. As you pass through each gallery, you
can click on an object to see it up close. The experience is very
effective, although it does take a considerable amount of time to
download the tour over those trans-Atlantic Internet links.

THE GRINCHES WHO TRIED TO STEAL DEMOCRACY

<P>
   Every Who down in Who-ville liked Democracy a lot,
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans on Capitol Hill assuredly did NOT!
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hated Democracy! Especially this season!
</P>
<P>
   Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
</P>
<P>
   It could be their heads weren't screwed on just right.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, perhaps, that their shoes were too tight.
</P>
<P>
   But I think that the most likely reason of all
</P>
<P>
   May have been that their hearts were two sizes too small.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the reason, their hearts or their shoes,
</P>
<P>
   They stood there on on Capitol Hill, hating the Whos,
</P>
<P>
   For they knew most Whos down in Who-ville beneath
</P>
<P>
   Had said no to their cantakerous vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the polls again,'' they said with a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers that made everything unequivocally clear.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity remained stratospherically high,
</P>
<P>
   So high, so high, all the Republicans could do was sigh,
</P>
<P>
   Yet they growled, with Ging-Grinch nervously drumming,
</P>
<P>
   ``We MUST find some way to stop Democracy from coming!''
</P>
<P>
   They stayed on their mission to put Bill out of commission,
</P>
<P>
   Thinking the Starr report would cause a state of perdition,
</P>
<P>
   But the Whos kept saying what Republicans liked least,
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, they served pollsters a contrarian feast.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent said Clinton should stay,
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent said his job performance was OK
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent said Starr went way beyond his reach,
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent said the president should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The more the Republicans thought of this Who Democracy thing,
</P>
<P>
   The more they thought, ``We must stop this whole thing!
</P>
<P>
   ``Why for two elections we've put up with Bill Clinton now!
</P>
<P>
   ``We MUST stop this Democracy from coming! But HOW?''
</P>
<P>
   Then they got an idea, an awful idea!
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans got a wonderful, awful idea!
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll release Clinton's video testimony to Starr!
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will see what a liar Clinton thou are!''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes moved few, even if Bill knew not what is is,
</P>
<P>
   Few Whos hooted in California, Kansas or Ole' Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them would want Clinton as their in-law son,
</P>
<P>
   But to scream high crime or misdemeanor was justice undone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight percent said the tape should never have aired.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent said the Republican's judgment was impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight percent said Starr went beyond his reach,
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent said the president should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what to do!'' Ging-Grinch laughed in his throat,
</P>
<P>
   Baring his teeth at Democracy like a crocodile from a moat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We swamp the Democrats in midterm congressional elections,
</P>
<P>
   ``We impale them with Clinton's salacious predilections.''
</P>
<P>
   On November 3, Ging-Grinch clutched at his throat,
</P>
<P>
   The Prez was the first in 64 years to add seats to his boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ging-Grinch quit, the Who votes devouring him like piranha,

   Including black Who voters telling him, ``Yo' Mama!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But you know, the Republicans were so smart and so slick
</P>
<P>
   They thought up a new scheme and thought it up quick!
</P>
<P>
   ``Pooh-pooh to the Whos!'' they were grinch-ish-ly humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finding out now that no Democracy is coming!
</P>
<P>
   ``We will simply vote along party lines to impeach,

   ``Our vote cannot be touched no matter who tries to beseech,

<P>
   They said ``That's a noise that we simply MUST hear!''
</P>
<P>
   They paused. The Republicans put their hands to their ears.

   And they did hear a sound rising over the snow.

   The Republicans gazed at Who-ville. They popped their eyes!
</P>

   Then they shook! What they saw was a shocking surprise!
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent said Clinton should stay.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent said his job performance was okay
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent tarred the Republicans with unsavory guile,
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight percent want the Senate to call off the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small,
</P>
<P>
   Was singing! Without having voted on this at all!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans, with grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
</P>
<P>
   Stood puzzling and puzzling: ``How could it be so?
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we lose in the polls and at the polls?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost Ging-Grinch, Livingston, what more the toll?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've caught Clinton lying to a grand jury,
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Whos hate us! For our partisan fury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans puzzled till their puzzlers were sore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they will think of something they hadn't before!
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Democracy, they'll think, can't be stolen from a store.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Democracy . . . perhaps . . . means a bit more!

 Aging and births of the British elite
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women who delay having children, and who have fewer of them over
a lifetime, are more likely to live into their 80s and 90s, at
least according to a scientific review of 1,200 years of
genealogical records kept by the British aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the current issue of the journal Nature, supports
an evolutionary theory that has been observed in fruit flies: that
the energy that goes into having offspring early and often may take
away from an organism's ability to maintain and repair its own
cells.
</P>
<P>
   British and Dutch researchers who specialize in the evolutionary
theory of aging analyzed data for more than 13,000 aristocratic
women born through 1875, looking at such factors as age of first
childbirth and number of children.
</P>
<P>
   Women who lived into their 90s had their first child at the
average age of 27, while women who lived into their 60s had their
firstborn at the average age of 23.8. The women who lived to their
90s had an average of 1.8 children, while those who lived only into
their 60s had an average of 2.36 children.
</P>
<P>
   Of the women who lived into their 80s and 90s, nearly half of
them had no children, while less than a third of women who lived
into their 50s and 60s were childless.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who statistically took into account such
potentially confusing factors as women dying during childbirth,
also looked at aristocratic men and found similar results: The men
lived longer when they had fewer children and at a later age.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying commentary, a University of Georgia
geneticist welcomed the study, but cautioned that it does not prove
cause and effect or that evolutionary genetics is the only
explanation. The geneticist, Daniel E.L. Promislow, cited other
studies showing that women who have no children have a greater risk
of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, many factors influence lifespan, and readers can rest
assured that having more children will not necessarily send you to
an early grave. After all, Queen Victoria gave birth to nine
offspring . . . and lived to be 81 years old,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dyspepsia cause: Bacteria at issue
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does the bacteria known to cause ulcers also lead to bloating,
belching, nausea, and other symptoms of chronic indigestion, or
dyspepsia?
</P>
<P>
   Two studies in the current issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine come to opposite conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish researchers found that patients who took an antacid
along with antibiotics known to kill the H. pylori bacteria saw
their symptoms disappear at three times the rate of those who took
only the antacid.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by researchers from Switzerland and elsewhere found
no difference in the rate of relief between patients who took the
antacid with antibiotics, or the antacid alone.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Lawrence S. Friedman of
Massachusetts General Hospital writes that the contradictory
conclusions may be explained by the studies' different definitions
of indigestion that is unrelated to ulcers. For instance, only one
study included patients with heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   But he points out that in both studies, the majority of patients
got no relief, whether they took antibiotics along with antacid or
not. Friedman says that suggests that other causes and treatments
for chronic indigestion need to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chemicals' effect on hormones seen
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another piece of evidence suggesting man-made chemicals may
damage human reproductive health, a study of men working at a
Chinese pesticide factory found they had abnormal levels of sex
hormone and decreased sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by physicians at the Harvard School of
Public Health, report their findings in this month's issue of the
Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing 34 male pesticide factory workers to 44 male
textile factory workers, who presumably were not exposed to the
agricultural chemicals, the researchers found that those exposed to
pesticides had slightly, but significantly, higher levels of what
are usually considered ``female'' sex hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the higher the female hormonal levels
in the pesticide workers, the lower their sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have also suggested that pesticides and other
manmade chemicals may decrease sperm counts and otherwise affect
human reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced
plans to screen pesticides and other materials for substances that
may pose as hormones and disrupt reproductive health.

GIVING BLETCHLEY ITS HISTORICAL DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Eachus, 87, divides his time now between Cambridge, Mass.
and Florida, but 56 years ago, as a young American Naval officer,
he found himself ordered for two weeks to a ramshackle British
country house 40 miles from London.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1942. The Japanese had just bombed Pearl Harbor. And
young Joe Eachus, who'd been educated from kindergarten through
college at Miami University of Ohio, and had advance degrees from
Syracuse and Illinois, had studied the arcane art of cryptography.
With one other Naval officer, Eachus was part of the first 11-man
US contingent admitted to the super-secret confines of Bletchley
Park, home to the British code-breakers who cracked Hitler's fabled
Enigma machine.
</P>
<P>
   By reading the coded German radio traffic, using material
snatched for the British by Polish forces, the Allies were able to
survive the Nazi onslaught that rolled over Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contributions people at Bletchley made to shortening the
war were immense,'' said Eachus in an interview last week. He had
to overcome British reserve and suspicion that the Yanks had
nothing to contribute. Several times Eachus and his fellow Navy man
were suspected of being Germans _ ``the American naval uniform and
the German were virtually identical, except for the insignia.''
</P>
<P>
   After his two-week stint, he was ordered back for three months,
and then for three years. What made his work easier was
encountering a young British Foreign Office staffer, Barbara
Abernethy, who has now been his wife for half a century. As a girl
she'd studied European languages in a Belgian convent school. Her
mom knew someone in the government, and in 1937, she was among the
very first contingent of British spy-types sent to Bletchley to
organize a secure code-breaking establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible old country house, but we loved it,'' said
Barbara Eachus, who was British vice consul-general in Boston
before retirement. ``I opened the place in '37 and closed the gates
in '47, when I turned the key and off we went.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Joe became a civilian employee of the Defense
Dept., specializing in, as he puts it delicately, ``other people's
communications.'' One of the early computer pioneers _ he knew Alan
Turing, the great computer genius of Bletchley _ Eachus did later
stints in high-tech industries, including Honeywell, where he
designed computers for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara invited Joe for coffee one day, and the young American
was introduced to an engaging collection of very smart, very
secretive British eccentrics, who deciphered thousands of German
radio transmissions in time to enable the Allied forces to counter
Hitler's moves. ``You knew everybody at Bletchley,'' said Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The talented folk doing the high-stress work of codebreaking are
described in William Stevenson's classic book on espionage, ``A Man
Called Intrepid'' as ``a priesthood of . . . scholars, solvers of
crossword puzzles, mathematicians, linguists and classical dons . .
.'' Joe Eachus fit right in. His job was to sniff out which among
the pile of German secrets might be useful to the US Navy, and send
it back, by coded radio transmission, overnight mail to Washington.
Two of his most important tools? The 25-pound cans of coffee and
sugar which he drew from the Navy supply depot.
</P>
<P>
   In wartime England, coffee and sugar were rationed, and
codebreakers craved their caffeine-sugar connection. ``So I just
set up my coffee pot outside my office, with the sugar, and pretty
soon all kinds of people working on all kinds of interesting stuff
came by,'' shrugged Joe. When he got something hot, he'd hightail
it to London and the US Embassy, where ``I was the only one other
than the ambassador who could use the encrypted radio link.''
</P>
<P>
   At the war's height, more than 1,000 people worked at Bletchley,
whose grounds had been deeded away by William the Conqueror nearly
900 years earlier. The secrets gleaned from breaking Germany's
Enigma codes came to be known as ``Ultra.''
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted communications gave the Allies a crucial
advantage. ``Ultra took the blindfold off our eyes so that we could
see the enemy in detail in a way in which he could not see us,''
wrote Peter Calvocoressi, a Bletchley veteran, in his book ``Top
Secret Ultra.'' The trove was invaluable: ``knowing day by day
where enemy units were; how strong they were; what their supplies
of arms, ammunition and fuel were; and, when occasion arose, where
they were being told to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The breaking of the Enigma machine cyphers helped end the Nazi
wolfpack menance in the Atlantic, and gave Britain's outnumbered
fighter pilots crucial head-starts on intercepting large-scale Nazi
bombing raids. Churchill was able to take the substantial risk of
dispatching tanks by sea to reinforce Allied troops in Africa even
while Hitler was threatening to invade Britain with Operation
Sealion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churchill's boldness in sending tanks to the Middle East while
the British Isles were still under seige may be likened to the
action of the Senate of Rome when it dispatched an army to Spain
while Hannibal was still at the gates of the city . . . a lesser
man would have quailed,'' wrote Calvocoressi. But the ace up the
Churchillian sleeve was ``a hidden assurance which he owed to
Ultra.'' The Bletchley codebreakers had ascertained that Hitler had
decided it was too risky to attempt invading Britain with his
Operation Sealion.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of doggerell titled ``Bumph Palace'' which
memorialized Bletchley types with this ode to bumph, slang for
interminable bureaucratic paperwork:
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . the Air Force types that never fly / Soldiers who
neither do nor die / Landlubber Navy, beards complete / Civilians
slim, long-haired, effete / Yet what they did they never knew / And
if they told it wasn't true / If I should die think only this of me
/ I served my country at BP ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eachuses figure in a new book about Bletchley, ``Station
X,'' which is also the basis for a four-hour television documentary
to be broadcast in Britian in January, and will probably be shown
here later. A fund-raising effort to restore Bletchley as a
memorial to the secret work that helped win the war is under way.
The address: Bletchley Park Trust, Wilton Ave., Milton Keynes, UK,
MK3 6EF.

REBOOT YOUR GIFT FROM MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas was a lot simpler when you didn't have to reboot your
presents.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all American homes now contain a personal
computer, and that number will increase in 24 hours, as families
proudly unwrap their new Compaqs and iMacs. Those who already have
a machine or two may content themselves with the latest gaming
software, or perhaps an educational program.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these Christmas revelers will find that their gifts
don't work properly, or not at all. What then?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you can dial up a technical support hotline. Major
computer companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Apple Computer
Inc., will have Santa's helpers on call right through the holidays,
including Christmas Day. But this is their busy season, so bring
along a good book before dialing.
</P>
<P>
   You may have no choice if the computer is totally blitzed. But
if you can fire it up and log onto the Internet, abundant
assistance awaits. Among the handiest information sources are the
America Online and CompuServe computer networks. These services
have 14 million subscribers between them, and their tech forums are
crammed with hints and tips. Nearly every new computer comes with
software and instructions for getting onto AOL and CompuServe, and
the first 100 hours are free. These services are an excellent
lifeline for computer newbies.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're connected, you can venture onto the larger Internet,
where computer companies have published vast databases of
troubleshooting information about their products.
</P>
<P>
   If your new Windows 98 computer is acting up, maybe you should
get in touch with Microsoft Corp. The firm has built one of the
best support Web sites around, at http://www.microsoft.com/support.
If anything, you'll find too much information here--thousands of
detailed reports about computer problems both common and obscure.
Sometimes it's hard to weed out precisely the data you need.
</P>
<P>
   Which should lead you to another excellent Microsoft
resource--the company's own network of Usenet ``newsgroups.''
Actually, these are electronic bulletin boards where you can post a
message on a technical problem, come back in a few hours and read
replies that may help you sort things out. Microsoft's bulletin
boards are overseen by teams of volunteer computer experts called
MVPs--Most Valuable Professionals. They're generally people with
lots of hands-on experience with Microsoft products, and they've
saved my hide on more than a few occasions.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know how to set up your browser for Usenet access,
visit the DejaNews Web site (http://www.dejanews.com). Click on
``Browse Groups'' and then run a search under ``microsoft.public''
for a list of bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's on-line resources are unusually well-organized, but
you'll find plenty of help for other hardware and software
products. Check your instruction manuals; you'll find Internet
addresses for the companies that made the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Game software firms are especially well-represented. If that new
game won't work, visit the company Web site and see if they've
posted a ``patch''--a small program that repairs bugs in a larger
program. Of course it's outrageous that so many computer companies
sell software with known bugs, and force their customers to make
their own repairs. But there it is. Download the patch--and don't
forget to send a snarky e-mail message to the software company.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're on the lookout for software, be sure to visit
the Web site of the firm that made your computer. There you may
find new hardware drivers--little programs that allow the computer
to work with vital systems like the monitor, video card and sound
card. Some game programs won't work unless you've installed the
newest drivers, and if your computer sat on a store shelf for a
couple of months, those drivers may already need replacing. Drivers
are free, and can usually be downloaded and installed in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes no amount of good advice or new software patches will
get that Christmas present going. Sure enough, it's time to switch
the thing off and reboot. It's amazing how often this works. And
the technique has other benefits. Once the hum of the computer
fades, you may notice the laughter of your children at play or
carols on the radio. And maybe you'll decide you've got better
things to do than play Tomb Raider III.

MAGIC LOSES TO MARTHA IN SANTA BUYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is with mixed feelings that Santa announces he will soon
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Martha Stewart Living.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Santa's accountants conducted an audit of his
operation. The figures were not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Santa was aware he had problems. Outmoded workshop technology.
Antiquated delivery system. Never-ending labor negotiations with
his so-called ``helpers.'' Protests by animal rights activists.
Federal Aviation Administration citations for failing to meet
flying sleigh safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Santa's entrepreneurial ventures have not been going
well. Santa's steamy semi-autobiographical novel ``Fly By Night''
never hit the bestseller lists, despite relentless plugging by Don
Imus. Sales of Santa's signature fragrance, ``Claus,'' are way
down. And as for G.L.B., Great Looking Beard, his amazing spray-on
beard-in-a-can, well, Santa has been forced to admit that it is an
idea whose time has yet to come. He couldn't move the stuff, even
on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's accountants told him he needs bigger profit margins.
This sort of talk rankles Santa. He has always believed his job is
about giving, not getting. His accountants told him that he is
totally out of touch with reality, which was no news to Santa. They
suggested he declare bankruptcy. He refused. He told them that
bankruptcy would be an unthinkable step for a larger-than-life
figure who serves as a role model for millions of boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Martha stepped in. Martha made Santa an offer he couldn't
refuse. Perhaps Santa should rephrase that, because he doesn't want
to convey the impression that Martha held a glue gun to his head
and forced him to sign. On the contrary. It was all very civilized.
Martha merely said that she planned to acquire Santa's operation.
It would be a friendly takeover, she said, if he cooperated.
Otherwise, she was prepared to play hardball.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has big plans for Santa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas every day.'' Martha told Santa to keep repeating
that phrase. It's the Santa mantra, she said, the unifying concept
behind all their new ventures, the key to maximizing profits year
round. First she'll trademark Santa's name and image. Then she'll
move Santa's base of operations from the North Pole to Orlando. By
this time next year Santa will have a catalog, a Web site, a
magazine, a television show, a theme park, a chain of restaurants,
a string of factories in Mexico. And that's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Martha confessed she was appalled by Santa's outmoded means of
production and delivery. She was amazed that he had managed, year
after year, to provide toys for millions of girls and boys all over
the world. How did he do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic,'' Santa told her.
</P>
<P>
   Martha said that no one, even Santa, can rely on magic anymore
to get the job done in the new global economy. ``Marketing is the
only magic,'' Martha said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa worries about all the boys and girls on his list. Who will
leave them presents if Santa doesn't deliver? Martha assured him
they''ll be just fine, that their parents can order as many gifts
as they like from www.santastewart.com, as long as their credit
cards aren't overextended.
</P>
<P>
   Martha says Santa should strive to be a purely secular icon, in
order to sell the Santa concept to boys and girls of every faith
and nationality. Santa told Martha he thought this idea smacked of
cultural imperialism. Martha said he was being silly, that he
should think of it as reaching out, making Santa more inclusive,
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Santa knows the Martha connection is the only way for him to
survive. And yet he finds himself lying awake in the middle of the
night, worrying. What has Santa done?

SOME FEAR SECULAR KWANZAA IS BECOMING A `BLACK CHRISTMAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Donald Dugan remembers that when he was growing
up, Kwanzaa festivities were intimate events in people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that celebrated used to fit in a house,'' said
Dugan, 41, an insurance agent in Oakland, Calif. ``Now they don't
fit in a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Kwanzaa surged in popularity among
African-Americans in the last several years, it has shed its
radical black image. Now firmly a part of mainstream culture, it is
taught in schools, observed by churches and marketed by corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, which grew out of the black power movement in the
1960s, is a secular holiday that celebrates family, community and
the struggles of people of African descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from just being a novelty to something that makes
sense, something that brings the community together,'' said Kola
Thomas, director of the Center for African and African-American
Arts and Culture in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Henry, professor of black studies at the University of
California at Berkeley, put it in more political terms. ``Up until
1990, it was certainly something that was associated with black
nationalism,'' he said. ``Now it's been mainstreamed. It's
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   With wider acceptance has come commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go buy a Kwanzaa set at Kmart,'' Blanche Richardson,
manager of Marcus Books in Oakland, said disapprovingly. ``You can
go to Safeway and buy a Kwanzaa card.''
</P>
<P>
   Such developments distort the meaning of Kwanzaa, which was
developed partly as an alternative to the consumerism of Christmas,
its longtime supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that a number of major corporations have started to
take notice and try to profit from Kwanzaa,'' said Oba T'Shaka, a
professor of black studies at San Francisco State University.
``That's not good. With money comes corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa was started in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, now a professor
of black studies at California State University at Long Beach.
Synthesized from African agricultural celebrations and principles,
it begins Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Kwanzaa'' comes from Swahili for ``first fruits.''
Each day is marked by focusing on one of the seven principles of
Kwanzaa: unity, self-determination, collective work and
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Gift-giving is optional and usually reserved for children, said
Fette Brown of the Bay Area Kwanzaa Committee, which has been
setting up events for more than 15 years. If exchanged, items
should be handmade or purchased from a black-owned business and be
of educational or cultural value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to Hallmark and getting a card, you're not
celebrating Kwanzaa _ you're doing something else,'' Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Kwanzaa is not, its participants say, is Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say it's like black Christmas, dreaming of a black
Christmas,'' Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Brown: ``The reason it's not a Christmas substitute is
because Dr. Karenga recognized the undue hardship the
over-commercialization of Christmas has had for people at the
lowest rungs of the economic ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   But with wider acceptance also has come increased popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa has grown not only in the United States but throughout
the world. It is celebrated by blacks in Europe, the Caribbean,
Asia and Latin America, said Chimbuko Tembo, a vice chair of Us,
the Los Angeles-based organization that founded Kwanzaa and is
headed by Karenga.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said some people started to observe it because
mainstream society legitimized it for them. ``They don't emphasize
the principles, don't talk about the spiritual aspect,'' she said.

<P>
   On Christmas Eve, my mother used to build a fireplace with large
red cardboard blocks. It never occurred to me to wonder how Santa
got through the solid wall, unlike my friend Chris, who brooded
about Santa coming down his chimney straight into the oil burner.
``He comes in the door,'' his mom reassured him. ``What do you
think, he's stupid?'' an answer, he explains, which made as much
sense as anything else. Chris's family always hung up nylon
stockings and on Christmas morning he came down to lumpy brown
sausages, 5 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   I've been talking to friends about their memories of Christmas
Eve, trying to discover what sticks in the mind. I found that folks
most fondly recall those yearly traditions that contrast with
run-of-the-mill Christmas routines. Not one person mentioned
specific gifts. Most of the stuff in the boxes, it turns out,
disappears into a forgotten file in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike home-grown, family-invented ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Rob's mother stacked presents behind an ironing board draped
with a sheet. Armed with a bamboo fishing pole, each kid would
``fish'' for his present, hauling in the one Mom tied to the line,
a practice Rob still follows. Holly, who was named for her birth on
Christmas Eve, remembers having her own very satisfying Birthday
Tree, decorated with non-Christmas ornaments. It sat happily beside
the family's larger tree, sheltering the birthday presents Holly
was allowed to open that night.
</P>
<P>
   For many, an abundance of love was symbolized by buffet tables
groaning under ethnic specialties, from exotic Caribbean or German
delicacies to semirepulsive oyster stew. An Italian friend
remembers the Christmas Eve dinner her family called the Feast of
Seven Fishes. Rosalie couldn't tell one fish from another, but
she's never forgotten the eels her aunt kept alive and fresh in her
bathtub or the calamari (squid to non-Italians), tentacles peeking
out of the spaghetti. Emily recalls the magic of eating dinner in
the wee hours after midnight Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Eating together is inseparable from being together, and for many
children, Christmas Eve was the time siblings and cousins could
avoid the supervision of adults. For Magnolia, the informal crush
of adults around a table heaped high with food gave kids the
freedom to run up and down stairs, raising a ruckus that was only
noticed intermittently. Few of my friends noticed whether relatives
were squabbling or bristling at one another. A crowd was excitement
enough.
</P>
<P>
   For some of my friends, it's the sounds of the holiday that
linger. Jeb recalls the Buffalo Philharmonic performing at her
church on Christmas Eve, transporting her into a magical realm.
Mike remembers the exhilaration of staying up until midnight and
singing the Hallelujah Chorus at midnight Mass with his whole
heart. Some families went caroling or spent Christmas Eve singing
around the piano, while others focused on the spoken word, a yearly
retelling of Ellin Greene's ``Legend of the Christmas Rose,'' or
``The Night Before Christmas,'' or Bible readings, repeated year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   There's also more than one way to handle the tree, from cutting
one down in the woods at dusk to waiting to trim it on Christmas
Eve. My daughter, Laura, fondly remembers our family lying under
the tree before bedtime, taking the time to admire the twinkling
lights casting colored shadows on the ceiling. In Mark and
Shannon's ritual honoring their tree, each person expresses thanks
to the tree before dropping a pinch of tobacco into a cloth, which
is then tied at the ends. The littlest child then hangs up this
bundle of gratitude as the first ornament.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by how the tellers of these tales remembered their
families' rituals with enormous pleasure. Children, I think, come
to count on familiar ceremonies, comforted by predictability. No
matter how chaotic life gets, a ritual anchors a family to solid
ground, providing a safety zone for anticipation and recollection.
It's no wonder moments of repetition appear as peaks of experience
in the level blur of the past.
</P>
<P>
   These last hours before Christmas are a perfect time to rebel
against have-to-do's and concentrate on love-to-do's. Have you
filled your seasonal fun quotient? What could you do _ so silly, so
special, so meaningful _ to bring a smile to your children's faces
years from now? No kids? Why not do something worth remembering
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Every ritual had its start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why not at this very moment?

PORTFOLIO'S AGGRESSIVE PARTS WORK BEST IN ROTH IRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. There's one Roth IRA conversion issue I have not yet seen
addressed in the financial media, and that's the priority of which
IRA funds to convert _ income or growth holdings. You wrote in a
recent column that funds with the greatest growth potential should
be converted, but you didn't explain why. I have five IRA funds.
There is $29,000 in Janus, $16,000 in Harbor International, $17,000
in Baron Asset, $6,000 in T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income, and
$10,500 in Fidelity Convertible Securities. I can afford to convert
about half of the current value of these accounts. In trying to
decide which to convert, I was assuming that funds producing income
would be better candidates than growth funds. I base that
assumption on current tax law that taxes dividends at higher rates
than capital gains, so the greatest benefit in the long run would
be with income funds. Is that assumption correct? I am 46 and in
the 28 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   S.O., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Alas, it doesn't work that way. When withdrawals are taken
from a traditional IRA, Uncle Sam treats the entire amount of the
withdrawal as ordinary income, provided the contributions have been
made on a deductible basis. The rules do not differentiate between
capital gains either long or short, or income; since the entire
balance of a traditional deductible IRA is viewed by Uncle Sam as
money not yet taxed, the full amount of the withdrawal must be
reported as taxable income on line 15b of your 1040 form.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the great advantage of the Roth IRA is that while
you must pay the taxes on money that's contributed to it _ either
through direct deposits or a conversion of a traditional IRA to a
Roth _ that's the end of your tax liability for the account.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, you transfer half of your traditional IRA
money into Roth IRA accounts. This would mean a total transfer of
$39,250, and special rules for this tax year allow you to spread
the tax liability over four years. Thus you would pay a total of
$10,990 in taxes to make the transfer. But consider that if you put
the transferred money in stock funds, you should be able to
reasonably expect average 10 percent annual total returns over the
next 20 years. Thus at age 66, you should have something in the
neighborhood of $264,054 in the Roth IRA _ and you can take the
money out in retirement with no tax bill at all.
</P>
<P>
   So since you will have no tax liability on the growth of the
Roth account, you would be best putting the most aggressive parts
of your portfolio allocations in the Roth. In the example above,
you would face $10,990 in near-term taxes, but the $206,804
portfolio growth will be entirely tax free.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose that you did it the other way, using the Roth for
your most conservative investments. If we suppose average annual
growth of only 7 percent, based on a Roth portfolio dominated by
fixed-income holdings, the 20-year growth would take the account to
only $151,885. Your short-term tax liability would be the same,
$10,990, but in exchange for that, you would have accumulated only
$112,635 in tax-free growth.
</P>
<P>
   If the fixed- income end of the portfolio were left in the
traditional IRA accounts, you would have only $151,885 upon which
taxes would be due upon withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   As for your specific portfolio, my suggestion at this point
would be to transfer the entire holdings in Baron Asset (a
small-cap growth fund) and Harbor International, and $6,250 of the
holdings in Janus. Probably over the long term, the Janus position
has better growth potential than Harbor International, a world
stock fund. But in the short-to-intermediate term, I think you're
likely to see better growth in the small-cap and international
markets than in the fast-cooling large-cap stocks favored by Janus.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, both Roth and traditional IRAs allow you to change
your holdings within the accounts without any tax consequences, so
you might in five years decide that prospects for the domestic
large caps are then better than for an international portfolio _ so
you could simply swap Harbor International shares for Janus shares
in the Roth portfolio, and then swap Janus shares for Harbor
International in the traditional portfolio _ maintaining the
identical portfolio balance, but keeping the holdings that seem to
have the best growth potential in the account that won't be taxed
when you eventually withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   One important addendum: people planning to transfer funds from a
traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and spread the tax liability over
four tax years must make the transfer by Dec. 31. Although
contributions to IRAs can be made until April 15 of the year
following the tax year in question, a transfer with the tax
liability spread over four years must be made during this calendar
year. The provision allowing the liability to be spread over four
years is a one-time goodie for 1998, and will not be allowed later.
This can be a critical factor for people who contemplate
transferring large sums to a Roth, since a large transfer could
push many people into a higher tax bracket, while spreading it out
over four years may not have that effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In about two years when my wife is 77 and I am 76, we plan to
sell our house and move to a rather expensive retirement community.
We expect to clear about $700,000 from the house, and we would like
to draw about $5,000 a month, after taxes, from the house money.
Our combined state and federal tax bracket is 45.3 percent, and we
will probably remain in that bracket. My first reaction was to buy
an annuity, but after studying the figures, I believe we could do
as well through other investments and have the possibility of
leaving some of the money to our heirs. As of this writing, I am
leaning toward a tax-free mutual fund paying 3.54 percent, which my
amateur figuring says is equivalent to 6.4 percent taxable. If we
go this route, how long could we expect our $700,000 to last with
$5,000 monthly withdrawals?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Presuming that the municipal fund you're looking at is free
of both California and federal taxes, the answer is that the funds
would run out just a bit short of 15 years. If you shopped around a
bit, you could probably find a fund with a better yield than the
one you're considering. Entering this month, the Fidelity Investor
newsletter reported a current yield of 4.01 percent for Fidelity
Spartan California Municipal Income, which it calculated was
equivalent to a 7 percent return for a person in the 36 percent
federal tax bracket. That small change in returns would mean that
the funds would last you about eight months longer than if your
investment averaged a 3.54 percent yield.

GRAND CHROKEE: STILL A JEEP, BUT ALMOST ALL   NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee _ like the company that makes it _ is
brand new this year. It isn't Chrysler Corp. anymore; it's
DaimlerChrysler. The company rep who introduced it to the motor
press at the New England International Auto Show held up a brown
paper grocery sack containing ``all the carryover parts'' _ about
27 pieces in all, if I remember correctly. All small bits.
</P>
<P>
   The body is new, the suspension is new, the engine is new, it is
larger all around. Still, it resembles its forebears _ there's no
mistaking it. It's a Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   So there it was in the driveway, waiting. ``I've got to do
something with this,'' I said to myself _ I talk to myself a lot
lately. ``Something'' involving trucks or sport/utilities usually
includes heavy lifting. ``Something'' this time started with a trip
to a purveyor of used office equipment where there was offered for
a reasonable price an oversized file cabinet, perfect for the
storage of oversize photographs, music folios, and other assorted
miscellany now littering the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, at $33,995 plus $525
destination charge, is hardly cheap, not exactly bare utilitarian.
For the money it comes plush _ leather, wood trim, automatic air
conditioning, automatic headlamps, dual heated outside mirrors, and
Chrysler's Quadra-Trac II _ an on-demand 4-wheel-drive system with
low range and automatic gearbox. ``On demand'' means the system
senses loss of traction in slippery going and shifts power to the
wheels with grip to keep you moving.
</P>
<P>
   For $6,250 less, you can get a Grand Cherokee Laredo in 4WD with
Selec-Trac, a full-time 4WD system, cloth upholstery, and manual
air conditioning. Skip the 4WD all together and still the cheapest
Grand is $25,800 plus delivery. Where do all these people who buy
these things get the money?
</P>
<P>
   The Limited in leather is not what one buys for heavy work or
rough cartage, but it is a sure way to get a file cabinet home.
Getting it in was easy _ the seller loaded it _ once I had figured
out how to fold the rear seats flat (the owner's manual was a big
help here, even though it is against the rules of malehood to ask
directions). In this edition of Grand Cherokee, the rear seat
bottoms flip up against the back of the front seat and the backs
fold down flat. No longer is it necessary to remove the headrests;
merely flip the lever on the back of the headrest and yank it
forward, thus folding it to allow the seatback to fold down.
</P>
<P>
   Unloading it was the problem _ the cabinet, judging by its
weight, is of excellent quality. Once eased out of the truck,
removing the drawers lightened the shell sufficiently to nudge it
along to its permanent place of repose _ one has occasion to miss
the teenagers when they grow up and go away.
</P>
<P>
   The new engine is a 4.7-liter V-8 dishing up 235 horsepower in
its standard configuration, 230 in a low-emission mode, and
delivers 295 ft/lb of torque. The 4-speed automatic gearbox is very
smooth with a conveniently placed floor shifter; the low-range
lever is to the left of it, out of the way but easy to reach. The
Laredo, by the way, is offered with 4.0-liter six-cylinder
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The new V-8 replaces the venerable 5.2-liter (318 CID) V-8 that
has been around for eons. What is lost in engine displacement,
however, does not seem to be gained in fuel economy; the Grand
delivered 16.03 miles per gallon over some 500 miles charted. Nor
is there any loss in performance; the Jeep moves out smartly
enough, albeit hard acceleration is more than a trifle noisy. The
tested model, however, is a pre-production vehicle that customers
won't normally get; the pre-pros frequently have bugs that must be
eliminated before full production begins and thus are not always
representative of what the customer will get.
</P>
<P>
   Where this Grand Cherokee disappointed was in ride and handling;
it is not the solid hulk that was the predecessor. The ride on the
'99 is softer; there is a certain vagueness on the road, a lack of
positive feedback that makes me nervous _ but again, this may only
be the anomaly of a prototype. The Grand certainly behaved well
enough, even if it didn't feel quite as surefooted this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Rear room has certainly improved; while the kneeroom in the back
can be snug with long-legged types up front, there is more than
yesteryear. Headroom is good, even with the space-robbing sunroof.
Rear entry is a bit awkward because of the wheel well intrusion,
exacerbated by the extra height off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is a mixed bag. The glove box is pitiful, but a
large covered bin between the seats, seatback pockets, and door
bins help.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are very good, with hefty knobs to set temperature and
control airflow. Some of the radio controls, however, are the
exception _ too small, too close together.
</P>
<P>
   OK, what good is a sport/utility just before Christmas if it
doesn't get put to the tree test? A dusting of snow is beginning to
make it feel like Christmas as I head northwest for the Sundance
Farm to find a tree where hot cider awaits the prospective
customers. I tramp into the woods, select a carefully manicured
balsam of about seven feet, and hack it down (a woodsman I am not)
with the supplied bow saw. It is a well-formed, plump tree that
needs a lot of pushing and pulling to get it far enough into the
Jeep to close the rear hatch _ and then a foot of tree trunk hovers
around my right ear.
</P>
<P>
   I should have used the roof rack _ I had brought rope. Even
fresh trees shed needles, and evergreen needles are vacuum-cleaner
resistant like nothing else on earth, but they sure smell good.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Grand Cherokee has gained a little, lost a little, I
think, but on balance I'd have to give it a thumbs up for being a
most elegant workhorse with a drive system that is perfect for
winter _ which no part-time 4WD sytem can ever be.

MARTIN DIDN'T HESITATE TO REJOIN HIS OLD COACH IN N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The opponent: the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The topic: Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Any regrets, Bill Parcells, about forking over $36
million of Leon Hess's petrodollars and some draft picks for the
running back?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells took some heat when he signed Martin last summer,
mainly for the financial implications at the time and down the
road. He heard it then and paid it no heed, and now, almost 1,200
yards and a division title later, there's even further reason to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they say,'' Parcells said Wednesday. ``I
think the guy is a good player. When you see a good player, you try
to get him. You don't just pass on a player like Curtis Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Patriots did, however, taking the picks, saving
the money, and allowing Martin, their best running back over the
previous three years, to head south. He already has rushed for more
yards (1,185) this season than in either of his last two years in
New England. His 353 receiving yards are a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Martin nor Parcells is surprised by the tailback's
season, even though he has been bothered by sore legs for most of
the year. There is a bond at work here, as there is between
Parcells and other ex-Patriots on the team. Martin said he came
here for one reason: the coach. Yeah, the money helped, but that
was not the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would have happened if there had been
another team, but with Bill, it was no question,'' Martin said.
``To be reunited with him and (running backs coach) Mo Carthon;
those guys have taught me so much. It was a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be here. I didn't mention any numbers or amounts
to my agent. It was the only situation for me. But I wasn't
expecting it. I was expecting to be back in New England. When I got
the news, I got on my knees and prayed. It was like a blessing from
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin may not have produced a jaw-dropping season, but he is
fifth in the AFC in rushing and already has produced the third-best
rushing season in Jets history. But he hasn't been drop-dead
dazzling on a week-to-week basis, and his 3.5-yard average gain is
a career low. His eight TDs are second only to the four he had last
year; he had 14 in each of his first two years in New England.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some big games (144 yards against Indianapolis)
and some not-so-big ones (38 yards last week against Buffalo), but
all Parcells sees is the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take 1,200 (yards) from a back. Just keep giving me
that,'' Parcells said. ``The guys that play this position, the
defenses are after them every week. There are no weeks off for
these guys. Just add up the yards he's got in four years. How many
have that many in their entire careers?''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said what he envies most about Martin, however, has
nothing to do with carrying the football. ``I think the best way to
describe it,'' Parcells said, ``is that he is at peace with himself
at such a young age (25). I wish I was. It doesn't mean he's any
less determined or ambitious. He just has an inner strength. I know
what kind of person he is. He shows up. He works his butt off. He
has no baggage. He's compassionate. What else do you want from a
guy?''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots knew all this, too, but decided the cost was too
steep. In the first meeting of the season between the teams, Martin
rushed for 107 yards as the Jets won, 24-14. He had sat out the
previous game in St. Louis, the only time in his three years with
Parcells that he has been unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   He's looking forward to Sunday, to finishing the regular season
strongly, to the playoffs, and to the unknown. What he's not doing
is looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' he said of his departure from New England.
``It's in my past. It's where I used to play and what I used to
represent. You put it behind you. That was the team I once played
for, but now it's over with.''

ZOLAK IS UP FRONT ON PARCELLS' EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In the background, a group of sportswriters
were howling as Bill Parcells was making some self-depricating
remarks about his weight on a conference call from Hofstra
University, the Jets' training site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, listen. Let me tell ya something,'' said Parcells,
addressing a Sports Illustrated story that listed his weight at 240
pounds. ``If I fell down, I'd rock myself to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a microphone in an adjacent room, Scott Zolak was
speaking over the jocularity, taking about the
second-most-important start of his career Sunday against Parcells
and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another game,'' said the Patriots quarterback,
unconvincingly. ``Last week the playoffs were on the line. This
week there's the possibility of a home game in the playoffs to play
for, and that would be huge for us _ to host a game against Miami.
We're gonna be scrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is above being spooked by Parcells, it might be Zolak.
When Parcells was coaching in New England, he liked his backup
quarterback; if not, Zolak wouldn't have been around. And while he
took his share of criticism from the coach, Zolak often gave as
much as he took. During the 1996 Super Bowl season, for example,
when Parcells mentioned that Zolak needed to lose some weight,
Zolak responded with something to the effect of, ``He should
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that exchange Wednesday, Zolak shrugged it off,
making it sound like no big deal. ``Quarterbacks are getting
bigger,'' he said with a grin. ``I'm a lot lighter now than I have
been. I've done a lot of extra running, and being involved in
practice as much as I have been the past few weeks keeps the weight
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Zolak always had a response for his former coach, he
also knows that while the kind words Parcells has been bestowing
upon him the past couple of days may be genuine to some degree,
there's also a method to his madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players really rally around Zo,'' said Parcells. ``He has
a good arm and he prepares well for games _ at least he did when I
had him. I remember the game we started him in Atlanta in '95, he
hit 15 of his first 20. I thought he played very well last
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, assistant head coach Bill Belichick, defensive
coordinator Al Groh and Co. probably already have Zolak defensed,
confused, overwhelmed, etc. with their game plan. Belichick has
been the assistant coach of the year in the NFL, the only to
successfully shut down Doug Flutie twice. His defensive game plans
have been impeccable, just as they were during the Patriots'
playoff run in '96. The only time Belichick and Groh failed was in
the Super Bowl when Otis Smith and Willie Clay got beat on long
balls.
</P>
<P>
   That may be precisley where the Patriots are able to do some
damage. After all, as well as Smith has played this season, he is
still Otis Smith. The Jets take away the middle-range passing game
as well as anyone because of their aggressive linebacking corps, so
throwing to Ben Coates may be a little harder than in other weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a great job on the underneath stuff,'' said
Zolak. ``Their linebackers have been glued to the receivers. Otis
Smith, Jerome Henderson, who both played here, have done a great
job in coverage, and Victor Green is a lot like Lawyer Milloy in
that he hits people pretty hard. I'm sure that they're going to put
together a plan they think can bring out my weaknesses. They know
me pretty well over there, so they know what I can do and what I
can't do. Now we have to find a way to put me in a position so my
strengths are utlized.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak still feels the whack in the back of the neck he took from
Ken Norton Jr. last Sunday, and he suspects that the Jets will try
to rattle him with blitzes from the corners and even from Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say they'd come after me,'' said Zolak. ``Their defense
does something different every game, but where I'm a guy who hasn't
played that much and for a long time, they'll try to make it tough
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak is preparing knowing that he definitely will be at the
helm Sunday. On Monday, Pete Carroll had left the door sightly ajar
for a return by Drew Bledsoe, but that was slammed shut when the
coach said that his usual starting quarterback won't even be active
for the game. In fact, Bledsoe may not be active in the playoffs,
especially if Zolak continues to win.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak certainly put on a winning show last Sunday, and he
reveled in that triumph for as long as he could. He understands
that opportunities to win games that get a team into the playoffs
are few and far between. He also knows that on Sunday ``this could
be the last game I play.'' And he knows if that's the case he'd
like nothing better than to end any jinxes, curses, or ghosts that
hover around the Patriots as related to the former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has a lot to do with me being here,'' said Zolak. ``Phil
Simms used to say that one of the things Bill does is make you
thick-skinned. And that's true. You learn to take a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Parcells got on him about his weight, Zolak
gave it right back. Parcells's former players remember so many
little things that motivate them when they face him.
</P>
<P>
   The players strive to perform better when they're facing
Parcells _ though they tend to say that the legend of their former
coach is a media myth. ``I think that stuff is overblown by the
media,'' said Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   Also overblown, said Zolak, is the notion that Parcells can get
into the heads of his former players, as he seemed to do with
Bledsoe. ``There's no question he's a great coach who knows our
personnel, but we should also know what he might try to do,'' said
Zolak. ``We know him pretty well, too.''

TAINTING OF THE RINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of a vote for a wanna-be Olympic host city used to be
a couple of first-class plane tickets, a luxury suite, a jeroboam
of bubbly, and maybe some calfskin luggage. Now, apparently, it's
free knee surgery, college scholarships, or a few hundred grand.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords of the Rings may relish their perks, but they're
supposed to be above bribery. Not so, says longtime International
Olympic Committee insider Marc Hodler, who claims that as many as
two dozen of his fellow members have sold their votes during the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, which spent more than $600,000 (much of it on
school subsidies for IOC family members) to sew up the 2002 Winter
Games, was merely playing the five-ringed game. ``I know of so many
times,'' said Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who has been an IOC member
since 1963. ``There is a good chance it is always the case.''
</P>
<P>
   That came as no surprise to disappointed bid cities such as
Sion, Switzerland, and Oestersund, Sweden, which either didn't know
they had to buy votes or refused to. Hodler claimed that middlemen
demand between $500,000 and $1 million for a bloc of votes and
charge the winning city another $3 million-$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's loose change, though, to lasso an event that brings
priceless prestige _ and an estimated $5 billion in tourist
revenues _ to the victor.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of would-be hosts has soared (10 cities bid for
the 2002 Games; 11 wanted the 2004 Summer Games, which went to
Athens; six have lined up for 2006, nine for 2008) and the number
of IOC members has grown from 90 in 1980 to 115, the bidding has
taken on the shady aura of a backstreet bazaar, with cities
offering lavish gifts and services and ``agents'' dangling blocs of
votes (usually from Africa) for a seven-figure price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four agents we know,'' said Hodler, who claims that
the host-city votes for the 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 Games have
all been tainted. ``One is an IOC member. He promises he will give
enough votes so the city can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two decades ago, the Lords couldn't give the Games away.
After Montreal lost a billion dollars on the 1976 Summer Olympics,
only Los Angeles dared bid for 1984. And after the US-led boycott
of Moscow in 1980 only two candidates _ Seoul and Nagoya _ entered
for 1988. What deluded city would be willing to risk a 10-figure
deficit on a 16-day event that half the world might skip?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, it was: Which city can afford to lose this
much money?'' says Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from
Canada. ``Now the Olympics are seen as an economic benefit to the
city. They've become a desirable international multiyear project.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed when LA emerged with a $200 million surplus
despite the Soviet boycott. Suddenly, there were six bidders for
the 1992 Summer Games and seven for the Winter Games _ and royal
perks for any IOC member who cared to indulge.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul had already set a handout standard in 1982. The night
before the Lords voted for 1988, the Koreans slipped two
first-class plane tickets, redeemable for cash, under their hotel
doors. Seoul swamped Nagoya, which had been the odds-on favorite,
by a 2-1 margin. Coincidence _ or not?
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, when half a dozen cities were in the chase for 1996,
Hodler says that quid pro quo was the byword. When Atlanta, which
had never before bid for the Olympics, bested Athens for the
Centennial Games, the shocked and furious Greeks cried foul.
``Coca-Cola has won over the Parthenon,'' declared actress Melina
Mercouri, the country's Minister of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which clearly had the best bid package, denied paying
anybody off. ``No payments, direct or indirect,'' insisted
organizing committee head Billy Payne. ``No scholarships, direct or
indirect. I have never heard of that and will state positively,
unequivocally, Atlanta did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, which had already bid unsuccessfully four times,
also believed it had the best package when it went after the 1998
Games a year later. When the Utahns lost to Nagano by four votes,
they realized they'd been playing the wrong game. ``The joke,''
says former SLOC member Fred Ball, ``was that we were giving out
salt water taffy and Japan was giving out Toyotas.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, it would be scholarships and surgery. Salt Lake
immediately set aside nearly half a million dollars for
``humanitarian aid,'' i.e. 13 college subsidies for foreign
students, six of them relatives of IOC members, most of them from
Africa. And a local hospital provided more than $25,000 in free
medical services (including a knee replacement) to three Africans
with IOC links.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $60 million of public money on facilities and $13
million of private cash on bidding, Salt Lake was leaving nothing
to chance for 2002, even though it easily had the best bid. When
the IOC voted in 1995, Salt Lake slam-dunked Sion, Oestersund, and
Quebec on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   When a local television station broke the payoff story last
month, outrage and embarrassment followed. SLOC chairman Frank
Joklik, who claimed he knew nothing of the payoffs, was called on
the carpet by the IOC executive committee at its meeting in
Switzerland two weekends ago to explain and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' said Hodler. ``We blame those
voters who can be bought. For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of
blackmail and not a villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has been president for
nearly two decades, nobody knows more about how the bidding game
works than Hodler, who, at 80, is the dean of the Lords. While he
held forth recently in the lobby of IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, past bid committee members from Sydney, Anchorage,
Lillehammer, and Quebec said they had been solicited for bribes.
And Melbourne officials admitted they gave money to IOC members
during their unsuccessful 1996 bid.

GRAND CHROKEE: STILL A JEEP, BUT ALMOST ALL   NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee _ like the company that makes it _ is
brand new this year. It isn't Chrysler Corp. anymore; it's
DaimlerChrysler. The company rep who introduced it to the motor
press at the New England International Auto Show held up a brown
paper grocery sack containing ``all the carryover parts'' _ about
27 pieces in all, if I remember correctly. All small bits.
</P>
<P>
   The body is new, the suspension is new, the engine is new, it is
larger all around. Still, it resembles its forebears _ there's no
mistaking it. It's a Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   So there it was in the driveway, waiting. ``I've got to do
something with this,'' I said to myself _ I talk to myself a lot
lately. ``Something'' involving trucks or sport/utilities usually
includes heavy lifting. ``Something'' this time started with a trip
to a purveyor of used office equipment where there was offered for
a reasonable price an oversized file cabinet, perfect for the
storage of oversize photographs, music folios, and other assorted
miscellany now littering the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, at $33,995 plus $525
destination charge, is hardly cheap, not exactly bare utilitarian.
For the money it comes plush _ leather, wood trim, automatic air
conditioning, automatic headlamps, dual heated outside mirrors, and
Chrysler's Quadra-Trac II _ an on-demand 4-wheel-drive system with
low range and automatic gearbox. ``On demand'' means the system
senses loss of traction in slippery going and shifts power to the
wheels with grip to keep you moving.
</P>
<P>
   For $6,250 less, you can get a Grand Cherokee Laredo in 4WD with
Selec-Trac, a full-time 4WD system, cloth upholstery, and manual
air conditioning. Skip the 4WD all together and still the cheapest
Grand is $25,800 plus delivery. Where do all these people who buy
these things get the money?
</P>
<P>
   The Limited in leather is not what one buys for heavy work or
rough cartage, but it is a sure way to get a file cabinet home.
Getting it in was easy _ the seller loaded it _ once I had figured
out how to fold the rear seats flat (the owner's manual was a big
help here, even though it is against the rules of malehood to ask
directions). In this edition of Grand Cherokee, the rear seat
bottoms flip up against the back of the front seat and the backs
fold down flat. No longer is it necessary to remove the headrests;
merely flip the lever on the back of the headrest and yank it
forward, thus folding it to allow the seatback to fold down.
</P>
<P>
   Unloading it was the problem _ the cabinet, judging by its
weight, is of excellent quality. Once eased out of the truck,
removing the drawers lightened the shell sufficiently to nudge it
along to its permanent place of repose _ one has occasion to miss
the teenagers when they grow up and go away.
</P>
<P>
   The new engine is a 4.7-liter V-8 dishing up 235 horsepower in
its standard configuration, 230 in a low-emission mode, and
delivers 295 ft/lb of torque. The 4-speed automatic gearbox is very
smooth with a conveniently placed floor shifter; the low-range
lever is to the left of it, out of the way but easy to reach. The
Laredo, by the way, is offered with 4.0-liter six-cylinder
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The new V-8 replaces the venerable 5.2-liter (318 CID) V-8 that
has been around for eons. What is lost in engine displacement,
however, does not seem to be gained in fuel economy; the Grand
delivered 16.03 miles per gallon over some 500 miles charted. Nor
is there any loss in performance; the Jeep moves out smartly
enough, albeit hard acceleration is more than a trifle noisy. The
tested model, however, is a pre-production vehicle that customers
won't normally get; the pre-pros frequently have bugs that must be
eliminated before full production begins and thus are not always
representative of what the customer will get.
</P>
<P>
   Where this Grand Cherokee disappointed was in ride and handling;
it is not the solid hulk that was the predecessor. The ride on the
'99 is softer; there is a certain vagueness on the road, a lack of
positive feedback that makes me nervous _ but again, this may only
be the anomaly of a prototype. The Grand certainly behaved well
enough, even if it didn't feel quite as surefooted this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Rear room has certainly improved; while the kneeroom in the back
can be snug with long-legged types up front, there is more than
yesteryear. Headroom is good, even with the space-robbing sunroof.
Rear entry is a bit awkward because of the wheel well intrusion,
exacerbated by the extra height off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is a mixed bag. The glove box is pitiful, but a
large covered bin between the seats, seatback pockets, and door
bins help.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are very good, with hefty knobs to set temperature and
control airflow. Some of the radio controls, however, are the
exception _ too small, too close together.
</P>
<P>
   OK, what good is a sport/utility just before Christmas if it
doesn't get put to the tree test? A dusting of snow is beginning to
make it feel like Christmas as I head northwest for the Sundance
Farm to find a tree where hot cider awaits the prospective
customers. I tramp into the woods, select a carefully manicured
balsam of about seven feet, and hack it down (a woodsman I am not)
with the supplied bow saw. It is a well-formed, plump tree that
needs a lot of pushing and pulling to get it far enough into the
Jeep to close the rear hatch _ and then a foot of tree trunk hovers
around my right ear.
</P>
<P>
   I should have used the roof rack _ I had brought rope. Even
fresh trees shed needles, and evergreen needles are vacuum-cleaner
resistant like nothing else on earth, but they sure smell good.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Grand Cherokee has gained a little, lost a little, I
think, but on balance I'd have to give it a thumbs up for being a
most elegant workhorse with a drive system that is perfect for
winter _ which no part-time 4WD sytem can ever be.

SKI SEASON FINALLY HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAY, Vt. _ ``This is not a business for the faint of heart,''
mused Bill Stenger, president of Jay Peak Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before Christmas Stenger was looking at a rain shower
falling from a leaden sky. It felt more like spring than the first
day of winter _ and just four days before the start of the busiest
periods of the ski season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nail-biter,'' said Stenger, ``but we're going to
pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in the mountains has been a long tradition for Sandy
and Lew Lawson, who are taking their two college-age children to
Quebec's Tremblant this winter. Like thousands of New Englanders,
the Lawsons will leave the day after Christmas for a week of
skiing, ending on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith,'' said Sandy. ``I know it hasn't been a great
winter for skiing so far, but it's cold now. I have a sister in
Quebec, and she tells me it's been down in the teens every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold did show up in New England, but, as Stenger said, a
little too close for comfort. It is expected to stay cold through
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   According to bookings at most major ski areas in New England,
many people are planning on heading north, especially next week.
Still, said Lew Lawson, ``When you ski this time of year you take
what you get. Some years it's great, and other years you have to
watch what your skis are going over.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, skiers faced a meltdown at Christmas after an
excellent Thanksgiving snowfall. The period before Christmas was
the best part of last season. This year?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make it,'' Stenger repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Maine's Sunday River, Skip King agreed that the autumn
leg of the season was ``kind of frustrating, but now we're through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With much relief, ski area operators are looking at a long
period of cold weather in which they can add to the base and open
more trails. Few if any areas will be at 100 percent, but most will
fall between 50 and 75 percent open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have six of eight peaks open this weekend, and probably
get seven peaks open next week,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the optimism despite the warmest fall in New
England history is the state of snowmaking in the northeast. Heavy
competition among ski areas the last two decades and advancing
technology that allows the process to take place at higher
temperatures have ensured that a few cold nights equal skiable
snow.
</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologist Mark Breen, who covers northern and
central Vermont, the weather system known as La Nina is about to
take hold, plunging the far north into deep winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the cold air mass expands,'' said Breen, ``it will start to
bring cold and snow to the northern inland areas. Areas to the
south and near the coastal influence won't feel the effect as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Breen confirmed that the fall was unusual. ``We have a pond
we've watched and kept records on for 30 years,'' he said, ``and
this is the latest that it hasn't frozen over.''
</P>
<P>
   He also confirmed that the cold spell that took hold Tuesday
night will hang in through Christmas. But, he added, aside from
flurries here and there, no big snow dumps appear in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   All this week, open acreage has been expanding at all ski areas,
and should continue through the period, according to area managers.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Killington had 32 trails open, about 20 percent
of its terrain, but the snowguns are whirling and the area is
expected to have half its terrain skiable by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south in Vermont, Okemo has 31 trails open and is
working on a base between 1 and 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gunstock has six trails open on a 6-to-18-inch
base, while Cannon has 14 trails open with an 8-20-inch base.
</P>
<P>
   Few glades or outback areas are open, since they need lots of
natural snow. Also, halfpipes and terrain gardens need more
snowfall than most areas have been blessed with.
</P>
<P>
   With conditions variable and changing, skiers should either call
their area ahead or read published listings. The following is a
standard code of the condition symbols.
</P>
<P>
   --New Snow: Natural snowfall that has occurred within the past
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Average Base Depth: An average of the high and low amounts of
snow over the entire ski area, both machine and natural.
</P>
<P>
   --Primary Surface Condition: The type of snow that covers at
least 70 percent of the open terrain.
</P>
<P>
   --Powder, PDR: Cold, new, loose, fluffy snow.
</P>
<P>
   --Packed Powder, PP: Man-made or natural snow that has been
packed by skier traffic or grooming machine.
</P>
<P>
   --Hard Pack, HP: Snow that has been packed so hard that it takes
effort to drive a pole into.
</P>
<P>
   --Machine-groomed Snow, MSG: Loose, granular snow that has been
repeatedly packed by power-tillers to the consistency of powder
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   --Wet Snow, WETSN: Powder or packed powder that has become moist
because of rainfall or thaw.
</P>
<P>
   --Loose Granular, LSGR: A consistency of frozen crystalized snow
created by freeze/thaw cycles.
</P>
<P>
   --Frozen Granular. FRGR: A hard surface of old snow formed by
granules of snow thawing and freezing together.
</P>
<P>
   --Wet Granular, WETGR: Loose and frozen granular snow that has
become wet after thaw or rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   --ICE: Hard, glazed surface that will not support a ski pole.
</P>
<P>
   --Variable Conditions, VC: When no primary condition (70
percent) can be determined.
</P>
<P>
   --Corn Snow, CORN: A surface condition consisting of large loose
granules that roll together like ball bearings.
</P>
<P>
   --Spring Conditions, SC: When in warm temperatures no one
surface condition can be determined over 70 percent of the area.
</P>
<P>
   --Windblown Snow, WBLN: Powder or granular snow that has been
blown by the wind into a hard base surface.

TWAIN REMAINS UNMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are looking through the musings of Edith Thys, in which a
feisty former racer from from the US Ski Team makes her case for
Western skiing. Of course, she is a Westerner herself (Squaw
Valley, Calif.) who admits right up front in the current issue of
Ski magazine that because of the polarization of East vs. West, ``I
was quite sure that had I been born in the East I would not have
become a skier.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to leave her commentary here, for Thys does
go on to write an insightful, very readable, and ultimately fair
comparison of the two areas of skiing which, she concludes, are
profoundly different. She adds that ``many of our differences have
deep cultural roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we have been around this barn before in this space. But it
still sounds a bit inflexible when people from New England say _ as
they so often do: ``The only skiing I do is the vacation week out
West. I can't face the skiing back in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, these are not what the industry would call mainstream
skiers, but rather _ as they themselves say _ marginal. The less
they ski in the East, with its particular requirements, the less
they can ski the East.
</P>
<P>
   So the West is easier?
</P>
<P>
   The groomed West, yes. The snow is more uniform and less
susceptible to attacks of moisture and the freeze/thaw cycle that
creates Eastern conditions. It's a question of altitude. At 1 1/2-2
miles high, snow is dry, light, and generally unhazardous to one's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Western areas have been developed on wide-open spaces
where the runs are wide and forgiving. Rarely seen is one of those
Eastern-style narrow, cranking corkscrews through dark woods that
close around us like the trees in ``Sleeping Beauty,'' though many
of those New England classics have since been retrofit over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But we emphasize the term groomed West, for much of non-tourist
Western skiing involves blasting through deep crud, hydroplaning
through thigh-high powder, learning that straight fall-line skiing
is the only way through deep stuff, and generally knowing how to
shift gears for various kinds of ``soft'' and broken surface
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Thys, speaking from a racer's viewpoint, sees some deeper
differences. In the East, she says, skiers train rather than ski.
Because of the cold, often hostile climate, Eastern skiers stay in
the lodge when they're not racing, while Westerners are out
freeskiing at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Western skiers do not deal with cold moisture in the air and
thus dress differently _ lighter, freer, less encumbered. Rather
than just ChapStick, Westerners also use prodigious amounts of
suntan lotion, which underlines, with odor, a certain quality of
laid-back ease to the Western approach.
</P>
<P>
   Thys talks about, when coming East to race a few years ago,
underdressing to the point of ``shivering through a December
morning of training in a cotton turtleneck and sweatshirt, never
having contemplated how to dress for damp cold.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not the first to point out that Easterners feel somewhat
superior to Western skiers because of their necessity to ski with
precision over ice, to ski in terrain that demands disciplined
turning, to brave a tougher climate and hard, unforgiving snow.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely have the two skiing cultures been analyzed to such
depths, to their cultural roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern skier behavior can be traced to the Mayflower,'' Thys
says. ``Yankee sensibility and the Puritan work ethic defined
everything from their demeanor to their clothing and their general
resignation that anything worth having is worth suffering for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise,'' Thys adds in a line worthy of Garrison Keillor,
``Western skiers are rooted in the pioneer mentality. They didn't
like the conditions in the East, so they left.''
</P>
<P>
   But one might maintain that the vast superiority of the
Northeastern mentality is its ability to manipulate the environment
in a competitive way. The ``product'' wars of the last two decades
have given nearly every ski area in New England the ability to
create instant winter _ or at least the 48-hour winter.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate aim of the amazing arms race that transformed
Eastern skiing was to create guaranteed winter _ an assurance to
skiers that conditions are not totally dependent on the vagaries of
climate. The Western winter climate in Rocky Mountain high country,
of course, creates its own guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   But skiers and boarders headed north this vacation season
looking for not perfect or even great skiing but skiing just the
same have a well-placed faith in the ability of the East to produce
snow. And, as Thys concludes, in the East, West, or anywhere else,
``Any snow is good snow.''

 UNDATED: ... 1996 bid.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so many cities chasing the Games and more members voting on
them, five-ringed payola seems inevitable. When Baron Pierre de
Coubertin revived the Olympics more than a century ago, he filled
the IOC with princes and dukes and lords because he figured they
would be immune to political and financial influence.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, though, the IOC came to be seen as a private club of
rich, white European octogenarians living in a cloud cuckooland. So
Lord Killanin and Samaranch expanded and diversified the
membership, adding women, former athletes, and sports federation
presidents, and recruited them from around the planet, especially
from Third World nations. Forty percent of the 115 members now are
from Africa, Asia, and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Lords now come from countries where bribery has been
an accepted part of doing business for centuries. Some of them
allegedly will accept cash and services in exchange for votes,
particularly if they have no stake in the outcome. A few _ Hodler
estimates 5-7 percent _ reportedly will ask for them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Samaranch insisted that Hodler wasn't speaking for the
IOC, the chief Lord knows a scandal when he smells one. ``If we
have to clean, we will clean,'' said Samaranch, who vowed to expel
any IOC member proven to have taken bribes.
</P>
<P>
   So he has turned over the whole mess to Richard Pound, who will
begin by investigating the Salt Lake City payoffs and see where
they take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on where the facts lead,'' says Pound, who is a
Montreal attorney and a former Olympic swimmer. ``But I don't think
we're going to run down every rumor involving the IOC for the last
hundred years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bribes or not, the record shows that whichever host city the
Lords select usually puts on excellent Games. ``Leaving aside the
peccadillos of a few IOC members,'' muses Pound, ``you look over a
hundred years or so and we pretty much have gotten it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the IOC would like to rid itself of the backstreet bazaar
aura, and the best way to cut down on the handouts is to reduce the
number of hands. From now on, the Lords will be forbidden to visit
candidate cities, Samaranch says. And instead of having all 115
members vote on host sites, the IOC probably will have the 11
executive committee members do the choosing. ``That's one of the
things we're looking at,'' says Pound.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are no longer a corner clambake. Two hundred
countries are invited with half the planet watching. The host city
is on global display for 16 days and on the international map
forever. Salt Lake City's budget for the Winter Games is $1.4
billion. That ain't salt water taffy.
</P>
<P>
   (Wire service material was used to prepare this report.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT THE IOC IS &QC; 
The International Olympic Committee, founded in 1894 and
headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, oversees the Olympic Games
and promotes the values of `Olympism' across the world. It chooses
its own unpaid members (currently 115) and elects them for life,
with a mandatory retirement age of 80. Countries are generally
limited to one member; those which have hosted the Games are
allotted two. Anita DeFrantz and James Easton are the US members. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW THE GAMES ARE AWARDED &QC; 
Host cities are chosen seven years in advance. A special IOC
evaluation commission visits each bidder, examining everything from
facilities to transportation to hotels to weather, and makes a
detailed report. If necessary, the IOC reduces the number of
candidates to half a dozen or fewer. The full membership then votes
by secret ballot until one city has a majority. The IOC will choose
the site of the 2006 Winter Games in June at a meeting in Seoul. &QL; 
 &QL;

Juan Antonio Samaranch (Spain) president &QL;

TAKE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR NEW PC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're firing up your very first computer for the very first
time, Friday should be a very merry Christmas indeed. Welcome to
the Digital Age!
</P>
<P>
   Few things are as exciting as owning that first personal
computer, except maybe buying a new PC after holding onto an
ancient one for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   But PC ownership can be as maddening as it is joyful. In many
ways, these machines are not ready for prime time, and mastering
them does still take some work and some learning.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-core computer newbies, I've got some basic advice about
getting along with your computer, and getting around the Internet
once you get online. Those who've been using a computer for a while
might want to consider this a quick refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   _ The most important thing I can urge you to do is to spend some
time learning your computer's operating system. Although you may
feel like you just want to know how to use simple applications like
e-mail, word processing or a Web browser, understanding the basics
of your OS will make your techno-life much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Learn about the network of folders, the storage places for
various files, and understand how to navigate them. For Windows
users, spend time exploring your hard drive through the My Computer
icon on your PC's main screen, which is called the Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem arcane right now, but it will become crucial
knowledge once you start navigating the Internet and receiving
e-mail attachments from friends or grabbing free software off Web
sites. When this happens, you'll save these files in specific
folders, and one of the problems many novices have is locating
their treasure after it's been stored on the computer's hard disk.
You'll also want to know how to copy files from one folder to
another, and understand what happens when you install new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Novices may want to invest in a book on the operating system. I
like the ... ``for Dummies'' series from IDG Books. ``Windows 98
for Dummies'' and ``Mac OS 8.5 for Dummies'' are fun to read and
don't talk down to their audiences, despite the implications of the
titles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Run as clean and simple a system as you can. Your PC may have
come with several programs that automatically start and run in the
background, including a virus scanner or something designed to
monitor software installations. Often, these can cause more
problems than they solve.
</P>
<P>
   I usually advise turning these off, particularly virus checkers,
which can interfere with some other programs, particularly software
installations. However, the threats from computer viruses are quite
real, so only turn these off if you are willing to be diligent
about manually scanning any new software that comes into your PC.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, if you experience problems with your system,
the first thing you should try is turning off virus checkers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn about the maintenance features of your computer. New PCs
come with all kinds of goodies for making sure your computer stays
in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Windows 98 users should know about the System
Information Tool (Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools), a Swiss
army knife for your PC. Also, get familiar with the Add/Remove
module in the Control Panel. You never, ever want to remove a
program just by deleting its folder _ always use the program's
listing in this module. Or, buy a third-party uninstall program,
such as Quarterdeck's CleanSweep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some online veterans may disagree with this, but I'd recommend
that those who have never owned a home computer use America Online
for first-time Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the easiest way to get online, and AOL's new 4.0
software is both friendly and powerful. Most of the problems that
AOL encountered when it switched to flat-fee pricing _ including
busy signals _ have been solved. However, its Web access can be
fairly slow, and some Web sites don't work like they are supposed
to with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once online, don't be taken in by hoaxes and scams. You'll see
dire warnings about viruses that are spread by e-mail (they're all
bogus) and you'll get junk e-mail inviting you to make tons of
money by mailing off ``reports'' (they're little more than illegal,
pyramid-scheme chain letters). A Web site sponsored by the Computer
Incident Advisory Capability of the U.S. Department of Energy
tracks online hoaxes at ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you'll eventually get lots of junk e-mail, known as
``spam,'' trying to sell you everything from access to adult Web
sites to plans for homemade cable descramblers. Don't respond to
them, even to requests to be removed from their mailing lists.
Often the ``remove me'' addresses are fake, or they are simply
devious ways to confirm valid e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has a feature called Mail Controls that can help
you filter spam. And all the major e-mail software packages _
Outlook Express, Netscape Communicator, Eudora _ let you create
filters for routing spam directly to your computer's trash bin.
They're not perfect, but they can help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, here are some quick online tips. Don't type e-mail
messages in all capital letters _ in the online world, it's
considered SHOUTING! Don't forget civility when you're
communicating with others online _ it's easy to forget that your
recipients are people with feelings, and often nuances and
inflections are lost in e-mail or in message forums.
</P>
<P>
   Never give your computer password to someone who asks for it
online, even if they claim to work for your Internet provider. The
technical support staff at your provider can access your password
via their account records.
</P>
<P>
   Don't launch program files sent to you as e-mail attachments
unless you know the person who sent them. And don't send e-mail
attachments to someone without asking first. Not everyone's e-mail
software can handle them properly.

CONSIDER CHOICE OF NEW SCANNER IN LIGHT OF NEEDS, PC CONNECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've been shopping around for my first scanner. I'm confused.
What are the pros and cons for the different types of scanners? I
see the flat kind, and the kind that pull paper through them. I see
SCSI, USB and parallel-port connections. I just want to scan
photos, some personal papers, maybe something from a magazine or a
book. What should I get?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scanners used to be the province of professional artists and
hardcore computer junkies with lots of money and free time. But
prices on scanners have dropped dramatically, making them the
latest mass-market peripheral. You can thank e-mail, to a certain
extent _ people understand the value of scanning in a photo or some
other item to send to a family member or friend.
</P>
<P>
   But scanners can still be finicky and confusing _ their
friendliness has not caught up with their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in scanning flat objects, such as photos
and paper, a sheet-fed scanner that pulls documents through them
can save space. They're certainly smaller than flatbed scanners.
But flatbeds have an advantage _ they can scan bound items, such as
books and magazines, without the pages being removed.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main ways of connecting a scanner. The most
common is via the parallel port, the same connection used for a
printer. Next is SCSI, which requires that you have a special
interface card installed in your computer. Finally, there's the
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, which is a new type of connection
generally found on PCs sold within the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel port scanner is the simplest to set up _ just
connect to the port, install the software and you're ready to scan.
Usually there's a second parallel connection on the back of the
scanner to which you can connect your printer. However, scanning
through the parallel port can be slow, and some printers don't like
to share the port.
</P>
<P>
   Although SCSI is considered the fastest connection, most
Windows-based PCs don't come with a SCSI connection (though most
Macintoshes do). You need to add a SCSI card, and they are
notoriously problematic. SCSI scanners also tend to be more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   USB-based scanners are perhaps the best solution. They're fast,
inexpensive and they are easy to install. Just plug them into the
USB port, supply the necessary drivers and scanning software and
that's it. However, USB scanners are still somewhat scarce, and you
really need Windows 98 for solid USB support.
</P>
<P>
   I'd recommend a flatbed, parallel or USB scanner in your case.
Only go with the USB if you have a PC with Windows 98 and a USB
port, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an archive of ``sent'' e-mails in Outlook Express that
I need to refer to frequently. Finding the right one is a pain
because I did not plan ahead with more descriptive subject lines.
(Now I do.) Is it possible to edit the Subjects of past sent
e-mails so that individual ones will be more easy to locate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in Outlook Express. You can do this with other e-mail
programs, such as Eudora Pro, which includes a button that lets you
edit received and sent messages; and in Netscape Communicator,
which lets you drag messages to the Drafts folder, change them,
then put them back in the Sent folder.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can create your own set of folders for sorting
purposes in Outlook Express. Give them the names your e-mail
messages should have had.
</P>
<P>
   Right-click on the Inbox, choose New Folder, then give it a name
that indicates what kind of messages are in it. Then, drag the
appropriate messages in your Inbox to that folder. Repeat until
you've sorted all your mail.

COLD BLAST DEVASTATES CALIFORNIA CITRUS CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A deep freeze that enveloped California's citrus
crop this week is expected to drive up prices for consumers, with
losses to growers already exceeding $590 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer will definitely feel the impact,'' said Shawn
Bagley, a produce broker in Salinas. ``It is dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Citrus growers were tallying the damage after the mid-week cold
snap. David Moore, a citrus grower who is president of the Western
Growers Association, said Wednesday that of the 70 percent of his
crop not yet harvested, ``I would say 100 percent of it was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't cut through the oranges, they are frozen. I'd like
to think some stuff in the center part of the tree will be
salvageable, but to be honest, I think that will not take place,''
Moore said of his grove, located in the southeasternmost part of
the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Food and Agriculture projected an
equally grim picture based on early reports from inspectors in
Central Valley orchards, where the impact of the cold snap was
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimated damage statewide at $591 million.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 90 percent of the remaining navel orange crop in
Tulare County _ the state's top orange-producing county _ was
destroyed. The damage is likely to cost up to $370 million since
only 15 percent of the crop had been harvested by the time the
chill set in, agriculture department spokeswoman Myrlys Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Fresno County, the entire lemon crop was
destroyed, an estimated $6.6 million loss based on last year's crop
value. Fifty percent of the navel orange crop was expected to be
lost, costing growers some $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.3 million grapefruit crop in Kern County was wiped out
along with 70 percent of the navel oranges, valued at $122.5
million. Lemons suffered a $47.5 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Florida has a larger orange crop than California, and most
of its oranges are used for juice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, avocados, strawberries and row crops such as celery
also could be in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some damage to the avocado blooms, and they are
waiting for the frozen broccoli to thaw so they can harvest,'' said
Guy Tingos, deputy agricultural commissioner for Santa Barbara
County. ``They aren't expecting damage to the broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Biggs, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau, said the
crop was already much smaller than normal because of heavy rains
from the El Nino weather phenomenon earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the smaller crop from El Nino and damage we've had,
we'll have probably _ at best _ half the crop we had last year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the damage to citrus isn't as severe as the 1990 freeze,
which wiped out the crops and ruined many trees, damaging the
following year's crop as well.

CLEVER `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' PULSES WITH ENERGY, HUMOR AND STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director John Madden had such good fortune with his previous
English period piece, ``Mrs. Brown,'' that he decided to give
historical costume dramas another go.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for him _ and us.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's ``Shakespeare In Love'' is a bawdy, raucous, clever
``skirmish of words'' that has been co-written by the brilliant
playwright Tom Stoppard. Not only is it lovingly, even lavishly,
scribed and staged, it's a great romp of a romance with real heart
in its soul.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1593 and who could have predicted that young William
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) would have writer's block? While his
arch rival, Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett), ascends to new
heights in the public's eye with his theatrical hit, ``Dr.
Faustus,'' poor Will suffers from lack of imagination, motivation
and most of all _ an appropriate muse.
</P>
<P>
   Will's newest play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,''
is yet a pipe dream, but his producer, the penniless Philip
Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), insists on beginning auditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Elizabethan Age and women aren't allowed to perform
onstage, so Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beauty with a
huge bank account, must dress as a man to fulfill her heart's
desire.
</P>
<P>
   She calls herself Thomas Kent in a rash move determined to
postpone destiny. Soon she won't have time to pursue her first love
_ the theater _ for her father has just agreed to marry her off to
the priggish and pompous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth). Wessex needs
her fortune to fuel his business interests in Virginia, and he
cares little for Viola as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks fly in this roundelay of gender-bending and mistaken
identity and Will finds himself smitten with the courageous Viola,
who will defy law in order to utter his words. Will's heart and pen
ignite with passion and the Bard writes what will be his best-known
tragedy, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' but just as art imitates life, the
meeting of Will and Viola is not without its own tragic _ and
triumphant _ consequences.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think ``Romeo and Juliet'' would have worn out its
big-screen welcome with its recent revivals _ Baz Luhrmann's
post-modern version set in Miami with Leonardo diCaprio and Claire
Danes and schlock distributor Troma's twisted, trashy ``Tromeo and
Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Madden, who enfolds the play (and Shakespeare's ``Twelfth
Night'') into his love story in a high-spirited, wholly unique way,
has made a film that pulses with energy, humor and style.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's helped immensely by the screenplay by Marc
Norman and Stoppard, whose first major success was his equally
quick-witted drama, ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,''
based on two supporting characters in ``Hamlet.'' They give the
story a contemporary twist by tossing in 20th-century show-biz
slang. While it seems like an iffy idea, it works well.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Fiennes, little brother to Ralph, finally gets a role in
which he can prove his brooding good looks and theatrical roots
aren't a liability. He's so likable and self-effacing as Will that
he's hard to resist. His temperament is matched by Gwyneth
Paltrow's patrician beauty. Though the actress essentially reworks
her performance in ``Emma,'' she tackles the English accent as well
as the cadence and pentameter of Shakespeare's lines with ease and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Dench, who received an Oscar nomination last year for
playing Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,'' has fun tweaking another
staid icon, Elizabeth I, giving the film an even stronger
post-modern slant.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the film belongs to the Bard himself. No matter
how you edit, revise or incorporate Shakespeare into a fiction, the
beauty of the words remains universal and adaptable. Madden has
seamlessly melded two worlds that run along parallel tracks,
proving that everything old is new again. The play is indeed the
thing in ``Shakespeare In Love,'' and his bold invention is a most
glorious, effervescent and transcendant love story.

`STEPMOM'S' STRONG CAST LIFTS WEAK SCRIPT TO LEVELS OF ENDEARMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' is this season's contender for the ``weeper of the
week'' award.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Terms of Endearment'' and even ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
from which ``Stepmom'' slyly swipes a scene or two, there is a
pervasive tug at the heartstrings that should appeal to viewers and
Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really much of a surprise considering the actors
involved: Susan Sarandon, Julie Roberts and Ed Harris. As a result,
``Stepmom'' feels akin to Carl Franklin's recent ``One True
Thing,'' which starred Meryl Streep, in that it rises above
TV-movie-of-the-week sensibility only through the star power of its
exceptional cast. It's another case of virtuoso acting elevating a
mediocre script to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Columbus directs this hit-and-miss story (credited to five
writers) and, to be fair, it has some abrasive, clever moments.
Unfortunately, they rub up against scenes of such silliness that
``Stepmom'' often sinks to the level of Columbus' ``Mrs.
Doubtfire'' and ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's at ease exploring a kid's point-of-view in an adult
world, there's a dark, unsettling undertone in the way ``Stepmom''
sets up its female protagonists as adversaries by virtue of their
association with a man. It's surprising it didn't bother its two
politically correct, high-power actresses, real-life pals Sarandon
and Roberts, who not only star but share executive producer credit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie (Sarandon) and Isabel (Roberts) have one thing in common:
Luke Harrison (Harris). Jackie is his ex-wife and Isabel his new
love, and their styles immediately clash. Jackie is a ferocious
mother bear, ever protective of her ``cubs'' and she gave up a
lucrative career in publishing to raise Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben
(Liam Aiken).
</P>
<P>
   Isabel is a modern, tough, smart fashion photographer who has an
eye for what's ``in'' _ and doesn't particularly want to relinquish
career for family.
</P>
<P>
   When Luke proposes marriage to Isabel, Jackie and the kids
rebel. But when Jackie finds she is terminally ill with cancer, she
must depend upon her adversary to ensure the future well-being of
her children.
</P>
<P>
   The vitriolic sparring match later blossoms into genuine
fondness and respect for alternate ways of life _ and child
rearing. But would these two very different women ever have gotten
together had Jackie not been diagnosed with cancer? It's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sarandon is such a dragon of rage and manipulation
that our sympathies ultimately lie with Roberts. Though Isabel
initially feels weak against Jackie's fury, she slowly emerges as a
contained, clear voice of reason. In the end, we root for her
despite her perceived selfishness; she's the only adult who doesn't
use these confused kids as high-stakes pawns.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Stepmom'' never makes any earth-shattering revelations
or has much invention, it does provide Sarandon with an opportunity
to chew up the scenery. Though Jackie is largely an unsympathetic
part, Sarandon makes the most of it. Roberts proves an able match.
But Harris wanders about with little to do, getting lost in the
shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom. Directed by Chris Columbus. Written by Gigi Levangie,
Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins, Ron Bass. Cast:
Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts, Ed Harris. Columbia Pictures. 124

REMARKABLE CAST DIVES INTO SHALLOW `DOWN IN THE DELTA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acclaimed writer and preeminent poet Dr. Maya Angelou makes her
directorial debut with ``Down in the Delta.'' Unfortunately, there
are few remarkable moments to give her first film as much emotion
and raw power as her rich, textured stories.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou directs with little flair and an undistinguished,
pedantic eye, but she hasn't been given much to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Goble's flawed, passive script, written in 1993, was his
first stab at writing a screenplay and it never rises above the TV
movie-of-the-week level.
</P>
<P>
   What it does have going for it is a remarkable bunch of actors.
Alfre Woodard plays Loretta, a high school dropout struggling to
raise her kids in the projects of Chicago. She suffers from awful
self-esteem and is full of guilt because her daughter is autistic
but is often mistaken for a crack baby. She soothes her pain with
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice), who keeps the family
together, launches a plan to end the emotional rubble Loretta is
creating among them. She decides to pawn the family heirloom _ a
candelabrum that's been passed down from generation to generation
since slave days _ and send Loretta and her kids to the Mississippi
Delta to live with her brother-in-law, Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), for
the summer. Loretta will be forced to straighten herself out, make
some money and take responsibility for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' has many watered down, feel-good moments.
It never reaches too deeply into the pain and despair that
threatens to tear apart this family, and its characters learn their
life lessons easily. Even the flashbacks to slave days are
luminously lit and sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the always marvelous Woodard lends a dark prickliness and
sly humor to Loretta and Freeman is solid as Earl, the grumbly but
kindly patriarch of the family who has problems of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Delta. Directed by Maya Angelou. Written by Myron
Goble. Cast: Alfre Woodard, Al Freeman Jr., Mary Alice, Esther
Rolle, Loretta Devine, Wesley Snipes. Miramax Films. 111 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for intense scenes of alcohol/drug use.

`DANCING' STEPS TO THE BEAT OF IRISH SISTERHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor (``Cal,'' ``Circle of Friends'') has
performed a small miracle in that he's improved Brian Friel's Tony
award-winning play, ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' by cutting its running
time. As a result, the film version is a more haunting, honed,
actors' tour-de-force.
</P>
<P>
   The play, about five sisters named Mundy who lived on the
ignitable brink of Ireland's involvement with World War II, hit
Broadway at a moment when we were vulnerable to everything Irish:
Jim Sheridan's anti-British films; Michael Whelan and
``Riverdance;'' Enya. It may have lulled us into complacency
against what really composes a good yarn. Still, this film makes no
bones about what makes it tick: It's the visual appeal of the
rugged Donegal countryside, and more, the fine cast.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep (and yes, her Irish accent is impeccable) plays
Kate Mundy, the oldest sister, who is a school teacher on the brink
of losing her job, and who bears the responsibility for her family.
The pressure has aged Kate and turned her into a sour, worried
soul.
</P>
<P>
   But the never-ending Irish economic depression and an impending
world war hasn't daunted the spirits of her four younger siblings:
Maggie (Kathy Burke), Agnes (Brid Brennan, who starred in the
original play); the simple, childlike Rose (Sophie Thompson) and
the ``baby,'' Christina (Catherine McCormack), who has borne a son
named Michael (Darrell Johnston), the film's grown-up narrator who
comments upon his childhood in a voiceover soliloquy as poignant as
a James Joyce story in ``Dubliners.''
</P>
<P>
   Into this matriarchy return two men: big brother Jack (Michael
Gambon), who has been a priest in a leper colony in Africa for 25
years, and Gerry Evans (Rhys Ifans), dad to Michael, who stops in
to say goodbye (and cadge a bit of ``love'' from obliging
girlfriend, Christina) before joining the anti-Fascist army in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusions will create upheaval, strife and separation among
the women, yet through their differences, they will bond for a
final dance, performed with great, unequivocal joy by both the
actresses and O'Connor's cinema verite camera _ to give us a
symbolic swan song to the old way of Irish family life, where
everyone looked after their own, against a new, more callous,
greedy world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' owes much to the actresses, who latch
onto the unique survival instincts of the Mundy clan. Each is so
distinct that they endear us to them in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Streep shows bitter regret as a woman forced to bear the brunt
of responsibility but who lets loose with small hints of a girl who
probably was a knockout _ and a flirt _ in her youth. And McCormack
is smashing as Christina,who is as beautiful as she is
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Burke, who won a best actress award at Cannes for ``Nil
by Mouth,'' and who played Queen Mary in the recent hit
``Elizabeth,'' who is the warm hearth and soul. Her Maggie is the
nostalgic keeper of the home fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is a film of small, intimate moments
that, upon scrutiny, don't amount to much. Still, those moments are
visually fine, neatly acted and linger in the memory, though they
fail to become anything more than the sum of their parts.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing at Lughnasa. Directed by Pat O'Connor. Written by Brian
Friel, Frank McGuiness. Cast: Meryl Streep, Catherine McCormack,
Michael Gambon, Bris Brennan, Sophie Thompson, Kathy Burke. Sony
Pictures Classics. 94 minutes. Rated PG for mild language.

`LITTLE VOICE' STRAINS REACHING FOR THE BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' is an example of a movie that's been limited by
its theatrical roots. It's based on the London stage play by Jim
Cartwright, which was written specially for actress Jane Horrocks,
who was a growly marvel in Mike Leigh's ``Life Is Sweet'' and the
air-headed Bubble on the defunct BBC comedy ``Absolutely
Fabulous.'' And the film falters every minute Horrocks isn't center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In its heart it's a small, fragile piece about a misfit of a
girl struggling with unresolved pain over the death of her dad, who
likewise lived in a fantasy world of music and soulful torch songs.
But it evolves into a chafing oddity about middle-aged angst and
envy. And in a work that demands delicate balancing, guess who
wins? Unfortunately, the loudest half, which co-star Brenda Blethyn
screechingly provides in spades.
</P>
<P>
   Little Voice, or LV (Horrocks), lives in a squalid flat with her
desperate, blowsy and boozy mum, Mari (Blethyn). Mari hates her
life and never quits complaining about the-rat trap existence she's
forced to lead because of inadequate financial planning by her late
husband. LV rarely speaks. She lives in a quiet place of music and
song. Only her beloved father's ghost can pull her out of her
terminal shyness and then she's able to impersonate Judy Garland,
Marilyn Monroe and Billie Holliday to a tee.
</P>
<P>
   One night mum scores and brings home fellow sadsack Ray Say
(Michael Caine), an equally down-on-his-luck talent agent, who just
happens to hear LV singing in her room. He believes she's his
ticket out of the low life he's been living for 40 years. Mom
thinks otherwise and she jealously carps over the attention he pays
LV _ until she shuts up long enough to hear for herself and then
forms her own greedy plan.
</P>
<P>
   Director Mark Herman (``Brassed Off'') conducts with a heavy
hand and allows Blethyn and Caine to run roughshod over the quiet
center of the film. Fortunately Horrocks, who does her own singing
and is an extraordinary impersonator of the great Garland, Monroe
and Holliday, holds her own in this shaky melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Horrocks' touching, deeply felt performance,
``Little Voice'' is still essentially a cabaret act, and shoving
such an intimate, interior work onto big screen proportions sadly
magnifies its limitations and flaws, and ultimately the film is
sunk by sincere but over-extended, intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Little Voice. Directed and written by Mark Herman. Cast: Jane
Horrocks, Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan McGregor. Miramax
Films. 100 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual content.

SUPERB CAST SPARKLES IN DARK AND MENACING `HURLYBURLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The '80s come ragefully back to life in ``Hurlyburly'' _ adapted
from his play by David Rabe _ an angry-young-man, drug-addled look
at confusion and misogynism set in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' was staged off-Broadway by Joseph Papp after
Rabe's success with his Vietnam plays, ``Streamers'' and ``The
Basic Training of Pavel Hummel,'' and starred then up-and-coming
actors William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Sigourney Weaver and
Christopher Walken. It was, above all, an actors' tour-de-force.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine topping that stellar cast, but director
Tony Drazen isn't apologizing for his lineup: Sean Penn won the
best actor prize at the Venice Film Festival for his portrayal of
the belligerent, bleeding-heart Eddie; Oscar winners Kevin Spacey
(who was an understudy in the original play) and the hardly
recognizable Anna Paquin as street-urchin innocent Donna; Garry
Shandling, Robin Wright Penn, Chazz Palminteri and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   They all contribute different kinds of threat and menace to the
frightening fantasy world called Hollywood, a place dominated by
drugs, money, testosterone and very little common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie is a casting agent who can't sustain a relationship with a
woman because he's so fearful and untrusting. His roommate is
Mickey (Spacey), an ace at seducing the opposite sex who tolerates
Eddie's rants and raves about the inequity of life in la-la land.
Eddie is struggling to maintain a relationship with Darlene (Wright
Penn) when Mickey moves in and sleeps with her, unleashing all of
Eddie's insecurity and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Men metaphorically wrestling with women, power and success are
the components that compose the frightening realm of
``Hurlyburly.'' Rabe acknowledges he was furious with the world
when he wrote the play and it is a worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's some of the best work the actors have done. Penn
is a marvel as Eddie and Spacey is equally deft as Mickey, his
chilly, methodical counterpoint. The pair face off in a bilious
testament to impotence and white male fury at what they perceive to
be female emasculation. But what these characters fail to
understand is they are each other's worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The characters teem with misery, futility and the inability to
emotionally connect in a business that can easily replace them,
where they face a slow, methodical death in a place where feeling
anything at all is a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe's play was a microcosm for an era of greed and selfishness
and though the film feels dated, it manages to make references to
the '90s. It is less confined and claustrophobic and makes a point
about self-delusion and illusion in a town that's notorious for
both.
</P>
<P>
   Though its characters create their own hell on earth, we're
riveted to the screen. It's like watching a car crash; we can't
escape our guilty curiosity at watching human agony and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Hurlyburly. Directed by Anthony Drazen. Written by David Rabe.

DISNEY'S `JOE YOUNG' IS MIGHTY DISAPPOINTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Did you see the intelligence?'' sighs awestruck zoologist
Gregg O'Hara (Bill Paxton) as he watches mythic Mighty Joe Young, a
titanic gorilla, interact with his best human friend, sexy Jill
Young (Charlize Theron).
</P>
<P>
   Gregg might be able to see some signs of intelligent life, but
in Disney's clunky ``remake'' of the 1949 black-and-white adventure
film ``Mighty Joe Young,'' we're unable to spot one iota of smarts.
Badly written, clumsily directed and only half-heartedly effective
in its visual ``gorilla'' effects, ``Mighty Joe Young'' largely
wastes its top-notch cast.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Paxton and Theron teeter on the brink of career
breakthroughs _ Paxton with ``A Simple Plan'' and Theron with Woody
Allen's ``Celebrity'' and the cover of ``Vanity Fair'' _ they
backslide with this tepid tale of Joe Young, a product of ``a gene
that pops up every four or five generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The gene has made Joe a gentle giant who, along with Jill, was
orphaned when young. Both Jill's mom, a Dian Fosseyish
primatologist studying the apes in the Pangani Mountains of Africa,
and Joe's, are murdered by evil poachers, Strasser (Rade
Sherbedgia) and Garth (Peter Firth).
</P>
<P>
   In his fear and fury, little Joe bites off Strasser's thumb and
finger, causing the man to harbor a vendetta against the great ape
that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Jill grow up happily together in the African hills and a
legend is born about the magnificient gorilla who is a sacred
guardian to the small village. Into their lives comes Gregg O'Hara,
intent on saving Joe from predators by moving him to an animal
preserve in California.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the hunters are hot on the trail. They capture Joe,
just as Jill captures Gregg's heart. Together Jill and Gregg must
race against time to rescue the innocent ape from imminent danger
and possible death.
</P>
<P>
   The 1949 ``Mighty Joe Young'' was itself a loose rehash of the
classic, ``King Kong.'' In the leads it starred Ben Johnson and
Terry Moore, a starlet who later claimed to be married to Howard
Hughes. And it had more humor, heart and edge than this wooden
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton and Theron (and the rest of the actors) are saddled with
such inane, ridiculous lines that ``Mighty Joe Young'' is more of
an embarrassment than anything. Audiences need only recall the film
``Congo'' to get an idea of the dismal fate in store if they opt to
plunk down seven bucks, because in the end, the only star to emerge
undiminished is Joe himself, and that's because the big guy doesn't
have a speaking part.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Joe Young. Directed by Ron Underwood. Written by Mark
Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner. Cast: Charlize Theron, Bill Paxton,
Rade Sherbedgia, Regina King. Walt Disney Pictures. 114 minutes.
Rated PG for scenes depicting animal cruelty.

SOUL SISTERS _ ER, BROS.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Girl Bros.'' is a strange title for a record
and an even odder name for a two-girl band.
</P>
<P>
   But the brooding disc by former Prince collaborators Wendy
Melvoin and Lisa Coleman _ the Girl Bros. _ is about to end up on
some 1998 best-of lists.
</P>
<P>
   Melvoin and Coleman have fashioned a dark, semi-acoustic effort
that responds to the death of Melvoin's brother, Smashing Pumpkins
road keyboardist Jonathan, who died of a heroin overdose in July
1996, prior to two shows at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Songs such as ``Bring You Back,'' ``I Will'' and ``Jonathan''
are often stark reminders of Wendy Melvoin's pain and confusion,
while the disc, produced by Latin Playboys member Tchad Blake,
never overlooks melody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was written after my brother's death,'' Melvoin said.
``Part of it was experimentation. People deal with loss in
different ways. I live with the fact that my brother is dead every
day of my life. Things that used to be important don't seem to have
quite as much importance anymore. The small things don't make any
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends since childhood, Melvoin and Coleman joined Prince's
backup band, the Revolution, in the early '80s. When the Purple One
gave them a pink slip in 1986, Melvoin and Coleman began work on
their self-titled debut in which they played nearly all the
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the pair collaborated on Joni Mitchell's
``Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Through five of their own albums, Melvoin and Coleman progressed
from a slick neo-psychedelic rock 'n' soul approach toward a
rockier sound. The pair also gained a reputation as song doctors
and co-wrote tunes for Seal's first two albums and helped out on
the soulful pop singer's just-released effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned with the business of making my album
popular at all,'' said Melvoin, who plays guitar on ``My Favorite
Mistake,'' Sheryl Crow's current hit. ``I'm more concerned with
being a creative person and expressing my grace through creativity.
I'm not so interested in living the pop life at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvoin and Coleman, who have scored films for Babyface's
company, are doing sporadic shows in support of ``Girl Bros.'' and
plan collaborations with Me'Shell NdegeOcello.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music started with the two of us at home just trying
things out,'' Coleman said. ``Then, we decided to find a third pair
of ears. That's how Tcke got involved. It turned into a
three-person free-for-all. It was like, `Let's try this _ play that
shaker and put it through this effects peddle and make it
spookier.' We became great friends.'' &QL;

WHO'LL USHER IN THE BOSS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's a question that's consuming Boss fans
throughout the world _ who's going to induct Bruce Springsteen into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year?
</P>
<P>
   Along with Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel are
included on the list of 10 who will be inducted at the 14th annual
ceremony March 15 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians are eligible for nomination 25 years after the release
of their first recording. Hall of Fame officials said the person
giving the induction speech traditionally is involved in the record
industry and has some musical link to the honoree.
</P>
<P>
   So, who's going to induct Bruce?
</P>
<P>
   Some insist Bob Dylan is the logical choice _ but nobody's
understood a thing the notoriously marble-mouthed Dylan has said
for the past 20 years. Of course, interpreting Dylan has always
been half the fun, but for an induction speech?
</P>
<P>
   As Bob himself might say: ``They're selling postcards of the
hanging/And painting the passports brown.''
</P>
<P>
   You figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation won't divulge who's
being considered for the job, but the choice is up to the
committee, not the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Other names being bandied about include John Fogerty. There's
also a groundswell among Springsteen fans that Jakob Dylan of the
Wallflowers might be the right person to induct the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   But with just two albums under his belt, the young Dylan lacks
the career longevity or influence apparently required.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder has also been suggested. However,
Vedder might let fly something nasty about the Hall of Fame, the
nominating committee, Springsteen or even the Waldorf itself.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Etheridge? Politically correct, indeed, but the question
remains _ why?
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen fans expect the Boss to perform with a reunited E
Street Band at the ceremony in March, even though the powerful and
highly recognizable backing band was excluded from the Hall of Fame
induction.
</P>
<P>
   The rocker was nominated without his longtime group because he
released his 1973 debut album, ``Greetings From Asbury Park,
N.J.,'' as a solo artist.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Springsteen has said he hopes the Hall can find a
way to recognize the contributions made by musical backlines like
the E Street Band, the Meters, the Philly International crew and
the Cornell Dupree/Bernard Purdie/King Curtis axis that basically
invented the Atlantic soul sound.
</P>
<P>
   He's right about that. The credibility of the Hall of Fame is
suspect as long as such important studio pioneers as New Orleans
r&AMP;b drummer Earl Palmer, saxophonist Curtis, Motown bassist James
Jamerson and Los Angeles session drummer Hal Blaine remain
unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredible that a Hall of Fame devoted to placing the
spotlight on the musicians who built one of the 20th century's
greatest popular art forms has ignored such giants.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, they'll probably get around to honoring the
still-living Palmer and Blaine one day.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jamerson and Curtis, it's too late. &QL;

BROOKE SELLING ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONATHA BROOKE/``Live'' (Bad Dog Records)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Story singer-songwriter Brooke's last album, ``10 Wings,''
garnered a lot of attention but didn't sell much, so she was
dropped by her label. This intriguing, 10-track live effort,
currently available only through Brooke's Web site
(www.jonathabrooke.com), contains literate, finely wrought songs
from her early days in the Story and her own two albums in solo,
trio and full band settings. 3 Stars. &QL; 
KOKOMO/``Live in Concert 1975'' (MLP)
</P>
<P>
   London r&AMP;b band Kokomo made funky soul music in the '70s that
some said outdid the Average White Band and counterparts in the
States. This disc finds the group and its superb three-piece vocal
section performing some of the stronger tunes from their first two
records, including ``I'm Sorry Babe,'' ``Anytime,'' Carolyn
Franklin's ``Angel'' and the ultra-funky workout ``Rise and
Shine.'' Best of all, though, are extended versions of Aretha's
``With Everything I Feel in Me'' and Bobby Womack's ``I Can
Understand It,'' two numbers Kokomo made their own. Available
through mail-order Web sites. 3 { Stars. &QL; 
VARIOUS/``The West Coast Jazz Box: An Anthology of California
Jazz'' (Contemporary)
</P>
<P>
   There are assorted definitions of the term ``West Coast jazz,''
but the one used to compile this four-CD box seems to be jazz
musicians residing on the left coast. In general, the L.A. school
took inspiration from such ``cool'' influences as Lennie Tristano
and Miles Davis' ``Birth of the Cool'' band, while New York was
still under the spell of be-bop in the '50s and early '60s. This
terrific collection, assembled chronologically, moves from Wardell
Grey and Dexter Gordon to Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Ben Webster, Davis
and the Lighthouse All-Stars, Joe Pass, Ornette Coleman and plenty
more. A great way to spend a weekend. 4 Stars. &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Town Hall Concert'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   This music, available on disc for the first time, was part of a
1985 concert to celebrate the rebirth of the Blue Note label in
which jazz giants Freddie Hubbard, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson,
Bobby Hutcherson, Tony Williams and Ron Carter gathered to play
such standards as Hancock's ``Cantaloupe Island'' and the Eric
Dolphy classic ``Hat and Beard'' in loose, driving configurations.
The album is a revelation, providing some of the most exciting
'50s- and '60s-style hard bop we've heard all year. 4 Stars. &QL; 
MORCHEEBA/``Beats &AMP; B-Sides'' (Sire)
</P>
<P>
   On ``Beats &AMP; B-Sides,'' the Brit trip-hop trio offers remixes
and remakes of tracks from previous albums. Often unfairly compared
to the far moodier Portishead, Morcheeba actually has more of an
uplifting dance element in its music, and these retooled tracks
satisfy on several levels. 3 Stars. &QL; 
GREGORY ISAACS/``Maritime Hall'' (2B1)
</P>
<P>
   Rude boy reggae crooner Isaacs _ known as the Cool Ruler _ likes
romantic ballads with a sturdy beat straight out of the '70s'
golden age of reggae. Caught live in San Francisco, ``Maritime
Hall'' is a tough, solid set of some of Isaacs' best-known numbers,
including the shivers-inducing ``Night Nurse'' and the equally
groovy ``Front Door.'' Unlike so many modern modern reggae albums,
the backup band here is excellent. 3 Stars. &QL; 
DICK GAUGHAN/``Sail On'' and ``Redwood Cathedral'' (Appleseed)
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Scottish folk singer Gaughan can reduce a club full
of boozed-up folk fans to sniffling crybabies. He's got an almost
operatic voice that resonates directly with the soul, and he's also
one of the best, most idiosyncratic guitarists in the world. On top
of that, he writes moving, poetic songs that deal with social
justice and the plight of the worker. Gaughan's two recent albums,
``Sail On'' and ``Redwood Cathedral,'' contain contemporary and
classic gems, including reworkings of Townes Van Zandt's ``Pancho
and Lefty,'' the Stones' ``Ruby Tuesday'' and Pete Seeger's
timeless ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' along with memorable originals and
traditionals. Both albums are well worth investigating. 3 { Stars. &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``Shakespeare in Love'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Warbeck's gorgeous score for the acclaimed fictional
account of the Bard's love life sounds like classic movie music.
The album reflects the film's many moods, from the meeting of the
lovers to the dance sequence in Viola's house and the final
turbulent shipwreck scenes. The score has the power to bring the
film back in the listener's mind. 3 Stars. &QL;

CONSERVATIVE SENATORS WANT NO PART OF CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The idea of censuring President Clinton may be
gathering momentum in the Senate, but a dozen or more conservative
senators want nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes Republican stalwarts such as Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri, Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire, and Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not afraid to appear to be at odds with the elite
media viewpoint (favoring censure),'' said Peter Dickinson,
executive director of the Campaign for Working Families, which
raised over $2 million for over 200 mostly Republican
``pro-family'' candidates last November. ``They're the ones who
would question the validity of short- term polls as a guide for
long-term results.''
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of the group and how much clout it has are open
to debate. There are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   These conservative ``true believers'' oppose abortion and are
outspoken on other conservative issues such as tax cuts and
privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Clinton's impeachment, this group dismisses the
possibility of a Senate censure as ``virtually nothing,'' as Inhofe
put it in an interview. When the Senate reconvenes in January,
these senators are likely to push for a full trial of Clinton on
the two impeachment articles approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction in a Senate trial requires a two-thirds vote _ 67
senators and Inhofe acknowledged that the odds of getting 67 votes
are remote.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Inhofe said by telephone from his office in Tulsa,
``I think we should go on with a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look 10, 20 years into the future and the possibility
of a corrupt president in office, we have to make sure we protect
this constitutional process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe expressed puzzlement about those senators who favor
censure on the basis that there aren't 67 votes now in favor of
convicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can (senators) come to the conclusion that the votes are
not there if we haven't weighed the evidence,'' Inhofe said. ``The
White House fears something we don't know may be brought out at
trial. Prejudging the disposition of this is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative senators do little to hide their personal
contempt for Clinton. Ashcroft has called for Clinton to resign
because he has ``disgraced himself (and) broken faith with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also are doubtful that censure of a president is
constitutionally permissible. The Constitution directs the Senate
to hold a trial after the House votes to impeach a president, but
says nothing about censure.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hickey, spokeswoman for Smith of New Hampshire, said
Smith's ``interpretation of the Constitution is that there should
be a Senate trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Other senators are miffed at being overlooked in what they see
as a head-long, media-driven rush to embrace censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my colleagues think this band wagon is gaining
speed,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., told the New York Times.
``Well, nobody called me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is a far more collegial body than the combative
House, so it is very possible a consensus for censure could arise
over the protests of these senators.
</P>
<P>
   But there are multiple layers of complicating factors. A major
one: A censure deal might require an admission from Clinton that he
lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
something he has denied. In a television interview with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson to be aired Sunday on CNN, Vice President Al Gore
reiterated Clinton's unwillingness to admit lying.
</P>
<P>
   If the censure movement does not gain more altitude by the time
senators return to Washington next month, the hardline
conservatives may find themselves in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they want to see Clinton strung up,'' said Keith
Appell, an Alexandria, Va.-based political consultant whose clients
include conservatives. ``It's that they believe the process should
adhere to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   By their very nature, conservatives are bound to the words of
the Constitution and not well disposed to any solution outside its
four corners, Appell said, adding: ``They look at censure as more
of a political quick fix or a Bandaid.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The idea of censuring President Clinton may be
gathering momentum in the Senate, but a dozen or more conservative
senators want nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes Republican stalwarts such as Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri, Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire, and Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not afraid to appear to be at odds with the elite
media viewpoint (favoring censure),'' said Peter Dickinson,
executive director of the Campaign for Working Families, which
raised over $2 million for over 200 mostly Republican
``pro-family'' candidates last November. ``They're the ones who
would question the validity of short- term polls as a guide for
long-term results.''
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of the group and how much clout it has are open
to debate. There are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   These conservative ``true believers'' oppose abortion and are
outspoken on other conservative issues such as tax cuts and
privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Clinton's impeachment, this group dismisses the
possibility of a Senate censure as ``virtually nothing,'' as Inhofe
put it in an interview. When the Senate reconvenes in January,
these senators are likely to push for a full trial of Clinton on
the two impeachment articles approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction in a Senate trial requires a two-thirds vote _ 67
senators and Inhofe acknowledged that the odds of getting 67 votes
are remote.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Inhofe said by telephone from his office in Tulsa,
``I think we should go on with a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look 10, 20 years into the future and the possibility
of a corrupt president in office, we have to make sure we protect
this constitutional process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe expressed puzzlement about those senators who favor
censure on the basis that there aren't 67 votes now in favor of
convicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can (senators) come to the conclusion that the votes are
not there if we haven't weighed the evidence,'' Inhofe said. ``The
White House fears something we don't know may be brought out at
trial. Prejudging the disposition of this is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative senators do little to hide their personal
contempt for Clinton. Ashcroft has called for Clinton to resign
because he has ``disgraced himself (and) broken faith with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also are doubtful that censure of a president is
constitutionally permissible. The Constitution directs the Senate
to hold a trial after the House votes to impeach a president, but
says nothing about censure.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hickey, spokeswoman for Smith of New Hampshire, said
Smith's ``interpretation of the Constitution is that there should
be a Senate trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Other senators are miffed at being overlooked in what they see
as a head-long, media-driven rush to embrace censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my colleagues think this band wagon is gaining
speed,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., told the New York Times.
``Well, nobody called me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is a far more collegial body than the combative
House, so it is very possible a consensus for censure could arise
over the protests of these senators.
</P>
<P>
   But there are multiple layers of complicating factors. A major
one: A censure deal might require an admission from Clinton that he
lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
something he has denied. In a television interview with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson to be aired Sunday on CNN, Vice President Al Gore
reiterated Clinton's unwillingness to admit lying.
</P>
<P>
   If the censure movement does not gain more altitude by the time
senators return to Washington next month, the hardline
conservatives may find themselves in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they want to see Clinton strung up,'' said Keith
Appell, an Alexandria, Va.-based political consultant whose clients
include conservatives. ``It's that they believe the process should
adhere to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   By their very nature, conservatives are bound to the words of
the Constitution and not well disposed to any solution outside its
four corners, Appell said, adding: ``They look at censure as more
of a political quick fix or a Bandaid.''

cost of its burgeoning Corrections Department, it is trying a new
approach with people on probation: trust. In metro Atlanta and in
Clarke County, the state is allowing its best probationers to work
on the honor system by reporting to a machine, instead of a person.
The probationer goes to a kiosk, usually in a state building,
inserts a fingerprint card and then responds electronically to a
series of question, such as whether he/she has recently used drugs.
Although the program is in its second year, the state has no
accurate measure of its success because the states tracks probation
recidivism on a three-year cycle. However, the chief probation
officer expects little problems with the 3,000 or so people who
choose this route. Because there is an extra $10 monthly fee for
this type of probation reporting system, the people who do it have
to volunteer. There is reality here, tho. Corrections officials
readily admit that the machines, also being tested in a few other
cities nationwide, can not replace occasional personal contact.

TEST SCORES ARE MEDIOCRE FOR `THE FACULTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though ``The Faculty'' falls apart after its first hour,
for the most part it's moderately entertaining, if reminiscent of
other recent teen sci-fi/horror films such as ``Disturbing
Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rodriguez, director of ``Desperado,'' ``From Dusk Till
Dawn'' and ``El Mariachi,'' works from a script by Kevin
Williamson, the whiz kid responsible for ``Scream'' and ``Scream
2.'' Not surprisingly, ``The Faculty'' is full of the same high
school stereotypes and allusions to movie and TV references.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Faculty'' isn't as innovative by half as Williamson's
previous blockbusters. Proving that the third time isn't exactly
the charm, the story yanks from ``Alien'' and Jack Finney's
literary science-fiction classic, ``Invasion of the Body
Snatchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a strange pod that eerily clones its human host into
a zombie, however, ``The Faculty'' introduces an alien sluglike
parasite that gruesomely attaches itself in its victim's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Rundown Herrington High's burned out, second-rate faculty _
including Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth), shy Miss Burke (Famke
Janssen) and Coach Willis (Robert Patrick) suddenly take a new
interest in ``teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   That forces a cross-section of kids _ school nerd Casey (Elijah
Wood), football hero Stan (Shawn Hatosy), popular Delilah (Jordana
Brewster), new girl (Laura Harris), drug supplier Zeke (Josh
Hartnett) and punk misfit Stokely (Clea DuVall) _ to endeavor to
find the alien queen.
</P>
<P>
   When they discover their teachers are truly from another planet,
it's up to them to keep the school _ and town _ from turning into a
different kind of student body.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Rodriguez's direction feels lackluster and
uninspired and doesn't bring anything truly exciting to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Graded on the horror curve, ``The Faculty'' is short on scares
and rates only average marks for such a blatant, if occasionally
amusing, Cliff's Notes version of better, more inspired B-movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Faculty. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Written by Kevin
Williamson. Cast: Elijah Wood, Famke Janssen, Robert Patrick, Salma
Hayek, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth. Dimension Films. 102 minutes.
Rated R for violence, language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

   NY-STAINED-GLASS (New York) _ A new stained glass window is
unveiled at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan. ``Like
painting in the air with colored light,'' said the donor of the
window, Robert Ryneveld. But there is much newly brilliant glass to
admire around the city. Restoration projects have reclaimed dozens
of darkened and damaged windows by masters like Tiffany, at
Congregation Shearith Israel on the Upper West Side; John La Farge,
at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and William Jay
Bolton, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn

Martin. A 17-year-old named Justin Rose became the darling of the

through the Masters and the United States Open, fans smiled back.

   FILM-SHAKESPEARE (Undated) _ ``Shakespeare In Love'' is a bawdy,

   FILM-VOICE (Undated) _ Despite Jane Horrocks' touching, deeply

``Hurlyburly'' _ adapted from his play by David Rabe _ an

in Los Angeles. Rabe's play was a microcosm for an era of greed and

FAITH BLOSSOMS AMID THE RUINS IN STORM-RAVAGED NICARAGUA 
</HEADLINE>

   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ A few days after Dominga Roja was flooded
out of her home by the hurricane called Mitch, she went back to
inspect the damage. Her house, like almost every other home in
Villa Sandino, was destroyed by the raging water and mud, but she
rescued two precious possessions: her rooster and her Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the rooster strutted around her small room in a
makeshift refugee center on an abandoned cotton farm here, Roja
clutched the Bible to her chest for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all wet when I found it,'' said the 60-year-old widow,
looking through the stiff, wrinkled pages, ``but I rescued it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it in my bed beside me,'' she added. ``I can't read,
but when I have it here, it protects me.''
</P>
<P>
   The rooster, however, may be turned into soup for a holiday
supper to share with fellow refugees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Josepha Aleman, 39, who was also flooded out of her home and
who, like Roja, is a Pentecostal, said the devastation had not
shaken her faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more faith now,'' she said. ``The water was up to our
chests all night but thanks to God, we got out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Roja and Aleman are among the Nicaraguan peasants who lost their
homes and belongings in the hurricane that began Oct. 26 and
hovered over Central America for days, killing 9,000 people and
leaving as many as 2 million others homeless in Honduras,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the woman have managed to keep their hopes up thanks in part
to their devout religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   As in many Latin American countries, religion has long played an
important role in Nicaraguan culture. In the weeks following the
storm, many Nicaraguans have grasped even more firmly to their
faith in an attempt to come to terms with the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Nicaraguans are Catholics, although
evangelical Protestant denominations have attracted roughly 25
percent of the population in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   To protect itself from any potential charges of mismanagement,
the Nicaraguan government designated the Catholic Church to deliver
much of the humanitarian aid that the country received after the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church is not neutral, and it's not universal,''
said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a magazine editor and son of former
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. ``But there's no doubt that
the church is the most credible institution in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Catholic nuns from orders such as the Daughters of
Charity of St. Vincent de Paul have come from other Latin American
countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Bolivia, to work with
traumatized Nicaraguan children and find homes for orphans.
</P>
<P>
   On the Saturday before Christmas, a Catholic priest from the
regional capital of Chinandega visited the village of Tololar to
say a Mass for the more than 2,000 people who died on or near the
Casita Volcano. On Oct. 29, after three days of torrential rain,
the wall of a crater lake at the top of the volcano collapsed,
unleashing a flood of water, followed by a massive mudslide, onto
the villages scattered down the volcano's western slope.
</P>
<P>
   Tololar, which sits at the foot of the volcano in the township
of Posoltega, has become a center for refugees who survived when
their villages were wiped out. More than 300 people gathered in the
town plaza for the Mass, leading their well-scrubbed children and
dressed in their Sunday best, which for many now consists of
donated clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The event not only brought the shaken community together, but
through the familiar ecclesiastical rituals, gave people a sense of
security and a chance to reaffirm their compact with God.
</P>
<P>
   Because the village has no church, residents had built a frame
of wooden poles, covered it with a green tarpaulin, made walls of
palm fronds and decorated the improvised chapel with white and
yellow balloons.
</P>
<P>
   As a church leader strummed a guitar, a group of children sang a
hymn to welcome the priest, the Rev. Marcos Dessy, a Sardinian who
has lived and preached in Nicaragua for 25 years and runs a
charitable foundation in Chinandega.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind blowing dust across the plaza and stray dogs
wandering through the crowd, people filed into the chapel. Those
who could not fit peered in through the palm leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, remember those who have died tragically in the landslide
of the Casita Volcano,'' Dessy said through a bullhorn so all could
hear. ``Accept them into your kingdom and give them peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As women dabbed their eyes with handkerchiefs, and old men
shifted their bare feet in the dust, he continued: ``It's true some
of us leave this earth before others, and we thank you for those
who were with us and have gone. But let us sing with joy that we
are alive here today.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Then, gesturing to the children in the front row, several of
whom had been orphaned by the storm, the priest said: ``When these
children here grow old, I want them to be able to say, `By God's
will, we have survived.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tent, Jasmina Herrera, 34, hugged her two young
daughters as she listened to the priest's words. She had come to
the Mass, she said, to bid goodbye to her brother, her pregnant
sister, her sister's husband and seven nieces and nephews, ranging
in age from 3 to 12, who were swept away by a wall of water and
mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to accept,'' she said. ``The children's bodies
were never found.''
</P>
<P>
   And she had come to say a prayer of thanks that her daughters,
Marta Lorena, 9, and Jessica, 6, were spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the water swept us out of our house, the current ripped
her away from me,'' she said, stroking Jessica's curls. ``I thought
she was lost, but a neighbor rescued her. My daughter says it was
the Virgin who saved her, and I think it's true. My girls are more
dear to me now, and the Virgin is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nubia Fletes, another villager attending the Mass, admitted the
disaster had challenged her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first few days we asked, `Lord, we're your creatures.
Why did you do this to us?''' she said. ``But eventually we
resigned ourselves, because what happened was his will. Now we
realize he can give us strength to endure these hard times. If we
reach out to each other, as the priest said, we will survive
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the challenge of the moment is to get through the
holiday season without their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the villagers set up a pinata for the children
and the priest handed out toys from the back of a pick-up truck.
Dozens of eager boys and girls crowded around, waiting for their
names to be called to receive a baby doll, a rubber ball or a bag
of plastic animals.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his 2-year-old daughter and with his 5-year-old son
dancing around his legs, Jose Anastasio Chavarria said that with
his home and its contents washed away, the small gifts were
especially welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, Christmas is a happy time,'' added the 37-year-old
farmer. ``My family always has a big party, but we're too sad this
year. How can we have a party when so many people have died?''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby refugee camp set up in a community named for Pope
John XXIII, Mariana Mendez Canale, 60, talked with her neighbors
about losing her husband when their village of El Porvenir was
buried by mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do,'' she said. ``When the Lord calls
us, it's our time to go. But it's a sadness that has no name.''
</P>
<P>
   Then her face brightened as she remembered a remarkable moment
in the midst of the terrifying storm. Like Aleman, Herrera and
scores of others overwhelmed by the apocalyptic proportions of the
disaster, Mendez found a miracle in the simple survival of
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man was struggling in the current when a cow came swimming
by,'' she recounted. ``He climbed on that cow, and he was riding
along when he saw a little girl in the water. He scooped her up and
put her on the cow. Then he saw a little boy, and he scooped him up
too, and he got those kids to safety. The cow saved their lives.
That was the Lord's work.''

`STEPMOM' GOES SLOW BEFORE THE TEARS FLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Heavy hankie films such as ``Terms of Endearment,''
``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' and ``Unstrung
Heroes'' always kill off the loving mom, orphaning the needy kids.
</P>
<P>
   If they killed off the father, it wouldn't be a tragedy because
Dad's not around much anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' carries that idea one step further: Not only is Mom
loath to leave her beloved children behind, she also is curdling
inside about leaving them to be raised by her ex-husband's new
trophy wife.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict and the ensuing tears make ``Stepmom'' a
damp-hankie experience for mothers and others from fractured or
blended families.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the state of hate with Jackie (Susan
Sarandon) and her two children directing their venom toward Isabel
(Julia Roberts), a busy career woman trying to treat the kids right
when they're in her charge half time.
</P>
<P>
   The harder Isabel works to make 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone)
like her, the meaner Anna acts.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship shifts when Anna realizes that having a
younger stepmom who knows something about makeup and how to destroy
boys has its advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie shifts when she learns she has cancer and needs to come
to terms with the woman who may play a bigger role than she will in
her children's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' spends the first half wallowing in lumbering vitriol
at a pace that realistically reflects much of child-rearing: It's
repetitive, often boring, brightened by brief moments when someone
says something worth listening to.
</P>
<P>
   The film then veers for the tears when the goodbye looks start
to dominate. The second half has more energy and a stronger gift
for the audience: the sense that caring for children is the most
important reward you can give yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Columbus usually makes family comedies: ``Home
Alone,'' ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Jingle all the Way.'' With Stepmom,
he wants to show that he can handle serious family stories, but he
too often mistakes lethargy for profundity.
</P>
<P>
   The script hits most of the parenting issues but has little to
say about them that we haven't seen in countless advice columns.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon and Roberts have powerful moments _ usually when
they're not talking but allowing the camera to linger over the
emotional turbulence in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Sarandon doubled as producers. Considering the film
was made for women, by women and about women, it's odd they turned
to a man to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13, ``Stepmom'' should have received an R for
profanity. 3 stars. &QL;

IN A YEAR OF SPORTS, RUNNERS-UP CAPTIVATED US WITH CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark McGwire and Tara Lipinski, the large and
short of it in big-time sports this year, were captivating in
victory, he with the bear hugs for his son, she with the wide-eyed
yelps as her jumps finished perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be more different, in girth or in deed. But they
had a bond, and what they shared made 1998 a special time in the
sports world.
</P>
<P>
   What they each had was spectacular runner-up, a second fiddle
who played the right tune.
</P>
<P>
   There was Sammy Sosa blowing kisses to his family, to his rival,
to a home country smitten with the possibilities that he
represented.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Michelle Kwan, who let Olympic gold get away but
held onto her extraordinary grace, who at age 17 had the poise to
say that life guaranteed her no prizes, no matter how hard she
worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est la vie, right?'' she said, defining herself in a single
phrase, a perfect mixture of the sophisticated and the
down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the best one-liner of the year, although Sosa came
close. ``Mark is The Man,'' he kept saying, as if he and Kwan were
collaborating on a new guidebook to sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, how we need a book like that.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. male hockey players certainly could have used copies in
Nagano. But they may have used them as projectiles, tossing them
out a dorm window.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late, though, for the hockey players to absorb the
lessons of Sosa and Kwan. Someone could still come forward and take
responsibility for throwing furniture through the Olympic Village
windows. The culprits remain in hiding, compounding their
disrespect for the finest hosts an Olympic Games could hope to have
with profound cowardice and a disdain for their teammates, who are
all implicated as long as the real perpetrators stay silent.
</P>
<P>
   They brought sports to a low this year, in a competition almost
as tight as the home-run race and the figure-skating final.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction could have gone to the International Olympic
Committee and its ``Hey bidder, do you have a dime?'' approach to
picking host cities. The lords of the rings will have to settle for
a special award in the crass shakedown division, a tough category
these days, at the peak of the build-me-a-stadium-or-else era in
American professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association and its locked-out players
could have been contenders for the overall low-point crown, but
they seem to be striving for irrelevance, and who wants to stand in
their way?
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on the doping revelations at the Tour de
France and McGwire's well-publicized use of a fishy dietary
supplement. The riders in the Tour defended their scandalized
brethren, a triumph of cynicism. On the other hand, any open debate
on this subject is worthwhile, and McGwire, though he broke no
rules, forced baseball to confront whether it should follow other
sports and ban androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   But even open, enlightened debate has a downside. In this case,
it advertised McGwire's use of the supplement to kids, who have
made it a dangerous athletic fad. That's a dubious portion of
1998's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The year closes with another large uncertainty. Did we see the
last of Michael Jordan, basketball player? Charles Barkley says
yes, but if we believed everything Charles Barkley says, we'd be
living a never-ending hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Jordan doesn't belong to 1998. He's the athlete of
the decade, and even in the year of the glorious runner-up, we
can't find anyone close to him.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was more obliging. In early 1998, it found a Super Bowl
to suit John Elway, a runner-up who finally broke through.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it saw Buffalo, the ultimate also-ran, link up with a
castoff quarterback for a new spin on a heartwarming holiday tale:
Doug Flutie as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Dismissed for being
different, Flutie proved that conformity stinks.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL season comes to a close, the year of the runner-up
has morphed into the year of the backup on a comeback. Randall
Cunningham and Vinny Testaverde join Flutie in this scenario, all
of them hailing from the island of misfit quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But as a whole, the year belonged to the sluggers and the
skaters. The winners conducted themselves admirably. McGwire went
after the difficult, uncomfortable issue of childhood sexual abuse
as if it were a fat fastball over the middle of the plate. Lipinski
chose to stay in the Olympic Village and attend the Opening
Ceremonies, to enjoy every moment of her Nagano experience, not
just the gold-medal part.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of them would have been as compelling if it weren't
for the two people behind them. Sosa's beaming face cast a
wonderful light on McGwire. His smoking bat put more fire in
McGwire's swing.
</P>
<P>
   On his own, McGwire would have passed Roger Maris. But 70 home
runs? Sosa, charging at him with 66, pushed Big Mac to that level.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, Kwan's skating defied anyone to be better, and when
Lipinski was, the accomplishment was that much greater. When
Lipinski accepted her gold medal, Kwan watched her carefully,
waiting for just the right moment to step over and hug the new
champion. She didn't want to intrude on any of the applause, on any
of Lipinski's bowing to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan had cried privately in her mother's arms and then was done
with it. After that, whenever tears started to come, she pushed
them back and smiled bashfully, determined not to show an ounce of
self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   This year produced a lot of amazing numbers: 70 for McGwire, 66
for Sosa, $105 million for Kevin Brown, a sixth crown for Jordan
and the Bulls, 15 years for Lipinski, the youngest skating gold
medalist in history. But the best of them all, the one that usually
connotes also-rans, the one that gained unexpected prestige, was
the No. 2.

YOUNG SHAKESPEARE FINDS HIS JULIET IN BAWDY COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED ``But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It
is the east, and Ethel is the sun!'' Ethel?
</P>
<P>
   That's what might have happened to Juliet if an uninspired
Shakespeare had finished his for-hire comedy, ``Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bard struggles through his writer's block in
amazing, amusing fashion in the bright, witty romp, ``Shakespeare
in Love.'' This romantic comedy takes an askew look at
Shakespeare's times and comes up with the holiday season's smartest
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is a joy for people who love
Shakespeare's plays, but it is also fun for people who run at the
mention of his name, afraid they'll never understand what he's
talking about with all that Elizabethan English.
</P>
<P>
   Because so little is known about the great playwright's personal
life, director John Madden and his writing team take liberties with
Shakespeare _ just as the Bard took with Julius Caesar or Richard
III. They use Shakespeare for their own purposes, making nasty
sport of two centuries: the 16th and our own.
</P>
<P>
   They've imagined Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) as a rakish
writer, employed by the lesser of London's two theaters to devise
some trivial comedy that will attract enough riffraff to keep the
creditors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare is miserably unhappy, unable to write, even unable
to chase women. But he is pressed by the head of his theatrical
troupe, who is in debt to Elizabethan gangsters, to write
something, anything that will amuse the masses and shake free some
coins.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to write low comedy, Shakespeare finds an
inspiration for grand passion through Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow),
daughter of a wealthy family who yearns for adventure and the
poetry of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   English women at that time were not allowed to act upon the
disreputable stage. So Viola disguises herself as a man and
auditions for Shakespeare's new play, winning the role of the young
Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   When Will discovers that his lead actor is really the flame of
his heart, they rehearse romance during the day and practice it at
night.
</P>
<P>
   But their idyllic passion is star-crossed, threatened by the
arrogant nobleman (Colin Firth) to whom Viola is betrothed.
</P>
<P>
   From these elements, director Madden fashions a wicked comedy
that is as romantic, bawdy and funny as anything Shakespeare wrote
to please the audiences of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Madden (``Mrs. Brown'') directs with great vigor and irreverence
but also with a deep love for the power of the theater to move
men's hearts. He amplifies the tale with Hollywood in jokes and
analogies to moviemaking to brighten the fun and give the story
resonance for our time.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated script _ rich in repartee, mistaken identity
and foiled passions _ comes from Marc Norman (Waterworld'') and Tom
Stoppard (``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead''). They capture
the boisterous egos of the buffoons who people Shakespeare's world
and toss in a wealth of wit that will delight theater lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, a master of ribald comedy, would be proud to be
pictured as the hero of a tale that lives up to his standards.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow (Sliding Doors'') makes a wonderful Juliet, and quite a
good Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   As the ink-stained wretch whose importance to history is
completely missed by his contemporaries, Fiennes makes an inspired
rogue. He is far better here than in the costume drama
``Elizabeth,'' where he can also be seen murking about in the same
century.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars still argue about the details of Shakespeare's life,
indeed, about whether he or someone else wrote his plays. So, the
liberties taken by the film's writers and director seem entirely
appropriate because they're done in the name of fun.
</P>
<P>
   These embellishments illuminate the maneuverings of a playwright
using his wits to keep wine in his cup. The movie invites us to
rejoice in the excitement of the theater. It's an invitation you
should accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is rated R for nudity and sex. The love
scenes are far more bawdy than anything Shakespeare dared to hint
at in his plays. 5 stars. &QL;

IT'S ALL HAPPENING AT THE ZOOG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While everyone is puzzling over when exactly the
convergence of computer, television and Internet will happen, the
Disney Channel actually is trying to do something about it with its
Zoog Disney offerings on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle starts on Sunday nights, when a two-hour block of
programming targeted at children between 9 and 14 is overlaid with
a variety of animated show hosts called Zoogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to really create an entertainment experience that
converged the two interests in our audience,'' said Eleo Hensleigh,
the Disney Channel's senior vice president of marketing. ``They
spend a lot of time with television, a lot of time with the
Internet. We want to make sure we're where kids are spending
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zoogs prompt viewers to go online, where they act as online
guides to contests, chat rooms, discussion areas, games, polls,
``shoutouts'' and more, all of it related to themes from that
week's programs, Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   The site then takes the children's responses and incorporates
them into the reruns of the shows the next Saturday, Hensleigh
said. The Zoogs show high scores in the games, contest winners,
shoutouts and more.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to get viewers to also get on the Web site was
a tricky proposition for the channel, which doesn't want to
cannibalize its audience. It's less of an issue for a
commercial-free outlet such as Disney, but Hensleigh said company
officials thought hard about how to knit together the Web and TV
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see this new medium to be a replacement for
television, it's to broaden the experience,'' said Hensleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment has paid off big time since it began Aug. 7,
Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen is, most importantly, a 50-percent increase in
9- to 11-year-old (TV viewers) in that day part,'' Hensleigh said.
``And we've basically seen a 350 percent increase in our online
traffic. We're now the No. 1-trafficked site on Disney.com. That's
a robust site but we have been the most trafficked area.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may help Disney deal with the difficult transition it
faces in keeping its young fans' attention as they lurch toward
puberty and more sophisticated viewing desires, Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we embrace this computer and online world, we've moved
that acceptance level with older kids just a little bit,''
Hensleigh said. ``As they grow older, it's a challenge for
Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as figuring out how to marry the Internet and television
has proved a challenge to virtually everyone in either business.
Zoogs, however preliminary, offers a glimpse of what that future
might hold.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUND OF SUCCESS: For most of the past two decades, Donald
Katz wrote about technology for publications such as Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's busy creating technology that lets you listen to
publications such as the Wall Street Journal as well as such audio
treasures as John Cleese reading Dante's ``Inferno'' or Walt
Whitman reading his own ``Leaves of Grass,'' with Thomas Edison on
the sound board.
</P>
<P>
   What he's done with Audible Inc. is create a Web site
(www.audible.com) loaded with 17,000 hours of programming that you
can buy inexpensively over the Internet. And his company also makes
a listening device that copies the audio files from your computer
so you can listen to them anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's moved into the world of audio, Katz and his company
remain dependent on print resources as the basis for nearly all
their recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Print is still the mother lode of information,'' said Katz
during a recent promotional swing through Los Angeles. ``When you
think about Audible, all it does is leverage the superior impact of
print over a new medium. People who love this love reading so much
that they want to extend that to places where they can't read.''
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a wonderful idea: Use the Internet and home
computers to cheaply distribute a vast array of digital
information; listen to it on a tiny player that links to the
computer, sort of like the tiny MP-3 music players from Diamond
Multimedia and Saehan.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is so smart that it has attracted a Murderers' Row of
heavy hitter investors, and dozens of content partners.
</P>
<P>
   The product itself is cheap, only $99 if you agree to buy at
least $10 of content every month for a year. That'll get you the
Wall Street Journal and a book a month. If you don't buy the
subscription, the player costs $199.
</P>
<P>
   Among the zillions of other products are Ezra Pound and the
Harvard Business Review, Alan Greenspan speeches and National
Public Radio's ``Fresh Air,'' Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones'' and
the Starr Report, self-help tomes and audio book thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   And you soon won't need the Audible player to take your
information with you, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, free player software will be available for owners of
Windows CE-based hand-held computers and personal digital
assistants. And in March, the software will be standard issue on
the machines sold by four manufacturers, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is getting interest from companies who see it as
a way to distribute such in-house information as product
descriptions and motivational speeches to their sales forces, Katz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is coming out soon with a beefed-up version of
its player, making it capable of storing seven hours of recordings,
compared to the current two, Katz said. New software will include
cover art and author information with each download.
</P>
<P>
   So what's that you hear? It's the Audible sound of a great idea
coming.
</P>
<P>
   FACE TO INTERFACE: And from music critic Fred Shuster comes a
Web recommendation for all you underground music fans. It's called
InterFACE Pirate Radio and is the legal Internet successor to an
illegal broadcaster in London spinning great drum-and-bass, jungle,
house and other electronic dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The music streams in on the RealPlayer plug-in for your Web
browser, but even cooler is the ability to talk with the disc
jockeys and other listeners in an online chat room and to watch a
video feed of the DJs as they mix and play music. Point your
Internet radio dial to www.interface.pirate-radio.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND: If you have a PalmPilot, those
delightful little personal organizer gadgets that are proliferating
like mosquitoes in a Minnesota summer, you should check out the
PalmPilot Gear HQ, at www.pilotgear.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has hundreds of downloadable software files for the
Palm Pilot and its successor, the Palm III, along with answers to
basic technical support questions, and information about
accessories. &QL;

`THE MARRYING MAN' GETS GROOMS IN LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Brides get the guy, the gown, and all the showers
held in their honor.
</P>
<P>
   But they also do most of the work. Remember how George's fiancee
died from licking all that cheap glue on the wedding invitations in
``Seinfeld''?
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips thinks George should have been helping, but then he
didn't know the rules. He didn't have ``The Marrying Man,'' a
groom's guide published by the Men's Apparel Group.
</P>
<P>
   It says the groom and his family are supposed to help the bride
with all kinds of stuff, like paying for the bride's engagement and
wedding rings, the marriage license, the boutonnieres for the
ushers, accommodations for out-of-town attendants, the rehearsal
dinner, the minister's honorarium and the honeymoon. On the latter,
the groom should book the hotel at least two months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   And one month in advance he'll need to get the marriage license,
arrange for tuxedo fittings, and have his insurance policies and
bank accounts adjusted to accommodate his new wife.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet has a glossary of fashion terms, so you'll know that
cutaway coats are for weddings between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., that
white dinner jackets are for spring and summer, and that white tie
is the ultimate choice for formal weddings any time of day or
night.
</P>
<P>
   For a free copy, write to Marrying Man, care of Ogan/Dallal,
1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036.
</P>
<P>
   BABY TALK: Just when you thought the yuppie puppy trend was
gone, the Gap brings it back. Miz Hot Tips is talking about the
store's new line of luxe looks for the diaper set, featuring
elegant outfits made of velvet, silk and cashmere. There's even a
tuxedo vest-and-pant set for $84, designed for the child who never
spits up or leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Origins cosmetics is busy on a new line of toiletries
for toddlers that will hit cosmetic counters in March. Origins will
include Short Cake baby cleansing bars, First Sun chemical-free
lotions and Powder Puff baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not the only ones wiping baby's bottom with pricey
products. Start looking for Bubbe's Special Cream for Special
Tushies, Kiehl's Diaper Rash Treatment Cream and Baby Bee products
at department stores in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S IN THE BAG: Pet carriers are the latest fad, and as any
trendie knows, labels do count. For the fashion-conscious, Chanel
has created a black nylon carrier with red lining for $385. It's
even quilted like Chanel's signature purse design.
</P>
<P>
   OH, DONNA: Donna Karan may not be dressing Demi Moore anymore,
but Miz Hot Tips heard that the New York designer has the entire
cast of Fox's ``That '70s Show'' wearing her DKNY jeans and
activewear. According to DKNY president Mary Wilberding, ``It's a
match dressed in heaven ... since both are young, thriving in their
fields and very excited about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   So start looking for them on the tube _ and also making personal
appearances at a mall near you in youthful drawstring pants, baggy
sweaters and funnel-neck dresses.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER CHRISTMAS: Waiting until New Year's to undress the tree?
Instead of just dumping the strings of lights in a box as usual,
Miz Hot Tips suggests wrapping them around a piece of cardboard to
keep them from getting tangled. Or you could try wrapping them on
the Evergreen-Light Caddy, which has a spool-like mechanism that
eliminates tangles and quickly dispenses lights as you need them
next year. It's $19.95 at Target stores. &QL;

THE WONDER OF A DAY WITHOUT CHEMOTHERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFIELD, Mass. _ So this is what hell looks like: A little girl
of 11, doubled over on the soccer field by a mysterious explosion
of pain, helplessly clutching her side in search of relief she
wouldn't find. And the next day, a doctor who informs two heartsick
parents that a grapefruit-sized tumor threatens to end their
daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook could not have been worse, the uncertainty more
rampant. Specialists were not clear if the cancer had invaded her
lungs or her diaphragm or spread into her bones. The survival rate
for Ewing's sarcoma, a rare, childhood disease, is only 60 percent.
And for those fortunate enough to recover, the route home is a long
and tortured one, marked by major surgery, months of devastating
chemotherapy treatments and scars that spread from body to mind.
</P>
<P>
   That was in April. What followed is a tale of courage and
compassion that brings us to this Christmas morning, a day when
young Lindsey Beggan of Medfield personifies the hope of the season
and the comforting -- though unfortunately contrarian -- belief
that people are essentially good. Lindsey's cancer became a town's
cause, and everyone involved seems the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days after the diagnosis, a group of 6 to 10 women
began meeting nearly every Friday to plan how the town could best
help the Beggans. They scheduled an endless stream of babysitters
for the three children, aged one-and-a-half, three and eight,
allowing the parents time in the hospital. More than 85 others
around town volunteered to cook and deliver meals. Others
redecorated Lindsey's room with new paint, a flower border and a
rose-colored rug. Still others delivered gift baskets for Lindsey
and her family everytime they returned from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A local lawn care company tended to the Beggan's property, no
charge. A maid service was hired to clean house. The women even
bought a First Communion cake for the eight-year-old. ``To this
day, I'm in awe at what people are doing,'' says Melinda Beggan,
Lindsey's mother. ``I've had people I've never met coming in with
meals. You think you know everyone in town, but you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause is a remarkable one. Lindsey looks to be all arms and
legs in that way fifth graders so often are. She is the fastest
runner on her soccer team, the oldest of four sisters. She plays
the clarinet. Her favorite subject is math, and when the topic
turns to her report card, she is more than willing to present it
for inspection, mostly, it seems, because she received all A's.
When she smiles, as she so often does, it is as if someone has
flicked a light on the tiny, chiseled features of her innocent
face.
</P>
<P>
   It's heartbreaking to picture her at the edge of the abyss last
April, surrounded by surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital
performing invasive, awful tests, helpless as doctors warned her
parents of the serious consequences ahead. ``It had to be
overwhelming, to be constantly bombarded with docters and nurses
converging on her all the time,'' says her father, Paul Beggan.
``She was just very quiet, never complained, never shed a tear.''
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed on Thursday, April 16, the tumor lodged to her
ribcage. Her first good news came on Friday, when doctors told her
there was no sign of cancer in her lungs. Still, there was one more
crucial result remaining: Whether the cancer had metastasized in
her bones. On Monday morning, when the doctor came to her hospital
room to tell them it hadn't, Paul Beggan bolted out the door
shedding tears of relief and joy.
</P>
<P>
   Next came six long rounds of chemotherapy treatments in three
week intervals, all in an attempt to obliterate the tumor and halt
any spread. The treatments caused vomiting, throat soars and
weakness. Her blood counts regularly plummetted and her parents
would race her to the hospital. Her long, light brown hair fell
out.
</P>
<P>
   By August, surgery. When doctors opened her chest, they weren't
sure what they would find, whether the cancer had spread into her
lungs, whether her heart might be damaged, whether the tumor had
shrunk enough. The Beggans, sitting silently, glumly in a room just
outside the surgical suite, received a call from inside saying
there was no sign of spread into her diaphragm. An hour later, her
doctor, Harvey Weinstein, came into the room to announce there was
no damage to her heart or lungs. Three hours later, the surgeon
declared the operation ``fantastic.'' He had removed five of her
ribs, but she would likely be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, the arduous chemotherapy regimen began anew,
though Lindsey refused to allow it to upend her life. She pleaded
with doctors to stop the treatments long enough for her to attend
her first day of fifth grade at the Dale Street School, and her
parents brought her from the hospital to Medfield, then rushed her
back that afternoon. Cancer doctors, as accustomed to grappling
with death as appreciating life, have been smitten. ``She is a
remarkable youngster,'' says Weinstein. ``This hasn't slowed her
down at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents tell of Lindsey vomiting in the morning, then
insisting on being allowed to go to school by afternoon. She has
resumed playing soccer with a special shield covering her chest.
Friends around town see her walking nonchalantly with a backpack
over her shoulders holding an intravenous hookup to her body. ``I
don't think I've ever heard her complain,'' says Sue Reardon, one
of the women in the core group that has helped the Beggan's.
</P>
<P>
   The chemotherapy treatments will continue until April. Lindsey
and her parents will keep shuttling back and forth between Mass
General and home. And at every level, there is still more help.
Meals are still delivered to the Beggan home during the hospital
stays. Lindsey's school still keeps a watchful eye on their
student. Lindsey's friends still keep their hair cut short in a
show of unity. Other parents around town still wonder what more
they can do.
</P>
<P>
   And about those volunteers, the cooks, the babysitters, the
gift-givers -- they say they've learned something about themselves
in all this, about each other. ``No matter what, I know I could
pick up the phone now and ask anyone for help and say, `Look I'm
having a bad day,' and they'd boost my spirits,'' says Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beggan house, Lindsey was walking around in a Santa Claus
cap one recent day. When a visitor asked what she missed most about
a life without chemotherapy, she looked around the room at nothing
in particular, deep in thought, then smiled in sudden realization.
``My hair,'' she said simply. And with that, she pulled off her
hat, revealing her perfectly bald head. When something is so
wonderful, there's really no need to cover it up.

WEIGHING POWER IN FOREIGN FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.D.)   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of late, domestic films have made a drab lot on video. Not so
the foreigners. On Tuesday, for example, Fox Lorber issued ``Lola
Montes'' (1955), Max Ophuls' last film, with Martine Carol as the
19th-century Mexican circus performer and collector of men from
Franz Liszt to the King of Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   And from New Yorker this week comes ``La Promesse,'' Jean-Pierre
and Luc Dardenne's exceedingly powerful film about a 15-year-old
boy (Jeremie Renier) whose loyalties are torn between a domineering
father and the family of a laborer from Burkina Faso whom the boy's
father has exploited.
</P>
<P>
   With a journalistic eye on racist xenophobia, the Dardennes'
movie has much to say about what ails French society. In its own
way, Deepa Mehta's ``Fire,'' also released by New Yorker, does the
same for India.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could leave me, but life can be hell for a divorced
woman,'' a husband smugly tells his wife in the film. That's from a
man who on the advice of his swami has been celibate for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she enters a lesbian affair with her beautiful young
sister-in-law, who has moved into her household and whose own
husband thinks a baby would keep his wife happy while he is busy
with his Chinese mistress. ``Two heroines in one kitchen,'' the
houseboy observes laconically.
</P>
<P>
   In India their screen rebellion has riled conservative elements
to such an extent that theater owners, fearing for their
establishments, have refused to show the film. Lesbianism by itself
is not so much the problem. ``It's the role of women in a
patriarchal society,'' Ms. Mehta said from New Delhi. ``They are
reduced to being pets.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hiroshi Teshigahara's classic ``Woman in the Dunes'' (1964),
released this month by Milestone (distributed by New Yorker), a
woman (Kyoko Kishida) and a man (Eiji Okada) are equal-opportunity
sufferers, making love out of almost crazed loneliness and all the
while shoveling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Their antagonist, but also their provider, is sand, great
undulating seas and collapsing walls of it that threaten to bury
them as they did the woman's husband and child. An entomologist and
schoolteacher from the city, the man wanders vast beaches by the
sea. Needing a place to stay for the night, he is directed by
villagers to a house at the bottom of a sand pit.
</P>
<P>
   He descends by ladder to be welcomed and fed by the woman, who
lives and works there alone. All night she shovels sand into a
bucket, which is hauled to the top of the pit by the villagers. In
the morning the man discovers that the ladder is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Shovel they must to earn their food and water, which is lowered
to them. ``Sand makes things rot,'' she tells him. Later he
discovers that for himself as he tries to make a ladder from
crumbling boards he's torn from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Looking appropriately and richly desolate, the film retains its
allegorical mysteries and fascination. Here is the inevitable
futility of life. Having escaped the pit at last, the man won't
leave. ``No need to rush and escape,'' he says. &QL;

   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Tommy O'Haver's film pushes the romantic-comedy
envelope several steps beyond the gender-bending ``Prisoner of
Sex''; on another, it is really about the way idealized 40s and 50s
Hollywood fantasies still influence our lives.
</P>
<P>
   A geeky-looking homosexual art photographer named Billy Collier
(Sean P. Hayes) falls for Gabriel (Brad Rowe), a 19-year-old
aspiring musician and ``Baywatch''-style boy toy who works in a
coffee shop. Landing on whatever side of the sexual fence the
situation calls for, Gabriel cooperates with Billy's idea to
restage great love scenes using drag queens as screen goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the island of Catalina, sexual chaos erupts in a
sweet, goofy movie in which, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, everything ``feels playfully surreal.''  &QL;

   In a sterile suburb, a smart 10-year-old girl named Devon
(Mischa Barton) and a free-spirited mower of lawns named Trent (Sam
Rockwell), both of whom can't stand the place, form an alliance for
friendship and survival.
</P>
<P>
   Trent lives the hermit's life with brio, and his insouciant
attitude attracts Devon, who gradually wins him over as a sidekick
and confidant. Though Devon's precociousness becomes cloying and
the pair's shared vulnerability can be heavy-handed, John Duigan's

   Soon there are baseketball teams around the country, inane

`THE BEATLES': ALL YOU NEED IS TRANSCRIPTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``The Beatles Anthology'' was released in 1996, it was the
expressed hope of the former band members that this 10-hour video
production would be the Beatles biography to end all Beatles
biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it instead became more grist for a mill that
still pours forth everything from scholarly analysis to diary-style
listings of the events in the saga. The Beatles' insistence that
only they could say what really happened, however, has given rise
to a style of biography in which authors try to fade into the
woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   David Pritchard and Alan Lysaght take that approach in ``The
Beatles: An Oral History,'' a book that draws on material they
began collecting in the late 1970s for a 24-hour radio series,
``The Beatles: The Days in Their Lives,'' and interviews they have
conducted since the show was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from an occasional scene-setting sentence or two, the book
is a sequence of quotations from the Beatles and some 100 people
who were participants in their career or close observers of it.
</P>
<P>
   It follows this year's similarly laid out ``Many Years From
Now,'' a collaboration between Bob Miles and Paul McCartney, in
which transcripts of interviews with McCartney are interrupted only
by brief descriptions of the events he is about to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The book version of ``The Beatles Anthology,'' due next year, is
to be transcripts of interviews that the Beatles and a few close
associates gave during the making of the ``Anthology,'' with John
Lennon represented by excerpts from the expansive autobiographical
interviews he gave throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be said for getting these memories on record,
but one needn't be a practicing historian to recognize that
dispensing with the authorial voice is not an entirely satisfactory
approach in biography. It puts the reader at the mercy of the
subject's memory lapses, self-editing and misapprehensions, to say
nothing of self-serving interpretations. The ``Anthology,''
valuable as it is, embodies all these flaws.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, Pritchard and Lysaght don't leave the story in
the Beatles' mouths, although they are quoted plentifully. Friends,
journalists and disk jockeys who traveled with them all weigh in,
as do recording engineers and session musicians, artists who
designed their record jackets and members of the inner circle at
Apple, the company the Beatles set up to run their affairs. By
casting such a wide net, the authors offer perspectives beyond
those usually cited in Beatles' biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these perspectives are trivial, but the best of them _
for example, the recollections of friends from Liverpool _ give a
palpable sense of the atmosphere at the band's early performances.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some dangling mysteries, including several
contradictory versions of how, when and where Brian Epstein
discovered the group that he would manage to stardom. And Dick
Rowe, the producer at Decca who rejected the Beatles after they
auditioned for the label in January 1962, explains his decision and
is discussed sympathetically by several colleagues, including some
in the Beatles' circle.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Emerick and Glyn Johns, recording engineers at the Abbey
Road Studios, provide fresh details about the recording of the
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ``Let It Be'' and
``Abbey Road'' albums, and Johns' dissection of the ``Let It Be''
film and recording project is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   He describes the first edit of the film as being full of humor,
and blames Allen Klein (who had just become the Beatles' manager)
for having it transformed into the portrait of fractiousness and
apathy that was eventually released. The section on the band's
breakup gives the sense of an adventure gone suddenly awry.
</P>
<P>
   There are some illuminating characterizations of the band
members, including one by Victor Spinetti, a British actor who
appeared in several of their movies. While filming ``Help!'' in
Austria in 1965, Spinetti, bedridden with the flu, was visited
separately by each of the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney asked if the flu was contagious and left quickly when
Spinetti said yes. George Harrison came in to plump his pillows.
Ringo Starr sat at the foot of his bed pretending to read a fairy
tale aloud from a room-service menu, and Lennon walked in, affected
a German accent to tell Spinetti that he would be experimented on
and left.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the book often reads like a radio script: one
speaker follows another, expanding on the story and offering a
different viewpoint. Errors that might pass in an interview-based
radio series, though, are less acceptable between hard covers;
authors are expected to keep the facts straight, even when
interviewees do not.
</P>
<P>
   Given the depth of detail in ``The Beatles: Recording
Sessions,'' Mark Lewisohn's invaluable book a decade ago, there is
no excuse for such errors as quoting both George Martin, the
group's producer, and Norman Smith, an engineer, saying that they
recorded 12 of the 14 songs on their debut ``Please Please Me''
album in a single day. They recorded 10; four songs were released
on singles before the marathon session.
</P>
<P>
   Smith adds that the Beatles recorded their instruments first and
added vocals later (not true at that point), and that the 1965
``Rubber Soul'' album was recorded on eight-track equipment, which
was not available at Abbey Road until the ``White Album'' sessions
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   If the authors did not want to tamper with the quotations, they
might have included clarifying footnotes. A list of sources and
dates for the interviews would have been helpful as well, since
they were not all conducted by Pritchard and Lysaght: some date
from the 1960s, and there are excerpts from news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Better care should also have been taken with names. In one
amusing instance, when an interviewee refers to Simon Postuma and
Marijke Koger (partners in the design team that ran the Beatles'
Apple boutique) using only their first names, the transcript yields
``Simon Mariaka.'' Even the interviewees are not safe: William
Pobjoy, headmaster at young Lennon's school, is listed as Popjoy.
</P>
<P>
   This book tells the story with a reasonable balance of diplomacy
and candor, and its most enlightening quotations nearly make up for
the lack of a guiding, interpretive viewpoint. But a biography
built on unprocessed interviews has to be edited more carefully
than this.

 &HT;    Gas Guy making his presence felt
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Natural Gas Services is off to a fast start as
one of the top competitors in the state's newly deregulated natural
gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light Co. has the
daunting task of luring its share of the 1.4 million customers now
served by its sister company. Those residences and businesses
already have started signing up for service with rival marketers.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, the company has launched an ad campaign
featuring its increasingly popular ``blue flame'' Gas Guy mascot
and promises prices for gas service that it says beat its rivals'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got tremendous momentum,'' says A. Clifton Payne, vice
president for marketing. The company hasn't released figures on how
many customers it has signed up. After two months of competitive
gas sales, its top rivals are SCANA Energy of South Carolina and
Houston-based Shell Energy Services.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its link to Atlanta Gas Light, Georgia Natural Gas is
seen as the player to beat among the dozen marketers now providing
service. Many observers believe consumers used to dealing with
Atlanta Gas Light will flock to Georgia Natural Gas when it comes
time for them to choose a marketer or be assigned to one by the
Public Service Commission sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Natural Gas won't disclose how much its advertising and
marketing effort is costing. But Stephen J. Gunther, president of
the company, said he expects his company to become profitable
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company had a rocky beginning. At first, AGL Resources Inc.,
parent of the gas company, wanted to call its marketing affiliate
Atlanta Gas Light Services.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors complained that would confer an unfair
advantage. AGL's marketing wing finally won the right in an
out-of-court settlement in July to call itself Georgia Natural Gas
Services and to use the same blue-flame logo that has identified
Atlanta Gas Light Co. for years.
</P>
<P>
   Many competitors are watching carefully for any sign Georgia
Natural Gas is gaining favored treatment from Atlanta Gas Light Co.
The utility is supposed to do business on an equal footing with all
marketers as the entity responsible for delivering gas to homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note Gunther, Payne and Senior Vice President Clayton H.
Preble all worked previously for AGL Resources or the gas utility
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any evidence that Georgia Natural Gas Services
has received special treatment that would be prohibited by law,''
said David Adelman, an attorney who represents several marketers.
``But it's very early in the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther insisted, ``We are treated like any other marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Higgins, president and chief executive of AGL
Resources, said he does speak to Gunther occasionally. But he said
Georgia Natural Gas Services is a ``separate company'' that reports
to a board of a joint venture called SouthStar Energy Services.
SouthStar is, in turn, a partnership of AGL Resources,
Charlotte-based Piedmont Energy and Houston-based Dynegy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Natural Gas Services has also contracted its billing and
customer service to Utilipro Inc., an Atlanta-based utility billing
services company in which AGL Resources has an 85 percent stake.
Utilipro's call center is in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizes a link
</P>
<P>
   The Gas Guy, dreamed up by the Atlanta ad agency BBDO South, has
allowed Georgia Natural Gas Services to promote its affiliate
relationship with Atlanta Gas Light and to build an identity with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a marketing expert, but it seems to be accomplishing
its purpose,'' Higgins said. One marketing expert, Georgia State
University Professor Kenneth Bernhardt, also said the Gas Guy has
been effective.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mascot is an unusual tactic for utility companies, which
until the recent advent of deregulation have been monopolies that
did not have to fight for market share.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Pillsbury Dough Boy and Ronald McDonald, a mascot
allows a company to ``break through all the clutter'' and establish
an identity with consumers, Bernhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stopped the average person in the street and asked
which gas company could they name, they couldn't name more than two
or three,'' he said. The Gas Guy ensures Georgia Natural Gas has
that awareness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gas Guy is also getting under the skin of rival marketers.
One has pinned a picture of the mascot on the wall and throws darts
at it. Another finds the ubiquitous blue blob ``aggravating.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Natural Gas identifies the Gas Guy as ``Matt.'' He has
his own office in Georgia Natural Gas Services' executive suite on
Glenridge Drive, off Johnson Ferry Road and Ga. 400 in north
Atlanta. There he plans public appearances and answers e-mail on
his own personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The mascot has been quite busy in recent weeks in a round of
``true-blue'' public appearances that have included a televised
fund-raiser for Georgia Public Television, Egleston Hospital's
Christmas parade and a visit to Hughes Spalding Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt says such ``cause-related marketing'' is effective
because it ties a product to a cause and ``transfers good will''
from a cause consumers may hold dear. But he said good will and
consumer awareness won't carry the day by themselves if the product
is not competitive on price and other things consumers care about.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Georgia Natural Gas prices have been competitive. Its
prices for an average residential customer were among the lowest in
a recent survey of rates offered by nine of the 10 marketers
selling gas this month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's most popular pricing plan, gas charges are
subject to change monthly according to market fluctuations, and
customers are credited in the 13th month of service for an average
monthly bill. Georgia Natural Gas also offers a fixed gas rate,
with a one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our price is a competitive price,'' said Payne. ``Consumers
who have gone to Georgia Natural Gas Services are seeing a lower
price.''

SIMMS EXPECTS DIFFERENT PATRIOTS TO TAKE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Phil Simms covered the Patriots, the team whupped
the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 6.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment wasn't a household word back then, and Scott Zolak
was just another backup quarterback. But now he's leading the
limping Patriots down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Simms expects to see a different team than the one
that pummeled KC. Against the New York Jets, he'll see one that
made the playoffs but has relied on a wing, a prayer, and a yellow
flag to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to be interesting to me is who is going to play
for the Patriots,'' Simms said. ``I mean physically. Who is going
to be physically capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms knows that Drew Bledsoe is out, but he also believes that
Zolak is a solid citizen, capable of keeping the patriots
competitive in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to make a case that Zolak is better than
Drew,'' Simms said during an interview. ``But with his performance
against the 49ers, Zolak is driving his market price up.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterbacks took a big hit after the NFL instituted the
salary cap. Simms said teams would slash their salaries to
$500,000, take it or leave town. But now, the value of backups has
risen, especially considering that at one point during the season
more than half of the starting quarterbacks were either injured or
not performing well. Simms now figures the price for a good backup
QB is about $1.5 million, ``right where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms was quick to point out that the Patriots' defense has been
keeping them in games, and while it's still solid, inexperienced
players such as Chris Canty and Tebucky Jones make the team
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has taught me one thing,'' Simms said. ``The teams
that have the best chance of succeeding in this league have quality
veterans. At the beginning of the season, a lot of people were
talking about their teams having the youngest average age. But most
of the teams that are in the playoffs are loaded with solid
veterans, making plays and leading their teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything is pointing to them,'' Simms said.
``They won their division. Even Bill (Coach Parcells) is giving
them praise, and you know how rare that is. He was telling me that
he was very happy with his offense. He thinks they are smart. They
don't make a lot of mental mistakes. He told me that they can go
through a week of practice with one, maybe two mental errors. The
blitzes are picked up, the receivers change their routes to beat
the coverage and the quarterback makes the right decision. Now
there are times when the running game is not clicking but its not
because the linemen don't know who to block. They just can't block
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms said Parcells returns to his old self when he talks about
his defense. According to Simms, Parcells says his defense makes
``seven or eight mental mistakes on every play.''

A HERO FOR OUR TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day next spring, the Clinton boom will surpass the Reagan
years and enter the history books as the second longest peacetime
expansion on record. Steady growth now seems likely to continue
into the next century, surpassing even the long war boom of the
1960s and becoming the most remarkable period of sustained growth _
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible is one of the few in Washington not to have
been sullied by the events of this dreadful year: Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Man of the year? How about accomplishment of the decade? We
won't see many years more dangerous to good financial order than
the one just past.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have guessed when he replaced Paul Volcker in 1987
that Greenspan would achieve a star status surpassing that of the
man who _ by sheer dint of personality _ stopped a runaway global
inflation at the end of the 1970s and laid the foundations for the
Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan has served three presidents now. The graying
former economics consultant has continued to build the integrity of
the Fed with good appointments to its board of governors and
regional banks. He has forged an excellent relationship with
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, another official whose stock has
risen throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The result: America and the global economy have dodged a series
of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan prevented the spilling-over of the long-running Asian
financial crisis _ itself largely the result of mismanagement of
the Japanese economy. He avoided a currency devaluation in China,
dealt with the Russian government default, contained an incipient
crisis in Brazil and liquidated a huge American hedge fund. Had it
been allowed to fail, Long-Term Capital Management could have
precipitated financial gridlock and tumbled the world into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the US economy has grown at annual rate of nearly 4
percent for the last three years -- with prices virtually flat.
Greenspan raised rates only once, before triming them slightly in
three steps last autumn. Even his ``irrational exhuberence''
warning of two years ago looks pretty good in hindsight _ a warning
that manias could take hold in unexpected ways in unexpected
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the crisis is entirely over. Some threats remain. But
DRI/McGraw-Hill recently dropped its probability-of-recession
estimate to 20 percent from 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To grasp the magnitude of Greenspan's achievement, however,
compare the three expansions of the Sixties, the Eighties and the
Nineties. Until recently this was a favorite ploy of the
Clinton-bashers, who complained that the 1990s expansion lacks
``the oomph'' of previous recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, growth often has been more robust in the past. The
economy grew by an astonishing 50 percent between the beginning and
the end of the 1961-69 boom, according to calculations by the
Institute for Policy Innovation. During the 1983-90 boom, the
economy grew 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when the current boom began, the economy has grown
only by about a 25 percent. Does that mean that the Nineties boom
has been weak and insipid?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. The Sixties boom was fueled by Vietnam War. When it
ended the international monetary system had been wrecked and a
decade of stagnation was in store.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighties boom was stimulated by those huge tax-cut deficits.
Only extremely nimble footwork by Greenspan in the years since 1987
_ and budget- balancing by three consecutive Congresses _ prevented
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Nineties booms looks like the model of
sustainable growth _ low inflation, a balanced budget and rising
real incomes, thanks to resumed productivity growth. .
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that Greenspan has bought continued
growth only by initiating an American ``bubble'' _ an inflation of
share prices through excessive monetary ease. They are mostly
partisans of former president George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right. But they often have been wrong. And in any
event, nobody doubts that the expansion eventually must end. The
question is when _ and whether it will be hard landing or soft.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's achievement has been to set a high standard both for
technical excellence and for bipartisanship in the management of
the economy. Future presidents, whatever their party, will have to
find central bankers whose stature is sufficient to permit them to
attempt to match his record.

 &HT;    Miracle man: Bethune-Cookman's Frink
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just a few years ago, the board of trustees of
Bethune-Cookman College was discussing the possibility of dramatic
cutbacks in the athletic programs of the church-supported school in
Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune-Cookman did not enact most of those measures _
fortunately for the football team, or the Wildcats would not be
preparing to face Southern University on Saturday in the Heritage
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With about 2,500 students, Bethune-Cookman plays football at the
Division I-AA level in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.
Fielding 16 athletic teams, including football, had put a
tremendous strain on the school's resources.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, a former executive of Atlanta Life Insurance Co.
became Bethune-Cookman's executive vice president. Jno. ``John'' S.
Frink, a graduate of Bethune-Cookman, had spent 40 years with
Atlanta Life, the last 18 as a vice president with expertise in
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, things were so difficult financially, we
had some trustees who felt that we should go back to the (Div. II)
SIAC,'' Frink said. ``A lot of others felt we should discontinue
football _ since it was so costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Frink's work with Bethune-Cookman president and
former classmate Oswald Bronson, talk of moving football to a lower
level, or even dropping the sport, has subsided. Frink convinced
the skeptics among the trustees that the school could survive at
the Division I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I could raise $25,000 that first year,'' Frank
said. ``We began to organize (booster clubs), and we ended up
raising $80,000.'' Last year, the goal of the athletic-support
groups was $100,000; they raised $145,000. With the increase came a
boost in the athletic teams' morale and performance, including the
football squad. Teams were able to practice at improved facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an athletic foundation back in the '80s, but we
couldn't get beyond the city limits of Daytona,'' said athletics
director Lynn Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were raising nothing,'' Thompson said. ``But Dr. Frink came
here in '96, and what he has done since has been incredible.
Because of the support of booster clubs he helped organize all over
the country, we've gone from being also-rans in the (MEAC) to the
upper tier in the conference.

 &HT;    Ex-Ole Miss standout likely starter for Miami
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rookie running back John Avery, Miami's first-round
draft choice out of Mississippi, apparently will get his first NFL
start Sunday against the Falcons (13-2) in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Karim Abdul-Jabbar, who leads Miami (10-5) with 960 yards and
six touchdowns on 270 carries (3.6-yard average), suffered a
concussion in the fourth quarter of Miami's 26-21 loss to the New
York Jets Dec. 13 but missed no practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar was knocked woozy again on the third play of Monday
night's 31-21 win over Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Avery was told Wednesday that he probably will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the chance I've been waiting for all my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Avery (5-foot-9, 190), has carried 129 times for 480 yards and
two touchdowns. He is very fast but has been impatient in letting
plays develop. He also tends to dance around looking for the
perfect hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's very athletically gifted,'' tight end Troy Drayton
said. ``There's more of a chance when John is in the backfield to
have a big play. When John touches the ball, he's a big play
waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's rushing average of 3.4 yards per carry is the worst in
the NFL, and in recent weeks quarterback Dan Marino has thrown the
ball 57 and 38 times, for 321 and 355 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson, however, continues to insist that he wants
to rely on the running game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Two names were added to the Falcons' injury list Thursday after
a 2 1/2-hour practice at the Georgia Dome. Defensive end Chuck
Smith (back) and free safety Eugene Robinson (leg) are listed as
probable. Joining them on the injury list are reserve cornerback
Randy Fuller (shoulder), linebacker Cornelius Bennett (knee) and
defensive end Lester Archambeau (broken thumb). All are listed as
probable. . . . Miami offensive tackle Richmond Webb, who at one
time was listed as out, is doubtful because of an a triceps injury.
Right guard Kevin Donnalley is questionable because of a sore knee,
and defensive end Kenny Mixon (knee) remains questionable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schedule update
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons next year will play preseason games at home against
Detroit and Baltimore and will travel for games at Tennessee and
Cincinnati. In the regular season, Atlanta will play four teams
from the AFC Central. Also, because the Falcons finished first in
the NFC West, they are assured of playing at least one of the other
NFC division champions, Minnesota or Dallas, and the second-place
team in both of the other divisions, Green Bay and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playoff possibilities
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' playoff schedule is set, inasmuch as they know they
have a bye the first week and will play a home game the second week
against Dallas, San Francisco or Green Bay. The Dolphins' situation
is not as clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   If they win Sunday in their first Atlanta appearance since 1980,
they will be the No. 4 seed in the AFC and will host either Buffalo
(9-6) or New England (9-6), whichever ends up the higher seed.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo plays at New Orleans (6-9) Sunday, and New England plays
in New York, against the Jets (11-4).
</P>
<P>
   If both teams finish with the same record, New England will be
the No. 5 seed, and will travel to Miami for the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Streaks
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's record of 19-4 since the middle of the '97 season is
the best in the league, one victory ahead of the Denver Broncos. .
. . Miami has beaten four NFC teams in a row, dating back to last
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Super D
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins lead the NFL in scoring defense, having allowed 227
points, or an average of 12.8 per game. The Miami record for fewest
points allowed in a 16-game season is 242, in '90. With 25 points,
Atlanta, which has scored 404 points, can surpass the team record
of 426, set in '81.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defense is what one would expect out of Johnson _ big in
the middle and fast everywhere else. They're also young.
</P>
<P>
   The starters average 3.8 years of experience, making them the
second-youngest defense in the NFL. The Falcons are oldest at 8.1,
now that cornerback Ronnie Bradford has moved back into the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphin keys are fifth-year defensive left tackle Tim Bowens
(6-4, 315 pounds) and third-year defensive right tackle Daryl
Gardener (6-6, 315). They keep guards busy while allowing middle
linebacker Zach Thomas, who has a team-high 157 tackles, freedom to
roam.
</P>
<P>
   With 45 sacks, Miami's defense often forces opposing
quarterbacks to rush throws, helping to explain the Dolphins'
league-leading 29 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison have eight each,
tied for second in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an active, quick defense,'' Falcons interim coach
Rich Brooks said. ``Hopefully, we'll be able to take advantage of
their under-sized ends . . . but you saw what they did to Terrell
Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's 31-21 win over the Broncos, the Dolphins
allowed the NFL's leading rusher just 29 yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fish tales
</P>
<P>
   In their first four games, the Dolphins averaged 225.8 yards and
16.8 points per game. Since then, they've averaged 345.8 yards and
26 points. . . . Miami is third in the league in average time of
possession (32:09), trailing only Atlanta (33:32) and Buffalo
(32:38). . . . Miami wide receiver O.J. McDuffie leads the league
with 85 receptions, 55 for first downs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last time
</P>
<P>
   When these teams met last, in 1995 in Miami, the Dolphins
rallied from a 20-9 deficit, scoring two touchdowns in the final
eight minutes, missing both two-point conversion tries.
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed 35 of 50 passes that day for 343 yards and two
touchdowns as the Dolphins had 428 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, in fact, has averaged 375.3 yards in the last four
meetings.

 &HT;    Jets-Pats rivalry full of bad blood
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As he bounded toward the locker room after the New
York Jets' division-clinching victory last Saturday afternoon,
coach Bill Parcells put his arm around the shoulder of Curtis
Martin and whispered sweet somethings in the tailback's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember,'' Parcells said, ``that we're not finished
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was referring to his desire for a third Super Bowl
championship. But given that this week's NFL schedule features
``Tuna Bowl IV'' _ the fourth matchup of the Jets and Patriots
since Parcells acrimoniously left New England after the 1996 season
_ his cautionary reminder might have suggested a more immediate
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that Martin, filched from the Patriots as a
transition free agent and one of several former New England players
on the Jets roster, won't require much prodding to get ready for
the latest edition of one of the league's best rivalries. Even
though the Jets have secured a first-round playoff bye, they can
scuttle the Patriots' chances for a wild-card game at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's motivation enough for me,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The New England-New York matchup is the only one in NFL history
in which each coach previously led the opposite team. Patriots
coach Pete Carroll is 1-2 against Parcells and is anxious to even
the score.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for most of the second half of the season, the
Patriots go into the game with several starters out with injuries.
Most notable is quarterback Drew Bledsoe. But because Parcells
seems to get inside his head so easily, Bledsoe's fractured index
finger might be a break for New England.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the NFL ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: The New Orleans Saints are playing for
pride and 1999 jobs. Those two elements, and the fear that Mike
Ditka indeed is coming back next season, could be enough to keep
things close in the game against Buffalo. The New Orleans defense
will stomp Doug Flutie and _ if Kerry Collins doesn't totally screw
things up on the offensive side _ spearhead a moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: The Miami defense, arguably the quickest
unit in the league, held Denver tailback Terrell Davis to 29 yards
on 16 carries Monday night. Six days later, it encounters Jamal
Anderson, who needs only 16 rushes to break James Wilder's season
record for carries. Sixteen carries probably will be 16 collisions
with middle linebacker Zach Thomas. Anderson and Thomas will be
chomping aspirin after this one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Imagine how excited St. Louis players were to
hear team president John Shaw's decision to bring back coach Dick
Vermeil in '99. Think they're going to be high for the 49ers, a
team that's defeated them 16 times in a row? Think again, and book
San Francisco tailback Garrison Hearst for about 150 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: Nothing tops Parcells vs. the Patriots, but
there's plenty of history in the Green Bay-Chicago rivalry. The
Bears played the Packers tough the first meeting of the season, but
Brett Favre is getting his playoff face on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: The bleeding Dallas Cowboys can become the
first NFC East franchise to get through division play undefeated
and untied. With the secondary decimated, it will be tougher than
expected against a suddenly resuscitated Redskins team that has won
six of its last eight games.

MISSISSIPPI MAN WANTED FOR KILLING IN POLICE CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A man wanted for murder, theft and other charges
who was apprehended by the Mexican police after a daring escape
across the border was in custody Thursday in a Texas jail.
</P>
<P>
   James Edward Tillis was being held in the Webb County Jail here
after Mexican authorities turned him over to a Texas Ranger, a jail
official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities were spared what could have been a lengthy
battle to have Tillis extradited when the Mexican government
deported him early Thursday for entering that country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis, 30, of Lambert, Miss., violated immigration laws by
swimming across the Rio Grande to flee U.S. Border Patrol agents
and entering the country without permission, a federal prosecutor
in Mexico said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is for prosecutors in Texas, Arkansas and possibly
Tennessee to decide who will be the first to try Tillis, who is
wanted for knifing two people in Arkansas, killing one of them, and
for allegedly tying up a man near Austin, Texas, and stealing his
truck. It was not clear Thursday why the man was being sought in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of details that need to be worked out,'' Capt.
Billy Williams of the West Helena, Ark., police said. ``We're
mostly waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Mexican policemen arrested Tillis on Wednesday after they
spotted him strolling through a Nuevo Laredo shopping district a
few blocks from the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers had been searching for Tillis, who doesn't
speak Spanish and was last seen climbing from the river after
fleeing Border Patrol agents who were pursuing him on the U.S. side
of the river.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the federal police headquarters in Nuevo
Laredo, Tillis said that he felt remorse for a crime spree that he
said was triggered over personal problems with a former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my temper and was caught in a whirlpool of sin,''
Tillis said. ``When that happens, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin King, 44, of West Helena, was killed Sunday. Brenda Green,
the mother of Tillis' former girlfriend, had her throat slashed and
was treated at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A man matching Tillis' description was scene by a Texas state
trooper using a coat hanger to get into a vehicle that had been
reported stolen. The police said Tillis escaped by tying up a man
near Austin and stealing his truck.
</P>
<P>
   He was spotted in Laredo and chased before jumping into the
river and swimming to Mexico. The stolen truck was found in Laredo.

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ They're expecting 22 for dinner Friday at what Al
Testaverde likes to call his ``little bungalow'' on Hunnewell
Street. Josie Testaverde will be serving the usual fare _ roast
beef, roast pork _ and for the first time in years, the couple's
only son will be at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde has spent Christmas the past few years in
suburban Baltimore and Cleveland and makes his offseason home near
Tampa. But this stretch of western Long Island is really home. This
is where he still goes for pizza at Carmela's and gets his hair cut
by John Gigante at A Cut Above. This is the only home he knows. His
parents moved here from south Brooklyn 35 years ago when their
third child, named for Al's father, was 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
   The couple saw their son blossom into a star at nearby Sewanhaka
High School and win the Heisman Trophy playing for the University
of Miami. They watched him struggle in Tampa Bay as a rookie and
then enjoy moderate success at Cleveland and Baltimore. They
watched him play for teams that almost unfailingly were horrid and
forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 12 years into what largely had been an unremarkable pro
career, the son has literally returned to his roots. He lives down
the road in a rented house in West Merrick and practices at Hofstra
University, a 10-minute drive down the Hempstead Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   That stretch of road is a dreamer's delight, with discount
outlets and fast food joints on almost every block. But furniture,
office supplies, and hamburgers are not the only bargains here.
Vinny Testaverde may be the best deal of all this season.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, his dream was to play for the Jets. He hung posters of
Joe Namath in his bedroom. He finally got a chance last summer,
signing as a free agent, seemingly destined to be the cagey,
dependable backup quarterback and No. 1 clipboard holder. What
happened instead, of course, has been quite different. No one,
anywhere, has been playing quarterback this season any better than
Vinny Testaverde. The homecoming has been a smashing, magical
success.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are 11-4 heading into Sunday's game with the Patriots,
and one very big reason is their 6-foot-5-inch quarterback, who has
flourished in Bill Parcells's system. The Jets are 11-1 in the
games he has started. He has 25 touchdown passes, one shy of the
club record held by Namath and Al Dorow. He has thrown only six
interceptions, none on third down, and his TD/INT ratio is the best
in the league and fourth best in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? His 100.6 quarterback rating is tops in the AFC and
second only to Randall Cunningham's 107.3. His QB rating on third
downs is 122.9. All of the above earned him a richly deserved spot
on the AFC Pro Bowl team, an amazing feat given that he wasn't even
on the fan ballot, which accounts for one-third of the vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a part of what I've always wanted to accomplish,
part of what I always dreamed about,'' Testaverde says, matter of
factly. ``But if I take too much time to smell the roses, I'm
afraid it will become a distraction. I don't want to be in a
position where I'm happy with what I've done. There's a lot left to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be a risk in going home, be it in literature or
athletics. Bill Fitch once cut Ronnie Perry because he didn't want
people in the Boston Garden stands wondering why the local phenom
from Holy Cross wasn't playing. The New York Knicks last season
passed on a deal for Kenny Anderson, worried that he would get
caught up with all his buddies from Queens. Testaverde has had no
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Testaverde means in Italian?'' asks Carmela's
proprietor Anthony Calia, rolling the ``r'' as he speaks. ``It
means green head. And what color are the Jets' helmets? They're
green (and white). So, to me, it makes perfect sense. It's full
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gigante has ben cutting hair at the corner of Crest Road and
Hempstead Turnpike for 23 years. Vinny has been a regular customer,
or as regular as one can be given his many pit stops. This summer,
the two talked about the perils of coming back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat in that chair over there,'' Gigante says, motioning,
``and said that if had happened 14 years ago, he would have been
nervous. But he said that he wouldn't be now. He said, `Why should
I be?' I know I'm not nervous giving a new customer a haircut,
because I'm a pro. Well, so is Vinny.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde understood the situation all too well even before he
signed with the Jets last summer. He still understands it, even as
his agent works with Jets management on the final details of a
four-year contract extension. There can be distractions, hangers
on, false friends, and out-of-the-woodwork buddies. But there also
was Josie's lasagna and an opportunity he really thought could
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Testaverde said, ``it was a big concern of mine. You
never know how it's going to work out. If it's good, it's twice as
good. If it's bad, it's twice as bad. So far, it's been good. And
to be able to share it with your friends and family has been a
thrill for all of us. But once you're on the field, you really
don't think too much about where you're from.''
</P>
<P>
   But he constantly thinks about where he is. It wasn't until the
season was 15 weeks along that Testaverde finally acknowledged that
he had felt all along that he would emerge as the starter. It
wasn't any reflection on preseason and opening-day No. 1 Glenn
Foley or any overinflated opinion of his own ability. He just felt
that everything was right: the timing, the team, the coach, the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Al Testaverde about his son's success this year, and the
father has two words: Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't make any difference if they were playing in China
_ Vinny always has had the talent,'' the elder Testaverde said.
``He's always been the same. He never gets rattled. He never
complains. What Coach Parcells did was bring that all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells didn't worry _ does he ever worry? _ about any risks.
He has overhauled the Jets in his own image in his two years here,
and Testaverde is one of many veterans brought in to, as John
Calipari likes to say, ``change the culture.'' The Tuna saw a
35-year-old hungry for a chance to come home and play. That's all
he saw, or so he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he says, ``I think he's glad that he can share this
with his parents. That's about it. And he can have dinner at his
mom's house. That's about it. It's no big deal. We're by all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular season ends Sunday in the Meadowlands. Vinny
Testaverde will make his 13th start and Josie Testaverde will make
the short trip to New Jersey _ ``she's the real trouper,'' says her
husband _ to see the game. And Al? He has to settle for a
tape-delayed replay, a grudging concession to a heart that once
quit on him during a 1987 game in Tampa. By the time the tape
starts to roll, Al will have discovered the outcome and the way in
which his son contributed to it. He can't even listen to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who I am,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Jets get to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think I'll take a chance on that one,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That might even be better than Christmas dinner for 22.

 &HT;    Pecking order: Rank in family hard to outgrow
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the family gathers around the Christmas tree this
morning, remember this: You never outgrow your birth order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get together with my brother and sister and they're in
the car, they still want to sit in the back seat and put me in the
middle,'' says psychologist Kevin Leman, 55, author of the 1985
best seller ``The Birth Order Book.'' ``And that same older brother
or sister who told you how to run your life as a kid is in the
kitchen telling you how to make the stuffing.''
</P>
<P>
   Family get-togethers bring out the best, the worst and the child
in everyone, Leman says. ``That little boy or girl in us always
pops out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like birth order, interest in family placement seems unwavering.
Leman is back with an updated and expanded ``The New Birth Order
Book,'' which is flying off the shelves like a group of firstborn
children on a mission. He expanded some popular parts of the first
book _ such as explanations of marital relationships _ and added a
whole new section about how birth order affects business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's interested in birth order,'' Leman says,
``Everybody has one.''
</P>
<P>
   Leman behaves himself for a series of CNN interviews, but admits
he's a classic youngest child. ``I lose things. I forget things. I
wore two different colored shoes'' on TV one time.
</P>
<P>
   On ``CBS This Morning,'' when asked his own place in the family,
he picked his tie up off his chest, wiped his nose with it and
said, ``The baby. I'll do anything to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He made terrible grades, got into college only after sending
Scripture verses about forgiveness to a Christian school that had
rejected him, then got kicked out for ``ripping off the conscience
box'' where people were supposed to pay for ice cream on the honor
system. ``It's a long, involved story and I was actually
innocent,'' he protests.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, he had a master's degree and a doctorate and was
dean of students at the University of Arizona, which had refused to
admit him as an undergraduate student, and using all his insight on
his own unwitting minions. He has written 19 books, including
``When Your Best Is Not Good Enough'' and is co-host of the radio
show ``Parent Talk.''
</P>
<P>
   A newfound belief in the Christian faith at age 22 turned his
life around, he says. ``I had thought Christians were a bunch of
wackos,'' he said. ``I did a 180. After I believed and developed
faith, motivation came to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For his reintroduction to the faith, Leman, who now lives in
Tucson, Ariz., credits his wife, an organized, color-coordinated
firstborn, ``a regular Martha Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Martha Stewart a firstborn?
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd have to be,'' he says. Or at least the oldest girl.
(Actually, Stewart is the second of six children, but one
biographer has described her as her father's favorite child,
meaning she may have been treated as a firstborn.)
</P>
<P>
   Leman's marriage, between a baby of the family and a firstborn,
is one of the best matches, according to his research.
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly been fruitful, giving him five opportunities to
observe his birth order theories in his own household.
</P>
<P>
   The first three children fit the patterns perfectly, he claims.
</P>
<P>
   Firstborn Holly, 26, was always ``meticulous, perfectionistic,
structured, hard-driving and bright,'' a stickler for the rules who
demanded precision.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-child Krissy, 25, is ``relational,'' inclined toward
mediation and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, 21, is playful and creative and has a great sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years the family functioned as a five-person unit. Then
along came a surprise. They named her Hannah. Because of the large
gap between her and her siblings, Hannah is ``a quasi-only child,''
according to her father, and exhibits many ``tender baby
characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hannah was a surprise, Lauren, now 6, was a shock. Again
because of a large gap, Lauren functioned as a combination baby
princess and firstborn.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of his own family show the variables in birth order
theory. Factors such as age spacing, gender _ being the firstborn
son or daughter in a family _ multiple births, death, adoption,
illness and parental criticism or pressure directed toward specific
children can alter relationships, Leman says.
</P>
<P>
   And when families blend, so that a firstborn suddenly has an
older stepsibling or a baby suddenly finds a younger child in the
limelight, chaos can result.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Leman maintains that birth order theory is solid. He
prides himself in being able to ``nail'' the birth order of
airplane seat mates, television hosts and even audience members at
his speaking engagements. (One secret is that he picks out
firstborns because of their meticulous appearances.)
</P>
<P>
   He has missed a few. He still smarts from wrongly figuring
Bryant as the older Gumbel brother several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leman thinks his birth order books far outsell more scholarly
volumes on the subject precisely because he's a baby of the family
and treats the subject with fun. So there he is on the best-seller
list with firstborn Danielle Steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically `onlies' and firstborns run things,'' says Leman.
``The baby's the one who can lighten them up.''
</P>

 &HT;    Heaven isn't the sort of place I'm looking for
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A friend for whom I did a slight favor said lightly,
``When you die, you're going to heaven.'' It gave me a bad couple
of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dying is all right if you must, but heaven? I'm not sure about
that, either getting there or liking it. Not to be secure in your
devotion to heaven! She thought I had blasphemed. I tried to throw
her off by singing a few bars from that old spiritual, ``Evvabody
talk about heaven ain't going there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no use pursuing the matter. Most of us who went to
Sunday school as children were probably reared with a mental
picture of pearly gates and golden streets, and no self-respecting
ad person nowadays would put that picture in a resort magazine.
</P>
<P>
   What do we want a perfect place to look life? It sounds bizarre
in view of all the troubles we've been having lately, but I happen
to like this world, the one we live in, the one we abuse, the one
we probably don't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven's golden streets don't entice me half as much as a stand
of pretty trees. Do they have fall color in heaven? Will the sweet
gums there be gold and rose and violet in autumn? Does heaven have
mountain laurel and rhododendron in June? How about mountains and
rushing little creeks and springs of great drinking water?
</P>
<P>
   Since you think of heaven as being ``up yonder,'' what about the
sky? Is it so close to the sky, you can't get a perspective on the
silvery clouds piled against a blue heaven? I like almost any sky
mood, blue or gray or buttermilk-spattered. It's wonderful to watch
the change as you drive home from work in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing. Do you work in heaven? I happen to like it
very much, but nothing I read or heard in my childhood mentioned
that there's a daily paper in heaven. Could it be that all of us
saints don't get the news?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of saints, I worry about them. I have known a few
saintly people, and they weren't half as much fun as some who had
slipped from sainthood. A little spice, a little malice . . . Is
that allowed? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   I recently read a book about the Roosevelt women, most of whom
were descended from Georgia's Mittie Bulloch of Roswell. Mittie was
almost too good to be true, except out of sympathy for her
Confederate kinsmen, she sneaked blankets from her Yankee husband's
family and smuggled them south. Some of her descendants were good,
as witness Eleanor Roosevelt, who was so caught up in doing for
other people she missed sitting around feeling virtuous. Then there
was Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who was probably assigned to the
gossip mill if she made it into heaven. There are many stories
about her, but one I hadn't heard was that when her grown-up
brother fell down the long staircase in her house, she sat still
and observed, ``I never liked him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta people I like a lot may not be headed for heaven, but
when the bank teller tells you to have a good Christmas, I think
she means it. Also the kid in the supermarket and the cashier at
the gas station. She doesn't speak English (do they in heaven?),
but she is cheerful and good-humored, and when she says, ``Mucho
merry to you,'' I feel warm and looked after.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't worried about the white sand and the blue water of the
Gulf of Mexico, but they're on my list of things to ask St. Peter
about if I ever get as far as the pearly gate. Train whistles and
boat whistles and dogs and cats and mockingbirds and rainy nights
and snow . . . I must ask my friend and if she doesn't have the
inside word, she should be more careful about consigning some of us
to that exalted place.

 &HT;    Christmas revelers born on this day often go to great lengths to
make sure their own nativity isn't forgotten
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's your birthday. All you want is a little special
attention from family and friends. Maybe a little party with a
cake.
</P>
<P>
   That's not asking for much _ unless the occasion comes on or
near Christmas, the most celebrated birthday in the Western world.
For those who follow the Christian tradition, it's hard not to be
overshadowed by Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christmas babies think they get the short end of the wish
list. Others, looking on the bright side, believe they are
twice-blessed. Either way, Christmas birthdays require some
celebratory improvising and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta siblings Leah and Pax Cumming(Ga.), both born Dec. 25,
always have at least two Christmas trees _ one just for birthday
presents, the other for Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty great,'' said Leah, who turns 5 today. ``I like it
because it's the same day as the baby Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah and Pax hold their birthday parties before Christmas Day so
friends and classmates can attend.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they celebrated last Friday. Leah had a North Pole
theme with Santa and a train. Pax, who's turning 13 and whose name
means ``Peace'' in Latin, had a Cosmic Bowling party later that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks sharing a birthday with Jesus and his sister is pretty
neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a lot of commotion with two birthdays. But I kind
of like it. My family makes up for it,'' Pax said. ``They make sure
they don't cheat me out on gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cumming children, Martha Marquardt of Avondale
Estates(Ga.) has learned how to get maximum mileage out of her
Christmas birthday. In midsummer, she gives herself a party to
celebrate the half-year mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Christmas in July, like the movie,'' said Marquardt, who
turns 46 today.
</P>
<P>
   She celebrates in December as well. Every year, she and her
relatives spend Christmas in the family's cabin near Blue Ridge. In
the morning, she opens Christmas presents with the rest of the
family. Later she opens some birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all my birthday presents separately, so there's a special
recognition of my birthday,'' Marquardt explains.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day she and a handful of friends walk to a secluded
waterfall in the Chattahoochee National Forest(Ga.) where they
celebrate her birthday with wine, cheese and cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very spiritual feeling,'' Marquardt says. ``It helps
me connect with where I came from and the cycle of life. I have
never felt shortchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joshua England, who turns 18 on Saturday, the day after
Christmas, does. If the Duluth resident could have one wish, it
would be to be born as far from Dec. 26 as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's kind of worn out from all the holidays. Then it's
my birthday and they don't feel like going to another party,'' he
says. ``I get presents, but they double as birthday presents. I'd
prefer separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents, grandparents and my brother are about the only
people who call me,'' he adds. ``But the rest of the family
forgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Leonard of Union City not only was born on Christmas but
was married that day too, in 1929. By necessity, she says: ``In
those days, you only had one day off from work.''
</P>
<P>
   Her late husband always made sure Leonard had two gifts under
the tree, she said. The only time she received a single present was
when he gave her the keys to a new car.
</P>
<P>
   ``On two different times I got a Karmann Ghia Since it was an
expensive gift, it was for all three occasions,'' says Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   She won't reveal how old she is today, but does admit ``I'll
never see 80 again.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's an ultimate expert on Christmas birthdays, it would
probably be Eula Mae Johnson, of Augusta(Ga.). She turns 100 today.
</P>
<P>
   A matriarch of 10 children and dozens of grandchildren always
made certain the holiday centered around her. The fact that it
happened to fall on Christmas was just an added treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any feelings about that when I was little. But
since I've been grown, I've been thankful about it being on
Christmas Day,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   She expects more than 300 friends and relatives to help her
celebrate the century mark. Festivities will continue through the
weekend, but Johnson will make certain she blows out the candles on
her cake today, not Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmama always said her birthday was the 25th, not the
24th or the 26th,'' says Joyce Clark, a granddaughter who lives in
Atlanta. ``We can't go out of town because we have to be down there
with her. But we don't mind, because we know it's such a
blessing.''

 &HT;    Wacky doctor Robin Williams shakes up routine procedures
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As likely to give your funny bone as your gag reflex a workout,
the comedy-drama ``Patch Adams'' is a mixed doctor's bag of genuine
warmth and manufactured schmaltz. It's ``Dead Poets Society'' with
lab coats instead of prep-school blazers. Instead of standing on
their desks to show solidarity with nonconformist Robin Williams,
the kids here strap on red clown noses.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps the movie from being a total groanfest is the
significance of its subject: the demoralizing experience of
hospital patients, shunted through a system that identifies them by
their diseases, not their names.
</P>
<P>
   We get a taste of this early, when Patch (Williams) commits
himself to a mental hospital, and finds the doctors more interested
in making coffee than really listening. Oddly inspired by such
indifference, Patch shakes things up in the asylum, cracking jokes
like a furry McMurphy from ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nurse Ratched of this movie is male: Walcott (Bob Gunton),
dean of the Medical College of Virginia, where Patch enrolls,
hoping to become a doctor with a difference. His goal is to heal
with humor, to build ``the first fun hospital in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Patch clowns for kids in the cancer ward. He infiltrates the
room of an old lady who won't eat (Ellen Albertini Dow, the rappin'
granny of ``The Wedding Singer'') and a terminal patient with a bad
attitude (Peter Coyote). And he woos a grim but lovely fellow
student, Carin (Monica Potter, a Julia Roberts look-alike).
</P>
<P>
   If you worry that Patch won't connect with all of them, you're
at the wrong movie. Based on facts but glossed in Hollywood
formula, the film tidies reality into familiar screenplay chunks.
Thus, we get Patch's recurrent confrontations with the tyrannical
Walcott. We watch him court Carin with ever-greater doses of charm.
He wins the respect of his by-the-numbers roommate (Philip Seymour
Hoffman). And for the finale, he makes big speeches to the faculty
about health care while adoring fellow students watch from every
seat of a jampacked assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   I lost count of how many times people stand up to applaud Patch.
You'd think the Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting'' wasn't gratifying
enough for Williams. He's verging on Kevin Costner's playing a
character whose mythical perfection verges on actorly narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he has his magic moments. With his energy, wit and
invention, he can't help being an ingratiating performer, even when
he's knee-deep in muck (as in, for example, the maudlin ``What
Dreams May Come'').
</P>
<P>
   The movie compensates for some of its over-the-top moments with
quiet scenes that get to the heart of the matter: When doctors
crowd a bedridden woman, chattering about her symptoms while
ignoring her mortification from the scrutiny, Patch asks simply,
``What's her name?''
</P>
<P>
   But in its second half, ``Patch Adams'' throws a downer of a
plot twist at us, and never really recovers its intended mixture of
humor and heart. The film is the product of writer Steve Oedekerk
and director Tom Shadyac, best known for ``Ace Ventura'' and ``The
Nutty Professor.'' That track record results in some howlingly good
laughs. But when it aims for seriousness, the movie is about as
deep as a bedpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams. Directed by Tom Shadyac. Rated PG-13
for strong language and crude humor. 1 hour, 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Think of it as ``Dead Poets Society'' in lab coats.
Another seriocomic role for Robin Williams, who needs to try
something new.

 &HT;    `Lughnasa' lame except for Streep
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you'll learn from the movie version of Brian Friel's
acclaimed play ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is how to pronounce the darn
title. It's LOO-na-sa.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you'll learn _ or relearn _ is how amazing Meryl
Streep is. Make all the accent jokes you like (the one here is
Irish), but she's still one of the most remarkable talents to
appear onscreen in the past 20 years. That, at 49, she's not
offered the array of roles available to her male counterparts is as
much our loss as hers.
</P>
<P>
   She is almost reason enough to see this well-intended yet
ultimately disappointing film. A 1992 Tony Award winner and a
mainstay of the regional theater circuit, ``Dancing at Lughnasa''
is a memory tale set in rural Donegal in 1936. Our narrator is
Michael (Darrell Johnston), the 8-year-old illegitimate son of
Christina Mundy (Catherine McCormack), youngest of the five
unmarried Mundy sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Not much happens at the home the sisters share. Kate (Streep),
the eldest, teaches at the local school. The rest _ Maggie (Kathy
Burke), Agnes (Brid Brennan), Rose (Sophie Thompson) and Christina
_ look after the house, tend Michael and make tea and soda bread.
</P>
<P>
   Things change during the fateful summer of '36, when the Mundy
household is augmented by two male presences. One is Gerry Evans
(Rhys Ifans), Michael's father. The other is the sole Mundy
brother, Jack (Michael Gambon), a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the nearby hills, the Celtic harvest festival of
Lughnasa is being celebrated. Its pagan bonfires and
pulse-quickening music are like a challenge to the Mundys to
abandon the straight and narrow path their spinsterhood has led
them down and embrace life's passions.
</P>
<P>
   Minus the enticing theatricality of the stage, the flaws in
Friel's script become appallingly clear. The Mundys are something
of a bore: Each sister exists as cliche. Further, Friel's thematic
face-off between heathen and Christian spirits is handled without
subtlety or depth.
</P>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor's approach becomes claustrophobically
predictable. Something happens _ Gerry arrives or Rose disappears _
and he cuts to one sister's face. Then the next. Then the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ifans is a disaster as Gerry _ horse-faced and charmless in a
role that asks little more than that the actor be a handsome,
charismatic rogue. Conversely, the infallible Gambon is effectively
addled as the prodigal brother, awash in his dreams of Africa. As
for the non-Streep sisters, each has her moments, but none ever
engages us fully.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, whatever's worth having in this movie belongs to its
star. You almost wish someone had persuaded Friel to change his
play, toss out the other Mundys and concentrate on Kate. As it is,
``Dancing at Lughnasa'' makes for little more than a discouraging
night out with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep. Directed by Pat O'Connor. Rated PG for
mild sexual talk. At Tara. 1 hour, 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Like watching a collective sibling hot flash, but
Streep almost makes it worth it.

 &HT;    `Delta' delves deeply into matters of the heart
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' doesn't really get down to business until
it actually gets down to the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 minutes or so, which take place in Chicago's
Cabrini Green housing project, come off pretty much like the
stilted exposition they are. The scenes serve merely to introduce
us to druggy, irresponsible, chronically unemployed Loretta (Alfre
Woodard) and her two children: preadolescent Thomas (Mpho Koaho),
who's trying to be a decent kid despite his surroundings, and
little Tracy (Kulani Hassen), who is severely autistic.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with drive-by shootings, drug dealers and her daughter's
general uselessness, Loretta's rock-solid mom, Rosa Lynn (Mary
Alice), pawns the family's one valuable possession _ an antique
candelabra named Nathan (the explanation comes later) _ and buys
them bus tickets south. She's sending them to spend the summer with
her brother, Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), and his wife, Annie (Esther
Rolle, in her last role), in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for a big-city girl, an altogether alien world. And
because Annie has Alzheimer's disease and Earl is busy running his
chicken restaurant, circumstances dictate that Loretta will have to
either put up or shut up, grow up or give up.
</P>
<P>
   The family's rebirth becomes the movie's rebirth as well. ``Down
in the Delta'' is a warm, funny, utterly engaging film, firmly
anchored by standout performances by Woodard and Freeman (plus,
it's good to see Wesley Snipes _ as Earl's son Will _ back flexing
his acting muscles instead of the other kind).
</P>
<P>
   The director is celebrated poet Maya Angelou. While she
shouldn't give up her day job, her natural empathy for all things
human translates well into another medium. The picture has its
preachy moments as well as its treacly ones, but its sense of
family matters, and why family matters, is sure and strong. And
while the legacy of Nathan is specific to the African-American
experience, it remains a haunting reminder for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by Maya
Angelou. Rated PG-13 for language and drug references. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Sometimes you can go home again, even if you've
never been there before.

INDIGENOUS CHILDREN OF SOUTHERN MEXICO SUFFER FROM MALNUTRITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Dec. 27) 
(See optional trim) 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TLAHUITOLTEPEC, Mexico _ Malnutrition stalks the children of
southern Mexico's highlands, killing some, stunting the physical
and mental growth of many others, robbing almost all of a future.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, more than one-fourth of Mexico's 95 million
people suffer from some level of malnutrition. But experts say the
malady falls with particular wrath upon the children of the
southern states of Chiapas, Guerrero and Oaxaca, whose large
indigenous and rural populations remain mired in poverty, isolation
and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with social discrimination,'' says Adolfo
Chavez, a physician and investigator with the government's National
Nutrition Institute in Mexico City. ``Society remains deaf to the
problems of the indigenous people, to the problems of the
countryside, to the problems of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   People in rural southern Mexico have long had it tougher than
their countrymen in the more prosperous cities and the North. But
Chavez and other investigators say the disparity has been widened
in recent years by policies that favor industrial exports from
northern cities _ embodied in the 5-year-old North American Free
Trade Agreement _ at the expense of the 28 million Mexicans who
still depend on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas in the South that have deteriorated badly,''
says Abelardo Avila, a surgeon and sociologist working for the
nutrition institute in Oaxaca. ``The gap between the North and the
South is great and getting greater.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators cite a government-sponsored survey from
several years ago that found that some 70 percent of people in
rural communities in the South suffer some level of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   While few, if any, Mexicans actually starve to death as in a
famine, malnutrition levels in some Indian communities of the South
rival those of Africa's hungriest areas, Chavez says.
</P>
<P>
   Children's bellies swell, and their skin bloats, signs of acute
starvation. Minds grow addled for want of nutrients, bones fail to
develop, hair bleaches, and eyes go bad. Too many toddlers never
see their fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many children die here,'' says Alicia Estrada, a nurse and
Roman Catholic nun who runs a church center that houses and feeds
about two dozen severely malnourished children in Tlahuitoltepec
(pronounced Tlah-wee-to-el-teh-peck), a Mixe Indian town in the
frigid, fog-shrouded mountains of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``They die because of the parasites,'' Estrada says, ``because
of lack of nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeding center in Tlahuitoltepec, a muddy hillside community
of 7,000, was founded 30 years ago to save the most desperately
malnourished children in the area from certain starvation, Estrada
says.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with a little money provided by the church, the
government and private aid organizations, the center provides beds
and three meals a day to children ranging from infants in cribs to
youths on the brink of puberty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catalina Hernandez, a stunted 8-year-old with a shy but engaging
smile, came to live at the center as a toddler, following several
older brothers and sisters who had also flirted with an early
death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite six years of solid meals at the church, Catalina's
health remains fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll stay as long as is necessary,'' Estrada says, pulling
down the bottom lid in Catalina's eye to reveal an off color that
the nun says reflects a level of illness. ``She's still not well,
and it will get worse if she goes home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Estrada's center cares for the hardest luck cases,
teachers at the primary school run by the Catholic Church around
the corner say that 80 percent of their young students suffer from
malnutrition. Almost every one of their students, the teachers say,
come to school hungry each morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic workers, whose funding is due to run out within a
few months, give the school's 600 children beans and bread for
breakfast and sandwiches for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and other officials working throughout the Mixe
highlands say the lack of nutrition is most noticeable in the
schools. Malnourished children fail to learn, they fall asleep in
class, their minds wander.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examinations found that 65 percent of the 1,130 Mixe
children enrolled in boarding schools run by the government's
National Indigenous Institute were malnourished, says Amado Miguel
Mejia, a doctor at the indigenous institute's Mixe regional office
in the village of San Pedro Y San Pablo Ayutla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kids who are 10 years old and haven't passed the
second grade,'' he says. ``Eighty percent of the kids (in the
boarding schools) have failing grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of rural southern Mexico survives on a daily diet of corn
tortillas and beans. Potatoes and vegetables become available
around harvest time but often are sold to buy clothes and other
necessities. Although villagers eat turkey at festivals, meat of
any kind usually is rare.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is worse still in Tlahuitoltepec, where poor farm
land and a chilly climate have limited harvest to once a year and
where people survive on wild herbs and the leaves of potato plants
for long stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beans are a luxury there,'' says Martha Garzafox, the Catholic
nun who founded the Tlahuitoltepec feeding program three decades
ago and was transferred by the church to a nearby town last summer.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 24 million Mexicans suffer some level of
malnutrition, according to government figures. Serious hunger in
Mexico tracks the astonishing gap between incomes in the cities and
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rural problem,'' Avila says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, per capita income in Oaxaca's capital city, also
called Oaxaca, stands at $7,080. That is almost equal to the per
capita earnings in Monterrey, northern Mexico's largest and most
prosperous city.
</P>
<P>
   But per capita income statewide in Oaxaca reached just $1,600 in
1996, according to Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. Earnings remain
far lower in the countryside, where 70 percent of the state's
people live.

GOT PLANS FOR DEC. 31, 1999?
</HEADLINE>

By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR; T &LR; he biggest night in 1,000 years is coming.
</P>
<P>
   We are marching inexorably closer and closer to Y2K, and that
means loading up on provisions, fixing the worldwide computer
glitch, being sure we have cash on hand ... and planning the
biggest bash this century.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 369 days left until many of the world's
inhabitants begin the final countdown to 2000, culminating at the
stroke of midnight with popping champagne corks, showers of bubbly,
crackling fireworks, sloppy kisses and group hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know where you'll be?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's serious about celebrating has already started
preparing for the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate fetes are in the works around the globe. Egypt will
host a five-day music festival near the base of the Sphinx. In
Greenwich, England, home of the prime meridian, they're building a
giant dome that will house multiple exhibitions looking back on the
last 1,000 years. The French have installed a giant clock on the
Eiffel Tower that's already begun the countdown. Rome has some 700
construction projects under way, several hundred of them preparing
for the Jubilee, the Catholic Church's celebration of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will host a
party for as many as 100,000 people, replete with fireworks, laser
light shows and multi-ethnic entertainers who will conjure up a
Super Bowl-style half-time show of Olympic opening-ceremony
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the private affairs around Southern California
that are sure to test the parking capacity in some residential
neighborhoods. Jeff Bennett, for one, is planning on doing more
than buying a few funny hats and noisemakers. The pet food company
owner has budgeted more than $1 million for a New Year's bash in
his Corona home.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have dancers in costume and food that was popular during
various periods of the 20th century. He'll turn his entryway into a
jet airplane so visitors can feel like they are traveling back in
time. His 600-plus guests can expect to get a pre-invitation in the
mail soon _ a clock counting down the days, minutes and seconds to
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' said Bennett, who's handed
over the reigns to Bob Gail &AMP; It's the Main Event party &UR;  &LR; planners.
``I'm never going to see another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Champagne and sparkling-wine producers are hoping you, too, will
throw the party of your life and stock up on bottles of bubbly. But
warnings about a widespread champagne shortage are not completely
accurate, said Bernard Gantner, &UR;  &LR; director of millennium and trade
relations for the makers of Moet, Chandon and Dom Perignon
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible that merchants will mark up the prices and
some high-end cuvees may sell out by mid-1999, you're unlikely to
find all the wine-store shelves empty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``We have all indications that even people who normally
stay home quietly are going to do something different,'' Gantner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, even though we're bracing for a new millennium, some
things will remain the same. Dick Clark, seemingly impervious to
the passing of time, assures us he'll be shivering and grinning
from his usual spot in New York's Times Square as he leads the
crowd in the countdown to 2000, just like's he's done for the past
27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Will he call it quits in the next millennium? Not as long as he
can help it, Clark says. His contract with ABC runs though 2000,
and it will likely be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Clark will see you through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, when ``Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'' signs
off, Clark and his wife have a couple of beers at a Manhattan bar
before boarding a flight the next morning back to Los Angeles. But
in 2000, ABC will likely extend the broadcast into the wee hours of
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   After that, ``I'll probably just go home and go to bed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're short on ideas but not short on cash, here are some
major events being planned for New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ARRIVE EARLY, STAY LATE: Getting to the party first may be a
faux pas in some circles, but among millennium enthusiasts _ and
cities and countries trying to cash in on tourism dollars the
millennium stands to bring _ it's the thing to do. Lubec, Maine,
boasts on the Internet that it's the easternmost point on the U.S.
mainland _ and hence the first to claim the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the clock hands actually strike midnight first? On
the specks of land that make up the plucky Republic of Kiribati,
more than 1,300 miles southwest of Honolulu. A few years ago, the
country officially moved the date line that intersected the islands
30 degrees to the east, hence bringing all of its islands into the
same time zone _ and the same day.
</P>
<P>
   That ensured it will be the first inhabited place to ring in the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The first place the sun will rise when the calendar reads Jan.
1, however, is the uninhabited Balleny Islands in Antarctica,
according to the Royal Greenwich Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   And the first inhabited place that will see the sun that day is
tiny Pitt Island (population 55), part of the Chathams, 467 miles
east of the New Zealand mainland.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hotels, however, on this island of fishermen and
shepherds. Visitors will have to stay 13 miles away on the main
island of Chatham (population 700), which features exactly one pub
in which to revel. Forget booking a last-minute room there. The
island's only hotel has a maximum occupancy of 24.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING HOME, BUT NOT ON THE COUCH: Four years ago, Mark Poncher
had a vision _ turn Los Angeles into the party place to be on Dec.
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been anything really wonderful to do in L.A.
on New Year's Eve,'' Poncher said. ``We want to create a signature
event for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Millennium Show, which has a proposed budget of
$10 million to $11 million, will feature several hundred drill team
performers, both professionals and local children, and big-name
celebrities who are yet to be announced, said Poncher, who formed
the Turn of the Millennium Corp. to plan the event, slated for the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A street fair with food vendors, entertainment and booths of
corporate sponsors will be held in Exposition Park preceding the
1{-hour show, which will be broken into three segments: ``Falling
Into the Future,'' featuring ``Jetsons''-type images of the future
seen through the eyes of the past; ``Time Explosion,'' a look at
dress and transportation of the 20th century; and ``Brotherhood,''
a celebration of multiculturalism that will feature performers from
21 Los Angeles ethnic groups. VIPs and sponsors will be treated to
private parties on site.
</P>
<P>
   The finale will be a fireworks and laser show.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will cost between $40 and $50, Poncher said. They'll go
on sale in the spring through Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department has pledged $100,000
in cash and in-kind services to each of nine regional arts councils
for family-oriented street festivals or other community
celebrations. A jury of Cultural Affairs staff and community
representatives will review proposals for celebrations and decide
in January what form they will take, said Eve Rappoport, manager of
community relations for the Cultural Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is up to the producers to see what makes sense for these
communities,'' Rappoport said. ``It's a way to bring people
together in these regions.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SQUARE, THE STRIP AND THE BIG BAND: In New York and Las
Vegas, plans are under way for what are being billed as the largest
fireworks displays in history.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacles have a budget of $1.5 million to $2 million each
_ and that's not including the police and related services the
cities are expected to kick in, said Philip Butler, who will
produce both shows for Fireworks by Grucci, a company based on New
York's Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, fireworks will be set off from 10 locations,
blanketing Manhattan under an umbrella of light at the stroke of
midnight. A similar plan is in the works for Vegas' Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object will be to light up the Strip and truly make the
stars come down to Earth,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight- to 12-minute show, called ``The Manhattan Project''
in both cities, will be set to music, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels on Las Vegas' Strip are already taking reservations
for New Year's Eve, 1999; others will wait until early next year.
The Las Vegas Hilton reports it's already sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see significantly higher prices. For New Year's 1999,
hotel-casinos along the Strip are typically requiring guests to
book three- or four-night stays for a total of more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big increase over this New Year's Eve's hotel rates,
which range from about $289 to $329 on New Year's Eve and less on
the days before and after.
</P>
<P>
   At least you'll have less money to lose gambling.
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING HOLIDAY TRAFFIC: The prestigious tour company
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent started selling Y2K packages in the summer of
1996, and demand has been growing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be somewhere exotic, with a sense of historical
significance,'' said Christa Brantsch, director of public relations
for the tour company.
</P>
<P>
   When the original 14 escorted group tours sold out, they added
43 more packages. Even though you may want to reserve your spot
now, you'll do so without knowing how much it costs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices won't be set until around June of next year, because tour
companies don't yet know what airlines, hotels and others will
charge them, Brantsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Where can you go? Spend New Year's Eve partying in sight of the
Taj Mahal. (Sorry, local officials won't allow a party inside.) You
can welcome the new millennium where little has changed since this
one began _ inside a Bedouin banquet tent in the lost city of
Petra, Jordan, or spend it in Kenya sipping cocktails in a ``luxury
tented camp.''
</P>
<P>
   You can travel to Vienna, where you'll ring in the New Year at a
gala ball in the Imperial Hotel, or take a cruise to Antarctica and
celebrate within sight of the most desolate continent.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular destination is Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca
capital in Peru, said Carol Snyder, public relations manager of
Maupintour.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU`RE TIRED OF `AULD LANG SYNE': In an undisclosed location
in the desert outside of Palm Springs, witches, free-thinkers,
shamans and other followers of pagan religions are planning the
``world's largest chanting circle.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid trouble with the federal government, organizers are
keeping the event low-key until closer to the date. But they're
still hoping to draw 1 million people to the three-day event,
``Prelude to the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Louis Farrakhan had no problem drawing 1 million
people to his event in Washington, D.C,'' said David ``Thor''
Francis of Bellevue, Wash., ``I'll have no problem drawing 1
million to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day, Tibetan monks and other religious leaders will
walk the perimeter of a circle that will encompass about nine acres
to bless it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That actually will energize the circle,'' Francis said. ``We
will consider the ground under it sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis says he has been approached by corporations interested
in sponsoring the event but so far has refused their offers because
he doesn't want to be beholden to peddling their products. He's
financing most of it from the salary he makes working as a building
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the spiritual Woodstock,'' Davis said. ``The
idea is that Woodstock wasn't so much about the music but the
experience. We're going to be having a chant written for this
event, a magical incantation to bring about global peace, unity,
understanding and religious tolerance.''

   ALL DRESSED UP BUT NOWHERE TO GO BUT CYBERSPACE: Check out New
Year's Eve Parties 2000 on the Web
(www.jepa.co.uk/scripts/2000.html), a registry where dozens of
people around the world have posted invites to all the world's
people. Ten guys somewhere in ``the middle of Germany'' are
inviting all pretty girls to the Ultimate Girls Party 2000 if they
send a picture. The boys claim already to have gotten 217
snapshots. That means there's space for 1,783 women.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS FOR THE ANTISOCIAL: Maybe you don't have the money for a
gala ball or luxury cruise. Maybe you have kids and know baby
sitters will be scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not do anything for the year 2000,'' said Elba Robbins,
45, of Calabasas. ``Everything will be three times the price or too
crowded, so we'll stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins appears to be in good company. Lots of people confess
they don't have plans _ and don't want to make plans _ for the
giant countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Said Alex Rubenstein, 13, of Sherman Oaks: ``We're going to do
the same thing we do every year _ nothing. We'll watch Dick
Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for those of you who haven't penciled in anything special
for the big night, not to worry. Just spoil the fun by reminding
everyone that the new millennium really begins Jan. 1, 2001, and
you're already making fabulous plans. &QL;

   ISRAEL-GENERAL (Jerusalem) _ Thirty-six years after he joined
the army, Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak turned in his uniform today and
plunged into civilian life in a peculiar role, dubbed by the media
here as ``the great white hope'' of Israeli politics. Shahak, 54,
did not announce his candidacy for prime minister. He voiced no
political opinion beyond a call for ``togetherness.'' But, even as
he tiptoed, Shahak, a silent shadow over the electoral aspirations
of both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak, finally stepped today into the fray. By Deborah
Sontag.

   CHINA-ASSESS (Beijing) _ A news analysis: Just in case anyone
here missed the point, the state-run media have given rare
publicity to the severe sentences dealt to three prominent leaders
of an alternative political party. Most Chinese had never heard of
Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai _ and for months the local
news media had totally ignored their efforts to form a China
Democracy Party. But in reporting the sentences the the press sent
a clear message to any would-be dissidents. And now, after a
draining week of shock and despair, those who worked openly to
promote the new party _ by some estimates, numbering as many as 200
_ are pondering the next steps for the dissident movement, and for
themselves. By Erik Eckholm.

   CIVIL-LAW-SCHOOLS (Washington) _ Jonathan Harr's 1995
best-seller ``A Civil Action'' tells the true story of a battle
between a bold but flawed plaintiffs' lawyer named Jan Schlichtmann
and two big corporations over whether they polluted the drinking
water of Woburn, Mass. In the movie that is opening in theaters
now, John Travolta portrays Schlichtmann as, if anything, bolder
and more flawed. But in Professor Lewis A. Grossman's class at
American University's law school here _ and at law schools across
the country _ Schlichtmann is already a star, foibles and all. The
book is playing an extraordinary role in what some legal educators
describe as a movement to modernize the training of lawyers in
America. Across the country, ``A Civil Action'' is required reading

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  TLAHUITOLTEPEC, Mexico: state's people live. 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problems of the Mixe mirror those haunting most of the
Mexican peasant farmers and nearly all of its indigenous
communities: too little land for too many people, poor soil and,
even worse, low crop prices, few good roads to get products to
market, and little private or government investment.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow two-lane highway climbs into the Mixe highlands from
the Mitla, site of an ancient Zapotec Indian village whose ruins
have become a major attraction for the tourists who flock to
Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   Although paved less than a decade ago, the road is riddled with
deep potholes. Mudslides are constant in the rainy season. Large
trees and boulders tumble onto the pavement from the ridges above.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers shiver in the bone-chilling cold along the highway.
New satellite dishes sit incongruously atop crumbling tile-roofed
adobe shacks, evidence of money sent back from family members who
have left for work in Mexico's cities or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest problems are health, education, nutrition and
production,'' says Benito Clara, the director of the indigenous
institute in Ayutla. ``The Mixe still must scream for the (national
political) leaders to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many (government) programs, but they never get
finished,'' complains Clara, as he goes over the books for one
program in the damp library of the Institute's regional
headquarters. ``There is no effort for institutional coordination.
Planning isn't a problem of the (Indian) communities, it's a
failing of the Mexican state.''
</P>
<P>
   Without immediate attention, the problem can only grow worse,
because the poorest families give birth to 75 percent of Mexico's
children, says Chavez, the physician with the the government's
National Nutrition Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Mixtec Indians farther to the west in Oaxaca, who
have traveled to jobs in northern Mexico and California for
decades, the Mixe farmers have only recently joined the mass
migration that defines much of rural Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most malnourished areas are also (those) where migration,
either to elsewhere in Mexico or to the United States, has been the
least,'' Chavez says. ``Those who (do) leave are the best fed, the
most ambitious people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poorest people stay,'' he says. ``(So) in the communities
there is a regressive selection.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of children who die of malnutrition in Mexico remains
open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   In Oaxaca, just 5 percent of the children younger than 5 who
died in 1995 succumbed to ``nutritional deficiencies,'' according
to the Mexican government's census agency. But Chavez and other
nutrition specialists say malnutrition contributes significantly in
six out of every 10 cases of infants who die of prenatal
conditions, congenital defects, pneumonia, flu and intestinal
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 infants younger than 1 died of all causes in
Tlahuitoltepec in 1995 and nine in 1996, the census agency reports.
But such numbers reflect long-standing traditions by which
children's births and deaths are often not reported to the
government, Chavez and other experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Because an infant's chances of survival are considered iffy at
best, the experts say, many indigenous parents don't register their
children until they enter school at age 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its severity, Mexico's rural malnutrition problem has a
relatively easy and inexpensive solution, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-month-old pilot program in an Otomi Indian village north of
Mexico City that provides residents with tortilla corn meal
fortified with soya and vitamins has brought remarkable
improvements in nutrition and overall health, Chavez says.
</P>
<P>
   The fortified tortillas consumed by villagers in El Rincon have
strengthened pregnant mothers and dramatically increased children's
growth and motor skills, according to a study conducted by Chavez,
who devised the project along with professor George Bates of Texas
A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The program costs about 15 cents per family per day, Chavez
says. Despite praise from Mexican health officials, it has yet to
be implemented on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   The fortified tortilla program can be put in place across Mexico
for as little as $100 million a year, Chavez estimates, adding,
``This is probably what people in Mexico spend on their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem of money,'' he said. ``It is simply a
problem of giving (malnutrition) priority. There have always been
badly chosen programs, in terms of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is one of regional development,'' he says. ``The
next generation (in the southern mountains) will all have to
migrate because there is not even interest in solving the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old idea of (economic) development is being erased from
the conversation,'' he says.

 &HT;    Ambitious, witty romp finds Bard acting in his own plots, with a
dynamite cast
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stage love will never be true love,'' says Viola De Lesseps
(Gwyneth Paltrow), a young noblewoman who believes that the ban
keeping women off the Elizabethan stage keeps theater from ever
reaching true emotional heights. Little does she know that reality
and theatricality are about to collide, becoming nigh impossible to
separate.
</P>
<P>
   The witty, breathless ``Shakespeare in Love'' suggests that the
young playwright (Joseph Fiennes) wrote ``Romeo and Juliet'' on the
fly, inspired by his own star-crossed love affair with Viola. The
movie presents a 16th-century London where Will's daily life is
packed with some of his more exaggerated plot devices, including
forbidden love, cross-dressing disguises, scheming maids, fierce
duels and even the occasional appearance of a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   This Shakespeare isn't the remote and laureled Bard of the
lecture hall. He's a struggling writer with ink-stained fingers,
bills to pay and a running rivalry with playwright Christopher
Marlowe (Rupert Everett), whose ``Faust'' is spouted by all young
actors at auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Genius or not, Will also has the vital libido of any young man,
so he can't help falling for the swanlike Viola when he crashes a
party at her family's estate. She feels the same for him. But Will
has an estranged wife in another town, and Viola herself is engaged
to the blunt Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), who sees her strictly as
his property. (``Is she fertile?'' he asks her parents when
negotiating the marriage terms.)
</P>
<P>
   Little does Will know that flaxen-haired Viola is also the young
man he's cast as the male lead in his new, unfinished play, ``Romeo
and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.'' Yes, that's right. An aspiring
actress, Viola binds her breasts and glues on fake facial hair to
get the role.
</P>
<P>
   There's a wonderful scene when ``he'' listens to Will rhapsodize
about the woman he loves; Viola can't help balking at the way
Will's romantic mind transforms her into an impossibly perfect
creature.
</P>
<P>
   The scene gets to what's most interesting about the movie: its
awareness that people fall in love with love itself, as much as
with the person they adore. It's the exalted, heady feeling of
infatuation that's captured in romantic tragedies like, naturally,
``Romeo and Juliet,'' as well as in comic romps such as ``Twelfth
Night'' or, well, this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Madden (``Mrs. Brown'') at a lively pace,
``Shakespeare in Love'' revels in sly contemporary touches.
``Follow that boat,'' Will commands a ferry captain, because
taxicabs won't appear in London for several more centuries. Even if
you're not a Shakespeare buff, you'll enjoy the ways the script
puts his famous lines into the mouths of Will's friends and
neighbors. (``I say a plague on both their houses,'' someone yells,
but he's talking about two rival theaters, not the fictional
Capulets and Montagues.)
</P>
<P>
   Building a small specialty at British roles, Paltrow can come
off at times as too studied, actressy; you can feel her working at
it. But she has the poise and luminescence the part needs. She's
nicely matched by Fiennes' puppyish, lovestruck Bard. Then there's
the supporting cast, almost overwhelming in its talent: Geoffrey
Rush as a beleaguered theater owner, Simon Callow as the queen's
master of ceremonies, Imelda Staunton as Viola's maid, Judi Dench
as a ghastly, stern Elizabeth I, and Ben Affleck as a swaggering
actor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's only weakness is an unexpected one: At times, its
cleverness can be almost distracting. The script is by Marc Norman
and, more tellingly, playwright Tom Stoppard, who began his career
deconstructing Shakespeare in ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead.'' Like other Stoppard works, the movie dazzles in its
wordplay and wit, but there's something cold at its heart. It can
feel like the showoff thesis of a prized lit student.
</P>
<P>
   While Viola tries to prove that stage love can seem real, the
movie she's in never quite pulls off the same stunt. It's too much
about playacting to really move our emotions the way it intends to.
Even so, like some of Shakespeare's own, unclassifiable plays that
bounce between comedy and tragedy, it's a wonderful mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
Directed by John Madden. Rated R for nudity and sexuality. Two
hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: In this clever, literate romp, William Shakespeare
finds himself living a plot as elaborate as his giddiest comedies.
</P>

 &HT;    Roberts, Sarandon elevate mawkish to moving
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tangled emotional issues of stepfamily dynamics are a
terrific subject and one rarely tackled by Hollywood _ unless you
count ``Cinderella.'' And in ``Stepmom,'' director Chris Columbus'
holiday comedy/weepy, when the immensely talented and appealing
leads, Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts, go toe to toe, the results
are funny, feisty and often achingly accurate. These are ``gotcha
last'' scenes done to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon plays Jackie, a bona fide supermom who gave up a
high-powered editing career to stay home and sew Halloween costumes
for preteen Anna (Jena Malone) and her little brother, Ben (Liam
Aiken). Jackie's ex, Luke (Ed Harris, trying not to look
emasculated in a badly written role), has fallen for lithesome
Isabel (Roberts), a Manhattan fashion photographer. His kids
haven't. Their steady loathing is countered by Isabel's ready
admission that she's unprepared to be anyone's mother, let alone a
surrogate constantly compared to a paragon like Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, abandoned by a longtime spouse and threatened,
consciously or not, by a younger, prettier replacement, Jackie
turns everyday parenting into a combo of art form and subtle
assault.
</P>
<P>
   But then director Columbus cops out. Instead of hanging in there
with these people and letting us see how they're going to work it
all out, the movie hands Sarandon a Disease. From there, things get
less challenging and more conventional.
</P>
<P>
   The movie never entirely relinquishes its hold on us, because
the leads are so very good. So good that they make simplistic
answers to complex questions seem perfectly acceptable. So good
that you forgive the script's (five screenwriters, a troubling
sign) cat-fight undertones and the overbearing, time-to-cry-now
soundtrack. So good that you go with the movie emotionally even as,
intellectually, you reject its mawkish manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   They're not good enough, however, to cover the movie's one
gaping hole. Namely, where's Daddy? Much lip service is paid to
Luke's devotion to his kids. Yet he's the one out of town on his
custodial weekends, leaving Isabel to inevitably screw things up on
her own. And he's not the one who has to risk his job in order to
leave in the middle of the day to pick up the chldren at school.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus doesn't like working mothers _ remember Sally Field in
his ``Mrs. Doubtfire''? And while he's certainly entitled to his
point of view, it weakens his take on this particular material in
that it encourages him to shy away from basic, hard-to-resolve
issues. Conversely, to his credit, he honors the traditional mother
beautifully. There is nothing cliched or condescending about
Sarandon; rather, she glows with vitality and humor _ and, on
occasion, a refreshing bitchiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' is like a lot of stepmoms. It may not be the real
thing, but it tries its darnedest to look after those who've been
left in its care. Check your brain. Take your hankie.

<P>
   ``Stepmom''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed
by Chris Columbus. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. At

by the two stars.

 &HT;    The `Little Voice' that got away
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks is pretty much the whole show in
``Little Voice.'' And what a show she is _ a gifted mimic who can
knock out tone-perfect impersonations of everyone from Shirley
Bassey and Marilyn Monroe to Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't up to her speed.
Based on a London stage hit tailored for Horrocks, ``Little Voice''
onscreen is a fairly feeble show-biz fable. Not stupid or
offensive, just not much of anything when Horrocks isn't doing her
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks plays LV (short for Little Voice), a painfully
introverted working-class waif who barely speaks above a whisper.
Except, that is, in the privacy of her room, where she communes
with the spirit of her beloved dead father and belts out the
aforementioned imitations.
</P>
<P>
   One night her blowzy mom (Brenda Blethyn from ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies'') brings home her latest ``beau'' (Michael Caine). He's a
seedy, bottom-feeding talent agent who hears LV doing her voices
and realizes she's the chance he's been waiting for his entire
career. One slight problem: how to get this reclusive phenom out of
her room and onto a stage.
</P>
<P>
   There are some affecting aspects to the film. Caine's attempts
to woo LV with his own tattered dreams of making it big are oddly
touching. Blethyn has a fine time tearing around like an ``AbFab''
reject. And Ewan McGregor brings an uncomplicated sweetness to the
role of a telephone installer who's more interested in LV herself
than her impersonations. (He played a similar role in director Mark
Herman's ``Brassed Off.'')
</P>
<P>
   The movie as a whole comes off as something of a hollow showcase
for a heck of a novelty act _ like creating an entire movie around
a ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch (not that anyone would do
something like that . . .). But Horrocks alone may make it worth
your time. She's a transcendent talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
Directed by Mark Herman. Rated R for language and brief nudity.
Tara. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Sings when Horrocks sings; doesn't when she
doesn't.

 &HT;    It's not too late to catch your holiday favorites
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say that your favorite holiday film is 1983's ``A Christmas
Story.'' You know, the one with little Peter Billingsley pining for
a Red Ryder BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   And say, it being Christmas Day and all, you want to watch it.
What do you do? Turn on the television.
</P>
<P>
   TNT is in the midst of a ``Christmas Story'' marathon, airing
the film again and again and again until 8 tonight, when, suddenly,
what in your wondering eyes should appear but ``How the Grinch
Stole Christmas: Special Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of great holiday viewing available today.
Probably too much for any holiday-obsessed couch potato to absorb
it all. What follows is a guide to the best.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The mother of all Christmas flicks: Zuzu's petals come into
play for the third time this season with NBC's final airing this
year of 1946's ``It's a Wonderful Life'' (8 tonight ).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Something merry and bright: 1942's ``Holiday Inn'' (11:30 a.m.
on AMC ) features the Oscar-winning ``White Christmas'' warbled by
Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  God bless this one: The most critically acclaimed version of
``A Christmas Carol'' is the 1951 vehicle (2:30 p.m. on AMC )
starring Alastair Sim and airing in glorious black-and-white.
Viewers with younger kids have permission to flip to ``The Muppet
Christmas Carol'' (4 p.m. on Disney ) or to ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas
Carol'' (5 p.m. on PaxNet ).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It's not just Christmas: ``Harambee Kwanzaa'' (8 p.m. on BET )
explores the African-American holiday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That family on the hill: TNN celebrates with ``The Waltons,''
including ``The Best Christmas'' episode at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tunes worth hearing: Great holiday music shows include
``Carols From Atlanta: The 70th Anniversary Morehouse-Spelman
Christmas Carol Concert'' (7 a.m. on WGTV ), ``Jessye Norman: A
Holiday Homecoming'' (8 a.m. on WGTV and 8:30 p.m. on WPBA ),
``Gospel Tabernacle Christmas Special'' (9 a.m. on WATL ),
``Atlanta Symphony: Christmas With Robert Shaw'' (9:30 a.m. on WGTV
) and ``Holiday Music Videos'' (9:30 a.m. on VH1 ).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visions of sugarplums: ``Christmas at Biltmore Estate'' (11
a.m. on HGTV ) and ``White House Christmas'' (1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on
HGTV ).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Very merry marketing: This year's ``Very Merry Christmas
Parade'' touting everything Disney starts at 10 a.m. on ABC .

GETTING A LEG UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They have proportionally long legs, perpetual
smiles and sparkly outfits for any occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Turn plastic into flesh and there is very little difference
between a Barbie doll and a member of America's most popular
precision dance troupe, the Rockettes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in faux eyelashes, a sequined jacket and kicking so high
that her ankles reach her ears, or dressed in nondescript civilian
garb while running mundane errands, a Rockette is a Rockette during
every waking moment.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Coleman, so perky she probably dots the ``i'' in her name
with a smiley face, has been on the team for five years and likes
everything that goes along with the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a great job, I will do it as long as I can keep
kicking,'' said the Studio City resident. ``It's great being a
world-famous eye-high-kicking Rockette.''
</P>
<P>
   World-famous, eye-high-kicking Rockette. Coleman repeats this
mantra several times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she believes in the Rockettes _ and all that it stands for.
Maybe more precisely, she has to believe in it, because being a
Rockette isn't work for wimps. These leggy dancers do more after 8
p.m. than most people do in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman goes through nine costume changes, including one polar
bear suit, and performs in 10 dance numbers during a two-hour show.
Some days, she has to do three shows, and the only way to prevent
flat-out exhaustion is plenty of coffee beans and an occasional
catnap in a sleeping bag laid out on the dressing-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockettes, and the rest of ``The Radio City Christmas
Spectacular,'' will continue tapping and kicking through Tuesday at
the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles doesn't have a lot of holiday spirit,'' said
Coleman, who grew up in Oklahoma City. ``Christmas isn't as big of
a deal here as it is in other places. It's great that we were able
to bring the `Spectaular' here and help everyone get in the holiday
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   And many Rockettes take that mission seriously, spreading peace
on Earth, good will toward men and the gospel of Rockette both on
and off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tree-lightings and other public appearances are a big part of a
willing Rockette's job. Some prefer simply to dance, while others
enjoy the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year there are a lot of public events,'' said
David Nash, the show's producer. ``And the Rockettes are in great
demand. They promote the wholesomeness of the time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising a family with five adopted and two biological
children with their Christmas wish of nine tickets to ``The Radio
City Christmas Spectacular'' on the ``Leeza'' show fits right into
that wholesome category.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day,Coleman was out and about by 9 a.m., and to the
``Leeza'' show about two hours later to do this good deed.
</P>
<P>
   Her first stop: the amphitheater dressing room to transform
herself. Giant faux eyelashes were attached, red lipstick was
applied, and a red sequined outfit trimmed with snow-white feathers
and a matching Santa hat were carefully slipped on.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting her turn to step on stage, Coleman sent off
letters, cards, resumes and glossy photos of herself to casting
directors and other Hollywood types, wishing them season's
greetings and inviting them to the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about networking,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, being a Rockette _ world-famous, eye-high kicks
and all _ isn't the final destination in Coleman's career plans.
She wants to break into acting.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a long shot, given the Rockette track record. There
have been no breakout stars from the first 65 years of the
Rockettes. But Coleman has some help _ she's newly married to a
screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman requested to be stationed in Los Angeles for this
holiday season to network while remaining close to family. Her home
base for the last 2{ years has been the San Fernando Valley, where
she lives with husband Art Altounian.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon isn't over by any means. They're an effervescently
happy couple who met in what could very well be the story line of a
romantic comedy. It was a Hallmark moment. Altounian and Coleman
were both shopping for birthday cards at Sav-on Drugs in Studio
City, when a simple hello turned into a 30-minute flirtation and
the realization by both that they had met their life partner; they
married in August.
</P>
<P>
   Altounian, who grew up in Glendale, had no idea his find in the
drug store aisle was a Rockette that first day. She kept that from
him until after their first date.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he couldn't be happier about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' he said. ``It's beyond great.''
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm runs in the Altounian family. His mother, who
lives in Brentwood, brought 68 people to one show and even takes
tap-dance lessons from her daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Altounian-Coleman partnership could be this Rockette's
ticket to stardom. She's about to work in a movie, ``Soul,'' that
was written by Altounian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a different agenda,'' Coleman said. ``Some go
back to school to get their degrees. Some go into becoming a makeup
artist, or photography or interior design.''
</P>
<P>
   And while they're waiting to get their next careers going, some
Rockettes just go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping themselves stocked with makeup supplies _ which the
dancers are required to buy and apply on their own _ is enough to
keep the makeup counters at malls in business.
</P>
<P>
   Too blue? Coleman pondered the tube of MAC Red lipstick in her
hands during a recent shopping trip to the Fashion Square mall in
Sherman Oaks. Rockette rules dictate that the dancers' lips be
dead-on red. A quick slick of the tester tube proved helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, this is pretty great,'' Coleman finally decided,
paying $14.61 to add the waxy wand to her makeup arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission accomplished, Coleman left for home to rest up
before heading back to the amphitheater for rehearsal, stretching,
more makeup and a show.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 p.m., more than 13 hours after she first arrived
at Universal City, Coleman's full day was over.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing that keeps Coleman coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel so good,'' she said. ``Rockettes are a part
of history, and you become a part of that. That's why it's such a
privilege and honor to be one of the world-famous eye-high-kicking
Rockettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbie couldn't say that. &QL;

`A CIVIL ACTION': LAWYER ERRS ON THE SIDE OF ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``A Civil Action,'' the self-interested lawyer played by John
Travolta gets a speeding ticket that changes his life.
</P>
<P>
   As Jan Schlichtmann, on whose bruising experiences the
best-selling book by Jonathan Harr was based, Travolta gets stopped
while racing his Porsche back to Boston from Woburn, Mass. He has
just disappointed a group of decent, aggrieved Woburn citizens
whose children were casualties of a poisoned river. A case like
that isn't worth a thing to ambulance-chasing Jan.
</P>
<P>
   But he spies some sudsy water while his car is stopped.
Intrigued, he even muddies his expensive shoes tracking the water
to its source. When he finally finds the tannery that has been
dumping evil-looking chemicals, Schlichtmann's face lights up: not
from solving the mystery, but from discovering that the factory is
linked to the deep-pocketed corporations Beatrice Foods and W.R.
Grace &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can spell J-O-H-N G-R-I-S-H-A-M can imagine the ripe
dramatic possibilities here. Maybe Schlichtmann will uncover a
billion-dollar conspiracy centering on the factory and dig to the
bottom of it, with a beautiful female colleague at his side. Or
maybe he will just change his ways, lose the suits, become a
passionate environmentalist and champion Woburn's citizenry until
the good fight is won.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this gripping, expertly acted film by Steven Zaillian
so enveloping is its avoidance of anything that easy. The story
presents both Schlichtmann and the civil court system as stubbornly
complicated. And it tells a finely nuanced tale of right, wrong and
the gray area in between.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers Zaillian's previous film, ``Searching For
Bobby Fischer,'' or his screenplay for ``Schindler's List'' will
recognize the keen, watchful intelligence he brings to this story.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Harr did on the page, the filmmaker presents
Schlichtmann as an abrasive yet affecting character and treats
everything else in the story in equally lifelike terms.
Schlichtmann's glaring mistakes become as compelling as his smart
moves, to the point where ``A Civil Action'' rings more true than
most films about the law.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian has also faced the problem of the real story's very
non-Hollywood outcome and made it slightly more palatable on
screen, without minimizing the toll the prolonged Woburn case took
on its participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' is ultimately less about winning or losing
than about the difficulty of playing a game in which
settlement-hungry lawyers gamble against tremendous odds and risk
losing their bearings in the process.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Macy, who plays the bean-counting member of
Schlichtmann's small firm so enjoyably here, even complains about
financial trouble to Kathleen Quinlan, as a somber mother whose
child fell victim to Woburn's pollution. ``How can you even begin
to compare what you've lost to what WE'VE lost?'' she snaps in
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' is very much an actor's film, with Travolta
at his best in the central role. The star captures this showboating
lawyer with that special zeal he brings to less-than-angelic
figures. (To watch Schlichtmann get upset about water spilled on
his conference table is to know a lot about the man.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet his reluctant, unanticipated decency is made very real, too.
Travolta and ``A Civil Action'' are good enough to see beyond the
particulars of one case and treat Schlichtmann as emblematic, a man
badly in need of a wake-up call. The performance is strong enough
to carry the audience along with Schlichtmann's transformation,
every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Also outstandingly deft here is Robert Duvall as Jerome Facher,
a daunting corporate lawyer who cultivates his oddball mannerisms
to Machiavellian effect. Zaillian's screenwriting, economical and
revealing, is sharp enough to announce Facher's tactics just by
watching him shred a young man who interrupts him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being a fine showcase for Duvall's wiles, the film also
elicits shrewd, first-rate performances from John Lithgow as a
judge who takes a quick dislike to Schlichtmann, James Gandolfini
as a conscience-stricken witness in the case and the director
Sydney Pollack in another of his mischievous acting turns.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Shalhoub and Zeljko Ivanek join Macy as partners dragged
along by the Schlichtmann coattails even when those coattails seem
to be headed over a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It includes profanity and implicit scenes of death.

   The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
</P>
<P>
   _Isaiah 9:2
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After hearing this scriptural reading on a recent
Sunday morning, the people of Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth
Avenue watched and applauded as a dark veil dropped to the floor,
revealing glacier-blue skies and crimson tongues of fire in a
shimmering new 22-foot-high stained-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like painting in the air with colored light,'' the donor of
the window, Robert Ryneveld, told the congregation. And the theme
of luminousness suffused the service, from the introit (``Arise,
Shine'') to the closing hymn (``I Want to Walk as a Child of the
Light'').
</P>
<P>
   It is not every day that a stained-glass window is installed in
a house of worship in New York. At Marble Collegiate, it is barely
every century. The last one, by Louis Comfort Tiffany, was
dedicated in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much newly brilliant glass to admire around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration projects have reclaimed dozens of darkened and
damaged windows by masters like Tiffany, at Congregation Shearith
Israel on the Upper West Side; John La Farge, at Judson Memorial
Church in Greenwich Village, and William Jay Bolton, at the Church
of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue is restoring
eight windows made in northern France in the late 16th century,
long before there was a St. Bartholomew's (or an Episcopal Church,
for that matter).
</P>
<P>
   Two of the windows, which were given to the church in 1953 and
placed in the auditorium, are on display in the Gallery at the
American Bible Society, Broadway and 61st Street, as part of the
exhibition ``Glory in Glass: Stained Glass in the United States,''
which runs until Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   And what better time to appreciate stained-glass windows than in
winter? They are a tonic for December's monochrome, with luscious
palettes that wash dark corners in glowing strokes of light, their
hues blending like a medley of wildflower fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, the cavernous Gothic nave of St. Ann and the Holy
Trinity on Montague Street begins to sparkle. Rays from the
clerestory windows stipple the fruits and vines of the column
capitals with purples, greens and golds. In a clearing at the west
end of this flamboyant architectural forest is a Mediterranean-blue
sky visible in the tracery web atop the 40-foot-high chancel
window, back after a four-year restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Across the East River, as the sun hits the east side of the
Judson Church on Washington Square South, certain colors in La
Farge's profusion of opalescent glass seem to leap to the
foreground, like French horns slicing through the sound of a
symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment, it is the gold on the edge of the Scriptures held
by St. Anthony. At another, it is the scarlet in the legs of St.
George, whose limbs are rendered as intricately as in an anatomical
diagram. A counterpoint to the dazzle is the grape-and-violet robe
of St. Peter, so lush in the layering of purples that it looks as
if it had been cut from velour rather than glass.
</P>
<P>
   Judson's windows, installed from 1892 to 1915, are together in
place for the first time in a decade. Weakened and buckling, they
had been removed one by one and stored. The church simply did not
have the $1 million needed to restore them.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994 Judson was bequeathed $300,000 on the death of its
administrator, Arlene Carmen. The senior minister, the Rev. Peter
Laarman, proposed using the money as a down payment toward
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to the city and our successors to bring those
windows back,'' he said. ``They're too good to have in the basement
in crates.''
</P>
<P>
   Support came from the Henry Luce, Vincent Astor and Paul and
Klara Porzelt foundations. The New York Landmarks Conservancy gave
$7,500 as part of its Sacred Sites Program, which has made 44
grants totaling $154,125 to stained-glass projects around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of things that need fixing in churches,'' said
Peg Breen, the conservancy president, ``but stained glass really
resonates with people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that resonance that appealed to Laarman. ``I never cast
this project as prettifying,'' he said. ``I cast it in terms of the
human spirit. I think the expansive spirit of the creators of this
space can touch people in lots of contexts apart from worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for instance, La Farge's Renaissance-style saints will
gaze down on a Kwanzaa celebration by gay and lesbian
African-Americans. Judson was intended from its origin as a place
with a social mission. But it is also a glorious place, designed by
Stanford White and ornamented by La Farge, who thought of
opalescent windows as a ``form of translucent mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   La Farge produced 15-foot-high windows resembling arched niches,
with individual saints framed by pilasters. In a smaller round
window is an ``Angel in Adoration,'' said to have been modeled on
La Farge's mistress, Mary Whitney Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The last windows to be restored returned in October from the
Cummings Studio in North Adams, Mass. The vice president of the
studio, Julie L. Sloan, said relinquishing the La Farge glass was
like sending a child to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``As proud as you are, there's a parting that's very sad,'' she
said. ``They were wonderful windows to work with, and we'll miss
them.''

</P>
<P>
   After laboring eight years on the Bolton windows in Brooklyn,
David Fraser, director of operations and senior stained-glass
conservator at the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts,
says he feels that same sense of kinship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used a palette of glass colors as you would in oil
painting,'' Fraser said. ``But glass is very brittle, and you're
applying materials to it to control the light. It makes oil
painting and watercolors seem like a snap. Bolton was fearless. He
must have been a very spiritual person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser also found a human side to Bolton at the summit of the
chancel window, beyond detection by the unaided eye. ``When we got
to the top, there was an unbelievably voluptuous nude female figure
of an angel playing a harp,'' he said. ``It was one of the most
intimate moments I had with Bolton.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bolton and his brother, John, were hired in 1844 to
produce all 60 windows for the Church of the Holy Trinity, as it
was then called, designed by Minard Lafever. The extraordinary
ensemble was the first major stained-glass commission in the United
States, said Virginia Chieffo Raguin, director of the Census of
Stained Glass Windows in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptism of Christ,'' now being restored, exemplifies
Bolton's work: a composition that breaks across the frames of the
windows, with powerful figures, an exquisite rendering of detail
and the unorthodox use of opaque areas to highlight adjacent
colors.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Boltons four years to make and install the windows.
To date, it has taken 18 years to restore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel as if we have a mission,'' said Susan Feldman,
the executive director of the St. Ann Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center has struggled to finance the $3.5 million project;
indeed, it still must raise $1 million to complete the north
windows. It even faced an attempted eviction in 1995 by the rector.
Church leaders worried that the project was placing esthetics above
the salvation of souls.
</P>
<P>
   That can be a tough call: spending thousands of dollars on
windows and other architectural features when religious and social
programs also beg for scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. John A. Kamas, pastor of St. Jean Baptiste, a Roman
Catholic church on Lexington Avenue, said he had no trouble raising
$500,000 from parishioners to restore windows made by the Lorin
studio of Chartres, France, between 1914 and 1919. The work was
done by Sunlites Stained Glass of Rockaway Park, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Congregation Shearith Israel on Central Park West, also known as
the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, raised more than $300,000 to
restore its Tiffany windows, which had buckled so badly in the
century since installation that pieces of glass were popping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bricks and mortar are not separate from the mission of the
congregation,'' said Rabbi Marc D. Angel. ``When you come into the
synagogue, you realize you're in the presence of God. You feel the
span of the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The east windows, above the ark, are buttery yellow under the
morning sun after restoration by the Clerkin Higgins Stained Glass
studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if somebody had turned the lights back on,'' said
Michael Katz, the chairman of the building and grounds committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some members even complained good-naturedly that the sanctuary
was so bright they needed sunglasses, said Dr. Alan M. Singer, the
executive director of the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   It was not darkness that bothered Ryneveld, a member of the
Marble Church on Fifth Avenue. Rather, as he stared at the south
wall during services, he thought it would be nice if the
diamond-patterned window over the minister's shoulder were
pictorial.
</P>
<P>
   The window was made by the 141-year-old Lamb Studios of
Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., with pieces of German and Polish glass that
were painted by Roy Coomber of Bristol, England, and shipped to the
United States for assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes include the Crucifixion and the Pentecost, in which
``tongues as of fire'' rest upon the heads of the disciples. At the
base of this group is a distinctly modern-looking trio of children:
one black, one Asian, one white.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity to reflect on what we're about as a
church,'' said Dr. Edwin G. Mulder, retired general secretary of
the Reformed Church in America and director of the capital campaign
at Marble. ``Each panel says something about who we are. The
Pentecost one says we are a diverse community in the congregation
itself, every color and race, young people, old people.''

`MIGHTY JOE YOUNG': KING KONG AS LITTLE BOY WITH ELEPHANT MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the technological expertise behind the 2-ton, 15-foot
animatronic ape (augmented by an actor in a monkey suit) who is the
title character of ``Mighty Joe Young,'' the beast is still capable
of only two facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   When riled, Joe roars, bares his teeth, beats his chest and acts
like a conventional movie monster on the rampage. In a calmer mode,
embracing his caretaker, Jill Young (Charlize Theron), in his giant
paws, Joe turns his mouth down in an expression of childlike
docility.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart of hearts, the darling creature is really just a
hirsute little boy pining for the closest thing he knows to a
mommy. As long as Jill is around, you can count on him to be a
sweetly obedient child following the signals of a flashlight she
uses to direct him like a conductor on a podium.
</P>
<P>
   The film, a remake of the 1949 movie ``Mighty Joe Young,''
starring Terry Moore as Joe's cheesecakey mother surrogate, is
essentially ``King Kong'' for kids. Very young kids.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar story begins when Jill is a child growing up in
Central Africa. One terrible night, both Jill's mother and the
mother of the baby ape who grows up to be Joe are killed by evil
poachers, but not before Joe has bitten off two fingers from a hand
of one of the villains.
</P>
<P>
   We flash ahead two decades. Little Jill is now Big Jill, a
slinky, tomboyish woman who is fiercely protective of her childhood
pet, with whom she enjoys playing games of hide and seek. Joe's
enormous size has made him a legend, and poachers and zoo keepers
from around the world have their eye on him.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving just in time to save the ape from probable kidnaping is
Gregg (Bill Paxton), a kindly American zoologist who persuades Jill
to let him transport the beast to an animal conservancy in Los
Angeles. Jill agrees on the condition that she remain Joe's
caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing Joe from news articles as the ape that cost him his
fingers many years earlier, Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia), the poacher
who killed Joe's mother and who now runs his own conservancy in
Botswana, descends on Los Angeles, bent on capturing Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Apes, like elephants, the movie suggests, never forget. And when
Joe spies his mother's killer, he begins acting up. Not even Jill
can figure out what's the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The movie culminates in Joe's going on a mild rampage through
the streets of Los Angeles. Compared with ``Godzilla'' or ``King
Kong,'' it's very tame stuff, and the only people who get hurt are
the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Joe is essentially an angelic child who
identifies with angelic kiddies everywhere. He becomes a hero after
risking his life to save a saucer-eyed little tyke trapped in the
top car of a burning ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young,'' directed by Ron Underwood from a
screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with
dialogue so wooden that Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem
animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they
can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old
could ever hope to own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).
Its early scenes of animal slaughter could frighten young children.
</P>

100-MEMBER MEDICAL TEAM PERFORMS TRIPLE TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn., Maine)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an overnight medical drama that one surgeon called a
``symphony of movement,'' transplant teams at Brigham and Women's
Hospital recovered two lungs and a heart from a single donor and
implanted them Tuesday into three different patients on the brink
of death, doctors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 physicians, surgeons, nurses and other specialists
carried out the logistically complex mission that involved many
coming to work in the pre-dawn darkness and required ``bumping''
several patients scheduled for elective operations to clear the
three surgical suites used for the tranplants.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the major ``white knuckler'' was bad weather that
threatened the air transportation of the organs from the
unidentified donor's location somewhere in New England. But the
heart and lungs arrived at Logan Airport early Tuesday morning, and
were taken to Brigham and Women's in time for the implants
beginning at about 10 a.m. that day, said the physicians.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time In New England _ and one of only a
handful of times anywhere _ that the three major organs were
implanted in three recipients at the same institution, said Dr.
David Sugarbaker, chief of thoracic surgery. Brigham surgeons were
the first to do it in New England, in April of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, men from Connecticut and Maine who received lung
transplants and a Haverhill woman in whom the heart was implanted,
were all doing well Thursday, and their relatives were ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the donor's family knows what an awesome gift
they've given,'' said Aline Santose, daughter of Marie Lowther, 56,
who received the heart in the operations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other recipients were Robert Konovaluk, 57, of Waterbury,
Conn., and Robert Downs, 60, of Brunswick, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a call from the New England Organ bank at 10 p.m.
Monday saying the organs were available, doctors held meetings and
traded phone calls through the night to arrange the procurement of
the organs, clear operating room time, and assemble the teams
needed for the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest of care in planning was necessary to ensure that
the recipients were put under anesthesia at the proper time, said
Sugarbaker, to make certain that the donor organs spent no
unnecessary time outside the body.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon, called it a ``symphony of
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort involved ``a huge commitment by the hospital and the
doctors'' to accept the three organs for simultaneous transplant,
said Sugarbaker. Otherwise, he said, one or more organs would have
gone elsewhere, and ``this is one gift that when it comes, you have
to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sugarbaker and Swanson, the transplant surgical teams
were headed by Dr. Raphael Bueno, a thoracic surgeon, Dr. Gregory
Couper, a cardiac surgeon, and Dr. Lawrence Cohn, chief of cardiac
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The team for each transplant recipient included three nurses,
two anesthesiologists, two or three surgeons, and several other
specialists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three surgeons flew in an airplane arranged by the
New England Organ Bank to remove the organs from the donor _
usually a brain-dead person fatally injured in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Fog and stormy weather threatened to force the returning plane
to land somewhere other than Logan, said Sugarbaker, adding, ``we
were concerned that the organs would be stuck in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart transplants have about a 70 percent long-term success rate
and lung transplants from 60 to 70 percent, said the Brigham
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   When donor organs become available, they are allocated to
patients who are sickest and have been waiting the longest, said
Betsy Strock at the organ bank. She said it was just chance that
the three organs all went to patients at the same hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At present, 70 patients in New England are awaiting donor hearts
and 171 are waiting for lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Leach, daughter of Downs, a lung recipient, said, ``Time
was running out for my dad. He had all he could do to get from the
bedroom to the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday morning, only two days after the transplant, she
said, ``he had color in his cheeks again, his hands were warm, and
I could see the sparkle in his eye that hadn't been there for a
long time.''

`DOWN IN THE DELTA': FAMILY VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production Notes are at the end of the review.) (DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a wonderful world it would be if every American family had
older relatives as wise, kind, generous and stern (when necessary)
as Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) and Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), the heroes of
Maya Angelou's unabashedly inspirational film ``Down In the
Delta.'' Together this sister and brother gently and methodically
heal the wounded spirit of a Chicago inner-city household on the
verge of disintegration, and in the process save their proud family
line from possible extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which often threatens to disappear into a tub of
soapsuds, is elevated immeasurably by the calm, stately
performances of Mary Alice and Freeman. These two fine actors lend
their roles a gravity, balance and underlying sense of sorrow that
convince you such noble souls really do exist in the world, even if
they're few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   If the term ``family values'' has a taint of right-wing
intolerance nowadays, the movie reminds you of what those values,
shorn of political ideology, really mean in terms of caring,
self-sacrifice and the nurturing of tradition through the honoring
of one's ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta,'' which Ms. Angelou directed (it is the
poet's debut behind the camera) from a screenplay by Myron Goble,
doesn't pretend that love and devotion alone can do the job. When
it becomes apparent to Rosa Lynn that her daughter Loretta (Alfre
Woodward), her grandson Thomas (Mpho Koaho) and autistic
granddaughter Tracy (Kulani Hassen) are in imminent danger of
succumbing to the drug-and-gun infested street culture of Chicago,
she takes drastic action. Telephoning her brother in Mississippi,
she announces that she is sending her daughter and grandchildren
south for the summer to stay with him.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the journey, Rosa Lynn pawns a priceless heirloom, a
sterling silver candelabrum, named Nathan, that has been in the
family for generations. As ``Nathan's'' story comes out in bits and
pieces, it becomes larger-than-life myth (illustrated with
flashbacks to slavery times) exemplifying the family's continuity
in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   That story gives ``Down in the Delta'' a resonance that
transcends mushy family drama and lends it the aura of a folk tale.
Family legends that connect us to our past, the movie suggests, are
necessary for the care and feeding of our souls.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Down in the Delta'' portrays some moments of family strife,
they are very muted in a film that is really a idyllic celebration
of a return to one's roots. Even in its relatively gritty early
scenes in Chicago, in which Loretta, rejected for a cashier's job
because she hasn't learned arithmetic, goes directly from her job
interview to a liquor store and from there to a crack house, the
edges are softened. Almost as soon as Loretta and her children have
settled comfortably in Earl's sprawling house in rural Mississippi,
her hard shell begins to melt.
</P>
<P>
   The film lavishes equal amounts of love on the bucolic
Mississippi landscape and on the kind, careworn faces of Earl and
his wife Annie (Esther Rolle), who is suffering from Alzheimer's
disease. Freeman's Earl is a man of infinite patience and
tenderness, and the scenes of him gently, painstakingly helping his
wife around the house and comforting her when she's afraid are
among the rare moments to be found in a contemporary movie in which
you see older people caring for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Earl devotes the same care to Loretta, whom he hires as a
waitress in the local restaurant he owns, an establishment called
Just Chicken. Also popping up on the homestead is the couple's
strapping grownup son Will (Wesley Snipes), a successful Atlanta
lawyer who gives his cousin some useful lessons in self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' may be an impossible dream, a cinematic
Hallmark card of familial togetherness, but the vision it offers is
still a dream worth dreaming.
</P>

   Game of the Week
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, 12:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   VIKINGS (14-1) at OILERS (8-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Vikings _ 530 (Points scored; leads league)
</P>
<P>
   Oilers _ 47.5 (Craig Hentrich's punting average)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Oilers are out of the playoffs, so they are
playing for the ``p'' word _ pride. Minnesota has homefield
advantage throughout the playoffs and is also playing for a ``p''
word _ points. Before the Vikings sail into the post-season, they
would like to make NFL history. Just 12 more points and the Vikings
will break the team scoring record of 541 set by the 1983
Washington Redskins. In this age of parity, that is a remarkable
achievement. Something else to look for: Quarterback Randall
Cunningham leads the league in passer rating (107.3) and could
break the mark of 112.8 set by San Francisco's Steve Young in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 35-24
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   CHIEFS (6-9) at RAIDERS (8-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs _ 15.5 (Leslie O'Neal's sacks vs. Raiders)
</P>
<P>
   Raiders _ 4 (Charles Woodson's interceptions)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Chiefs have had a terrible year, and now comes
the inevitable talk of what changes will be made. The pressure of a
failed season bubbled to the surface when wide receiver Andre Rison
blew up at a reporter this week. The Raiders were never expected to
make the playoffs this year, so they will be more relaxed. One more
thing: Woodson was supposed to play on offense this week, but coach
Jon Gruden nixed the idea after Woodson said, basically, that it
was about time. So for now, Woodson remains a working stiff on
defense and probably gets another interception. Quarterback Wade
Wilson, 40 years old, fills in fine for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 24-17
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 1 p.m. Games
</P>
<P>
   BILLS (9-6) at SAINTS (6-9)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Bills _ Plus 8 (Turnover ratio)
</P>
<P>
   Saints _ 4-1 (Record when leading at half)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Jets developed the blueprint for stopping Bills
quarterback Doug Flutie: Flood the field with defensive backs and
blitz him so that he stays pinned in the pocket. No doubt that
Saints defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian, who has done an
outstanding job this year, will try some form of that. But over
all, New Orleans does not have the talent the Jets do. The Bills
want to win badly because they have an outside chance at a home
playoff game. Flutie passes for 300 yards and throws for three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 32-20
</P>
<P>
   PANTHERS (3-12) at COLTS (3-12)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Panthers _ 4 (Linebacker Jeff Brady's interceptions)
</P>
<P>
   Colts _ 17 (Sacks given up)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Carolina is in a state of complete disarray. The
head coach, Dom Capers, will probably be fired. The linebackers
coach, Kevin Steele, sore from being roughed up by Kevin ``WWF''
Greene, will leave the team to coach in college. And Greene himself
is contemplating retirement. About the only good news for the
Panthers is that quarterback Steve Beuerlein leads the league with
a 63.4 completion percentage. Meanwhile, Colts quarterback Peyton
Manning continues to light up the league. He has an NFL
rookie-record 25 touchdown passes and tied a club record this
season with four 300-yard passing games.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   LIONS (5-10) at RAVENS (5-10)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Lions _ 1,450 (Barry Sanders' rushing yards)
</P>
<P>
   Ravens _ 3rd straight vs. NFC
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: This was a disappointing season for Baltimore, and
coach Ted Marchibroda will probably be fired because of it and
moved to the front office if he desires. But the Ravens will end
their season with a victory because the Lions remain the game's
biggest underachievers. Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh has thrown
for 1,746 yards against Detroit, his highest total against any
team.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 28-10
</P>
<P>
   PACKERS (10-5) at BEARS (4-11)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Packers _ 9 (Straight victories vs. Bears)
</P>
<P>
   Bears _ 1-10 (Dave Wannstedt vs. Packers)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Packers have a playoff berth, but are motivated
because if they win and San Francisco loses, the Packers would have
a home playoff game. The only danger for Green Bay is that Bears
running back James Allen will most likely start, and last week
against a decent Baltimore defense he rushed for 163 yards, highest
total by a Chicago running back since Walter Payton ran for 176 in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 30-19
</P>
<P>
   DOLPHINS (10-5) at FALCONS (13-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins _ 299 (Regular-season victories)
</P>
<P>
   Falcons _ 13 (Victories this season, club record)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: It will be interesting to watch Atlanta this week,
and not just because coach Dan Reeves, who recently had heart
surgery, won't be on the sideline. How will the Falcons play this
game? Will they keep their starters in the entire game if it's
close, or will they play it safe and sit most of them? Imagine the
outcry if the brittle quarterback Chris Chandler was injured in a
meaningless game. That's why the Falcons will probably get an early
lead, then take out their starters in the third quarter. Miami
allows only 15.1 points a game, but they are no match for a fast
artificial-turf team like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 25-9
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOTS (9-6) at JETS (11-4)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Patriots _ 3-3 (Scott Zolak's career record)
</P>
<P>
   Jets _ 59-25 (Bill Parcells' record at Giants Stadium)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Beating the 49ers last week without Drew Bledsoe was
one of the best coaching jobs this season. But asking New England's
Pete Carroll to duplicate that feat against Parcells, who in some
ways knows the Patriots better than Carroll does, is almost
impossible. The Jets are peaking, typical of Parcells teams in
December. He owns a career 34-19 regular-season record in December,
and with veterans on his side like Keith Byars, who will play with
an injured arm, and David Meggett, signed last week, his December
success won't change. Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe sits again
with an injury; Scott Zolak gets the start.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 31-28
</P>
<P>
   BUCCANEERS (7-8) at BENGALS (3-12)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers _ 294 (Rushing yards last two games)
</P>
<P>
   Bengals _ 8 of last 11 (Victories in December games)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Tampa Bay blew its best chance for post-season play
with an inexcusable loss to Washington last week. Now their playoff
fate is out of their hands. They can finish 8-8, and after the way
their season began, that would be a moral victory of sorts. It will
be a close game. Cincinnati has a terrible defense and inconsistent
offense, but one thing they do not do is turn the ball over. The
Bengals, with 19 turnovers, are tied with Denver and Tennessee for
fewest in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, 12-7
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 4 p.m. Games
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (7-8) at EAGLES (3-12)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Giants _ 3 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Eagles _ 14.8 (Points per game)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Giants can clinch a playoff berth with a
victory, and losses by Arizona and Tampa Bay. A long shot, sure,
but strange things have happened before. The Eagles will play hard,
in part because of inspiration from wide receiver Irving Fryar, who
is retiring after the game. But a player on the Giants will be
inspired as well _ defensive end Michael Strahan. He leads the team
with 14 sacks and needs just half a sack for a career high. Watch
out, quarterback Koy Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-3
</P>
<P>
   RAMS (4-11) at 49ERS (11-4)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Rams _ 60 (Amp Lee's receptions)
</P>
<P>
   49ers _ 16 (Consecutive home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: One of the most incredible streaks in the NFL: the
49ers have not lost in 15 home games under coach Steve Mariucci.
But the 49ers could be vulnerable. Steve Young will probably play,
but his knee is no doubt still very sore from a bruising hit he
took last week against New England. And the 49ers' secondary is
still banged up _ there isn't a part of safety Tim McDonald's body
that isn't hurting.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 38-28
</P>
<P>
   CHARGERS (5-10) at CARDINALS (8-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Chargers _ 5 (Terrell Fletcher's touchdown runs, last 6 games)
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals _ 3 (Adrian Murrell's consecutive 1,000-yard seasons)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: So now come reports that Ryan Leaf, who has had one
of the worst seasons, on and off the field, of any rookie
quarterback this decade, has been showing up late to meetings and
sleeping through some of them. Players are beginning to doubt if he
will ever be a leader. That may be why coach June Jones decided to
start Craig Whelihan instead of Leaf, though Leaf will get
significant playing time. Arizona is fighting for its life because
a victory gets it into the playoffs. Who do you think will win this
one _ a hungry Jake Plummer, who just signed a new contract that
included a league-record $15 million signing bonus? Or a
sleepy-headed Leaf?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 40-21
</P>
<P>
   SEAHAWKS (8-7) at BRONCOS (13-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks _ 4-1 (Jon Kitna's record as starter)
</P>
<P>
   Broncos _ 2 (Consecutive losses)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: What's wrong with the Broncos? That's the question
Denver is being asked again and again, almost as much as it was
asked about going undefeated. What's wrong is that Mike Shanahan
teams don't do well in December _ the Broncos lost two straight
last year at this time, and under Shanahan the last four years they
are 6-8 in December. Denver lost its last two games on the road. At
Mile High Stadium this week, the losing will end. Denver has scored
at least 30 points in 12 of its last 14 games at home. The Broncos
are also 29-2 at home under Shanahan. Nothing like home cooking to
erase a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 38-14
</P>
<P>
   REDSKINS (6-9) at COWBOYS (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Redskins _ 4 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys _ 7-0 (Record vs. NFC East)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Redskins are one of the most curious teams in
the league. They have won six of their last eight games and five of
their last six. At one point, coach Norv Turner was fighting for
his job; now he has the team fighting for him. Since the Cowboys
have nothing to fight for in this game _ they are already in the
playoffs _ they lose by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 16-9
</P>
<P>
   Monday 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   STEELERS (7-8) at JAGUARS (10-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Steelers _ 1,046 (Jerome Bettis' rushing yards)
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars _ 20 of last 23 (Home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Jacksonville's crushing 50-10 loss to Minnesota came
on the same day the Jaguars won the AFC Central, a longtime goal.
The starter at quarterback against Pittsburgh is uncertain, but it
definitely won't be Mark Brunell, out with an ailing knee. There is
even some doubt _ albeit small _ about Brunell's return for the
first round of the playoffs. The way Pittsburgh's offense is
playing right now, the Jaguars don't need Brunell. The key to this
normally intense series is that the home team has won each of the
seven meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 21-14

<P>
   ABOARD THE USS BELLEAU WOOD, Persian Gulf _ On schedule in the
rec room tonight: ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' by order of the
chaplain. Plastic holly leaves and strips of tinsel are taped to
bulkhead doors within the vast hull of this amphibious assault
ship. A dungareed sailor absently whistles an off-key ``Angels We
Have Heard on High'' as he scans the shimmering heat-hazed horizon
with powerful binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   It is the season of peace on earth, good will toward men. But
this season seems preposterously incongruous with the mission of
the thousands of American soldiers, sailors and aviators massed in
a region that has become synonymous with bloodshed and turmoil. And
the official line spouted on the Belleau Wood is that Christmas is
just another routine working day for its stretched-to-the edge
complement of 2,200 Navy personnel and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Not that many buy the official line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the spirit of Christmas will find you no matter you
are, no matter how strange the setting,'' said Maj. John A. Wilson
of Lynn, Marine pilot and operations officer for the helicopters
and Harrier ``jump jets'' stationed aboard the 820-foot vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Hey, I can't be thinking of Christmas out here,' ''
he said. ``But, truth is, you can't stop thinking about Christmas,
or your loved ones. It can be a bittersweet time of year for
military people. You just try to stop that ache and count your
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson spent the four-day Desert Fox operation flying helicopter
support missions for the Marines who were landed on the desert
shores at the outset of the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace holds, he'll spend Christmas flying ``Santa
missions'' _ his Huey gunship laden like St. Nick's sled with the
first hot chow deliveries for the devil dogs, as Marines call
themselves, still hunkered in foxholes near the Iraq border.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our Marines onshore, a taste of hot turkey and some mail
would be like _ well, like Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail from home is pouring into the Persian Gulf at nearly
the volume of the ordnance and other military supplies: Christmas
cards, boxes of candy and _ aboard the Belleau Wood at least _ one
20-inch-tall living Christmas tree sent to devil dog Staff Sgt.
Eric Tausch. Love, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way from Durango, Colorado, and that good American
dirt is still fresh,'' said Tausch, showing off the
merrily-decorated little tree to the flight deck crew crowding
around. ``Smell that spruce! Is that the smell of Christmas, or
what?''
</P>
<P>
   The ship courses smoothly back and forth across the green
swells. On a sweep close to shore, the white minarets of Muslim
mosques can be seen rising from a settlement on the edge the
dazzling sands. Giant oil field flare towers, coincidentally
painted red, burn like a long row of holiday candles.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bill DeVine of Boston, a Roman Catholic priest by vocation,
a lieutenant commander by naval rank, is chaplain for the Belleau
Wood and two accompanying vessels, the USS Dubuque and the USS
Germantown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous world, as events of the past few days
have demonstrated,'' he said. ``Everyone aboard this ship is
working very hard to keep in readiness for a job most hope they
never have to do _ fight a war. So even with a Christmas sing-along
at 19:00 hours, decorations in the cafeteria or cookies from home,
the season is going to seem a little off-key out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``Our celebration can perhaps be a bit more
spiritual. A time of quiet prayer or reflection, not just
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the bridge, Lt. Commmander Jim Hruska of Brookline, Mass.,
navigator of the Belleau Wood, is preoccupied with electronic
charts and guidance systems. ``My job is to get the ship from Point
A to Point B as quickly and as safely as possible,'' he said. ``By
naval standards, the Persian Gulf is a tight body of water for
manuvering. There are lots of hazards, from mines to offshore oil
rigs. So I can't say I'm overflowing with the season's spirit. But
it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kelly, also from Massachusetts, is back at the ship's
base in Sasebo, Japan. And he acknowledged that it's a particularly
tough time of year to be apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cards and letters from home soften the blow. Believe me, a
Christmas card counts as something real precious when you are this
far from everyone you love,'' he said. ``I just hope my wife can
take comfort that I'm on a real life mission, serving the real
interests of our country. I know I take comfort from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's the occasional scoffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas? Just another 24 hours out on the boat, that's
all,'' said Maj. J.E. Szewczynski, a Marine Harrier pilot from
Yuma, Arizona. ``Sure I'd rather be with my wife and four children.
But I'm not, so I just focus on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   A warship is basically a floating delivery system of death and
destruction, a thing of cold steel and hard edges. But it's also a
community. And for all their tough talk and strutting, the sailors
and Marines aboard are bound by more than just duty and military
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got family back in the states who I miss worse than words
could possibly say,'' said Lt. Kristen A. Lasica of Chicago, part
of the Marine expeditionary unit transported to the Gulf by the
Belleau Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, corny as it sounds, the people aboard this
vessel, they're like family, too,'' she said ``We'll just be doing
our jobs on Christmas, sure. But we'll carrying the season in our
hearts and taking strength from each other.''

VISIONS IN GLASS: AMERICA'S ANGELS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Union Congregational Church building in
Worcester, Mass., a rather loose interpretation of Notre Dame in
Paris, was vacated and sold to a developer in the mid-1980s, its
stained glass windows were removed and stowed. Chief among them was
the ``Angel of Praise,'' designed in 1896 by Henry Landon Parkhurst
of New York, a wonderfully crafted, opalescent Victorian vision in
pinks, mauves and turquoises of a full-length female angel in
flowing robes.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of oblivion, the window, seven feet tall, now
graces the new Pakachoag Church building in Auburn, Mass., where a
sensitive installation has eased its transition to a simpler
interior in New England meeting-house style. Its recycling in a
more modern setting is one example of a growing interest in the
preservation of American stained glass from earlier times. (The
renewed appreciation of this essentially public art brought about,
in 1979, the formation of a nonprofit group, the Census of Stained
Glass Windows in America, to record architectural stained glass in
the United States. A recent survey made by its Philadelphia branch
came up with 3,654 examples in that city alone.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Virginia C. Raguin, a professor of art history at
the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, the interest has at
least in part to do with the post-modern revival of appreciation
for narrative and descriptive art. ``We prize this art much more
now than in the time when we were looking at, say, Rothko, as the
criterion of artistic expression,'' said Dr. Raguin. ``Now we have
the ability to read a window, in terms not just of its image, but
its color, form, its placement within a building, the kinetic
element of changing light, its relationship to poetry, novels,
stories and texts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raguin is the curator of ``Glory in Glass: Stained Glass in
the United States,'' a shimmering _ and enlightening _ show at the
Gallery of the American Bible Society that explores the development
of stained glass in American churches. Drawing from seven houses of
worship around the country, including St. Bartholomew's in
Manhattan, as well as the Neustadt Museum of Tiffany Art, a
collection in part housed in Queens and Hartford, Conn., the show
contains 14 ``living'' (not replica) windows, panels and roundels,
including the ``Angel of Praise,'' removed from its setting for
restoration. Although only a small sampling, it suggests that, even
if not quite up to Chartres or St.-Denis, the glass in American
churches is not to be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   The show is buttressed by loans of earlier European work from
art museums, sketches, cartoons, design books _ many from the Bible
Society's own extensive collection _ and pictorial inspirations for
subject matter. A glazier's table shows a 19th-century window in
the process of restoration. And there is a display of pieces in
various stages of glazing along with a collection of tools and
paints used in the craft.
</P>
<P>
   Stained glass, used pictorially in European cathedrals since the
10th century , was regarded as a symbolic manifestation of divine
light, and at the same time a highly effective tool for teaching
Biblical history and church dogma to illiterate congregations. In
the 12th and 13th centuries, the golden age of the craft, windows
were made to look like transparent paintings, and the art was in
fact one of the most important forms of monumental painting.
Nineteenth-century Romanticism and the Gothic revival brought about
a renewed interest in stained glass as well as other medieval arts.
The interest was nurtured in England by the Arts and Crafts
movement under William Morris, and in this country by two
brilliantly innovative designers, John La Farge and Louis Comfort
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there are no works by Tiffany or La Farge in the show
(although they may be seen in churches around Manhattan). But there
is a radiant, full-length ``Angel with Lilies'' (1900) by Frederick
Wilson (1858-1932), an Englishman who served for more than 30 years
as chief designer of the Tiffany Studios. Wilson, known for his
figural work, specialized in the upscale ``Tiffany angel,'' looking
rather like a Balanchine ballet dancer and described in the show's
catalog as having ``an elegant pre-Raphaelite body, long slender
nose, broad forehead, high cheekbones and invariably reddish
tonality of hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's ``Angel with Lilies,'' designed for an unknown
building, also reveals, with its tightly pleated bodice and
rippling robe, the artful handling of glass that is characteristic
of the Tiffany Studios. This particular angel, lent by the Neustadt
Museum, is thought to be from a three-part window ensemble. It is
shown in the hope that someone may be able to shed more light on
its origins.
</P>
<P>
   A more compassionate-looking celestial being is the
Botticelli-like figure in a circular medallion that appeared above
a double lancet window showing Jesus washing the feet of the
Apostles. Designed by the famous Hardman Studios in Birmingham,
England, for the monumental Gothic building of St. Peter's Church,
in Lowell, Mass., the windows were saved when the 1892 church was
demolished in 1966. In this medallion the kindly looking
androgynous angel, with bright yellow hair, is dressed in white
with a lavender robe and surrounded by stylized foliage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most beguiling angels appears in an intensely
color-charged image, a seraph's face that glows white in a
dazzlement of vividly jewel-toned feathers. It was part of a choir
loft window designed by the Munich firm of Franz Meyer around 1900,
for what is now the Sacred Heart Cultural Center of Augusta, Ga. A
fine example of the Romanesque Revival style, the center started
out in 1898 as the Sacred Heart Church. But over the decades the
congregation dwindled, and in 1971 the church closed. For 16 years
the building languished, prey to pigeon and human nesters. Then a
local philanthropist led a drive to renovate it, and in 1987 it was
reopened as a nonprofit center for cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the windows are of holy figures. The earliest display,
from the Central Baptist Church of Southbridge, Mass., built in
1866, goes back to the very beginning of American stained glass.
Its windows, possibly designed by Samuel West of Boston, are among
the rare intact examples in America of a technique known as quarry
glazing, in which small sections of glass are assembled into a
stylized lattice pattern. It was popular in English 14th- and
15th-century country churches and in medieval and Renaissance
secular buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many early American Protestant congregations used this
decorative scheme because they were short on money and technical
resources, and they didn't like the idea of figurative art in
churches. The upper half of the sanctuary window displayed here is
stenciled in a grisaille pattern composed of diagonals, each
bearing a circle surrounded by eight highly stylized three-leaf
figures _ dull, but neat and serviceable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The show's most secular exhibit _ although from a church _ is
the knockout Goddard Memorial Window of the First Parish of
Brookline, a 280-year-old Unitarian church in Brookline, Mass.
Dedicated in 1912, the window was designed by the Boston painter
George H. Hallowell (1871-1926) and executed by Otto Heinigke
(1850-1913) of New York. Although the church has many important
sacred windows, this one honors the Revolutionary war hero John
Goddard, a Brookline farmer who in 1776 built overnight, with the
aid of a horse-and-wagon corps he organized, a fort that helped to
drive the British from Boston. But rather than depicting his deed,
the twin-lancet window gives equal space to full-length figures of
farmer Goddard and his wife, Hannah, pillars of New England
rectitude, as role models for 20th-century parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad there's so little here in the way of contemporary
work. There are a couple of cartoons and sketches for windows done
in 1995 by Susan van Heukelom for the Cathedral of All Souls in
Asheville, N.C., but their style is traditional. One might brood on
the fact that the United States has no artists like Matisse,
Chagall or Rouault doing star turns in stained glass. Still, the
show _ handsomely installed in the newly expanded galleries of the
Bible Society _ is not intended to be comprehensive, and it has a
lot worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory in Glass: Stained Glass in the United States'' is at the
Gallery at the American Bible Society, 1865 Broadway at 61st
Street, through Feb. 16 (closed this Friday through Sunday).  &QL;

ON HOLIDAY EVE, CHEERY ECONOMIC NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Offering good cheer for the holiday season, the
federal government reported Thursday that Americans earned more,
saved more and were forced to visit to the unemployment office less
often in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With most analysts predicting a slowdown in US economic growth
next year, the new data shows that, at least for now, Americans are
enjoying the fruits of a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic slowdown hasn't happened -- not yet -- despite
all the concerns that have arisen this year,'' said Frederick
Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income jumped 0.5 percent in November, the largest gain
in nine months, the Commerce Department said. It previsouly
reported solid gains of 0.4 percent in October and 0.3 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to many economists, the savings rate moved
into positive territory for the first time in three months.
Economists have worried that Americans are spending more than they
earn and might soon have to cut back significantly, which would
slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The savings rate -- or savings as a percentage of after-tax
income -- was 0.1 percent in November. That is a meager number, but
better than the negative 0.2 percent in October and 0 percent in
September, after a rate of 0.3 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Labor Department said that the number of
Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell by
13,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, the lowest level
in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This draws a picture of a very health economy,'' said Cynthia
Latta, chief US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington.
``You can find little pockets of problems, but there is so much
ferment in the rest of the country that it offsets these
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the Asian financial crisis has prompted
big layoffs and Boeing and hurt the economies of Oregon and
Washington State. ``But we read lots and lots and lots about
layoffs this year, and yet you don't see signs of it in the
unemployment rate,'' Latta said. ``So far, there's a job available
for everyone who gets laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the United States is bound to watch its
economy cool amid the global finanical downturn, which started 18
months ago in Asia. Many predict growth next year of about 2
percent or slightly more, compared to growth estimated at well
above 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists are trying to figure out why Americans appear to
be saving so little amid the current prosperity. In the mid-1980s,
the savings rate was as high as 6 percent, Latta said, compared to
a near-zero rate today.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation, some economists say, is that Americans are
spending money that they have made in the stock market. Breimyer
believes that mortgage refinancings, which have surged this year,
provided Americans with a second and important source of cash.
</P>
<P>
   However, showing that Americans have money to spend does not
explain why they feel the need to spend it all, and to save so
little.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could be spending so much, Latta said, because of the
``wealth effect,'' a term economists use to explain the increased
spending that comes from a rising stock market. Americans might
just feel more wealthy than if the stock market had been flat, so
they are spending a lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   Breimyer has an additional explanation: the savings rate is
being measured in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Commerce Department began treating the income
that people receive on mutual fund gains differently. The savings
rate for April, for example, came in at 3.6 percent under the old
calculations, but fell to only 1 percent under the new
calculations, Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good part of what's going on could be this methodological
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its income report, the Commerce Department said that wages
and salaries -- the most important component of income -- rose 0.6
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and salaries were flat in manufacturing, a sector that has
been hurt as the Asian financial crisis cut US exports and prompted
a wave of imports. Wages and salaries rose 0.9 in services, which
are less affected by international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Two special factors held down spending and helped boost the
savings rate. Auto buying returned to more normal levels after
shooting higher in September and October. Those months saw a buying
spurt just after the summer's General Motors' strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, mild weather depressed electricity and natural-gas
use, which helped keep spending to a modest 0.2 percent rise.
Spending on nondurable goods such as food, chemical products and
paper rose 0.3 percent.

 &HT;    Resolve to add fruits and veggies to diet
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After weeks of family celebrations, office parties and
nonstop socializing, a lot of folks are feeling as stuffed as a
Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, all that revelry will give way to resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, many will resolve to diet _ whether it's to
lose the 5 pounds gained over the holidays or the 20 pounds put on
over the last year. Or maybe it's simply a desire to eat and feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the reason _ or the particular diet philosophy you
plan to follow _ there's one goal that's good for everyone: Eat
more fruits and vegetables. Shoot for five servings a day at the
least _ the more the better. And most of us can stand to improve.
Only an estimated 10 percent of Georgians are getting their
five-a-day, according to a survey last spring by the public health
division of the state Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   That's dismally low, said Alice Trainer, health communications
manager at the DHR. Nationally, less than 25 percent are meeting
the minimum recommendation. ``People really don't seem to be aware
of how important eating five-a-day is,'' Trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   And many folks are counting french fried potatoes _ the most
popular vegetable dish consumed in America, and a fat-rich
nutritional disaster _ as one of their servings, according to Chris
Rosenbloom, a nutritionist and professor at Georgia State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to emphasize that five is the minimum and the reasons
go beyond what your grandmother meant when she said to `eat your
vegetables,' '' Rosenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   Our grandmothers wanted us to stave off vitamin deficiency
diseases such as scurvy and beriberi, explains Rosenbloom. Today,
research is revealing that the disease-fighting power of many
fruits and vegetables is greater than ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence indicates that phytochemical and antioxidant
nutrients found in fruits and veggies protect human tissue from the
kind of toxic damage that occurs with everyday living.
</P>
<P>
   That means diets rich in such foods may actually help prevent
some cancers and heart damage in addition to helping to lower
cholesterol, protecting vision and regulating blood pressure and
blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium are phytochemicals. So are
beta carotene and carotenoids, found in such foods as carrots,
sweet potatoes and red peppers. Carotenoids are believed to be
defenders against lung cancer, heart disease and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   Lutein and zeaxanthin also help protect vision and are found in
kale, collard greens, broccoli, spinach and tangerines.
</P>
<P>
   Lycopene may help prevent some cancers, especially prostate and
cervical cancers. Tomatoes are a great source, along with
grapefruit, raspberries, strawberries and watermelon. Saponins,
found in garlic, dried beans and asparagus, may help protect
against high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few examples of the kinds of nutrients
scientists have identified in fruits and vegetables that are
proving to be powerful agents of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research began to show that people in cultures with low rates
in cancer and heart disease ate a lot of fruits and veggies,''
Rosenbloom said. ``From there, research began to focus on what
exactly in those foods might be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But if all that scientific talk has you overwhelmed, then focus
on other good reasons why eating fruits and vegetables will help
you succeed in meeting your New Year dietary goals.
</P>
<P>
   They taste good. They are colorful and crunchy. And they are
something you can add to your diet rather than subtract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not as hard to add to your diet as many people seem
to think,'' Trainer said. One point of confusion, she said, is that
people believe only fresh fruits and vegetables meet the
requirement. But in fact, canned and frozen vegetables are just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer said surprisingly, the same survey of 800 Georgians
statewide that showed only 10 percent are eating five servings a
day, also showed that more than 50 percent said time for cooking
and shopping was not a barrier. The problem, it seems, is folks
simply aren't shopping for and cooking vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a number of health organizations have formed the
Georgia Coalition for Nutrition Education, which is sponsoring a
campaign called ``Take Charge of Your Health.'' And one of the key
messages is the five-a-day advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is a great time to start. Folks who are trying to cut back
or diet will find they don't have to deprive themselves,'' Trainer
said. ``They can satisfy their sweet tooth, crunch and munch and
never get hungry if they've included fruits and vegetables in their
diet plan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SERVING SAVVY
</P>
<P>
   It's not as hard as one might think to get a serving of fruits
or vegetables. All it takes is a half-cup of cooked vegetables or
fruits; three-quarters of a cup of juice; 1 cup of raw leafy
greens, such as lettuce or 1 medium-size piece of fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3-5 spears of broccoli
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7-8 baby carrots or carrot sticks
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 ear of corn
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 spears of asparagus
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium stewed or fresh tomato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 medium baked potato
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4-5 dark green lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Five a day the easy way
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Serve a variety of fresh, frozen and canned fruits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep fruit handy. Carry a piece in your purse or briefcase.
Create a community fruit bowl at work. At home, keep a fruit bowl
near the family's spot for watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cut up raw fruits and veggies and keep healthy dips in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep dried fruits, such as raisins, apples or apricots in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drink 100 percent fruit juices more often.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start early. Breakfast is a great time to work in two servings
of fruit _ try fresh fruit with cereal and a glass of juice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make salads healthier with dark greens such as spinach. Feel
free to use the salads in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add frozen vegetable mixes to rice, pasta or broth for a quick
meal.

UNBEATEN TULANE CAN'T WIN RESPECT IN BCS SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS - Eleven and oh, and anarchy rules.
</P>
<P>
   The head coach is gone, punched his ticket. His replacement is a
mystery man, rarely seen on campus. What once was an office is now
a storage room brimming with packed boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Half the assistants are lame ducks, the others unsure of their
future. The seniors have turned into counselors, helping the young
ones cope with the lessons of change. Amid the swirl of emotion,
there is one last game, one last chance to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven and oh, and a football team dealing with a whole lot of
BCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect us,'' Tulane defensive end Kevin Reavis said. ``Look
at our record, look at our scores. We're not 11-0 by some fluke.
We're 11-0 because we can play football.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the French Quarter and cobblestone filth, up St.
Charles Street and past the old-money mansions, Tulane University
sits under a shroud of abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Green Wave was a novelty, a team that had a
cornerback named Michael Jordan and a trainer named Scott Pippin.
This season, they are one of two undefeated teams left in the
nation, a team that started out No. 43 and ended up No. 10. A team
that might have been hosed by the process.
</P>
<P>
   They have a quarterback _ Shaun King _ who set an NCAA record
for passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   They have an offense that has scored more than 40 points eight
times, beating a pair of bowl teams in Southern Mississippi and
Louisville. They toppled Navy, 42-24. And in the only barometer of
relativity, they beat Houston, 48-20.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA beat Houston, 42-24. Tennessee beat Houston, 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (King) is the MVP in the country,'' Houston Coach Kim
Helton said after losing to Tulane. ``Without that QB, they don't
win five games. I'm not ready to bronze his shoes, but if there's
another QB who's done as much for his school, I haven't seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   So the best snapshot of Tulane is this: An explosive offense, a
mediocre defense and a wonderful quarterback. In other words, no
different than UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're upset because we feel more worthy than some of the teams
playing on January 1,'' King said. ``But we understand. We're not
bitter. When you start out about 40, it's hard to work your way up.
And if you don't play a top-20 schedule, you're not going to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tulane is off for the Liberty Bowl on the afternoon of New
Year's Eve. Against Brigham Young (9-4). They are a team that got
lost inside the BCS computer, which is really the reason their head
coach isn't around anymore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QC; 
Tommy Bowden became a commodity about three weeks into the season,
when he was the only undefeated Bowden left in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrived in 1997, Tulane had won five games in the
previous three years. Its record in the previous six years was
16-62. It hadn't been to a bowl game since 1987. But in his debut
season, Tulane went 7-4, showcasing an innovative passing attack,
causing a major ripple in college football.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Green Wave beat up everybody. Bowden had turned
things around quickly, too quickly, and in early December, he was
gone. Off to Clemson, taking four assistants with him.
</P>
<P>
   Those four will hang around until the conclusion of the Liberty
Bowl, but the rest of the staff is in jeopardy. Those men may or
may not make the cut of Coach Chris Scelfo, whose credentials are a
bit murky. He was an assistant coach for three years at Georgia. He
is the son of a legendary Louisiana high school coach. No one knows
much about him because Scelfo is staying out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guy is to be commended,'' King said. ``He knows
these coaches got us to this level, and he's staying out of it.
It's hard to become the head of something and then sit and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it hard to say goodbye? Last year, Mack Brown left
10-1 North Carolina before its bowl game. It's ridiculous, and it
happens all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're 11-0? It may be a first in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of young guys at every position that Coach Bowden
had recruited,'' defensive tackle Phil Henderson said. ``The Bowden
name is very big in the South, and there were guys who thought they
were going to run his offense, guys who thought he would be here a
long time. We had to tell them what was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, there were rumors that the Sugar Bowl might select Tulane,
spotlighting the hometown heroes. That the Orange Bowl once
pondered pitting Bowden vs. Bowden. Even the yellow jackets from
the Fiesta Bowl paid a courtesy visit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was reality, followed by a hard-line decision:
</P>
<P>
   If you can go 11-0 at Tulane and not crack the BCS, well, it's
never going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulane offered me everything that Clemson did, except what I
was looking for,'' Bowden said. ``And it was the challenge to play
in the arena we've got to play in and the people we've got to play
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get where they're going, they're going someplace
else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QC; 
New Orleans rests below sea level, a city flanked by the
Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, a city on constant alert
for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Before a game at Southern Methodist, a tropical storm flooded
the area, forcing police to escort players to the airport. A home
game against Navy was played as the city braced for Hurricane
Georges. After it was over, Bowden immediately dispatched his
players to be with family _ most of whom had evacuated the city.
</P>
<P>
   And the following week, in preparation for Southern Miss and the
biggest game of the season, they had no indoor site to practice
(the Superdome was being used as a homeless shelter) and discovered
King had a broken bone in his left wrist. The underrated star wore
a cast for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, they have prevailed. A team that completely
upstaged Louisiana State, the local powerhouse. The architect who
stepping-stoned his way to a bigger stage and better rewards.
``We've been through obstacles all season long,'' Reavis said. ``So
a coach leaving isn't going to bother us too much. Not after what
we've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of right and wrong, the resiliency of young
athletes and the residue of a system gone wrong. Had Tulane been
rewarded, Bowden would've likely stuck around for the bowl game,
maybe another season.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, would it have killed Bowden to spend another
three weeks in New Orleans, to finish what he started?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but coaches come and go, and December is the month of
musical chairs. You can't waste all that free recruiting time with
players who can't help you next season, now can you? As for those
players stuck with broken hearts and broken promises, well, sorry,
that's just the way it goes.
</P>
<P>
   They are acting tough, talking mature, but inside, the Green
Wave knows what's up. It's Christmas Eve and they're on their own,
with one last chance to escape the vacuum of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, nobody will care where we were ranked or what bowl
we played in,'' King said. ``We'll be undefeated. Forever. And
people will remember.'' &QL;

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER 26
 &HT;    A new year is around the corner, and with it come resolutions
for personal improvement
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not
do, but what I hate I do. . . For I have the desire to do what is
good, but I cannot carry it out. . . . What a wretched man I am!''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Apostle Paul
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no mistaking the anguished tone of Paul as he
wrestles with a struggle common to most people _ the fierce quest
for personal transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul never revealed what he grappled with, only that it was a
``thorn in my flesh.'' But anyone trying to kick an addiction,
embarking on a new career, attempting to save a marriage or
friendship, or making any other such change in their life
understands how agonizing change can be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people persist, especially at this time of the year when
New Year's resolutions are made. Yet by spring, many of those
resolutions have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Change is difficult, but it adds zest to life, said Atlanta
psychiatrist Frank Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you change your pattern, it makes you more alert to
everything,'' Pittman said. ``When you take an unfamiliar route
home, or when you're around people you don't know as well, you
become more alert. You get bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other therapists, pastors and recovering addicts agree.
They offer some suggestions that might prove helpful as the New
Year approaches:
</P>
<P>
   DEVELOP A NEW HABIT ``I can resist everything except
temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   That line, from the 19th century Irish playwright Oscar Wilde,
contains a truth that many people are reluctant to admit. Bad
habits are hard to kick because people derive great pleasure and
comfort in them.
</P>
<P>
   Find a new set of habits to replace the old ones, Pittman said.
When he kicked a 30-year smoking habit in 1985, he discovered that
exercise gave him the physical satisfaction that he once craved
from cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Extend that principle to any bad habit, even ones that involve
moral failures, Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people who have been in the habit of messing around and
keeping things secret will substitute honesty and intimacy in their
marriage, they'll discover all sorts of wonderful things,'' Pittman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Millman, a speaker and best-selling author of ``Everyday
Enlightenment'' (Warner Books, $22), said sheer willpower isn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't focus on not doing something,'' he said. ``Focus on
doing something else.''Be wary of sweeping resolutions _ ``I'll
never do that again!'' Some people never change because they try to
tackle too much too soon, Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it all or nothing,'' he added. ``If they eat one
cookie or leer at one passing person, they feel as if they've
failed and they give up on the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Do what Michael Stanley, an Atlanta reiki and meditation
teacher, did when he quit smoking after 40 years. He started small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say, `I'm going to stop smoking,' '' said Stanley,
57. ``I said, `I will not smoke the next cigarette.' If we start
off with something too big, we're doomed to fail. If you have small
success, it encourages you to keep trying. Small success spurs us
on to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   GET UP AND MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Some change is not planned, but forced upon people. Newt
Gingrich and House Speaker-elect Bob Livingston resign from public
office, victims of political intrigue. Dallas Cowboy Deion Sanders,
reeling from divorce proceedings, contemplates suicide, but instead
embraces Christianity. Televangelist Jim Bakker is convicted of
swindling thousands of supporters of millions of dollars and
rethinks his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   People are fired, get divorced, become victims of crime and
nature. Often they become paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Keep moving. That's what Russell Malone did after being dropped
by a recording company in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, a jazz guitarist, was ``stunned'' at the time. The
Georgia native was settled comfortably in Atlanta and his solo
career seemed strong.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning that he had been dropped by Columbia, Malone
didn't miss a beat. He moved to New York and became a sought-after
sideman, playing with jazz greats such as Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Now Malone, 35, is a nationally known jazz guitarist. He
recently released a solo album, ``Sweet Georgia Peach,'' and is a
member of one of the most popular jazz acts today, the Diana Krall
Trio.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is clear. As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said,
don't get frozen by the ``paralysis of analysis.'' When change
shakes up your life, do something tangible: Move if you have to,
fill out that job application, learn a new skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody once told me, `You can be sitting on the right track,
but if you don't get up and move, you'll just get run over,' ''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BE LONE RANGER
</P>
<P>
   America loves cowboys. The image of the solitary lawman,
epitomized by actor Gary Cooper in the legendary film ``High
Noon,'' is embedded in the country's national psyche. And while
lone rangers may lick the bad guys, they rarely kick bad habits,
addiction counselors warn.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to kick an addiction, join a community of people
with the same mission. Don't try it alone.
</P>
<P>
   That is what saved Michael Stamps, an assistant pastor at
Antioch Baptist Church North.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps, 44, struggled with cocaine and alcohol addiction for
many years. He flirted with change but wasn't successful until he
joined a Christian recovery group at Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps has been clean for nine years. Recovering addicts he met
in church inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if they could do it, maybe I could do it, too,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Change your playmates if you want to change your habits, Stamps
said. ``If you want to be a millionaire, you don't hang around
broke people. All they can teach you is how to be broke.''
</P>
<P>
   HAVE A LITTLE FAITH
</P>
<P>
   ``You have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless
until they can find peace in you.''
</P>
<P>
   The quotation comes from St. Augustine, a man who knew about bad
habits. In his autobiographical ``The Confessions,'' Augustine said
only God's power delivered him from his hedonistic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Bad habits are often driven by a hunger that only a belief in
God can satisfy, many say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind any major addiction is a deep spiritual hunger,'' said
Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, a speaker and Episcopal priest whose bout
with overeating is detailed in ``Holy Hunger'' (Alfred Knopf, $23).
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of us, there's a hunger for intimacy, belonging and
communion with the source of life itself,'' she said. ``You need to
find a spiritual practice and spiritual community that feeds your
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   BE COMMITTED
</P>
<P>
   There's hope, even if you don't believe in God. Something in the
universe will still believe in you if you are committed to change,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Mayo not only believes that, she's seen it happen. The
41-year-old Smyrna resident founded the Center for Balanced Living,
where she ``coaches'' people on how to realize their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, when you get clear on what you want to do, what
you're passionate about and you commit to it, resources line up
that you never expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what W.H. Murray, a Scottish mountaineer, discovered
when he led an expedition to Mount Everest in 1951. His words are
worth noting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw
back, always ineffective concerning all acts of initiative (and
creation),'' Murray wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills
countless ideas and splendid plans; that the moment one definitely
commits oneself, then providence moves, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sorts of things occur to help one that would never
otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the
decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents
and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have
dreamt would have come his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.' ''
</P>

`THE FACULTY': INTENT ON TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Frankenstein, ``The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of cinema
for its body parts: Here are the paranoia and parasitism of
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy,
sharp-toothed creatures of ``Alien.'' Over there are the movie-wise
teen-agers of ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   The list could be extended, but the point is clear: this
mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken
over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no
new ground. But it has an engaging cast, with a half-dozen
appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all
that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world
as certain moviegoers know it.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's wittier passages, the six high schoolers
puzzling out the mysteries of a small new creature found on a
football field, a teacher's corpse in a closet and a sudden
outbreak of docility among their normally brutish and dysfunctional
schoolmates speculate that paranoid movies of the past may have
been part of a plot to soften up the public for the real invasion
of the body snatchers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``The Faculty,'' directed by Robert Rodriguez,
whose credits include ``El Mariachi'' and ``Desperado,'' and
written by the ubiquitous Kevin Williams of the ``Scream'' movies
and other adolescent adventures, opens with a clunky, bloody,
cheap-thrills sequence that colors what happens afterward with
triteness.
</P>
<P>
   So the chief pleasures of the film, such as they are, remain the
actors: Jordana Brewster as Delilah, the beauteous, bitchy
cheerleader captain and editor in chief of the school newspaper;
Shawn Hatosky as Stan, her soon-to-be former boyfriend, the
quarterback and captain of the Herrington High football team who is
undergoing a pre-midlife crisis and hanging up his pads; Clea
DuVall, as Stokely, the unhappy loner and science-fiction
aficionado whom Delilah taunts as a lesbian; Laura Harris as
Marybeth, the sweet blond Southern belle who is the new girl in
school; Josh Hartnett as the cool Zeke, who peddles homemade
inhalable substances, condoms and fake IDs, among other wares, but
happens to be a science genius, and Elijah Wood as Casey, the
decent little victim of the school bullies, who turns out just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   The adults aren't bad, either: Salma Hayek, all but hidden
behind her tissues as the sniffling school nurse; Bebe Neuwirth as
the principal; Famke Janssen as a seemingly shy teacher; Piper
Laurie as a senior faculty member, and Robert Patrick (the
indefatigable villain of ``Terminator 2'') as the volatile Coach
Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Herrington High is one of those schools that as the principal,
Drake, explains at the outset has no money for new computers, a
class trip to New York City or a school musical this year, but can
come up with cash for all the new football equipment its team
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The locals, she explains, are football people.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Faculty'' is the only movie they see this year, maybe
they can be fooled into believing that it is fresh and frightening.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   One morning in October, Steven M. Golden set upon his
competitors like a brawling barnyard dog.
</P>
<P>
   Golden is chief executive of Coolsavings, one of seven companies
vying to dominate a burgeoning field that barely existed two years
ago _ the electronic distribution of coupon-style discounts to
consumers. On Oct. 19, Coolsavings, which is based in Chicago,
announced the first of six lawsuits against all its rivals,
accusing them of infringing a patent it was granted in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a position of strength and following the advice
of attorneys about how we protect our position as an industry
leader,'' Golden said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Coolsavings' patent-and-sue strategy is aggressive but far from
unique. Companies in fiercely competitive technology industries
from communications and software to drugs and biotechnology are
giving the 12-gauge lawsuit a prominent place in the corporate gun
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of civil lawsuits in federal courts is rising again
after a slump in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And a recent
federal court of appeals decision that broadens the already wide
definition of a patentable process has opened the door for more
contentious patents, and thus more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers say strategic suing makes sense in lucrative new
drug and technology markets. ``It can definitely be a good idea if
it slows competitors and gets you a one- to two-year head start,''
said James G. Gilliland, an intellectual-property lawyer in San
Francisco who has many technology clients. ``That can make all the
difference in the world because, my goodness, there is a lot of
money to be made'' when a new idea first reaches the marketplace,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of more patents and more companies built around
patented technology has driven up the number of lawsuits, said
Eugene R. Quinn Jr., a lawyer and consultant who teaches at the
Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, N.H. In a review of federal
court records, Quinn found that the number of new patent-related
lawsuits grew to more than 2,100 in 1997, from 1,500 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic suing is not for the thin of wallet. The richer the
prize, the bloodier the warfare and the greater the likelihood that
the case will be tried rather than settled. The median cost to each
party in a patent trial is $1.2 million, according to the American
Intellectual Property Association; complex trials can run to $6
million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Zealous patent litigators are tutoring entrepreneurs in the art
of legal combat. Although most lawsuits are settled before trial,
suing or threatening to sue is viewed as a mandatory sign of
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, the only way to look credible in this game is to
play hardball,'' Quinn said. ``The name of the game is to take no
prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent disputes are still sometimes resolved without lawsuits
being filed, Gilliland said, but ``far less so than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At Coolsavings, the patented process involves the ability to aim
discount certificates at the most promising customers, a system the
company introduced ahead of competitors in March 1997, Golden said.
The goal of the lawsuits is to fend off the irksome prospect of
imitators' copying its methods while undercutting its prices. ``It
isn't right,'' he said. ``We had a lot of development costs, a lot
of hurdles to figure out our business formula.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coolsavings is not on a crusade. If his competitors will
come to the negotiating table, Golden said, he would consider ``any
solution that makes economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The targets of Coolsavings say the suits are groundless.
``Nuisance patent suits are part of the background noise'' in
technology-based businesses, said Bill Purcell, chief executive of
Planet U, one of the defendants. ``What happens is, when people get
a patent, they often get patent testosterone and think their patent
covers a lot of area it doesn't.'' He said his company prefers to
``win in the marketplace, not the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Patent duels can pay off big in the drug industry, where huge
brand-name drug makers like Glaxo Wellcome and Eli Lilly are
accustomed to throwing their legal weight around. A much smaller,
generic drug maker, Barr Laboratories, has profited richly by
identifying shaky patents on brand-name drugs and then either suing
the patent holder or provoking a suit, hoping to open the way for
Barr to market a generic version.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is set to begin in federal court in Indianapolis next
month in Lilly's suit against Barr over the validity of Lilly's
Prozac patent. Barr's chief executive, Bruce L. Downey, said Barr
would realize an additional $100 million in revenue if it wins.
</P>
<P>
   Downey is a lawyer, and he and Barr's senior vice president for
strategic business development, Paul M. Bisaro, once worked
together at a law firm. Going to court thus comes naturally for the
company, and the hunt for breakable patents is a permanent part of
its business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``A component of our business is to set about looking for
them,'' Downey said. ``We make no apologies for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr expects to spend $6 million to $8 million each time it goes
to trial, so Downey said he wanted to be sure the chances of
winning were at least 50 percent before joining battle.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Barr is two for three in big patent cases. It sued and
won a settlement from Zeneca Group in 1987 over tamoxifen, a breast
cancer drug; under the settlement, Barr became a distributor of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Barr provoked a suit from Glaxo Wellcome in 1991 by filing for
government approval to sell a generic version of AZT, which is used
to combat AIDS; Glaxo won, and Barr must wait until the patent
expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Barr did better when a similar filing in 1995 over the
antibiotic ziprofloxacin drew a suit from Bayer AG; Bayer agreed
last year to pay Barr up to $30 million a year until the patent
expires in 2003 and to allow Barr to distribute the antibiotic for
the final six months of the patent's term. The proceeds of its
patent battles help pay for Barr research aimed at creating
patentable new drugs of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies sometimes contend that bigger competitors who
win broad patents leave them no choice but to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Inc., which makes software to detect credit card fraud,
is suing a younger and much larger company, HNC Software, in
federal district court in Providence, R.I., contending predatory
and monopolistic practices over a broad patent recently won by HNC.
With 23 of the 25 top issuers of bank credit cards buying HNC's
system, Nestor felt so shut out that it had little option but to
seek relief in court, said the company's chief executive, David
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Campbell, HNC's marketing director, denied that HNC had
a monopoly and said the patent office had already settled the
question of whether HNC's anti-fraud neural network system was
patentable.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonable chill that has gripped the West and northern
Plains will begin retreating this Christmas Day as westerly winds
transport milder air eastward from the Pacific. After a frosty
morning in many locations, ample sunshine will boost daytime
readings into the 50s and 60s across southern California by
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, a fast flow of air from the Pacific Ocean will
direct a plume of moisture into far northern California and the
Northwest. Heavy rain will dampen coastal areas, especially toward
evening as a warm front crosses the region.
</P>
<P>
   Farther inland, freezing rain will glaze portions of the
Columbia River Valley as the moist Pacific air begins to dislodge
weighty cold air hovering near the ground. In addition, heavy snow
will fall in many of the west-facing mountain ranges of the
Northwest and northern Rockies, as the moist air is further lifted
and cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure that is splayed across the lower
Mississippi Valley and northern Middle Atlantic States will promote
dry weather in much of the East on Friday. An exception will be
near the southeast coast, where low pressure draws moist air
inland. Intermittent chilly rain will occur from south Georgia to
eastern North Carolina. Meanwhile, pockets of ice will fall further
inland where surface temperatures hover near freezing.

   In the wake of Thursday's early snow, abundant sunshine and
light winds will return to the northeast seaboard. Elsewhere, cool
air crossing the warmer waters of the Great Lakes will induce a few
snow showers over upstate New York and northern Michigan.

   Focus: Gelid Bakersfield
</P>
<P>
   A push of polar air into California has produced subfreezing
temperatures across the southern San Joaquin Valley, damaging much
of this year's citrus crop. At Bakersfield, near the southern end
of the Central Valley, readings fell to 19 degrees on Wednesday
morning, tying the lowest temperature ever recorded. On seven other
occasions in the past 70 years, the mercury at the Bakersfield
airport has reached this level. Light winds and clear skies on the
past several nights have contributed to the unusual chill. The cold
snap will end this weekend as milder air from the Pacific returns.

PARCELLS SAYS NEW ENGLAND EXPERIENCE PAST HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ He's been gone for two years. But absence only
has made Bill Parcells's shadow grow larger over his old team,
especially with the progress he's made with his new one.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has put New England behind him. Maybe he has. But New
England certainly hasn't put Parcells behind it, and the Jets coach
addressed that phenomenon Thursday before his team's late-morning
workout in preparation for Sunday's game against the Patriots at
the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media makes more of this,'' he said. ``I know a lot of
players on that team. I know what the relationships are. But what
it really is is good copy. I don't let the personal stuff get into
it. I never have. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he's no different than a lot of coaches and
players who are moving around in this era of free agency. He said
it will continue to happen and that football is a ``transient
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his former players in New England, the coach said,
``The only thing I allow myself to be satisfied about is that in
the time I was there, I brought in seven Pro Bowl players. That's
what makes me feel good. And I'm pretty sure Ted Johnson is going
to make it, so that will be eight. But I can't take credit for what
they've done the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said New England now is just another division rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good rivalry,'' he said. ``I expect the game to be
clean and hard-hitting. You acquire a respect for a quality
opponent and that's what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you say, coach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parcells ran his troops through an indoor practice because an
overnight snowstorm made the outside field too icy. The Jets will
have Friday morning off, but will report Friday afternoon for
practice at 1 _ outdoors _ and another outdoor walk-through
Saturday . . . There was no change on the status of either Keith
Byars (arm) or Aaron Glenn (ankle). Byars is expected to play, but
Glenn may have to miss his third straight game . . . Parcells said
he's still fond of Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak and revealed
that he and his wife used to dog-sit for Zolak's bulldog, Molly.
``There were couches in our house that I couldn't sit on, but they
were OK for Molly,'' Parcells said. He said Zolak had another
pooch, Boomer, but he was much larger and thus was not welcome in
the Parcells home . . . The Jets and Vinny Testaverde will not
complete a new contract for the quarterback anytime soon. There was
some incentive money moved to next year, Testaverde's option year,
and negotiations will continue probably into February. ``Fellas,
you might as well forget about this one for a while, because
nothing is going to happen,'' Parcells said. ``The urgency is
off.'' The Jets had hoped to have the deal done by Saturday for
salary cap reasons . . . The Jets are 3-0 in December, including
successive road victories vs. Miami and Buffalo. Parcells prides
himself on having December-ready teams; overall, his record for the
month is 35-20 for a 61.5 winning percentage . . . The Jets have
won five straight and nine of 10. The only loss in that stretch was
a 1-pointer at Indianapolis. Of course, one of the wins was the
disputed victory over Seattle. Of the Jets' four losses, three have
come to losing teams: Indianapolis, Baltimore, and St. Louis . . .
Only six Jets remain from Patriots coach Pete Carroll's stint as
New York's head man. Eight who played for Parcells in New England
have followed him to New York.

TOBIN SAYS HE'S HAD NO CONTACT WITH BOSTON SCIENTIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James R. Tobin, who resigned Wednesday as Biogen Inc.'s chief
executive officer, said Thursday he chuckled at Wall Street
speculation that he may be a candidate for chief operating officer
at Boston Scientific Corp., the Natick, Mass. medical device maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anyone there and Peter Nicolas (Boston
Scientific's chairman) and I have been trying for months to have
breakfast, which is now scheduled in February,'' said Tobin in a
telephone interview from Colorado, where he is on a ski vacation
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts said Tobin would make a strong
chief operating officer at Boston Scientific, which is currently
facing a federal probe stemming form the recall of one of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Tobin at Boston Scientific would make a lot of sense,
because they get a seasoned manager,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz,
a medical products analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he did not know much about the Boston Scientific job,
adding that he has made no immediate plans since informing Biogen's
board late Tuesday that he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that I will never go into a company as a Number 2,
having done that twice, and I am not going to do that again,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin spent 21 years at Baxter International, rising to the
Number 2 spot as president, before joining Biogen in February 1994
as president and chief operating officer. He became chief executive
officer in 1997, when chairman James Vincent turned over day-to-day
control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his decision to leave, Tobin stressed that there
were no differences with Vincent in their strategy for running
Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   But there were differences in styles, along with some
disagreements. Vincent ran Biogen from 1985 to 1997 and is credited
with turning the nearly bankrupt company around.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent's familiarity with all levels of Biogen reportedly led
to his involvement in certain details for which Tobin was
responsible, leading to a showdown with the board of directors. On
Tuesday, the board sided with Vincent, prompting Tobin to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a criticism, but if I were in his shoes and had been
there a long time, I might have done the same thing,'' said Tobin,
adding that he had a lot more fun running Biogen compared to his
last few years at Baxter Inernational.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Tobin said he wants to stay in the health-care
field, preferably at a smaller company than a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   He said he received several calls after a Wall Street analyst
during Bigen's conference call Wednesday questioned whether his
departure was a result of personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only weakness is chocolate,'' he said.

Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia
University, is the author of three books including ``Upon This
Rock: The Miracles of a Black Church.'' 
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early on a Sunday morning almost a decade ago, I
picked my way warily through the ruined streets of East New York,
Brooklyn, bound for the church that would change my life. I did not
know then, of course, how St. Paul Community Baptist Church would
transform me. I knew only that I intended to write a book on the
congregation and its pastor, the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   I understood that I was entering this black Christian church as
a double outsider, a white Jew. I was carrying a notebook, not a
Bible. But what confounded St. Paul's worshipers most of all was
that I was not observant even in my own faith. A Hasid, a Buddhist,
a Zoroastrian _ all would have made more sense to these Brooklyn
Baptists than I, the secular humanist.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday morning earlier this month, 10 hours before Hanukkah
and 12 days before Christmas, I drove back to St. Paul. Beside me
sat my rabbi, Gerald Zelizer of Temple Neve Shalom of Metuchen,
N.J. In taking him to St. Paul, I was reconciling the two parts of
my spiritual life. And as a practicing Jew, I was returning to this
Christian sanctuary that had become for me, paradoxically,
consecrated ground.
</P>
<P>
   The night sky was just lightening when Rabbi Zelizer and I
pulled off the Belt Parkway and up Pennsylvania Avenue. The 8 a.m.
service was nearly an hour away. I had planned to arrive early. I
wanted Rabbi Zelizer to see the same East New York I had seen those
years ago, the place where the police wore T-shirts emblazoned
``The Killing Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   A trash fire burned under a trestle of the elevated line. Wild
dogs prowled the rubble of the same vacant lots that had been there
in 1989. Outside the 24-hour smokeshops shuffled men with wildly
tufted hair and oil-smeared coats. I remembered the time I had
inadvertently stared at one too long and he mimed shooting me.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rabbi Zelizer and I caught sight of the first gaggle of
worshippers padding down New Lots Avenue: the little girl with
braids, the father with shaven head and a broad-shouldered topcoat,
the mother in heels and a wide-brimmed church hat. From my first
visit to East New York until now, this same tableau had never
failed to stir me. Every step that family took toward St. Paul
seemed an act of will and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Improbably as ever, a traffic jam formed outside St. Paul even
as most of New York was still snoring. The church itself had the
tan bricks and smoked windows of a branch library. It had been
built in the mid-1960s as a synagogue by Jews who never imagined
the suddenness with which block busting and panic selling and
street crime would drive them away. Some of the older members of
the St. Paul congregation still recall playing in bingo games in
the synagogue, all proceeds going to the building fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome,'' came the greetings as Rabbi Zelizer and I joined
the line on the church sidewalk. ``Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   Like anyone attending a reunion, I looked for the familiar
faces, so many of them, like mine, grayer and more deeply lined for
the passage of time. There they were: Melvin Heyward and Rose
Stokes, Leroy Howard and Nell Jones. Bill Scott, a new member of
the church when I first visited, now served on the board of elders.
In place of his once close-cropped hair hung dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the church, Rabbi Zelizer and I squeezed past tables
covered with the envelopes that hundreds of members use for
tithing: contributing to the church, by the example set in the Book
of Numbers, one-tenth of their earnings. On the billboard of the
main lobby hung posters for St. Paul's annual production of
Langston Hughes' ``Black Nativity.'' And beyond a set of double
doors sprawled the 1,200-seat sanctuary, overarched by the
skylights and cedar beams for which I remembered the worshipers
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rabbi Zelizer and I were hurried by ushers into the
minister's study. Youngblood was stripping off a kente-cloth
vestment, soaked through as he had preached during the 6 a.m.
service. The men knew each other by reputation through me, and both
had also been friends of Rabbi Marshall Meyer of Congregation B'nai
Jeshurun in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sam's second rabbi,'' Rabbi Zelizer said, extending his
hand to Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second?'' the minister asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the first,'' Rabbi Zelizer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then Youngblood, smiling, regarded me, back after 10 months'
absence to this home of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying around here,'' he joked deadpan, ``that when
you talk about the Devil, you bring him around.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't quite the Devil when I first arrived at St. Paul. I was
just the product of my past with all its antipathy toward religion.
My mother had grown up with observant, immigrant parents but had
broken with them over her youthful love affair with an Italian
Roman Catholic. My father, the child of anarchists, grew up among
Jews so fiercely secular they held dances on Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my childhood experimentation with Judaism had ended
when, two weeks before my bar mitzvah, the rabbi announced he would
not perform the ceremony because the reception lunch was not
sufficiently kosher. A different rabbi ultimately presided at the
service, but my parents' critique of religion had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something more than a purely journalistic curiosity had
brought me to St. Paul in 1989. I wondered what it meant to
believe; I wondered how it might change your life. And I thought
that maybe the answers would appear more visibly in an alien
environment, that I might learn more about myself by looking out
the window than in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife miscarried early in my time at St. Paul, a group of
church elders asked me to pray with them, and even in my
ambivalence I dropped to my knees. When a group of recovered drug
addicts testified to God's grace during one worship service, I
nearly wept at the memory of a friend who had died of an overdose.
It was as if, all through the three years I spent reporting and
writing my book about St. Paul, half of my brain was thinking and
half was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's not going to be done with you,'' Youngblood told me more
than once, ``till you're a rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   I remain a long way shy of the clergy. But St. Paul showed me
what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. meant by the phrase
``beloved community'': a church that not only lifted spirits but
also built housing, started schools, underwrote small businesses.
It set a standard, in other words, for whatever synagogue I might
attend. And it proved to me that feeling unworthy, far from
disqualifying one for faith, was perhaps the prerequisite for
having any.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after finishing my book on St. Paul in late 1991, I
moved to New Jersey and found Rabbi Zelizer's temple up the street.
I proceeded to break my atheist father's heart by joining. But even
he, when I took him to St. Paul one time, had to admit, ``I love
that church.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On this latest pilgrimage, I experienced the familiar with the
revelatory power of newness, seeing St. Paul through Rabbi
Zelizer's eyes. Not a pew was empty; the last arrivals stood three
deep along the rear wall. When the congregation swayed with the
power of praise-songs, of ``This Is the Place'' and ``The Blood
That Jesus Shed for Me,'' Rabbi Zelizer whispered to me, referring
to Jewish prayer, ``It's the same as davening, the undulation.''
When a dance troupe of the church's teen-agers performed on the
altar, Rabbi Zelizer leaned to me again and said, ``The exaltation,
you can transfer that exaltation from the secular into the
religious.''
</P>
<P>
   As I would explain later to the rabbi, he was not viewing just
any conventional black church. Youngblood had years earlier
nicknamed St. Paul ``Church Unusual''; he even had the slogan
stenciled on the church's vans. Nothing was more unusual on this
morning than his decision to leave the pulpit and sit beside Rabbi
Zelizer as the church's children and young adults paid tribute to a
man named Rochester Blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Rocky,'' read the embroidery on the maroon cardigan that
Blanks always wore during my time at St. Paul. ``Father Rocky''
might have been more accurate, for, as the church's financial
director and then its facilities manager, he served most
importantly as surrogate parent to scores of young people. Like so
many of them, he had grown up fatherless himself.
</P>
<P>
   All though the testimonial to Blanks, who was retiring to North
Carolina, Youngblood provided a running commentary to Rabbi
Zelizer. That girl dancing has a drug-addicted mother. That boy
just quit a gang. That young mother had a baby out of wedlock;
there were folks who wanted her kicked out of church. ``This is
sacred work,'' I overhead the rabbi tell the minister.
</P>
<P>
   Himself awed by the testimonial to Blanks, Youngblood decided
not even to deliver a sermon. He returned to the pulpit only
briefly toward the end of the service to speak of a passage from
the Gospel of John. It tells of the Apostles in a moment of doubt,
asking Jesus to show them God, as if their leader's miracles had
not offered proof enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do we fail to see the God in each other?''
Youngblood asked, mindful of Rochester Blanks and so many other
obscure heroes in his flock. ``Stop looking up for God. Start
looking down. Start looking around. And there's a better chance
you'll see God.''
</P>
<P>
   When the service heaved its last prayer, more than three hours
after it had begun, Rabbi Zelizer and I headed back to the car and
New Jersey. As I steered, he talked about resurrection. What he had
seen was resurrection, he said, the kind of literal, physical
resurrection that the sages of the Talmud said the Messiah would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Messiah, needless to say, in East New York, least
of all for two Jews. Neither of us could believe in Jesus as
anything more than human. ``But there's a way,'' Rabbi Zelizer said
of St. Paul's service, ``you can take the spirituality without the
theology.'' And I realized right then that my rabbi had expressed
just how Youngblood's church had blessed me.

IN POLITICS AND THE MARKETS, LESSONS FROM CHAOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Looking back at 1998 should instill a little
humility in Washington journalists and global investors. They are
two breeds with little in common, other than a fondness for
confidently predicting how events will unfold _ and then explaining
confidently how life interfered with an otherwise perfect scenario.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton's indiscretions were revealed, many a
talking head predicted that he would be gone in months. When the
Paula Jones civil suit was dismissed, journalists said impeachment
was inconceivable. Autumn airwaves were full of forecasts that the
Democrats would lose 10 to 20 seats in Congress. They gained five,
and impeachment was dead again. Until it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The masters of the world economy didn't do much better in 1998.
The International Monetary Fund thought its program to save
Indonesia would be carried out because President Suharto understood
his own interests and had an iron grip on his country. Wrong twice.
Then the IMF's managing director, Michel Camdessus, told the world
to pay no attention to investors fleeing Russia: ``Contrary to what
markets and commentators are imagining, this is not a crisis. This
is not a major development.''
</P>
<P>
   But those miscalculations pale beside the ones investors made.
America, they figured, had too much invested in Boris Yeltsin to
permit default and economic chaos in Russia. When both arrived
there, world markets fell into an abyss that looked bottomless by
October.
</P>
<P>
   Then the experts said the Asian contagion had finally arrived in
America and killed the boom; three interest-rate cuts later, the
Dow is back around 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will no doubt spend decades dissecting the lessons of
roller-coaster 1998. Here are a few to get them started. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The markets prefer paralysis in Washington _ until
someone needs a bailout.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for Wall Street's so-what view of impeachment
comes from the libertarian song book: A distracted Congress won't
have time to raise the minimum wage or otherwise monkey with the
economy. ``It's the kind of thing you hear when markets are good,''
said Allen Sinai, chief global strategist for Primark Decision
Economics, a consulting firm in Boston. ``People on the Street
convince themselves that the government can only mess things up.
When things go bad, then it's a different tune.''
</P>
<P>
   The tune certainly was different when Long-Term Capital
Management was on the verge of collapse and the Federal Reserve
instigated a private-sector bailout. White House and Treasury
phones were abuzz with the suggestions by everyone from George
Soros to the partners at Goldman, Sachs about what the president
should say and when he should say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the turning point was the president's speech at the
Council on Foreign Relations,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin
said in an interview last week, referring to Clinton's call in
September _ scripted by Rubin and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan
_ for policies to promote growth rather than contain inflation.
Interest rates fell around the world as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that at crucial moments, government policy does
matter _ and government paralysis matters even more. Just ask the
Japanese. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)It's bad news when big economies stumble, but it can be
worse when little ones do.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Rubin, a staunch defender of the country's response to the
Asian crisis, concedes that his staff saw little chance of
Thailand's 1997 meltdown leading to global economic trouble. It was
a reasonable guess, since larger economies had tanked, as Mexico's
did in 1995, without causing tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
   But it was wrong, and it won't be the last bad guess. The world
tracks (and professes to understand) every ripple in the American
and Japanese economies but has little insight into developing
countries. Thailand, Indonesia and Russia are all examples of what
happens when, as one Clinton administration official puts it, ``you
put countries with 19th-century financial institutions into a
21st-century world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   So the surprises may not be over. A month after Brazil received
a $41.5 billion bailout, investors are not exactly rushing back in.
The IMF predicted last week that Russia's economy would shrink by
8.5 percent next year, topping anyone's list of social explosions
waiting to happen. And if China, which has bravely held off the
worst effects of the Asian crisis, starts to falter, all bets are
off. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Crony capitalism sank the Asians, but in Greenwich, it
has its advantages.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the IMF miss no opportunity to tell Asians why
they shouldn't bail out failing institutions to spare the
well-connected. So who could blame Japan for gloating when
Long-Term Capital Management was rescued? ``This looks a lot like
our program,'' observed Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister,
with a twinkle in his eye. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The markets have discounted the possibility of a long
impeachment trial in the Senate, because everyone knows what's
coming: a censure deal.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. It's a sure bet.

<P>
   Fifteen years ago, while taking my driving test, I bashed my car
into the vehicle behind me. Actually, it wasn't so much a bash as a
nudge, but the DMV guy was not amused. He flunked me.
</P>
<P>
   Traumatized at the time, I now realize that untold American
drivers can be as klutzy as I was then. They prove it every time
their cars bang into walls or mangle their garden tools while
pulling in and out of their garages.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents bruise more than egos; they can cost dearly in
bumper repairs. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Arlington, Va., this year subjected dozens of American- and
Japanese-made vehicles to four kinds of collisions at 5 miles an
hour, bumping the front of the vehicle into both flat and angled
barriers and the rear into a flat barrier and a pole. Total damage
ranged from $134 for a 1998 Volkswagen New Beetle to $6,086 for a
Lexus LS 400.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, California and Hawaii require car makers to inform
consumers about the sturdiness of their bumpers. But neither state
sets standards, and federal law requires only that a bumper be
strong enough to prevent damage to the rest of the car _ but not to
itself _ in crashes against stationary objects at 2.5 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   No one I know makes enough money to be frivolous with his
bumper. And though a tennis ball dangling on a string from the
garage ceiling has proved effective for many as a guidepost of when
to stop, who really wants such an eyesore in the garage?
</P>
<P>
   Well, help is at hand for us bumper bashers and wall whackers,
in the form of the Park Zone, a battery-powered device that gives a
driver visual warnings as the vehicle approaches physical
obstructions, whether walls or wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, bumpers were pieces of protruding aluminum,''
said Charles Balsamo, chief executive of Exeter Technologies of New
York, maker of the Park Zone. ``Today, they're part of the whole
body of the car and aren't effective for low-speed impact. The
garage environment is often overcrowded, and damage can be
inflicted on other objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the Park Zone, which looks like a miniature traffic
light, guides you into the proper parking position. As your car
enters the garage, an ultrasonic sensor activates a green light. As
you inch forward, a yellow light warns you to prepare to stop when
you are nearing contact. Then a red light flashes, indicating that
you must stop or the laws of physics will come into play.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Zone is easy to set up. Attach it at eye level on your
garage wall, park your car in the desired spot, connect the coiled
cord, press the activation button, and voila! The distance from
wall to vehicle is programmed into the sensor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure,'' said Joseph Fimone of Juno Beach, Fla., who
owns a Park Zone and whose own jury-rigged systems have let him
down in the past. ``I had a ball hanging from the ceiling that I
used to bang my head on. Then I had a board, and I tripped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   How well does the gadget work? Since I don't have a car, I
coerced a friend, Bob Levitt of Brooklyn, into helping me with a
test. Bob is passionate about his car, an emotion many people
share.
</P>
<P>
   According to a November survey by MSN Car Point, Microsoft's
automotive Web site, 65 percent of Americans think of their cars as
members of their families; 1 out of 3 compare giving up their car
to losing a dear friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob may have more reason than most to love his car. It is
gorgeous _ an aqua 1966 Oldsmobile Delta that is roughly the size
of Trenton, and he admits that he bought it partly to impress
women. (So far, he tells me, it has attracted only ``middle-aged,
toothless men who want to know if that's the original paint job.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he is fanatic about its upkeep, and he parks it in a
lot where spare tires line the walls, ``so when you bang into them,
you hit the tire and don't injure your bumper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob confesses to more than one parking misadventure. ``One time,
cruising into my parents' garage in Massachusetts, I got a little
overzealous and took out a workbench,'' he recalled, with more than
a trace of pride. ``I also managed to scrape and break wooden
two-by-fours off the side, and I assaulted a garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bob is a Park Zone candidate. We met one Saturday in
midtown Manhattan, and after spending 35 minutes in search of an
empty lot, we pulled into the bottom level of a garage at 50th
Street and Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   I hopped out, propped the Park Zone against the wall, calibrated
the distance by pressing the button, and leaned up next to it.
``Come on!'' I coaxed as he placed his foot on the gas. ``Closer!
Closer!''
</P>
<P>
   Bob inched the car forward, his eyes transfixed as the Park Zone
light shifted from green to yellow to red. His gas guzzler's
chrome-plated prow was a mere six inches away from my knees when he
stopped. Happily, both it and they survived without a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, we were impressed. ``It's a good thing for the elderly,
who'll pay attention to it,'' Bob said, ``and because it's
mindless, it's good for 16-year-olds, who usually bash into
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I told him the price: $79.95, or $89.95 for the Platinum
Park Zone, a silver-colored version featuring an alternating
current adapter. He turned pale. ``That's dinner and a movie!'' he
said. ``What's wrong with the hanging ball?''
</P>
<P>
   With that, we made our way out the garage and headed down Ninth
Avenue. No one commented on the impeccable bumper. But they loved
the paint job.

HOLIDAY PERVADES, EVEN ON A MILITARY MISSION

<P>
   ABOARD THE USS BELLEAU WOOD, Persian Gulf _ On schedule in the
rec room tonight: ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' by order of the
chaplain. Plastic holly leaves and strips of tinsel are taped to
bulkhead doors within the vast hull of this amphibious assault
ship. A dungareed sailor absently whistles an off-key ``Angels We
Have Heard on High'' as he scans the shimmering heat-hazed horizon
with powerful binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   It is the season of peace on earth, good will toward men. But
this season seems preposterously incongruous with the mission of
the thousands of American soldiers, sailors and aviators massed in
a region that has become synonymous with bloodshed and turmoil. And
the official line spouted on the Belleau Wood is that Christmas is
just another routine working day for its stretched-to-the edge
complement of 2,200 Navy personnel and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Not that many buy the official line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the spirit of Christmas will find you no matter you
are, no matter how strange the setting,'' said Maj. John A. Wilson
of Lynn, Marine pilot and operations officer for the helicopters
and Harrier ``jump jets'' stationed aboard the 820-foot vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Hey, I can't be thinking of Christmas out here,' ''
he said. ``But, truth is, you can't stop thinking about Christmas,
or your loved ones. It can be a bittersweet time of year for
military people. You just try to stop that ache and count your
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson spent the four-day Desert Fox operation flying helicopter
support missions for the Marines who were landed on the desert
shores at the outset of the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace holds, he'll spend Christmas flying ``Santa
missions'' _ his Huey gunship laden like St. Nick's sled with the
first hot chow deliveries for the devil dogs, as Marines call
themselves, still hunkered in foxholes near the Iraq border.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our Marines onshore, a taste of hot turkey and some mail
would be like _ well, like Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mail from home is pouring into the Persian Gulf at nearly
the volume of the ordnance and other military supplies: Christmas
cards, boxes of candy and _ aboard the Belleau Wood at least _ one
20-inch-tall living Christmas tree sent to devil dog Staff Sgt.
Eric Tausch. Love, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way from Durango, Colorado, and that good American
dirt is still fresh,'' said Tausch, showing off the
merrily-decorated little tree to the flight deck crew crowding
around. ``Smell that spruce! Is that the smell of Christmas, or
what?''
</P>
<P>
   The ship courses smoothly back and forth across the green
swells. On a sweep close to shore, the white minarets of Muslim
mosques can be seen rising from a settlement on the edge the
dazzling sands. Giant oil field flare towers, coincidentally
painted red, burn like a long row of holiday candles.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bill DeVine of Boston, a Roman Catholic priest by vocation,
a lieutenant commander by naval rank, is chaplain for the Belleau
Wood and two accompanying vessels, the USS Dubuque and the USS
Germantown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous world, as events of the past few days
have demonstrated,'' he said. ``Everyone aboard this ship is
working very hard to keep in readiness for a job most hope they
never have to do _ fight a war. So even with a Christmas sing-along
at 19:00 hours, decorations in the cafeteria or cookies from home,
the season is going to seem a little off-key out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``Our celebration can perhaps be a bit more
spiritual. A time of quiet prayer or reflection, not just
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the bridge, Lt. Commmander Jim Hruska of Brookline, Mass.,
navigator of the Belleau Wood, is preoccupied with electronic
charts and guidance systems. ``My job is to get the ship from Point
A to Point B as quickly and as safely as possible,'' he said. ``By
naval standards, the Persian Gulf is a tight body of water for
manuvering. There are lots of hazards, from mines to offshore oil
rigs. So I can't say I'm overflowing with the season's spirit. But
it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kelly, also from Massachusetts, is back at the ship's
base in Sasebo, Japan. And he acknowledged that it's a particularly
tough time of year to be apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cards and letters from home soften the blow. Believe me, a
Christmas card counts as something real precious when you are this
far from everyone you love,'' he said. ``I just hope my wife can
take comfort that I'm on a real life mission, serving the real
interests of our country. I know I take comfort from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's the occasional scoffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas? Just another 24 hours out on the boat, that's
all,'' said Maj. J.E. Szewczynski, a Marine Harrier pilot from
Yuma, Arizona. ``Sure I'd rather be with my wife and four children.
But I'm not, so I just focus on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   A warship is basically a floating delivery system of death and
destruction, a thing of cold steel and hard edges. But it's also a
community. And for all their tough talk and strutting, the sailors
and Marines aboard are bound by more than just duty and military
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got family back in the states who I miss worse than words
could possibly say,'' said Lt. Kristen A. Lasica of Chicago, part
of the Marine expeditionary unit transported to the Gulf by the
Belleau Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, corny as it sounds, the people aboard this
vessel, they're like family, too,'' she said ``We'll just be doing
our jobs on Christmas, sure. But we'll carrying the season in our
hearts and taking strength from each other.''

WHAT THE S&AMP;P KNEW THAT THE DOW DIDN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic of Dow industrials vs. S&AMP;P 500 is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)  
 (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index hit a new high last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks did not. Since June,
the S&AMP;P is up 37 percent, while the Dow is up 20 percent. Measured
over the last two years, the divergence is even wider, with the S&AMP;P
up 60 percent and the Dow up 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These are unusually wide gaps between the two most popular and
closely watched indexes, which usually move at about the same pace,
up or down. The divergence leaves investors wondering how strong
the market has really been this year.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P's bettering of the Dow is likely to fuel its own growth
in the new year, said Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at
Prudential Securities, as investors throw money at index funds
based on the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the divergence is explained by what is going on in the
American economy. While computer shares have soared recently,
manufacturing stocks, especially those of many exporters, have been
crushed by economic turmoil in the rest of the world. The energy
industry, meanwhile, has been hit hard by lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the venerable Dow is more heavily loaded with the
companies that are being hurt and short on those that are doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four weeks, announcements of expected
disappointments in earnings have often been from Dow companies.
Nine of the Dow 30 _ Merck, Boeing, Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing, Union Carbide, Coca-Cola, J.P. Morgan, Caterpillar,
Sears and Procter &AMP; Gamble _ said their fourth-quarter profits
would be below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors are at work, too. One is the fact that the two
indexes are calculated differently. Since the Dow is based on
price, Dow stocks with higher prices have a bigger impact on the
change in the total index.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P is based on the change in a company's market
capitalization _ the product of the change in price and the amount
of stock outstanding. The bigger a company's market cap, the bigger
its impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, investors have been favoring a very
small group of big, well-known stocks. More of them are in the S&AMP;P
than in the Dow. Thirteen stocks, according to Merrill Lynch,
accounted for over half of this year's move in the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   But only five of them _ Wal-Mart Stores, IBM, Merck, Exxon and
General Electric _ are in the Dow. Those not in the Dow, but in the
S&AMP;P, were Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies,
Dell Computer, Pfizer, Home Depot and Time Warner. At the end of
November, 50 stocks accounted for half the total market
capitalization of the S&AMP;P 500, its greatest bias toward bigness in
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&AMP;P, noted
that if the S&AMP;P 500 index were calculated on a basis that weighed
each stock price equally _ which would bring it closer to the way
the Dow is calculated _ it would be up only 10.8 percent through
November. That is because almost half of the stocks in the S&AMP;P are
down for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But in an index that favors big market caps, the stocks that
have dropped have much less impact because the better performers
are so much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is not the best price gainers that account for
most of the jump in the S&AMP;P 500. Instead, it is the companies whose
market capitalizations have increased the most.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 S&AMP;P stocks with the biggest price moves through Wednesday
were Dell, EMC, Apple Computer, Ascend Communications, Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems, Unisys, MCI Worldcom, Staples and
Providian Financial. Only three of these are among the top 10
movers of the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric was one of the top movers of the S&AMP;P, but its
price is up just 34 percent, well below Dell's increase of 242
percent. Microsoft, having a big year, is up 117 percent. Providian
Financial, the 10th-best performer, is up 130 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what index reflects best what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Prestbo, editor of the Dow Jones indexes, said:
``Despite the vast difference in the stocks and the difference in
the calculation, over time the Dow and the S&AMP;P correlate 95 percent
of the time. They are both telling the same story about the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer of S&AMP;P argues that his index is a better reflection of
the entire economy because it is bigger than the Dow and because it
is changed more regularly with the addition and subtraction of
stocks. America Online will be added this week.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges that most individual investors focus on the
changes in their stocks' prices and, therefore, would probably be
more comfortable with the Dow. ``The Dow,'' he said, ``is an index
that the average guy would relate to more.''

SAVINGS BONDS PERK UP IN A NEW INCARNATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Savings bonds have long represented a triumph of convenience
over sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Available in denominations as small as $50, they are ideal as
gifts. But when it comes to returns, the 30 year savings bonds have
usually yielded less than comparable Treasury securities, because
the rates are pegged at about 90 percent of a five-year Treasury
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, investors may want to take a look at a new type of
savings bond, the so-called inflation-indexed variety. These seem
to be remarkably good deals at the moment, especially for investors
who want to stave off paying taxes on their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have clients who would find this very attractive for money
that they don't need now but may need in the future,'' said Rosilyn
Overton, a financial planner in Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The securities, known as ``I bonds,'' were introduced by the
Treasury in September. The goal was to bolster sales of savings
bonds, which have been flat, as well as to offer smaller investors
a bond as resistant to the effects of inflation as the
inflation-indexed Treasury bonds introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The I bonds are bought at face value in six denominations, from
$50 to $5,000, with the guarantee that their returns, which are
paid when the bonds are redeemed, will be protected from inflation
for up to 30 years. Rates are adjusted for inflation twice a year _
in early May and November.
</P>
<P>
   The current yield is 5.05 percent. That is the sum of the bond's
3.3 percent fixed rate of return and the inflation-adjustment rate
of 1.75 percent, which is based on the Consumer Price Index from
April through September.
</P>
<P>
   That means the bonds are not only already yielding more than
traditional Series EE savings bonds, whose current yield is 4.60
percent, but even more than conventional 30-year Treasury bonds,
now at 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How does the I bond stack up against the inflation-indexed
Treasury bond? The comparison gets tricky, because the Treasury
bond is adjusted differently. Its coupon is fixed, at 3.625 percent
for the 30-year variety; the principal is adjusted upward with the
price index to provide an inflation-adjusted yield.
</P>
<P>
   That carries immediate tax implications. Investors owe capital
gains taxes each year on the increased principal, in addition to
income tax on the payout.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, holders of I bonds, like those of other savings
bonds, do not owe tax until their bonds mature or are cashed in.
(Holders of plain-vanilla Treasury bonds pay tax on their income.)
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may be able to skirt some or all of the taxes on
I bonds by applying the earnings toward a child's college costs,
although the tax break applies only to single filers with adjusted
gross incomes of less than $67,250 or joint filers with less than
$108,350.
</P>
<P>
   As for convenience, I bonds can be bought at most banks and
financial institutions, or through some employers' payroll savings
programs. Buying Treasury securities means going through the more
tedious Treasury Direct program _ by mail or in person _ or through
a broker, who will charge a commission. Moreover, Treasuries start
at $1,000, so they are expensive stocking stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I bonds may not be right for every investor's sock. The
biggest drawback is the possibility that falling inflation will eat
into the inflation-linked earnings rate. In the event of deflation,
the I bond's fixed rate may actually be negated _ which means
returns can fall to zero. (The bond's principal, however, would not
be touched.)
</P>
<P>
   There are restrictions, too. Purchases are limited to $30,000 a
year. And investors who cash in the bonds within the first five
years forfeit three months of earnings.

PARTY POLITICS AND THE FIRST PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be better. The Huntington Library in San
Marino, Calif., has mounted an exhibition on George Washington that
focuses on ideas instead of artifacts. The wisdom of the first
president comes through loud and clear in the approximately 130
letters, manuscripts, maps and rare printed documents in the show,
many eerily relevant to the current national debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the bicentennial of Washington's death approaches in 1999,
several exhibitions about him, including ``Treasures From Mount
Vernon: George Washington Revealed,'' now at the New-York
Historical Society, have been organized. Washington was no
intellectual; his formal education ended when he was 15. But he was
a leader who could not bear the political squabbling that dominated
national affairs in the later years in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before his second inauguration, the president spoke to
Jefferson of the `extreme wretchedness of my existence while in
office,''' wrote John Rhodehamel, curator of the Huntington Library
show, in the catalog, ``The Great Experiment: George Washington and
the American Republic'' (Yale University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Rhodehamel continued: ``A few months later, Washington told his
Secretary of State that he regretted `but once' having agreed to
serve a second term. Unfortunately, that `once,' Washington
continued, was `every moment since.' He swore that `by God he had
rather be in his grave than in his present situation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was reacting to the bitter partisan battles between
Alexander Hamilton's Federalists and Thomas Jefferson's Republicans
that had begun in 1790.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's disillusionment with American politics shows up
again in the draft of his 1794 Annual Message, another item in the
show. In the draft, he expressed fears that the Whiskey Rebellion
in Pennsylvania might become an insurrection and worried about the
precarious state of the union.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``When we call to mind the gracious indulgences of
Heaven by which the American people became a nation, when we survey
the general prosperity of our Country, and look forward to the
riches, power and happiness to which it seems destined, with the
deepest regret do I announce to you that during your recess some of
the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an
insurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, when Connecticut's Governor, Jonathan Trumbull, asked
him to run for a third presidential term in 1800, he would not even
consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington explained that new political conditions in the
country made his candidacy irrelevant,'' Gordon S. Wood, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian, wrote in the catalog. ``In this new
democratic era of party politics, he said `personal influence,'
distinctions of character, no longer mattered. If the members of
the Republican Party `set up a broomstick' as a candidate and
called it a `true son of Liberty' or a `Democrat' or `any other
epithet that will suit their purpose,' it still would `command
their votes in toto!'''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition reveals a truly humane Washington, from his first
battles to his last will and testament.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter to his stepdaughter, Eliza Parke Custis
(Washington had no children of his own) he tried to advise her
about the dangers of passionate love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are emotions of a softer kind, to wch. the heart of a
girl turned eighteen, is susceptible,'' he wrote. ``Do not deceive
yourself in supposing that the only means by which these are to be
obtained, is to drink deep of the cup and revel in an ocean of
love. Love is a mighty pretty thing; but like all other delicious
things, it is cloying . . . too dainty a food to live upon alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition material is drawn from the collections of the
Huntington, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, Mount Vernon
and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American
History. The show will be at the Huntington through May 30, 1999;
then it moves to the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be too many Washington letters about partisan
politics around, but Washington letters are not as rare as one
might think. He wrote long letters about farm management at Mount
Vernon throughout the entire Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Washington material still on the market,''
said Chris Coover of Christie's. ``Some excellent letters are still
circulating privately.'' On Dec. 9 Christie's sold a letter from
Washington to his commander at Fort Pitt during the Western
campaign of 1780 for $25,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how moderate the prices are, even today,'' Coover
said. ``Washington's letters are less valuable than Jefferson's or
Lincoln's, though Washington had better handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15 Sotheby's sold four Washington letters, three
relating to the Revolutionary War, for $7,500 to $21,850 apiece.
Joseph Rubinfine, a veteran autograph dealer in West Palm Beach,
Fla., also has several Washington letters for sale, though nothing
on party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, agriculture was his principal interest,'' Rubinfine
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in ``George Washington's Mount Vernon,'' a new book
from the Monacelli Press, the architect Allan Greenberg tracked
Washington's passionate involvement with the house he acquired from
the estate of his half brother Lawrence in 1752. Washington, who
never left the United States, was a self-taught architect who
formed many of his ideas by reading English pattern books, unlike
Jefferson, who lived in Paris and studied the city's architecture.
the Legion of Honor, across the street from the Musee d'Orsay.)
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg points out details in Mount Vernon one might not
notice, like its asymmetrical facade. He says Washington was making
a statement about the difference between a mansion in the New World
versus the Old. He also notes that the plaster decorations in the
dining room ceiling depict shovels and plows, not the gilded
weapons or musical instruments seen at Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas will undoubtedly be studied anew next year, as other
Washington exhibitions open. On Jan. 28 the Octagon, the museum of
the American Architectural Foundation in Washington, plans to open
``George Washington: Architect.'' In April Greenberg will publish
his own book on Washington as an architect and on April 18 will
lecture at the Huntington.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They had been here before, of course, but somehow it
all looked different.
</P>
<P>
   ``So clean, well lighted, much more than I remember,'' said
Adolph Green, words drawn out and tone approving, as he shuffled
toward the mammoth apotosaurus on the fourth floor of the American
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Times Square, all cleaned up,'' responded Betty
Comden briskly. ``I remember vividly the first time I was here,
going to the cafeteria and having raisin bread with cream cheese.
The cafeteria looked Mexican or Aztec. It seemed quite exotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember best was not being in class, not being in
school, what a joy,'' Green chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``An excursion,'' she replied. ``I love excursions.'' Since they
have become suddenly ubiquitous at the age of 83, it seemed a good
time to take an excursion with Green and Ms. Comden, the
longest-running partnership the musical theater has produced. The
two have been professional but not personal partners since 1938. He
has been married to the actress Phyllis Newman for 38 years. Her
husband, Steven Kyle, died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``On the Town,'' the adaptation of the Jerome
Robbins-Leonard Bernstein ballet ``Fancy Free,'' which was first
produced in 1944 and is being revived on Broadway by the Public
Theater. There is ``Peter Pan,'' this time starring Cathy Rigby at
the Marquis, and destined, one assumes, to be running in perpetuity
somewhere on earth. There is even a new libretto for the Met's
revival of ``Die Fledermaus,'' Johann Strauss Jr.'s operetta, which
has been around quite a bit longer than Comden and Green have.
</P>
<P>
   Recreating ``On the Town's'' manic 24-hour jaunt via subway and
taxi from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to Times Square to Coney Island
and back was out of the question. And even if the time, energy and
patience with the Christmas traffic were there, the Navy Yard and
the amusement park at Coney Island are shadows of what they once
were and most of the clubs that were the inspiration for the ones
in the three sailors' one-day leave are gone.
</P>
<P>
   But a scaled-down tour seemed worth a try, beginning at the
museum's magnificent piles of bones _ tyrannosaurus rex and
apotosaurus _ where the sailor Ozzie, originally played by Green,
meets the anthropologist Claire DeLoone, originally played by Ms.
Comden.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comden, thin, obsessively punctual and as decisive as a
surgical knife, was outfitted in a dramatic blue Koos fringed coat
with bold patches of color and a black shawl. Green, warm and
avuncular, his vision clouded by cataracts and his gait more
noticeably slowed by age, was in a checked shirt, blue tie, blue
blazer and heavy winter coat.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in 1944, ``On the Town'' established itself as an
instant classic. The current production, directed by George C.
Wolfe, has received hot and cold reviews.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a good deal more than half a century in the
theater to render Ms. Comden and Green oblivious to the critical
reaction to their work. Indeed, the passage of time may have made
them that much more attuned. So when asked whether it's fair to
wonder if the adventures of 1944 resonate with audiences in 1998,
whether a night of wartime romance can compete with Nicole Kidman's
curves, Ms. Comden jumped on the question like Sammy Sosa getting a
chest-high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feelings and thoughts and relationships are universal, so
it's very contemporary,'' she said with a hint of pique. ``And the
women in it are very aggressive, very forthcoming, very much of
today. In wartime all the women had men's jobs, so it's very
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   With equal conviction, if less edge, Green added: ``It's totally
not enveloped in nostalgia of any kind. There's not a hint of it.
No `Remember what it was like.' We couldn't be happier with the
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comden threw in: ``And the music is timeless. Not the
jitterbug music of the '40s. It's brilliant symphonic music. Very
fresh, very original.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it didn't take long to get two things straight. The
first is that rather than a couple who finish each other's
sentences, Ms. Comden and Green are more like a single creature
with two brains, heads and mouths. They both gobble up all
questions, ornament each other's thoughts and edit each other's
declarations, like some agreeable beast out of Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that rather than being content with the status of
revered eminences grises, they see themselves very much as players,
who still hole up in a room together almost every day and go to
work as they have for the last six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Neither should be a surprise. Ms. Comden, born in Brooklyn in
May 1915, and Green, born in the Bronx seven months later, got to
know each other when they were both going to auditions in the
1930s, and began working together in 1938, when Max Gordon of the
Village Vanguard decided he wanted a musical group to perform on a
Sunday night. He first recruited Judy Holliday, who brought in
Green, who recruited Ms. Comden. Eventually there were five of them
called the Revuers. They thought of themselves more as performers
who wrote their own material than as writers until their friend
Leonard Bernstein, who first met Green at a summer camp where
Bernstein was working in 1937, came to them with the idea of
turning ``Fancy Free'' into a musical.
</P>
<P>
   They had never written a musical but saw no reason why they
couldn't. By the time they were done, the show became the first to
be sold to Hollywood before it was even produced on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Their next effort was ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' and as the years
went by their projects included Broadway shows like ``Bells Are
Ringing,'' ``Applause'' and ``On the 20th Century'' and films like
``The Band Wagon'' and ``Singin' in the Rain,'' which is still
perhaps the most acclaimed film musical of all time. They have won
six Tony Awards as book writers or lyricists and were nominated for
two Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, they were less interested in awards
then in mugging for the cameras, breaking into a hammy rendition of
``Carried Away'' from ``On the Town'' as baffled children, parents
and dinosaurs looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's walk more swiftly, Adolph,'' Ms. Green urged as they
made their way from the dinosaurs to the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will walk as swiftly as will please any summer's day,'' he
replied jauntily, as they headed toward a waiting car for stop No.
2, Carnegie Hall, a place with real-life and theatrical resonance
for them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the show, it's where Madame Dilly teaches music and where
Gabey, one of the three sailors, meets the object of his
infatuation, the Miss Turnstiles winner whose subway poster sets
the plot in motion. But it is also where Bernstein used to live in
one of the studios that have housed such artists as George
Balanchine and Isadora Duncan, and where Enrico Caruso made his
first U.S. recordings in 1904 for $400 a song at the Victor Talking
Machine Company studio.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there is much back and forthing. About whether the
music teacher was changed in the movie of ``On the Town'' to a
ballet teacher named Madame Dilyovska. About Bernstein and Green's
both being hospitalized for minor operations at the beginning of
the writing of ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolph had his tonsils out and had to rest his voice,'' Ms.
Comden explained. ``It was like losing life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   They made their way through grotto-like hallways, an acting
studio here, an opera soprano's voice bouncing off the walls there,
until they came to No. 803, which houses Carnegie Hall's marketing
department and leads to what used to be No. 805, Bernstein's
apartment, where Green crashed for months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things they see is a framed photograph of
Bernstein, looking impossibly young, resting his head on his right
hand and looking straight at the camera as he posed by the
south-facing window in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' said Ms. Comden, momentarily thrown for a
loop. ``It's a picture of Lenny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken by this window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what a beautiful young man he was.''
</P>
<P>
   They looked on silently and then together recreated the
apartment, explaining where the piano, the daybed and the few
chairs were. Bernstein lived there in the early 1940s; it is where
he wrote ``Fancy Free.''
</P>
<P>
   They lingered a bit and headed for the streets, Green, in a
counter-nostalgic mood, grumbling about what a dump the old Coney
Island was. Then it was time for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Where to go? There are no more Nedick's, the Nathan's-like hot
dog stands featured in the play. Sardi's would be appropriate, but
it's crowded and noisy. So instead we headed to the Supreme
Macaroni Company on Ninth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets, not
``On the Town'' but eternal New York. The decor _ white tile floor,
Italian family photographs, hanging wine bottles _ looks precisely
the same as it did when it opened in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comden briskly ordered antipasto with a glass of water.
Green fussed about a bit and then ordered antipasto with a cup of
tea. They swatted away the predictable questions about who does
what with the predictable response that they both do everything
together. Still, it's not hard to see some differences. Certainly,
the brassy independent women of ``On the Town'' could not be more
like Ms. Comden. And she is the organized one who has put their
words down on paper, first on a yellow legal pad, now on a
computer, while he's still trying to make his peace with any kind
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that confused me was the electric light,'' he
said. ``I remember how staggered I was back when you picked up the
phone and said what number you wanted when a dial took its place,
for Pete's sake. I'm still staggered by that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``One thing we used to fight about was time, having
spent many days waiting for Adolph. But that's over now. He's very
prompt, and I'm getting a little messier around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he responded agreeably. ``I've been whipped into total
submission.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they agree on more than they disagree: on Stephen
Sondheim's brilliance, on ``Guys and Dolls'' as the best musical of
them all, on the mixed blessings of the new, sanitized, cleaned-up
Times Square, on the contemporary curses of too many skyscrapers
blotting out the sky and too much traffic clogging the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But having spent their entire lives living in and chronicling
New York, they are almost too much a part of the city to notice it.
So when asked to philosophize whether the city was more a place
transformed or more a place essentially like the one that entranced
their wartime sailors, they drew mutual blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the tawdry, disreputable aspects of the old days,'' she
said, ``But I don't think too much about it. This is where we live
and work and get up every morning. Does one get up and look at
one's environs and decode it? We don't do that. But it's still an
extraordinary city. Look at all the tourists. You can't move
because of them. They're not that much different from our sailors
from Scranton, Peoria and Iowa. I don't think they leave
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only 2:30 and Ms. Comden is hurrying us along so she can
make her 4 o'clock appointment. But we have one more stop.
</P>
<P>
   We make it down to the West Village on the off chance someone
will be at the Village Vanguard, where they played their first job
one Sunday evening for $5 each. Indeed, it was the first time any
paid act played there, and the regular poets and village habitues
hooted and hissed, figuring the place was just fine as the hangout
it was.
</P>
<P>
   The door was locked, but Peter Bondy the piano tuner was there
waiting, and sure enough someone promptly showed up to let him in.
We all descended the trapdoor-like staircase together.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Lorraine Gordon, the club owner and widow of Max
Gordon, showed up. They reminisced about the Sunday comics that
used to wallpaper the place and about clubs long gone, and then
wandered behind the bar where the original performing area was
until Ms. Comden's 4 o'clock was looming, and it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're welcome to come in for an audition Sunday night,'' Mrs.
Gordon said sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't have any new material,'' Ms. Comden replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' she said. ``The old is still good. The old is
just fine.''

 &HT;    All rocks are beautiful if you feel their spirit
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing else is like a rock. Without moving, it exudes strength,
mystery, independence, energy. And beauty. I've never met a rock I
didn't want to take home.
</P>
<P>
   In woods, on beaches, in the middle of streams, stones of all
shapes, colors and sizes assert themselves, winding up in my
traveling bags, car trunk, pockets _ on their way to my mantels,
tables, floors and garden. Perfect souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the free ones. Too, I've bought a few, from 2-ton
field stones down to 6-inch-diameter pyrite suns that once lay
hundreds of feet deep, in the coal mines of Southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Shona sculpture from Zimbabwe, a face carved
loosely out of serpentine. Part of what attracted me to this piece
was what the artist said about rocks, something similar to what
people practicing the Shinto religion in Japan say: Everything on
earth, animate or inanimate, has a spirit.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, North Georgia is flowing over with spirits. At
my cabin in McCaysville, where I have spent much of the last year
building a garden, I've found a rock paradise, a bonanza of
spirits, including The Rock, some 20 feet across _ doubtless a site
of Cherokee council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In the highlands, you dig a five-gallon hole, and you get three
gallons of rocks. Thus, like many others around the area, I use
stones to outline just about every space on the land. I've
constructed a rock garden, piled up rocks just to view, taken one
to rock lover Harry Abernathy, who cut it in half and made me two
bolos. Others I've hauled off to my Atlanta garden for rockeries.
</P>
<P>
   Each stone feels special to me, but not everyone thinks rocks
hung the moon. Friend and mountain neighbor Pat Holmes says she
gave up on gardening right away after moving to the area about a
dozen years ago: ``Every place I tried to dig was Rock City.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirit City, Pat. Spirit City.

 &HT;    Hastings' `Rich Harvest' plants ideas for spring
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The days between Christmas and New Year's are
traditionally time spent with seed catalogs and dreams of spring
planting.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize that H.G. Hastings, the famed and most
respected seedsman, fostered that idea until I read the new book by
his grandson, Don Hastings. Family and plant workers hurried in the
days after Christmas to get the seed catalogs in the mail, Don
wrote, and I remember that it renewed the excitement that could
have dissipated otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, a strong devotee of the Hastings company, and all my
farmer friends in the Roswell area, who swore by Hastings and
especially Hastings Prolific corn, probably felt there was no more
constructive way of using that between-holidays time.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Don's book is another good way to use the time. If you
have or haven't received the pretty catalogs yet, you will be
happily engrossed in the pleasures and problems of tilling the
soil, with ``Rich Harvest: A Life in the Garden'' (Longstreet,
$20).
</P>
<P>
   The story of an enduring seeds and plants enterprise has not
been told before, so far as I know. The Hastings family, going back
to 1889, have been the authoritative voice on Southern gardening.
Don's grandfather and father, Harry Hastings and Donald Hastings,
and Don's mother, Louise Hastings, have written, demonstrated,
grown and sold almost every vegetable, flower, tree and vine known
to the South.
</P>
<P>
   Don himself served as a talk show host on radio and television
for 14 years, cheering, encouraging and sometimes scolding fumbling
tillers of the soil. He has spent years in Malaysia, Egypt and the
Philippines instructing horticulturists there in the commercial
growing of vast fields of vegetables to feed that part of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Don and his wife, Betsy, and their two sons are my neighbors,
and I have known when the family departed for one of their overseas
adventures. But I didn't know the fascinating details of problems
encountered and problems solved, as related in this book.
</P>
<P>
   The night I finished reading ``Rich Harvest,'' rain was
hammering on my cabin roof, or I think I would have been out in the
yard with a shovel trying to get ready for a vegetable garden. Don
is that inspiring. Although horticulture is his career (and also
that of his younger son, Chris, who is getting his master's degree
in horticulture from Don's alma mater, Cornell University), you get
the idea that his heart really belongs to his own personal acres in
north Fulton County(Ga.). He has many amusing stories to tell of
growing up at the Hastings home, Floweracres(Ga.), near Griffin,
and toiling in the fields with the hired hands.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's gardens close to the house were an education in
themselves, but he gives abundant credit to Georgia's plain
farmers, who knew instinctively many secrets of the earth that
Cornell didn't teach him. He is also grateful to the professors
there, who instructed him in the science of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with the personal adventures here and abroad are concrete
facts about fertilizer, pesticides and the turning of the soil.
With typical generosity, Don gives credit to people who helped him
along the way, many of them well-known to all of us who showed up
at Hastings' Atlanta garden center with limp-leafed plants and
burning questions.
</P>
<P>
   I especially liked his chapter on old and distinguished trees on
Atlanta's streets. I'm planning a pilgrimage to see the grandpappy
of all our Burford holly shrubs in downtown Atlanta.

 &HT;    The year in style
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear from the looks showcased in our second
annual InStyle calendar that there's much to look forward to
wearing in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   When we asked retailers to send us the best styles they had for
each month of the year, they responded by selecting clothes that
emphasize luxurious fabrication, comfort tailoring and cheerful
colors. All things considered, 1998 was a good year for the
style-conscious. And from the look of things, 1999 is going to be
even better.

   Nod to Olmsted and the Ice Age
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Public Art Fund has big plans for the southeast
entrance to Central Park, officially known as the Doris C. Freedman
Plaza. The nonprofit Art Fund has orchestrated projects like the
water tower that the English artist Rachel Whiteread cast in resin
and installed on a SoHo roof this summer. For the last year and a
half, it has been working with Andrea Zittel, the American
installation artist, on a project for the park.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zittel will create a series of faux-rock outcroppings, made
in Palmyra, Va., with a steel infrastructure and layers of
carefully painted concrete. The work, ``Point of Interest,'' will
mimic the use of boulders by the park's original designer,
Frederick Law Olmsted, and echo those in the nearby zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The $75,000 project will be installed in April and is expected
to be the largest one that the organization has done for the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up for nearly a year and will change with the
backdrop of the seasons,'' said Susan K. Freedman, president of the
Public Art Fund. The plaza was named after her mother.
</P>
<P>
   New Sotheby's Venture
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has taken another giant step into territory once
reserved for dealers. The auction house announced this week that it
had organized an exhibition of Buddhist ritual and ceremonial
objects in association with Rossi &AMP; Rossi, London dealers who
specialize in Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said it has a financial interest in the items in the
show, but declined to discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years Sotheby's has bought art galleries and helped
dealers finance purchases. It also has gone into partnership with
dealers on private sales. But this is the first time it has entered
a retail venture with a gallery. Everything in the show is for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the show is another unexpected bit of news. It will
be held in the former Andre Emmerich Gallery in the Fuller
Building. Sotheby's, whose headquarters in New York, bought the
Emmerich Gallery two years ago but in October announced it was
closing the 45-year-old business and consolidating its operations
at Deitch Projects, a SoHo gallery partially owned by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   When Sotheby's announced it was closing Emmerich, it said space
in the Fuller Building was too expensive to keep. ``We haven't
given up the lease,'' said Matthew Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman.
``In addition to exhibitions, the space will be used for
auction-related exhibitions and private sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's declined to say how long the lease runs.
</P>
<P>
   From March 24 to April 3, when collectors and dealers will be in
New York for the Asian art auctions and the International Asian Art
Fair, the old Emmerich space will become a showcase for about 60
artworks. These will include gold and silver objects, textiles,
painting and sculpture, all from Tibet and the Himalayan region and
dating from the 12th to the 19th centuries. The objects were
gathered over several years by Rossi &AMP; Rossi from collectors and
private dealers in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that's never been shown before,'' said Carlton
C. Rochell Jr., who heads Sotheby's Asian departments worldwide.
``It's totally cutting edge. It won't compete with our auctions.
It's a great opportunity to educate the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Why will the show be at the Fuller Building?
</P>
<P>
   ``The show needs more time and space than Sotheby's premises
could allow,'' Rochell said. ``We will be able to give the show
4,000 square feet. It's a retail exhibition and should be on middle
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a financial benefit for them, as there is for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first Rossi &AMP; Rossi show in New York. In 1996 it
exhibited 30 Tibetan wooden covers made for manuscript containers
from the 12th to 15th centuries. That show was at the Barbara
Mathes Gallery, which is also in the Fuller Building.
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Rossi, an owner, said he did not believe the public or the
art world would have a negative reaction to Sotheby's involvement
in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antagonism between dealers and auction houses may have existed
in the 80's, but it's a situation we are moving away from,'' he
said. ``Sotheby's can help us create a market. They have an
infrastructure that's useful. Their marketing powers are bigger
than any single dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Branching Out
</P>
<P>
   The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown,
Mass., has been adding to its collection in significant directions.
For starters, it recently bought an important Old Master painting,
``Virgin and Child with Sts. Elizabeth and John the Baptist,''
painted around 1520 by Quentin Massys. The 25-by-20-inch panel
painting was reportedly bought by the museum for less than $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mostly 19th-century and Impressionist art, but we do
have some Old Masters,'' said Michael Conforti, the director of the
Clark. ``This is a devotional panel in its original frame and in
perfect condition, which is highly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Conforti said the Clark had known about the painting for about
three years. It came from a private British collection and will be
displayed with Renaissance works by Piero della Francesca, Perugino
and Hans Memling.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark spent the last eight months forming a serious
collection of 19th-century photographs. This is the institute's
first new area of collecting since its founding in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either now or never,'' Conforti said. ``We've combed
private collections and auction houses to see what's interesting in
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   At Christie's in London in May the Clark spent more than
$250,000 on five photographs. It also bought a Baldus, ``The House
of the Faloise'' (1857), from a private French collection and a
Degas photograph at Sotheby's in New York this fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong and
Beverly D'Angelo. Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed
but gut-slugging, renounced by its director yet still a showcase
for his effective style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who
develops a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its
toughest images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing,
presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials,
spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and
versatility, Norton plays a savage, racist killer who learns the
error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally effective plot
devices and trying to protect his younger brother ( Furlong).
Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BABE: PIG IN THE CITY,' starring Magda Szubanski and
four-legged friends. Directed by George Miller (G, 95 minutes).
Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout, remains
a cute little porker in this elaborately ambitious sequel. But once
he and his mistress head for the city, they must contend with many
discouraging urban sights, including Mickey Rooney in a purple
clown suit. And once he winds up at the eccentric, creature-filled
hotel that is the film's main setting, the film turns rougher than
its G rating suggests. Had this ``Babe'' been made first, it
wouldn't have prompted a sequel (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A BUG'S LIFE,' featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz.'' With the same anthropomorphism that
gave Lasseter's ``Toy Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued,
visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage
while incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of nature.
And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial expressions
that make this type of animation more and more invitingly lifelike
all the time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a black-tie psyche-bashing blowout is told
with a hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or
sound, and the effect is invigorating rather than austere.
Imaginative angles, nimble editing and fluid, agile camera work
keep the film spinning as a large Danish cast makes the festivities
seem utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for the
tell-all age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and vengeful
children. ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' says one
partygoer, putting it mildly (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CELEBRITY,' starring Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Joe Mantegna,
Winona Ryder and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Woody Allen (R, 113
minutes). Following in the footsteps of ``La Dolce Vita,'' Allen
presents a New York in which the only thing worse than being famous
for nothing is not being famous at all. At the center of it all he
places Branagh as a journalist with all the Allen tics but none of
the filmmaker's comic flair. The bitter breakup at the center of
the film (with Ms. Davis as the journalist's beached wife) is
regularly upstaged by guest-star segments, a few of which stand out
in witty relief against an otherwise weary backdrop. Charlize
Theron dazzles as a capricious, headstrong model, and Ms. Griffith
plays a pampered movie diva with aplomb. Best of all is Leonardo
DiCaprio's brief, wicked appearance as a bad-boy wonder (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance is one of the year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DANCING AT LUGHNASA,' starring Meryl Streep, Brid Brennan,
Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack. Directed by
Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the
other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from
Brian Friel's delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the
play's intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also
gained a good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint
rural charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five
unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the
return of their gently eccentric brother from many years'
missionary work in Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this
beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter
these characters' lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama
for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).

 &HT;    Pair's unflagging drive cleared a path to culture
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You don't have to walk into one of the two chapels in
this city's unique arts compound to get the feeling you are in a
sacred precinct.
</P>
<P>
   You can, instead, visit the artwork in the Menil Collection.
Whether you fall under the magic spell of the African masks or
enter the dream world of surrealist Belgian painter Rene Magritte,
this repository of John and Dominique de Menil's private art
collection is a spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique de Menil once wrote, ``Through art, God constantly
clears a path to our hearts.'' For the de Menils, many kinds of art
cleared the path. Modern and contemporary art may dominate this
highly regarded collection, but it also encompasses folk art and
ancient western and tribal arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Menil sets a standard for private collections that one
could only hope to have in one's city,'' said Atlanta's High Museum
of Art director Ned Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the serenity-inducing calm of their complex,
these French sophisticates kicked up quite a storm when they
arrived in provincial Houston of the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to do something, and they dragged everyone along
with them,'' said Peter Marzio, director of the city's Museum of
Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   They stamped Houston with their aesthetic vision, their taste,
even their liberal politics. Like a tornado spinning in off the
prairie, they stirred things up, bringing in speakers, getting
involved in arts organizations, even starting the equivalent of a
stock club for purchasing art. Theirs was a life of cultural
ferment, and they shared it with their fellow Houstonians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew who you'd meet when you went for dinner,''
recalled Louisa Stude Sarofim, president of the board of directors
of the Menil Foundation. ``It could be Roberto Rossellini or Marcel
Duchamp,'' referring to the Italian movie director and the
French-born artist.
</P>
<P>
   The de Menils, both deceased, didn't start collecting art in
earnest until after they came to Houston, where John ran
Dominique's family's business, Schlumberger Ltd. But once they got
going, their enthusiasm was unstoppable. It extended to
architecture as well as art. They asked Philip Johnson to design
their home, the first modernist residence in Houston, as well as
the master campus plan for the University of St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Contemporary Arts Museum was initially a focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they even bought works to fill out shows,'' said
retired art critic Ann Holmes. ``But they liked to be in charge.''
When a dissident faction fired Jermayne MacAgy, whom they had
brought in as director, the de Menils shifted their attention to
the University of St. Thomas, where MacAgy taught and curated.
After MacAgy's sudden death, Dominique took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to bring (ancient pre-Greek) Cycladic figures to
class in her purse,'' recalled gallery owner Fredericka Hunter, who
studied with her. ``People like (director Michelangelo) Antonioni
and (artist Andy) Warhol came through, and the students got to pick
them up at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever seeking the sacred in art _ not necessarily the
conventionally sacred _ the de Menils built the Rothko Chapel in
1971. Fourteen brooding, monumental, almost monochrome paintings by
the abstract expressionist master hang around the octagonal
interdenominational meditation room.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique carried on after her husband's death in 1973,
commissioning Italian architect Renzo Piano to design a museum
building for the collection and a smaller one devoted to Cy
Twombly's paintings and sculptures. A deceptive simplicity and
special attention to the quality of light characterize both highly
acclaimed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Indefatigable even at 75, Dominique, who died last year at 91,
saw to the rescue and restoration of some stolen Cypriot fresco
fragments. She commissioned her architect son Francois to design a
home for them. The Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, which opened in
1997, is exquisite. Like an abstracted orthodox church, its simple
exterior makes the otherworldly experience of interior that much
more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominique changed Houston,'' said Sarofim. ``She made art
acceptable, made people more conscious of art as being an essential
part of our life. Houston would be emptier, more soulless, but for
her.''

 &HT;    With its philanthropic tradition and Texas-size hunger for
top-tier status, the Houston's an arts-embracing role model
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This city of almost 4 million people is a booming New
South metropolis, sprawling all over the place and proud as punch
about it. Its downtown is an Oz of glass and steel and stone
skyscrapers rising from the plains. Freeways slice through the
cityscape.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Houston might seem to be just a more humid
version of Atlanta. Take a closer look. That hole in the ground
downtown is not a new high-rise in the making but a two-theater
performing arts center. The building under construction a few miles
down the road is not a new mall but a $55 million addition to
Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. Off in a quiet residential
neighborhood in between, the Menil Foundation has added another
building to an arts complex that draws pilgrims from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is home to the kind of visual arts philanthropy that
Atlanta institutions can only envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving,'' says Peter Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine
Arts, ``is a very Houston thing to do. It's in the water.
</P>
<P>
   People here believe in less government (and less government
funding), but they are willing to fill the gap. People give out of
a notion of public responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As the High Museum of Art movesll deliberateness to start
a fund drive for its addition in Atlanta, Houston's Museum of Fine
Arts is in the midst of a campaign so successful that it upped the
ante from $100 million to $112 million. Starting off with major
gifts also helps, such as $20 million from the Houston Endowment
and $15 million from longtime patron Carolyn Weiss Law, who also
purchased the land for the addition.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA already boasts a $400 million endowment, the
fifth-largest in the country, ahead of the Museum of Modern Art's
$300 million in New York and substantially beyond the High's $52
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their endowment is almost 10 times ours,'' said High director
Ned Rifkin. ``That speaks volumes about people's understanding of
what an endowment means to an institution. It's not a priority for
this community. Although we are working to orient future donors
that way, it takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements the wistful Rifkin could imagine with
such an endowment is a significant upgrade in the quality of the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on gifts, which is very different from targeting
works of art and purchasing them in a strategic way,'' he said.
``We do have significant endowments in the decorative arts, and you
can see the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of public responsibility is evident in the magnitude
of Houston's gift giving as well. When Audrey Jones Beck was
building her collection of late 19th-century and early modern
paintings, now a highlight at the Houston museum, she acquired not
just out of personal passion but, as she wrote, because of her
``dream to collect a representative group of impressionists works
for Houston.'' (Italics mine.)
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy is a value passed on through the generations. Beck
is the daughter of Jesse Jones, an oil and newspaper magnate who
founded the 50-year-old Houston Endowment, the largest foundation
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Marzio, 56, said that most of his board is younger than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were raised in a world of philanthropy,'' explained Louisa
Stude Sarofim, a patron of the Contemporary Arts Museum and many
smaller organizations. ``It was part of our upbringing to give and
make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a desk covered with postcards of works of art and
surrounded by examples of the works on paper she collects, the
Houstonian, president of the board of directors of the Menil
Foundation, remembers her mother reading letters from students her
family had helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to give if (the organization) is really original and
weaves into the fabric of the city,'' Sarofim said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents started the Brown Foundation, one of five or six
family foundations whose giving has been critical to Houston's
cultural life. None is as big as Atlanta's network of
Woodruff-related foundations, which boast $8.8 billion in combined
assets and have been key supporters of the city's cultural
institutions, among its wide array of interests. (The Houston
Endowment, for example, has $1.4 billion.) But together the Houston
foundations have formed an effective network of support. Also, like
the Woodruff, they provide validation that spurs other giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take a chance, we might, too,'' said Jack Doherty,
director of the Shell Oil Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family foundations are it,'' said Fredericka Hunter, owner
of Texas Gallery in Houston. ``No other city has foundations like
these.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil wealth is the source of much Houston foundation money, but
that shouldn't let Atlanta off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get lots of $55,000, $60,000
</P>
<P>
   checks (from individuals),'' Marzio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this place runs on. Givers set examples for the
others. Someone says, `If he can do it, I can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just money, however; it's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is content with achieving second-tier status and
doesn't feel inspired or moved to become truly world-class in the
arts,'' said Louise Shaw, former director of Nexus Contemporary Art
Center. ``That's reflected in our facilities, the quality of our
institutions, their support. We never seem to want to go the extra
mile to reach the top level.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, said Ann Holmes, who was art critic for the Houston
Chronicle for almost 50 years, ``When Houstonians get behind a
project, they want to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't wait around. ``People came back from World War II
after living in other places and wanted what they had seen
(elsewhere) in their own town,'' said Marti Mayo, director of the
Contemporary Arts Museum. ``They wanted a more cosmopolitan city.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of contemporary art devotees founded CAM in 1948. At
that time, it was only the third institution in the country devoted
to modern and contemporary art. Even today, there is no equivalent
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, CAM, which now has a $2.1 million budget,
aimed high. Early exhibits included a van Gogh show in 1951; ``The
Family of Man,'' Edward Steichen's milestone photography exhibit,
in 1956; and a Mark Rothko exhibit in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   One CAM patron attributes the support of the arts to the way
Houston welcomes all comers. ``Houston is very open,'' said Sissy
Kempner. ``You might not get into the Bayou Club (an exclusive
private club for old-guard Houstonians), but you can be on any
board in town if you can write the check.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a sunny room crowded, like the others in her home,
with modern and contemporary art, from a small Joseph Cornell
collage to a huge Pat Steir painting, the down-to-earth Kempner
relishes her role.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a bigger city, I would have never been on this board,'' she
said. ``This is an opportunity to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one observer links this openness to the wildcatter
mentality of early 20th-century Houston: It doesn't matter who you
are or where you are from as long as you produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is not very hierarchical,'' the Texas Gallery's Hunter
said. ``All boundaries are pretty porous.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the wildcatter mode, the city values innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of place where people are more accustomed to
taking risks,'' said artist Rick Lowe, who founded Project Row
Houses, an imaginative combination of art and community service in
the largely African-American Third Ward. ``They'll support
something because they think, `This is just weird enough to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This we-can-do-anything mentality may have been an impetus for
the Menil family, which has had a profound effect on the arts in
Houston. The French couple settled in Houston in the 1940s so that
John could run the family's oil-related business, Schlumberger Ltd.
Their complex of museums and chapels is only the most obvious
legacy of the indelible mark their infectious passion for art has
made on the history and direction of contemporary art in this city.
As CAM's Mayo said, ``They were utterly critical in forming a taste
for contemporary art and artists in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to benefiting from individual benefactors, Houston
institutions have learned that working together has its advantages.
Although the city is often cited as an example of the perils of no
zoning, 10 museums cluster midway between downtown and the medical
center. The Contemporary Arts Museum is across the street from the
Museum of Fine Arts. The children's and natural science museums are
nearby. Recently, they formed a district and are making a joint
effort to increase visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is just starting to figure out the benefits of
cooperation, as exemplified by the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau's cultural tourism initiative. Museum of Fine Arts patron
Nina Cullinan gave Houston an object lesson 40 years ago. When she
donated the money for the museum's second addition, Cullinan
included the proviso that the Contemporary Arts Museum could
exhibit in the new space when the MFA's schedule permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the three major fine art institutions _ MFA, CAM and
the Menil Foundation _ jointly hosted the retrospective of former
Texas artist Robert Rauschenberg organized by New York's Guggenheim
Museum. With their collective clout, according to Mayo, they were
able to find sponsors in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A few arts administrators and artists suggest that Houston is
not a paradise for the arts. As is true most everywhere, the larger
institutions get a larger slice of the dollar pie. Emily Todd,
director of DiverseWorks, a smaller alternative space, worries
about ``a lost generation of givers, middle-class baby boomers,''
while Mayo dismisses the image of bountiful Texas philanthropy as
``a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a core of Houstonians and foundations who do the bulk
of the giving. The challenge of arts institutions is to expand that
base,'' Mayo said. ``I see it changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing Houston's generosity to the arts from this side of the
bayou _ where getting support is, as Shaw says, ``an uphill
battle'' _ one can't help feeling that Mayo doesn't realize how
lucky she is.

 &HT;    Row house rehab project brings art and aid together
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The sound of children at play is a familiar one at
Project Row Houses, but then so is the thwack of an artist's hammer
or the recitation of a poet.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of 37-year-old artist Rick Lowe, this unusual
public art effort nurtures artists, community and even preservation
in 22 renovated shotgun houses in Houston's primarily
African-American Third Ward. Not to be confused with Habitat for
Humanity, which builds permanent homes for needy families, Project
Row Houses offers temporary residences for single mothers and a
slew of complementary programs as well as opportunities for
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the white houses are devoted to giving women a chance to
turn their lives around. They may live in one of the homes with
their children free for 12 to 18 months while they go to school and
attend in-house workshops. The organization uses some of the houses
as classrooms for child care as well.
</P>
<P>
   Artists do installations in eight of the houses. Their projects
have encompassed paintings on the walls, music, poetry and
discussion groups. They also mingle with and give workshops for the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to creative people and the philosophy that
creativity comes in all forms is one of the characteristics that
distinguishes this from other social programs, according to alumna
Assata Richards, who lived there in 1995-96 and is now pursuing a
doctorate in sociology at Penn State University. She also
appreciates how the program combined art and practical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an emphasis on personal development,'' said
Richards, 25. ``We had workshops on sexuality, spirituality,
parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Project Row Houses gave me an opportunity to finish my B.A.,
to build relationships with other women and with artists, to be
part of a larger community. It was so vibrant and busy, always
something going on. It has shaped who I am and who I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Radcliffe Bailey, one of the participating artists, is
also high on the project's concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of my best experiences as an artist working on
neighborhood projects,'' he said. ``In other places, I felt like it
was missionary work, almost a violation. . . . I brought my father
with me, and we met a lot of interesting people who would just walk
by. I think the neighborhood is very proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Using wood and other materials found in the community as well as
photos, electric candles and sound, Bailey turned a row house into
a series of shrines to a fictitious family he imagined living
there. He considers it one of his best installations.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have happened without a patron. In 1993, Lowe
was about to give up because the houses were going to be
demolished, and he couldn't come up with the money to buy the
property. Serendipitously, his partner, Deborah Grotfeldt,
mentioned the problem to Isaac Heimbinder, president of
Houston-based U.S. Home Corp., at a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to his wife and immediately arranged a crucial
$120,000, no-interest loan,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were able to see that this would be a tremendous
opportunity for the community,'' Heimbinder explained. ``The
program is very creative, and the mothers' program gives back to
the community immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, it offers access to art via living artists
and insight into how art is made. ``If you want people to go to the
ballet or the museum, you have to give them some education first,''
said Heimbinder, also a benefactor of DiverseWorks, an alternative
art presenter. ``Project Row Houses should be a role model for
other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heimbinders have continued to be important patrons, in
various ways. At their instigation, sponsors, vendors and local
interior designers involved in Houston's 1996 home show made
Project Row Houses their cause, furnishing the residential units
and donating all the fixtures instead of creating the standard
in-show vignettes. As a result, the houses have an individuality
and sense of permanence that support the project's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Help has come from local volunteers, who have come out and done
the hands-on renovation work, as well as grants from local
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston Endowment supports us, and the Menil Foundation
was very instrumental,'' Lowe said. ``This is one of those moments
when everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Project Row Houses won an award from the National Trust
for Historic Preservation. Proud as that makes him, Lowe sets his
priorities on less tangible achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art must enhance our ability to create a more humane
environment and serve as a process that brings people together,''
he said. ``We need new ways of thinking about improving these
communities.''
</P>

 &HT;    Compilation of Times reviews reflects a century of transience
and trends
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The carcasses of junked automobiles, lying in forgotten heaps
like discarded toys, testify to mortality of another kind. If the
showroom was the nursery, this is the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   We do better by people, usually, and sometimes by books as well.
A used-book store can be depressing or restorative, depending on
the air of neglect or quiet tribute. But it takes a hopeful heart
to think any book, brightly swaddled in its dust jacket, is
destined for a long life. Most, as David Hume would recall of his
first, ``A Treatise on Human Nature'' (today a classic in modern
philosophy), fall stillborn from the press.
</P>
<P>
   No obituary marks their brief existence. With books, it is the
birth notice, not the obit, that one looks for, and the review _
good or bad _ sometimes attends (or dogs) a book all its life.
Nowhere does one matter more than in The New York Times Book
Review. Indeed, the book that has not been reviewed in the Times is
almost an orphan; as far as its publisher is concerned, a book
doesn't exist until the Times has spoken.
</P>
<P>
   For a century now the Times has been American publishing's
herald and arbiter, pronouncing with magisterial authority on the
work of Henry James and Don DeLillo and an astonishing gallery in
between. Some do the job with equal dedication and others, on
occasion, with greater wit. But none does it as thoroughly, week
after week, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the cumulative result of so much excellence is, in one
respect, impermanence. ``To read through 100 years of The New Times
Book Review,'' its editor, Charles McGrath, writes in his
introduction to ``Books of the Century,'' ``is to be reminded,
forcefully, that almost nothing lasts. The 99 blue-bound volumes
containing the Book Review so far are crammed together on metal
shelving at the back of the Times's editorial library, some of them
unopened for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what is in that dusty repository is something to behold,
like the jawbone and metatarsus of a creature that has passed out
of existence. ``It is generally conceded,'' an anonymous reviewer
wrote on April 25, 1903 (signed reviews did not appear until the
1930s), ``that Booker T. Washington represents the best hope of the
negro in America, and it is certain that of all the leaders of his
people he has done the most for his fellows with the least friction
with the whites who are most nearly concerned, those of the
South.''
</P>
<P>
   The book under review was ``The Souls of Black Folk'' by W.E.B.
Du Bois.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, on April 13, 1952, Wright Morris was
responding to Ralph Ellison's ``Invisible Man'' this way: ``His
report in this novel might be subtitled, `Notes From Underground
America,' or `The Invisible Black Man in the Visible White Man's
World.' That is part of his story, but the deeper layer, revealed,
perhaps, in spite of himself, is the invisible man become visible.
The word, against all odds, becoming flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, from 1897 to 1997, there is close attention not just
to the book at hand but to the world in which we live. If, here and
there, that world today seems antiquarian, perhaps it is a measure
of its topicality yesterday. From Henry James' ``The Spoils of
Poynton,'' reviewed on Feb. 20, 1897, to DeLillo's ``Underworld,''
reviewed on Oct. 5, 1997, this centennial volume speaks to more
than the rise and fall of literary reputations or the fleeting
familiarity of this book or that. It speaks to a cultural
continuity, one whose breaks and interruptions are sometimes
jolting, to be sure, but nonetheless parts of a whole.
</P>
<P>
   James Joyce and Marcel Proust, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,
Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, Norman Mailer and Norman
Vincent Peale, James Michener and Aleksandr Solzhenitzyn, Grace
Metalious and Kate Millett, Margaret Mitchell and Thomas Pynchon _
all passed into view and some out of view.
</P>
<P>
   They often were greeted, as Charles McGrath says, with
surprising prescience. When Joyce's ``Ulysses'' _ canonized only a
couple of months ago as the Novel of the Century _ appeared in
1922, the Times' reviewer, one Dr. Joseph Collins, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I venture a prophecy: Not ten men or women out of a hundred
can read `Ulysses' through, and of the ten who succeed in doing so,
five of them will do it as a tour de force. I am probably the only
person, aside from the author, that has ever read it twice from
beginning to end. I have learned more psychology and psychiatry
from it than I did in ten years at the Neurological Institute. . .
. Stephen Dedalus . . . will pretend indifference to the
publication of a laudatory study of `Ulysses' a hundred years
hence, but he is as sure to get it as Dostoyevsky, and surer than
Mallarme.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a quibble, but in this instance and others a reader
wonders who the reviewer was. Dr. Joseph Collins, for one, was not
afraid to pat his own back in the midst of a prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising, in fact, what reviews saw beyond the moment.
The unsigned review of ``Gone With the Wind,'' published on July 5,
1936, was sure-footed as it was flat-footed: ``This is beyond a
doubt one of the most remarkable first novels produced by an
American writer. `Gone With The Wind' is by no means a great novel.
But it is a long while since the American reading public has been
offered such a bounteous feast of excellent story telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by decades, ``Books of the Century'' is not a catalog
of hits and misses but a kind of cultural retrospective _ even when
the subject seems almost too slight to notice. That, in fact, was
sometimes precisely the case. One of the amusements of this book is
the acknowledgment of occasional oversight. On Page 465, in a box
under the heading Oops!, there appears the following: ``The Bridges
of Madison County. By Robert James Waller.'' It was published, the
box notes, on April 1, 1992. It was in March of the following year,
after Waller's lachrymose elegy to impossible love had sold in the
millions and prompted who knows how many buckets of middle-aged
tears, that the Times got around to reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Times' reviewer had to say at that late date, the
editors of ``Books of the Century'' thought it could be omitted
without grievous harm. (You wonder, though, what unfortunate was
dragooned into duty as reviewer.)
</P>
<P>
   Most books may be transitory and their reviews even more so, but
the enterprise of writing and reviewing leaves its traces. ``If you
look at enough reviews,'' McGrath writes, ``and at reviews over a
long enough period, amid the accidental changes you can spot some
trends or alterations that seem instructive, if not reliably
permanent. The dramatic emergence, for example, of that generation
of writers _ Hemingway, Dreiser, Fitzgerald, et al. _ who in the
years after the First World War transformed the literary landscape
and shifted its center to America. Or the flowering, in response to
the baby boom, of children's literature in the '50s and '60s, the
outpouring of extraordinary and original fiction in the '60s and
'70s, and the great age of biography that seemed to sweep along
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of these changes is the maturation of book
reviewing and, eventually, criticism itself _ ``informed,'' as
McGrath writes, ``and readable and aimed at a discerning general
audience.'' Books come and go, and most go for good, never to be
seen again. But there is something reassuring in knowing they were
even here, and in seeing how strong an imprint they made. The
record of it is in the reviews that announced their arrival.

UNDATED: all (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `ENEMY OF THE STATE,' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology whiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics bring an
additional touch of class (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the year,
McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, the gay
``Frankenstein'' director, playing him late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip Seymour
Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not rated;
135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his ``Welcome to the Doll
House,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores loneliness in
his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous touches _ none more so
than its title _ come easily to ``Happiness,'' and so do the dark
secrets that would surely have brought it an NC-17 rating. No point
in cataloguing this film's perverse details: what emerges most
clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban characters
seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to make this a
``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional
times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a three-sister family with
hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming
pederast who is also a respected doctor and a loving father is
impossible to forget (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JACK FROST,' starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston and Joseph
Cross. Directed by Troy Miller (PG, 100 minutes). Keaton stars as
the title character, one of those rock-and-roll musicians who are
also great husbands and devoted dads. The film is about what
happens after Jack dies in a Christmas Eve automobile accident and
returns to his family as a large, wisecracking marshmallow man
parked on the front lawn. As one more Hollywood effort to look on
the sunny side of fatality, this one is so sugarcoated that it
makes other recent efforts in the genre look blisteringly honest by
comparison. The actors are as plausible and nice as possible in
displaying emotions as sincere as the soap-flake snow that coats
the sets (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LITTLE VOICE,' starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan
McGregor and Michael Caine. Directed by Mark Herman (R, 99
minutes). The main attraction here is watching wispy Ms. Horrocks
put on a spectacular one-woman diva festival, with her phenomenal
mimicry of musical grande dames from Judy Garland to Marilyn
Monroe. What works less well is the broad and stagy story built
around her. As the timid title character, she is harangued by her
blowsy mother (Ms. Blethyn), latched onto by the talent agent who
is the mother's boyfriend ( Caine) and courted by a nice young man
who loves his pet pigeons. In that last role, McGregor makes a
telephone installer scintillating and once again shows that he can
do anything. Incidentally, the soundtrack is divine (Maslin).

   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William H. Macy, Don Knotts, J.T. Walsh and Jeff Daniels.
Written and directed by Gary Ross (PG-13, 116 minutes). This
cleverly executed fantasy, with a back-to-the-future trip into the
small-town, squeaky-clean paradise of a 1950s television show,
tends toward the black and white, visually and otherwise. The
missionary zeal with which teen-agers from the 1990s try to awaken
benighted '50s types from their slumber is an attitude that wears
thin. But in the meantime there are witty tricks integrating color
into black-and-white images, and nice little touches abound. The
cast is poignant and amusing, with Ms. Allen especially touching as
a pre-feminist housewife who's the prime recipient of '90s
hindsight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,' starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph
Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda
Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came
the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from
Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to
balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an
admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must
initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and
miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators'
reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).

 &HT;    Face it: On Broadway, talent doesn't always rule
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This may sound like a plea for the existence of the
Easter Bunny, but wouldn't it be great if a Nicole Kidman could get
on a magazine cover purely for her talent in a Broadway drama even
if she looked like Ernest Borgnine?
</P>
<P>
   Or if dozens of ordinary-looking stage actors with extraordinary
talents could also get that exalted level of exposure?
</P>
<P>
   Dream on. In America, more than ever, cuties rule.
</P>
<P>
   To Newsweek's credit, the recent article on Kidman (hair flowing
in a machine-made breeze) celebrates both her talent and sex
appeal, pulling ``The Blue Room,'' her U.S. stage debut, up from
the basement of public consciousness where Broadway dramas usually
languish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its vaguely skinflick-ish title, ``Blue Room'' is
intelligent and timely. It's David Hare's updated take on Arthur
Schnitzler's 1900 ``La Ronde,'' in which Man A trysts with Woman B,
who does likewise with Man C, and so on through a chain that comes
back to Man A. Amid the randy humor there's the melancholy sense of
a planet (the blue room) where human connections are mostly
physical. Kidman has received well-deserved kudos for playing five
women _ from coke-addled model to narcissistic actress _ opposite
the equally versatile Iain Glen. The London-bred production sold
out its Broadway run (through March 7) with dizzying speed when
word spread that Kidman briefly flashes full-length nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's only backal, as opposed to frontal,'' wrote tabloid
gossip priestess Liz Smith with obvious disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, like Washington these days, gets bent out of shape by
sex, glamour, celebrity. Ideas and quality still count but are
increasingly upstaged by Whatever's Hot This Week _ and ``Blue'' is
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nicole were playing, say, `Hedda Gabler,' '' says John
Istel, editor in chief of Stagebill, ``I doubt that things would be
this crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   How crazy? As patrons exited the Cort Theater the other night,
30-odd people were packed in layers against a few feet of police
barricades, waiting for the possibility of seeing the Aussie
actress _ or at least a bundled up figure that might be her _ dive
about 15 feet from stage door to limo. Kayla Margenot, 24, with a
prime spot on the rail, explained that she doesn't much care about
Tom Cruise's coltishly lovely wife but was holding the place for a
Cruise-crazy friend ``who wants to see if Nicole is really that
beautiful'' and had gone to get something to eat after waiting for
hours in raw weather.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of when Al Pacino played ``Richard III''
off-Broadway around 1980 and two teenage girls behind me kept
hissing ``Gross!'' in stage whispers whenever his saliva-spray
(admittedly copious) caught the light. Even Shakespeare is not safe
from the surreal effects of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Klieg lights blaze on the beautiful; deserving talents are
thrown in the shade. Nobody stalks the balding, paunchy, brilliant
Phillip Bosco, but it was purely his performance and not Carol
Burnett's that made 1995's ``Moon Over Buffalo'' worth watching.
And I found no autograph seekers last week by the stage door of the
Ethel Barrymore Theatre, even though Claire Bloom, who played Lady
Anne to Laurence Olivier's ``Richard III'' 43 years ago, is giving
an electra-fying performance in ``Electra.'' (I also happen to
think that Bloom at 67 is almost sexier than the fashionably thin
Kidman, but Newsweek doesn't consult dinosaurs like me in choosing
its covers.)
</P>
<P>
   Titillation sold on Broadway even before Mae West wrote and
starred in ``Sex'' in 1926; scalpers then got an unheard-of $50 per
seat. And there's always been at least a steady trickle of movie
stars returning for more serious projects with fulfillments (a live
audience response, for instance) not found in film. Dustin Hoffman,
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Denzel Washington, Bernadette Peters and
Alec Baldwin have had two or more New York stage roles in the past
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are movie stars whose voices, it turns out, are too weak
for theater: Elizabeth Taylor in 1981's ``The Little Foxes,''
Jessica Lange in 1992's ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' There are
stars who keep their stage muscles so well-toned that they can
carry a mediocre show on their backs: Julie Andrews in
``Victor/Victoria.'' In the words of publicist Richard Kornberg:
``Stars are your insurance policy _ nobody comes to see nobodies
with mixed reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater is both grateful for movie stars and resentful of
their power, so you often get wildly split, schizophrenic reviews,
as for Madonna in 1988's ``Speed-the-Plow.'' I agreed with The New
York Times that she was artfully understated in the David Mamet
play, but other critics went out of their way to cut the superstar
down to size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason you don't see more movie stars onstage is
their knowledge that they're going to get kicked in the teeth,''
said Gregory Mosher, who directed the Madonna and Lange projects.
``The issue is usually not money, though it's laughably smaller
than in film. It's this attitude of, `Are you really good enough to
play in my club?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek and USA Today noted the many movie and TV stars on
Gotham stages in 1998: Helen Hunt in ``Twelfth Night''; Christian
Slater in ``Side Man''; Jennifer Jason Leigh in ``Cabaret''; Angela
Bassett in ``Macbeth''; Holly Hunter in ``Impossible Marriage'';
Martin Short in ``Little Me''; Marisa Tomei and Quentin Tarantino
in (the short-lived) ``Wait Until Dark''; Toni Braxton in ``Beauty
and the Beast.'' But those articles missed a key point: It's not
the number of stars but the fact that they tap a Gen X audience
that's otherwise oblivious of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Uta Hagen _ probably the last actress whose legend
status is based entirely on stage work _ is starring off-Broadway
in ``Collected Stories.'' After her generation is gone, it will be
harder than ever for audiences to know, before they buy a theater
ticket, which of the pretty faces can actually deliver the goods.

UNDATED: ingenuity (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `PSYCHO,' starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. Directed by Gus
Van Sant (R, 100 minutes). It turns out that the apparent rocks in
Van Sant's head, as he contrived this near-exact color replica of
Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic, were only pebbles. His remake (a
modest term, but it beats plagiarism) is artful and good-looking,
faltering only when it tries to improve on the brilliant original
blueprint. The casting of Vaughn as Norman Bates is the film's
biggest Achilles' heel, since the performance Hitchcock elicited
from Anthony Perkins remains an impossible act to follow. Still,
Van Sant has tried an outlandish experiment and come up with what
are, especially for fans of the original, intriguing variations on
a theme (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RUGRATS MOVIE,' starring the voices of E.G. Daily,
Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Tara Charendoff and Tim Curry.
Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov (G, 90 minutes). Dil
Pickles is not the first baby whose resentful older sibling wanted
to return him to the hospital, but he's probably the only one who
has such an interesting trip back. Dil (full name: Dylan Preston
Pickles) is the newborn hero of the first film starring the five
talking babies of Nickelodeon's hit children's series ``Rugrats.''
The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight, from
encounters with wolves, wizards and circus monkeys in the forest to
musical numbers at the ``baby store.'' There's material for
grown-up moviegoers, too, including a scene with some pathetic
reporters who turn up at the Pickles house when the children
disappear, getting everybody's name wrong and asking, ``Is it true
a dingo ate your baby?'' (Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow,
Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy also envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow
make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A SIMPLE PLAN,' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime
cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream
storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast
plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment
that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4
million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's
story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When
you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an
especially memorable performance from Thornton, it won't be from
the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,' starring Patrick Stewart, Jonathan
Frakes and Brent Spiner. Directed by Frakes (PG, 105 minutes). The
latest movie episode of the series that will not die finds Captain
Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise saving a
tribe of utopian space pioneers who live on a planet where everyone
enjoys eternal youth. The bad guys want to relocate the people
forcibly and exploit the planet's life-giving properties. Picard,
standing up against the admiral of Star Fleet and risking
court-martial, delivers impassioned speeches about the ugly history
of forcible relocation and also falls in love with a 309-year-old
beauty (Donna Murphy). Although in its ninth movie episode, the
series has retained its sincerity and multicultural
right-mindedness. It's hokum, but executed deftly and with a warm
heart (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `TOUCH OF EVIL,' starring Orson Welles, Charlton Heston and
Janet Leigh. Directed by Welles (not rated, 108 minutes). Anyone
familiar with Welles' 1958 film-noir landmark knows that it could
just as well have been called ``Truckload of Evil,'' and that its
crazily sinister plot turns and breathtaking camera work remain
astonishingly fresh. ``Touch of Evil'' is, among so many things,
the other film to find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under
strangely menacing management, and the one in which Welles gave one
of his most droll, swaggering performances as a corrupt police
captain in an American town on the Mexican border. As visually
thrilling as it is sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version
of ``Touch of Evil'' remains one of the brightest lights on the
cinematic landscape this season (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WAKING NED DEVINE,' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and
Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast
of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning career
directing television commercials means that everyone here is an
amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian
stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're
worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The Full
Monty,'' but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of
elderly gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `YOU'VE GOT MAIL,' starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Directed by
Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This cozy, inviting comedy
romanticizes the rivalry between two bookstore owners, while also
finding time to fall in love with books themselves, the instant
intimacy of e-mail and a picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's
Upper West Side. With a feel-good ambiance much less forced than
that of ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from
``The Shop Around the Corner'' while making this knowing, urbanely
funny film very much her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable
without trying, while a ruefully lovelorn Hanks proves that he can
do anything. Again (Maslin).

AN ENGLISHMAN RIDES INTO TOWN  
 MACY'S MOVES  
 LAUGHTER MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Stephen Frears said with a laugh: ``I must have been
mad. Imagine. An Englishman doing a western.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' a western drama that opens on Wednesday
in New York and Los Angeles, and around the United States in
January, was in many ways a challenge for Frears, the 57-year-old
director of the respected films ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``The
Grifters,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``Prick Up Your Ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears, who began his career as an assistant to the British
filmmaker Karel Reisz, said that at first he was intimidated by the
prospect of directing a film that evokes some of the landmark
westerns of the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago, anyone in Hollywood knew how to make a
western,'' he said. ``Now you need a degree. The world has moved on
so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start from the very beginning,'' he said. ``I had to
literally learn everything. I had to learn about what this society
was like. I had to learn about this very detailed world. Western
films are sort of half mythology, half what it was like in the
West. I had to learn why people filmed westerns the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   When he ran into a problem on the film, he said he thought of
Clint Eastwood. ``I thought, `Oh my God.' I turned to my assistant
and said, `What would Clint do now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. To Frears' delight, ``The Hi-Lo Country'' has
already received strong advance notices. The film is set in a
prairie town, Hi-Lo, N.M., mostly in the days after World War II.
It is about two best friends, played by Woody Harrelson and Billy
Crudup, who are a dying breed of cowboy, and the relationship they
have with a married woman played by Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a 1961 novel, ``The Hi-Lo Country'' by Max
Evans, which was inspired by true events. The movie took decades to
get to the screen. Over the years the project drew the attention
of, among others, Sam Peckinpah, Charlton Heston, Ali McGraw, Lee
Marvin and Slim Pickens. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then, some years ago, the actor L.Q. Jones, a friend of
Peckinpah and a regular in his films, gave Martin Scorsese a copy
of the novel while playing a role in his 1995 film ``Casino.'' Both
Scorsese and his producer, Barbara De Fina, were taken with it,
largely because it depicted the changing postwar West, a world that
had not often been seen on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese, one of the movie's producers, was too busy to direct,
so he gave the script to his friend Frears. Frears was nervous
about taking on the project, but Scorsese and Ms. De Fina assuaged
his concern by arguing that some of the best American films had
been directed by foreigners, like ``Midnight Cowboy,'' directed by
John Schlesinger, who is British, and ``Witness,'' the work of
Peter Weir, who is Australian.
</P>
<P>
   What finally made Frears accept was the screenplay by Walon
Green, who shared the writing credit with Peckinpah on the
Peckinpah classic ``The Wild Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After Walon wrote his first draft, Evans told him, `I've been
waiting 35 years to read this; you're the first one to get it
right,''' Frears said.
</P>
<P>
   Frears acknowledged that his experiences with big-budget
Hollywood films in recent years had been disappointing. His two
expensive films _ ``Hero,'' with Dustin Hoffman, and ``Mary
Reilly,'' with Julia Roberts _ were box-office failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no capacity at all to make these big films; I admire
people who do that,'' Frears said. ``Both those films, they were in
a mess. And it was like making films in the middle of a circus. I'm
not good at those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' is most certainly a Hollywood-style film.
But it was made by an independent company, Gramercy Pictures. Its
$20 million cost was relatively modest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was hardest about making the movie, Frears paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try filming 600 head of cattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's Moves
</P>
<P>
   For most of his adult life, William H. Macy has been a
hard-working if relatively unknown stage and film actor. Then came
``Fargo,'' the 1996 Joel and Ethan Coen comedy-drama in which Macy
played a scheming car dealer. His performance not only earned him
an Academy Award nomination but placed him on a new career path as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved here in 1990 I was working pretty steadily, but I
was the fourth guy, the fifth guy, the 10th guy in a movie,'' said
Macy, 48. ``Then `Fargo' kicked me up to the grown-ups' table.''
</P>
<P>
   With some understatement, Macy added, ``I'm a pretty busy boy
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy appears in ``A Civil Action,'' a drama that opens on Friday
in New York and Los Angeles. The film deals with an eight-year
battle by working-class families in Woburn, Mass., who contended
that two large corporations had contaminated their town's drinking
water with chemicals and caused the deaths of five children and one
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Macy has a relatively small role in the movie. ``I'll always
take a great script over a huge part,'' he said. ``My goal is to
find a huge part in a great script.'' He recently starred in
``Psycho'' and the fantasy ``Pleasantville'' and has been in an
array of other movies, including ``Boogie Nights,'' ``Wag the Dog''
and ``Air Force One.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new year, Macy will be making several films as well as
starring in a Turner Network Television comedy-drama, ``A
Travesty,'' adapted from a novella by Donald Westlake. Macy wrote
the script for the film with his friend Steven Schachter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a film critic who mistakenly kills someone,'' Macy
said. ``It's funnier than all get out.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is any writer that Macy has been identified with,
it is David Mamet. Macy has appeared in several Mamet plays _
``American Buffalo,'' ``The Water Engine'' and ``Oleanna'' _ as
well as the films ``Homicide,'' ``Things Change'' and ``House of
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy offers no deep insights on his bond to the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn the lines, exactly,'' he said. ``I don't make anything
up. And I talk loud. That'll do it.'' With a laugh, he said:
``Mamet refers to me as being Hebraically challenged. I'm a novelty
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met in the 1970s at Godard College in Vermont, where
Macy was a student and Mamet was teaching theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brilliant teacher and theoretician; his aesthetic was
a wondrous thing,'' said Macy, who is married to Felicity Huffman
of ``Sports Night'' on ABC. ``He raised the bar for all of us. He
said acting was a noble profession, and it's the actor's job to
tell the truth, and the audience goes to theater to hear the truth.
That's a lot different than show biz.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Miami and brought up in Cumberland, Md., the son of an
insurance agent, Macy said he began acting in plays and never
looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one thing I was successful at,'' he said. ``I was a
rotten student. And I basically had two skills, acting and
carpentry. But it was acting that always made me feel really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy is completing ``Mystery Men,'' a science-fiction film about
what he calls ``loser superheroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the shoveler,'' he said. ``I fight crime with a
shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this was a comedy, Macy responded, ``Dear God, I hope
so.''

<P>
   In the last four years Tom Shadyac has emerged as one of
Hollywood's most successful directors.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time comedy writer and stand-up comedian, Shadyac has a
track record for comedy hits that makes him sought after by stars
and envied by other filmmakers. His first feature as a director was
Jim Carrey's breakout hit, ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' That was
followed by ``The Nutty Professor,'' starring Eddie Murphy. Then
came another Carrey success, ``Liar Liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Shadyac has directed Robin Williams in ``Patch Adams,''
based on the true story of Hunter ``Patch'' Adams, an unorthodox
and dedicated doctor trained at the Medical College of Virginia who
believes that humor, compassion and empathy are sometimes as
important to patients as medicine. The film opens on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Although early reviews have found fault with the film's
sentimentality, Shadyac strongly rejected that criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the reaction of audiences at test screenings: It
connects very deeply to them,'' said Shadyac, who is 40. ``People
are responding very strongly to this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadyac said the same criticism was made of classics like Steven
Spielberg's ``E.T.'' and Frank Capra's ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say this on bended knee about those films,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shadyac had some special reasons for making ``Patch Adams.'' In
the movie, the character played by Williams wants to create a free
hospital. Shadyac's father, Richard Shadyac, is the national
executive director of the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, Tenn., and is in charge of fund raising. The hospital
gives free treatment to many children with cancer. ``I connected to
the material in a very personal way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Shadyac's mother, Julie, who died during the
filming, had been wheelchair-bound for years; she was a
semi-quadriplegic as a result of a misdiagnosis resulting from a
slipped disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to watch, and it's one of the reasons I responded
to this material,'' Shadyac said. ``Through all her physical
difficulties and challenges, she used humor to disarm tension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She literally made jokes on her death bed,'' he said. Shadyac
dedicated the film to his mother.

 ALONG THE WAY

   NEW YORK _ Christmas is here, and that means just one thing:
it's time to play Grinch.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, midseason box office figures are at record heights, and
yes, there's more competition for theaters than at any time in the
last decade. But cynics would remind you that the bulk of the
critical reaction suggests that the fall season has been a creative
disappointment on Broadway. No one has escaped the barbs. The
season's biggest financial hit, ``The Blue Room,'' was given cool
notices by many critics. Even the well-liked ``Electra'' took lows,
with John Simon of New York magazine calling it a ``junk
production.''
</P>
<P>
   As rough as those assessments have been, critics have had a
particularly hard time with the season's musicals. That, in turn,
has meant hard times for some of the musicals' producers. At the
Gershwin Theater, there was an ominous dip last week in the gross
for ``On the Town.'' According to figures from the League of
American Theaters and Producers, attendance for the revival dipped
below half-capacity last week, with ticket sales registering only
$322,332. That is an estimated loss of about $125,000 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producer, the Joseph Papp Public Theater, has bought
television commercial time, to begin on Monday. The advertisements,
which feature Lea DeLaria, will be broadcast in the early mornings
and late in the evening, said Carol Fineman, the theater's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln Center the recently opened
``Parade'' is starting its advertising campaign in earnest,
emphasizing the good reviews the show received, a majority from
out-of-town critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the reviews are murderous and there's no comfort
anywhere,'' said Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln
Center Theater. ``But that's not the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has a large built-in audience of subscribers,
has had a decent box office response, with sales of $288,229 last
week. Gersten said the break-even point of the show was about that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the healthiest of the bunch is ``Footloose,'' whose
reviews were, well, just plain bad. Its producers say they are
happy with their weekly sales, which have been around $475,000 and
peaked a month ago at just over $600,000. The show's weekly costs
are about $350,000. A national tour began last week. ``Our intent
has always been to appeal to the widest variety of audience,'' said
Michael David, a producer for ``Footloose.'' ``The critics are a
very small percentage of that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   NO ROAD TO RICHES
</P>
<P>
   As if any more reason were needed to discourage future actors,
consider this figure: $14,936.
</P>
<P>
   That's the average annual income of a member of Actors' Equity,
according to the latest statistics compiled by the 36,000-member
union. The median income is even more depressing, a whopping
$6,276, which is more than $2,000 below the federal poverty line
for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   (Just to put the actor's lot in perspective, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average yearly salary for a dental
hygienist is about $40,000, plus dental benefits.)
</P>
<P>
   The Equity figures are even more alarming when one considers
that it includes only union members, not the tens of thousands of
nonunion actors who prowl the boards Off Off Broadway and in
smaller theaters around the nation, usually for little or no pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the silver lining department, the average annual income is up
about $1,000 from last year and shows a gain of nearly $6,000 from
a decade ago. Not that that was much solace for union officials.
``People think of Broadway and just think of the stars,'' said Alan
Eisenberg, executive director of Equity. But the majority of actors
and all artists in this country are vastly underpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   A DEPARTURE
</P>
<P>
   Bebe Neuwirth, who was to star in ``Over and Over,'' the new
musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb, has left the cast. The show,
based on Thornton Wilder's apocalyptical comedy, ``The Skin of Our
Teeth,'' is to begin on Jan. 6 at the Signature Theater in
Arlington, Va. Ms. Neuwirth, who won a Tony for her performance in
the Broadway revival of ``Chicago,'' by Kander and Ebb, was to play
Sabrina the maid, the role created on Broadway by Tallulah
Bankhead. Her replacement has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls Thursday to Kander and Signature officials were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY/UNLUCKY BREAK
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Kathryn Meisle was sitting at home, looking for work
and anticipating a pinched holiday season. She had not had a paid
acting job since the summer, and the autumn had been short on
auditions. ``I was planning a very, um, relaxed holiday season,''
she said. ``I was going to do a lot of baking.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, fate. Jenny Bacon, an actress in Paul Rudnick's ``Most
Fabulous Story Ever Told,'' fell during a Saturday night preview,
fractured her foot and after performing on it was told by doctors
that she would have to leave the show.
</P>
<P>
   In a spate of frantic auditions, Ms. Meisle landed the part at
11 p.m. on a Tuesday, read the script for the first time that night
and by Wednesday at 8 p.m. was onstage in a wig, performing with a
script in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the classic actor's nightmare,'' she said. ``Except I
was awake.'' She managed to perform without a script after three
days, just in time for the critics. And then the nightmare turned
into a dream, as the show and its cast received strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way to move the production after it
closes at New York Theater Workshop on Jan. 10. Still, it may be a
short-term gig for Ms. Meisle; Equity rules allow Ms. Bacon to
return to the role if the show moves and she is healed.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Ms. Meisle is counting her blessings. ``I'm
just enjoying it for all it's worth,'' she said. ``I'm not much of
a baker anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ALONG THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   The Signature Theater Company in New York has decided against
trying to present three John Guare plays this spring as part of its
all-Guare season. Instead the company will produce the world
premiere of Guare's ``Lake Hollywood,'' which follows the lives of
a married couple in New Hampshire and New York. It is to begin
performances on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Theater people _ and their publicity agents _ just love
anniversaries, and 1999 offers plenty, including the 50th
anniversary of ``Death of a Salesman,'' which will be celebrated
with a Broadway revival of the play at the Eugene O'Neill Theater
on Feb. 10. Then there's the 100th anniversary of the birth of Noel
Coward. The producer Alexander H. Cohen says he will present the
U.S. premiere of Coward's ``Waiting in the Wings,'' a 1960 play
about a dozen elderly women. Michael Langham will direct; the
opening is to be on Dec. 16, Coward's birthday.

`VIETNAM, LONG TIME COMING': MAKING PEACE WITH THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rehab center south of Hanoi, a man blinded in the Christmas
bombing of 1972 gives a traditional Vietnamese massage to an
American veteran blinded in a Vietcong land-mine explosion in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   At the Troung Son National Cemetery along the 17th Parallel, in
what used to be the DMZ, or demilitarized zone, two amputees
embrace: One fought on the side of Ho Chi Minh, the other on the
side of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a memorial to the massacred innocents at My Lai,
American veterans make a stand in the parking lot, refusing to
enter the shrine, declaring that they won't take part in a ceremony
there, that they won't be tools of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   These are scenes from ``Vietnam, Long Time Coming,'' a
documentary on NBC on Saturday about a journey of reconciliation by
American veterans and their former enemies. And if the scenes seem
loaded with symbolism, that's apparently the idea. A kind of forced
symbolism underpins and sometimes overwhelms this otherwise worthy
film, beginning with the very occasion for it.
</P>
<P>
   What brings these former foes together, many of them physically
disabled, is an elaborately staged event: a 16-day, 1,200-mile
bicycle trip from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, a destination the
Americans still tend to call Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The road they travel _ through humble villages, over jungly
mountain passes, across rice-paddied valleys _ is Highway One, a
two-lane blacktop that on a map looks like the spine of that
vaguely seahorse-shaped land, linking the once-divided North and
South. There's something fittingly symbolic about that too.
</P>
<P>
   The film was created in part by the makers of the acclaimed 1994
documentary ``Hoop Dreams,'' Peter Gilbert and Gordon Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Like the trip, it was sponsored by Sports Illustrated Television
and World T.E.A.M. Sports, a nonprofit group that conducts similar
events all over the world and whose stated mission is ``to
demonstrate what people of different abilities and backgrounds can
accomplish by working together through sports.'' (The acronym is a
more useful term than the awkward name it stands for: The
Exceptional Athlete Matters.)
</P>
<P>
   For this goodwill tour, which took place last January, the
sponsors mobilized a small army of men and women: 45 American and
20 Vietnamese bicyclists, as well as vans of support staff, coaches
(the Tour de France champion Greg LeMond among them), a medical
team and, of course, a camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the bicyclists were middle-aged veterans. Some were sons
of vets. Others were children in Vietnam during the war. Three
participants, riding on the back seats of tandems, were blind.
Eight lost legs or the use of them in combat, and a half-dozen or
so were confessedly crippled in spirit, still haunted by the
terrors and barbarities of that war. (``We chased a guy into a
village,'' one American recalls, dazed by the memory. ``A girl came
out carrying hand grenades. I killed her.'')
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped in cinema verite style, the documentary often
fascinates with a kind of in-motion immediacy: The camera rolls
right along with the bicyclists, capturing their recollections and
reactions, pausing to visit peasants along the road, serving up
postcard views of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   With that comes a mood of sustained intimacy, even
intrusiveness. Time after time the camera is present as veterans,
confronted by the ghosts of war, break down in one another's arms,
often during anguished group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes are moving, sometimes understatedly harrowing _ one
veteran calmly itemizes his suicide attempts _ and a viewer can
only be sympathetic. But they begin to pile up. Like too much of
anything, they cumulatively dull the impact they're meant to
deliver individually. The viewer begins to weary, as someone might
while listening in on a long group-therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   The film, too, never quite escapes the staginess of the event.
For all the human drama portrayed, the uneasy thought persists that
what we're watching has shades of a promotional stunt. The
bicyclists' black-and-gold riding togs and snazzy matching helmets
only reinforce the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But what isn't contrived, and what makes the film worth watching
_ even while football games are raging all around it _ are the
moments of pain and revelation that these battle-scarred men and
women share. Many still rail against the government that sent them
to fruitless war; some marvel at the gentleness of the rural
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   And not everything recorded here was planned. The impromptu
protest outside the My Lai memorial seems to take the filmmakers by
surprise. The Americans fear they're being set up to take the blame
symbolically for the 504 civilians murdered there. ``I don't want
to pay no homage to the dead,'' one veteran says. ``The dead are
dead, the dead are gone. They're in God's hands, not in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation is a long road. The war, on many fronts, goes on.
</P>

A FANFARE FOR THE VANITIES OF 1998

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
(af) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Simply living through 1998 proved quite a learning
experience for many investors.
</P>
<P>
   People who had previously been acquainted only with a bull
market in stocks finally looked a bear market in the eye. And those
who never paid much attention to the bond market learned in late
summer that when its mysterious wheels grind to a halt, a
full-blown credit crisis can result.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also discovered why Alan Greenspan is a lot more
important to the markets than Bill Clinton. And they found out why
big, risky investment pools are called hedge funds _ because they
often get clipped.
</P>
<P>
   What better time than the end of a momentous market year to
reflect on its players, both major and minor, and to bask in its
priceless moments with the awarding of the first Augustus Melmotte
Memorial Prizes?
</P>
<P>
   The awards, for this year's financial flubs and feats, are named
for a larger-than-life character in ``The Way We Live Now,''
Anthony Trollope's novel. A sort of ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
circa 1875, the book details the chicanery of Melmotte, a financial
plunger of mysterious background who buys his way into the upper
levels of London society, entertaining royalty and gaining a seat
in parliament. His fall from grace comes when a railroad company,
for which he helped raise money, is found to be nonexistent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARTY ANIMAL OF THE YEAR AWARD To Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve and everybody's favorite master of the punch
bowl. Who knew that the man who cautioned investors about
irrational exuberance in the stock market in 1996 would work so
hard 3,000 Dow points later to keep the party going? Greenspan's
three successive interest-rate cuts last fall and explosive
increases in the money supply meant that investors partied hearty
late in 1998. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMIABLE DUNCE AWARD To William Gates, chairman of the Microsoft
Corp. Before his taped depositions in the Justice Department's
antitrust suit against Microsoft, most people assumed that the
world's richest man had to be a genius. After all, amassing $51
billion in personal wealth usually takes brains.
</P>
<P>
   But in his testimony Gates displayed an impressive ignorance
about such business basics as market share, and he could not
explain what he meant when he wrote an e-mail to top aides saying,
``Winning Internet browser market share is a very, very important
goal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And how smart is it to underestimate the determination of the
federal government in full pursuit? According to a witness in the
trial, Gates predicted back in 1995 that ``this antitrust thing
will blow over.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNEADING OUT THE KINKS AWARD To Walter Forbes, former chairman
of the Cendant Corp. Forbes was chief of CUC International, a
membership services company that merged with the franchiser HFS to
create Cendant in 1997. After the merger, auditors found that CUC's
numbers had been massaged to create profits that, on second look,
were losses instead.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant has since restated three years of results. In 1997, for
example, the company turned in a $217 million loss, not the $55.5
million profit it had initially reported. Forbes left with a $35
million severance package, saying he had ``absolutely no
knowledge'' of the accounting problems. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS HE THINKING AWARD To Alan Greenberg, chairman of the
Bear Stearns Companies. In September, Greenberg, who is known as
Ace, sent a $10,000 check to the Police Athletic League, a charity
whose chairman is Robert M. Morgenthau, the district attorney of
Manhattan. A simple case of generosity? Maybe. But Morgenthau's
office also happens to be deep in an investigation of the possible
role of the Bear Stearns Clearing Corp. as clearing firm for the
defunct brokerage A.R. Baron, described by prosecutors as a
criminal enterprise that stole $75 million from investors.
</P>
<P>
   The check was returned. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROUND WHEEL AWARD To Albert Dunlap, pushed from his post as
chairman of the Sunbeam Corp. in June. Dunlap, known for axing
thousands of jobs to keep his company's stock price high, learned
that what goes around sometimes comes around.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dunlap, author of ``Mean Business: How I Save Bad
Companies and Make Good Companies Great,'' the company was found to
have overstated Sunbeam's earnings in 1997 by 65 percent, largely
by selling barbecue grills to retailers in December and agreeing to
defer billing on the goods until the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   While almost nobody felt sorry for Dunlap, Sunbeam shareholders
were to be pitied indeed. The company's stock, which traded as high
as $53 in March, was still skulking around at $5.5625 six months
after Dunlap left. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE ``ONE TIME'' AWARD To the management of
Kellogg Inc., the cereal giant in Battle Creek, Mich. For the
fourth time in four years, the company took a ``one-time''
restructuring charge to earnings in 1998 for ``streamlining
operations.'' The charges this year came to $22 million. The total
charged to earnings over the four years of one-time charges: $764
million, equivalent to one-quarter of Kellogg's net income during
the period. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TIMING IS EVERYTHING AWARD To the top executives of the Cendant
Corp &UR; . &LR;  In October, after Cendant stock had lost two-thirds of its
value, falling to a low of $7.50, executives cut the exercise price
on 26.3 million stock options to $9.81. Previously, the options had
prices between $12.26 and $20.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has since recovered, giving the executives an enormous
windfall but leaving public shareholders wondering: Where are our
repriced shares? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS OSTRICH AWARD To Jill Barad, chairman of
Mattel Inc. In a Dec. 14 conference call to analysts, she told of a
shocking 30 percent decline in earnings per share at the company
and a 12 percent drop in sales of Barbie merchandise. After a great
Thanksgiving, Ms. Barad explained, retail reorders ``came to a
screeching halt.'' Never mind that throughout the year, press
reports had noted weaknesses in the Barbie business that Ms. Barad
had steadfastly denied. The stock fell 27 percent on her wake-up
call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PREDICTIONS ARE DANGEROUS AWARD To the management of Starwood
Hotels and Resorts. On Nov. 11, 1997, with Starwood shares trading
at $55.25, the company ran a full-page newspaper ad listing the
12-month projections from 10 Wall Street analysts for Starwood's
stock price. Ever optimistic, the analysts reckoned that Starwood
shares would trade between $75 and $83. Twelve months later, the
stock was just over $27, a victim of investor fears over the
performance of real estate investment trusts in a slowing economy.
Oh, well. Who will remember? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LET THEM EAT CAKE AWARD To Charles Wang, chairman of Computer
Associates. Last May, he received 12.15 million free shares of
stock in the company _ worth $670 million _ after the shares rose
to $53.33 and stayed there for 60 trading days. The grant was a
reward for three years of Wang's labor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Computer Associates' other shareholders, two
months after the chairman bagged his prize, the company announced a
$675 million charge to earnings to cover the stock award to Wang,
among other things. It also warned that revenues and profits would
probably slow for several quarters, thanks to slack demand from
Asia. The shares slid almost 31 percent in response to the news. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDUE DILIGENCE AWARD To Goldman, Sachs. The investment bank
reaped millions in underwriting fees on two Russian bond deals
peddled to customers last June and July. Not long after the ink on
the $7.65 billion in bonds was dry, Russia's banking system
collapsed, making the bonds worthless. The firm earned $56 million
on the July deal alone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE RESEARCH AWARD To Henry Blodget, Internet
stock analyst at Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. On Dec. 16, Blodget raised his
year-end 1999 price target for Amazon.com from $150 a share to
$400. That would give the Internet darling a market capitalization
of $21 billion _ one-third the value of all books sold in the world
at retail last year.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget told Bloomberg News that he raised his price target
because Amazon.com had blown through the one he had set earlier.
The day Blodget made his optimism public to the investing masses,
Amazon shares jumped 17 percent, to $289. A week later, the stock
was at $325. Could a $500 price target be far behind? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE AWARD To number crunchers at the United
States Treasury. Earlier this month, the Treasury revealed that
miscalculations meant it had paid Social Security and other trust
funds $1.4 billion in extra interest since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And Uncle Sam is afraid to privatize Social Security, so average
Americans can control their own retirement accounts? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YEAR'S BEST TRADE AWARD To the risk management committee of
Switzerland's UBS A.G., the world's second-largest bank. UBS wanted
so desperately to invest in the Long-Term Capital Management hedge
fund that it made personal loans to the fund's partners and bought
an $800 million stake in Long-Term Capital as part of a complex
derivative transaction.
</P>
<P>
   When the teetering hedge fund had to be rescued by a consortium
of Wall Street banks and brokerage firms in September, UBS wound up
writing off its investment, losing $700 million in the process. The
bank's chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, and three other top
executives resigned over the disaster. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A SOW'S EAR IS A SOW'S EAR AWARD To executives of the Zapata
Corp., a fish oil and meat-casing company in Houston. Hoping to
breathe a little life into the company's stock, Zapata management
announced plans in July to become ``one of the largest Internet
companies in the world.'' How? By buying or investing in enough
World Wide Web sites so that it could compete with established
search engines like Yahoo and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Investors snapped up Zapata shares on the news, pushing the
formerly comatose stock from around $10 to almost $23. Alas, the
Internet plans fizzled, the company returned to fish oil and the
stock fell back to earth _ until the company announced last week
that its Internet onslaught was back on track. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATIENCE IS ITS OWN REWARD AWARD To individual investors. Those
who hung tight through the summer's market meltdown _ while
professional money managers panicked _ proved that every once in a
while, amateurs can beat the pros at their own game.

   KRONBERG, Germany _ Klaus Gossens built his career by thinking
more like a European than a German. As head of European trade
management at Braun AG, he has nurtured one of Europe's best-known
brand names for such household gadgets as coffee makers, spice
grinders and electric shavers.
</P>
<P>
   So, as most of Europe takes a huge step toward unity by
introducing its new single currency, the euro, why is Gossens
worried?
</P>
<P>
   His problem is prices. A Braun Flex Integral shaver sells for
about $90 in Spain, $103 in the Netherlands, $118 in Germany and
$124 in France. There are similar variations for countless other
products: Chanel perfume, Volkswagen sedans, Levi's jeans, even
Bayer aspirin. And French or German consumers are not the only ones
who pay more. Europe's biggest retailers themselves often pay their
suppliers different prices in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, buyers tolerated those differences,'' Gossens said
in a recent interview at Braun headquarters in Kronberg, north of
Frankfurt. ``But they aren't tolerating them anymore. We are
entering a situation where everything is very transparent. If I am
a buyer and I don't get satisfactory answers about prices, I'll go
off to another company.''
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like Economics 101, but until recently Europeans
have been fighting it. Though the European Union abolished most
trade barriers among member countries years ago, European retail
markets remain stubbornly balkanized.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as 11 countries prepare to start using the euro as their
common currency on Friday, the crazy-quilt system has become a
battleground. By eliminating the fig leaf of different currencies,
the euro should theoretically make it much easier to compare prices
and to pounce on discrepancies. It is also likely to give a new
boost to cross-border transactions within Europe, because it will
eliminate exchange-rate fluctuations and the cost of hedging
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new bills and coins will not begin circulating until
2002, the euro is already quite real. The participating countries _
Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Austria, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Finland _ will permanently
lock their exchange rates to the euro on New Year's Eve and
surrender their control over monetary policy to the new European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some stores have begun posting prices in euros and plan
to start accepting euros on credit card purchases as early as Jan.
4. Banks are required to let their customers keep their accounts in
either euros or the local currency, and all interbank transfers
will be cleared in euros.
</P>
<P>
   Big industrial companies like DaimlerChrysler and Siemens are
converting their own books and prodding their suppliers to deal in
euros as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   All this is accelerating a revolution in prices that began when
the European Union essentially abolished trade barriers among
member countries earlier in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers like Carrefour Group in France and Metro AG of
Germany are beefing up their computer systems to catch suppliers'
pricing discrepancies. Car companies, already struggling with
overcapacity and brutal competition, are grudgingly bringing prices
into closer alignment from country to country. Computer
manufacturers, generating more sales through the borderless
Internet, are doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who expect Adam Smith's invisible hand to eliminate
the incongruity _ and to do so swiftly _ are likely to be
disappointed. European prices are rooted in big social and
institutional differences that companies have learned to respect.
</P>
<P>
   Buying power, for example, is much weaker in Spain and Portugal,
where personal incomes are about 25 percent lower than the European
average. Aspirin is more expensive in Germany in part because laws
aimed at protecting small pharmacies prohibit supermarkets from
selling it. Groceries are expensive in Paris; the city has
prohibited high-volume ``hypermarkets'' within its boundaries.
Sales taxes and luxury taxes also vary, despite years of efforts by
European leaders to harmonize them.
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables, there are no simple patterns in the
price differences. A recent survey by Test-Achats, a consumer
research association in Brussels, found that Italy had the lowest
prices for Swatch watches but among the highest for Lacoste polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the euro will bring lower prices over all, but that
the price differences will be more or less the ones we have right
now,'' said Stephane Douchy, a market analyst at Test-Achats.
</P>
<P>
   With the euro, ``there will be greater price transparency,''
added Harald Muenzberg, a retail industry expert at Gemini
Consulting in Bad Homburg, Germany. Still, he said, it will remain
``relatively difficult to figure out prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different prices for many different products,''
he added. ``There are discounts, advertising allowances, rebates.
All of that leads to different pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   For people like Gossens of Braun, which is owned by Gillette
Corp., it also adds up to big struggles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are coming to us and saying, `We want to pay the
lowest prices possible,' '' he said. ``But what is that? Is pricing
what you have in your price list? Is it the price after you deduct
bonuses and conditions? What are you really comparing across
countries?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The customers Gossens has in mind are people like Vincent de
Meaux, who coordinates euro planning at Carrefour Group, Europe's
closest answer to Wal-Mart. Based in Paris, the company owns nearly
200 hypermarkets in Europe _ most of them in France _ and 100 more
in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   De Meaux is looking forward to the euro era, in which he expects
retailers to grab more influence over pricing from the hands of
their suppliers. ``The market dynamics have existed for several
years already,'' he said in a recent interview in Paris. ``But this
will make more pressure on suppliers; that is obvious. It's not
going to happen overnight on Jan. 1. It will take a few years. But
it will be a big change.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wal-Mart, Carrefour sells everything from fresh fish to
personal computers, relying on huge volume to eke profits from
small margins. With total sales this year of about $32 billion, it
competes ferociously on price and puts constant pressure on
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not alone. Metro AG of Germany is now the world's
second-biggest retailer, behind only Wal-Mart, operating everything
from warehouse and department stores to cash-and-carry grocery
outlets. Inditex SA of Spain owns clothing stores in much of Europe
as well as Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Europe's incongruities are sufficiently confounding _ and so
deeply seated _ that even these giant retailers can hardly expect
to call all the shots.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, European consumers have widely varying tastes,
which means that identical goods are not sold everywhere and that
comparison-pricing across borders can be tricky. Italians like big,
``family-sized'' bottles of shampoo, for instance, while French
families prefer smaller bottles tailored to individuals. Nestle has
scores of variations on the formula for Nescafe, to take account of
regional coffee-drinking preferences from Italy to Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   National regulations add to the complexity. French retailing,
for example, is unique in Europe, because stores are prohibited
from charging more for products than they show on their own
invoices. Instead, retailers earn their profits by negotiating with
suppliers to obtain rebates and other payments for promotional
services. The money works out about the same, but the practice
makes international comparisons far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Different countries also have very different retailing systems,
some more efficient than others. High-volume hypermarkets have a
strong presence in France and Spain, but Germany has a high
proportion of smaller specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this are logistical rigidities that are the modern
tracings of hundreds or thousands of years of national divisions on
the Continent. ``Carrefour can't just say, `Well, I'll buy all my
Coke from Spain because it's cheaper,''' de Meaux said. ``If you
need to supply 130 stores in France, you can't change all your
suppliers every time someone offers a lower price.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Price comparisons can even be difficult on the Internet, where
national borders can be jumped with a few clicks of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Dell Computer, which now sells about
$2 million worth of personal computer equipment a day in western
Europe over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a chicken-and-egg situation,'' said Jan
Gesmar-Larsen, president of Dell's subsidiary for Europe, the
Mideast and Africa. ``We have been using the Web to push all our
sales. But as you go on the Net, it's very easy to call up pages
country by country. It's very easy for a skilled customer to make
comparisons between pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said Dell could not hope to charge different national
prices when it began marketing over the Web in 1996. But even
though prices were equalized, consumers were nudged in different
directions by means of separate home pages for almost every
country, in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, comparing prices is anything but simple. Customers
who log onto the German page find that the baseline home computer
is a modest machine that costs about 2,895 marks, or $1,754. The
prices and complexity go up from there. Those who log onto the
Spanish page are led to an entirely different series of computers.
This list starts with a model that sells at 347,000 pesetas, or
$2,443, and from there the prices and complexity go down _
ultimately below the cheapest German packages.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences are a reflection of very different markets.
German consumers remain among the wealthiest in Europe, yet they
are used to price wars on computers and are anxious about the
economy's slow growth. Spanish consumers are much poorer, on
average, but economic growth is booming and businesses are spending
heavily on equipment of all types.
</P>
<P>
   Dell says that its pricing policies are reasonable and that the
euro will be good for business. ``We think what it will do is
encourage more visibility on prices, and that will encourage people
to go to our Web site,'' said James Reed, the company's director of
European programs. ``We look on this as an opportunity and not a
risk.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the new currency is forcing merchants and their
suppliers to battle over some of the hoariest traditions of
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, European stores try to make products
look cheaper by posting prices just below a round number _ for
example, selling shoes in Germany for 99.99 marks instead of 100.
</P>
<P>
   But in euros, that price would be more like 51.51. And that
raises the question of whether to round the euro price up (to
51.99) or down (to 50.99). Collectively, such choices will add up
to billions of euros that will be borne either by consumers or
someone else along the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders have already begun warning stores not to make
consumers pay by rounding such prices up, and most experts don't
think consumers would accept the increases, anyhow. But suppliers
and retailers do not want to absorb price declines, and neither is
ceding much ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers already have enough clout to make their views
prevail,'' said Gossens of Braun, echoing a widespread fear among
consumer-goods companies. ``It will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly so, because the euro arrives at a time when
European prices are already under downward pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Continent, inflation is below 2 percent a year; it
has nearly evaporated in Germany, where prices rose just
seven-tenths of a percent over the last year. Thanks to fallout
from financial crises in Asia and Russia, many European exports are
actually declining in price. Though Germany's economy grew about 3
percent in 1998, the Association of German Retailers estimates that
retail sales declined slightly in real terms, according to its
spokesman, Hubertus Pellengahr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not possible to raise prices in this environment,''
he said.

MEMORABLE TV MOMENTS OF '98'  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A TV critics's list of 1998's top trends and topics,
in no particular order of importance:
</P>
<P>
   - The last minutes of Bobby Simone's life were the most riveting
minutes of prime time television all year. As he slipped away, the
detective, powerfully portrayed by Jimmy Smits, conversed with his
ghostly birding buddy, who served as Simone's guide to whatever's
next. Put your heart in the deep freeze if you weren't moved on the
night of Nov. 24 by the fine writing and acting on ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it was hard not to open your heart to Rick Schroder,
beset with the awful luck of being a former cute child star, as he
joined ``NYPD Blue's'' cast Dec. 1. Schroder brings surprising
gravity and subtle humor to his character, and brings the show
robust new life.
</P>
<P>
   - Laughs weren't large on TV this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unintentional humor was everywhere, of course, from the halls of
Congress on up. But you know you're in a dry spell when the most
loveable programming on television isn't the actual programs.
Madison Avenue commercials _ for Taco Bell, Jack-in-the-Box and
ESPN's SportsCenter _ upstaged all but the most creative Hollywood
minds. Talking dogs always score laughs, and the ESPN commercials
have been cutting-edge for years, but who knew that the
bubbleheaded burgermeister could be so drolly funny?
</P>
<P>
   - On the non-commercial front, PBS in November built a temple of
tribute to ``Frank Lloyd Wright.'' Co-directors Ken Burns and Lynn
Novick honored the famed architect by not spackling over his deep
personal flaws, and their exquisitely paced, two-part special was
respectful-but-real documentary filmmaking at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   - There's never been a better argument that too much TV destroys
souls than Monica Lewinsky, whose mindless girltalk with Linda
Tripp could be outtakes from lesser episodes of ``Melrose Place,''
or any number of daytime soaps. Which zip code does Monica hail
from again? Oh, that's right, 90210. What'd'ya say we impeach Aaron
Spelling instead of the president?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the supremely seduceable Bill Clinton fared no better
in 1998, and TV's most profound influence in his life _ all that
fund-raising pays primarily for campaign TV commercials _ has
proved no less damaging to the national fabric.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all preface to the long, lost weekend of impeachment,
Iraq and the self-immolation of yet another Speaker of the House.
Dec. 19 was one of the most intense ``news days'' in history, at
least according to the television anchors, reporters and
commentators who presided over it. But, oddly, not in many viewers'
eyes, most of which were focused elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   What those viewers chose to ignore _ emerald green night-vision
images of Baghdad rooftops in one split-screen box, the bright red
faces of angry partisan pols in another _ was truly a nightmare
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest Drudge Report murmurs to the release of the
Lewinsky-Tripp boxed set, the national news media fed on the lurid
story like a school of hammerheads. The public never really bit,
however, and ratings from Big Saturday seem to echo what all those
approval-rating polls said all year: ``We, the people, don't care
about the president's personal problems. Stop trying to make us
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thanks to Monicagate, this has been a banner year for
cable-news networks, who would otherwise have to dig for real news
to fill that 24-7 news wheel. With, for example, programs like
CNN's terrific ``Cold War'' miniseries. Early episodes proved gray
and grim, though still riveting for history lovers. Now, the
24-hour documentathon has finally swung into the James Bond years
of the 1960s, so at least the sound track has a back-beat. ``Cold
War'' is a heroic work of telejournalism, a valuable keepsake of a
genuinely scary era.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with its cast of real-life characters on both sides of
the Iron Curtain, the players in the Clinton-Lewinsky potboiler are
all toy poodles. Can it be true that the Cold War was fought in the
same world now hypnotized by the pathetic couplings of the
president and his no-mind intern? In 1998, TV viewers saw too much
of these two.
</P>
<P>
   - No matter how it arrives, David E. Kelley's writing comes
special delivery. Consider just two of the characters he created
and writes for every week. On one show, ABC's ``The Practice,''
there's Ellenor Frutt, a larger-than-life attorney played by Camryn
Manheim.
</P>
<P>
   On another Kelley show, Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' Calista Flockhart
gives the wispy title character an elasticity that only
occasionally needs special-effects enhancement. Size matters for
both actresses. Manheim dedicated her September supporting-actress
Emmy win to ``all the fat girls!'' Flockhart has attracted tabloid
attention by seemingly vanishing toward the other extreme. Large or
small, however, Kelley's heroines are the complete package.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Seinfeld'' got the big send-off, but ``The Larry Sanders
Show'' is the departed series I miss the most. Both shows ended
distinguished runs in the spring. While NBC gave its cash-machine
comedy a farewell fiesta of hype, the finale itself was a busted
pinata. Oh well, we'll always have those great reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HBO's classic dark comedy, a ruthless spoof of
late-night talk-show titans, went out with a memorable last blast.
Jerry Seinfeld scored the big syndication money, but Garry
Shandling and co-stars Jeffrey Tambor and Rip Torn made a place for
themselves in TV critic heaven.
</P>
<P>
   - Phil Hartman and Frank Sinatra, linked only by Hartman's
devastating ``Saturday Night Live'' impersonation of the Vulgarian
Years Frank, both got fitting TV memorials. Though Sinatra's main
media were nightclubs, recording studios and movie sound stages,
news producers had enough cool performance footage after his death
to fill the airwaves with beautiful, timeless music for a few days.
For example, TV Land's ``Frank, Dean and Sammy: An Evening with the
Rat Pack'' special _ salvaged from a St. Louis union benefit in
1965 and originally aired in April _ offered a vision of Sinatra
near the tail end of his most vividly swinging period. Replayed
after the singer's May death, the special showed again how Sinatra
_ singing ``Fly Me to the Moon,'' ``I've Got You Under My Skin''
and other fine tunes _ will swing forever more.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman died a couple of weeks after Sinatra, in a stunning
murder-suicide, so his loss hasn't been as easy to reconcile.
Sinatra led a big, brassy life, most of it in public. Hartman, age
49 at his death (Sinatra's age in the TV Land special), still had
many creative years left, and though the amazing body of his work
for ``SNL,'' ``The Simpsons'' and ``NewsRadio'' will also replay
forevermore, there were characters in him that we hadn't yet met.
In person, he was a sweet prince.
</P>
<P>
   - The baseball season opened with a mess _ the bungled local
telecast of Bank One Ballpark's opening night _ and ended with a
mess of majestic home runs. The Mark McGwire-Sammy Soza dinger
derby was captivating, the kind of culture-stopping story that TV
just owns. After-homer close-ups of both sluggers revealed that
sports could still be joyous and fun, and not always just another
greed-fueled racket.
</P>
<P>
   - They were both commercials for the moribund American space
program, but Tom Hanks' HBO miniseries ``From the Earth to the
Moon'' was much better television than John Glenn's return to
space. The Apollo program might've been the century's greatest leap
of imagination, and Hanks, working with a cast and crew of
thousands from the blueprint drawn by Andrew Chaikin, in the book
``A Man on the Moon,'' found the little stories that told the
larger tale. In doing so, he made heroes of the Earth-bound
engineers, geologists, astro-spouses and journalists who helped
lift men to the Moon. He also created top-flight television.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of Glenn's shuttle junket was overwhelmingly
uncritical, which is perhaps forgivable given the emotions
generated by returning the aging space pioneer to orbit, but
probably shouldn't be forgotten by students of the medium.
Statements by Walter Cronkite and many others aside, Glenn's
mission was a publicity stunt, not science, and journalists who
contributed to the hype (without repeatedly pointing out the
cost-to-taxpayers reality) did their fellow Americans a huge
disservice.
</P>
<P>
   - Snappy dialog, original characters, unpredictable stories and
a genre-busting attitude are the shared traits of the fall TV
season's best new shows, ``Sports Night'' and ``Cupid.'' If you're
not watching these two, both products of the ``We Love TV'' network
_ that would be ABC, bucko _ you just don't love TV.
</P>
<P>
   The new season's biggest disappointments, the NBC sitcom
``Encore! Encore!'' and the WB drama ``Felicity,'' veered from
success at different stages of their development. ``Encore!
Encore!,'' coming from can't-miss production auspices (the creators
of ``Wings'' and ``Frasier'') and headlined by a truly gifted star
(Nathan Lane), entered the schedule D.O.A. thanks to a bungled
preseason publicity plan and just plain slipshod execution.
``Felicity,'' the fall season's most hyped freshman, took a couple
of weeks to become supremely annoying. Though the network has made
ongoing promises to de-mope the lovely lead character, the changes
have been (now here's a good word for this season of charity)
subtle. Though I admit I'm a long way outside the young and female
target demographic for this show, I do reside in the middle-aged
male demographic that probably best understands unfulfilled
potential.
</P>
<P>
   - CBS washed the Winter Olympics out with soap. Melodramatic,
emotion-baiting, portrait-painting, relentlessly sappy storytelling
has ruined the Games for genuine sports fans. Commerce,
specifically the belief that mass audiences have to be fed
artificial plot-enhancement trickery to stay interested in the
actual events, is the culprit, and NBC (which owns the rights to
both winter and summer Olympics for years to come) is just as
guilty. Give the events back to the athletes, lose the soft-focus
approach, maybe give the irreverent ``SportsCenter'' anchors and
producers creative oversight, and there'll be hope, not soap.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it seems, it's soapy storytelling that's at the heart of
the latest revival of pro rasslin', which is grinding through yet
another of its cyclical moments in the artificial sun. Most nights,
there's as much or more over-the-top emotin' as over-the-top-rope
body-slammin' on the WCW and WWF cablecasts, and the young males at
the audience core for the hyper-theatrical virtual sport couldn't
be happier. Next: a roller derby revival, which signals the end of
this current ``up'' cycle for fake hair-pulling and
throat-chopping.
</P>
<P>
   - In the spirit of Spinal Tap, we're amping this Top 10 list up
a notch to recognize a truly remarkable turn of events for
TV-heads. It's called Tuesday night, and where did it come from?
Thursday was once the see-it-all night, but NBC's insistence on
dragging along rocking-chair wrecks like the must-miss ``Single
Guy,'' ``Jesse'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' has gradually killed the
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' is fine, ``ER'' still thrills, and ``Frasier'' will
come out of its current slump to thrill again, but Tuesday has
become the don't-call-me-after-7 night, which actually starts
earlier with the WGN airing of ``Buffy, The Vampire Slayer.'' Then
comes Fox's ``King of the Hill,'' NBC's ``NewsRadio'' (taping WGN's
``Felicity'' all the while), ABC's ``Spin City'' and ``Sports
Night'' (taping, meanwhile, NBC's ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``Will &AMP;
Grace''). Finally comes the resurgent ``NYPD Blue.'' Total, that's
six (sometimes time-shifted) hours of top-notch tube on one night.
Six-and-a-half if you throw in ``3rd Rock From the Sun.'' Whew! And
wow! &QL;

SANCTIONS END MARRIAGE AND `REAL LIFE' FOR IRAQ'S WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ A decade ago, Iman Mohammed was a new
schoolteacher who earned the equivalent of $400 a month and spent a
fair amount of it keeping herself smartly dressed and pretty in the
hope of attracting the best possible husband.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ms. Mohammed still teaches fifth-graders, but inflation
has reduced the value of her monthly salary to just $2. She lives
at home with her widowed mother and five brothers and sisters, and
has all but given up hope of starting a family of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two brothers support the family, but they have no money to
get married,'' she said during a break between classes on Thursday.
``Other young men are in the same situation. I am ready to marry
anyone who asks, but who can do it in these conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   Depressed, unable to contribute substantially to her family and
facing the prospect of living her life without a husband, Ms.
Mohammed, 36, is typical of her generation of Iraqi women. Although
eight years of economic sanctions on Iraq have devastated the
entire society, women have suffered most acutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctions have changed many things for women,'' Ms.
Mohammed said. ``There is no work, so men do not get married. Women
can barely afford food or medicine, and the idea of having anything
nice is just a dream. When I was young, I was middle class and
happy. Now my adulthood is being denied to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and men can adjust more easily to this situation. They
can go everywhere they like. They can have jobs, even if they are
bad ones. We are much more limited. We can't even go out for a
picnic. It causes us great psychological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Iraqi women like Ms. Mohammed work in public jobs,
and nearly all earn about what she earns. They avoid starvation
largely because of monthly food rations supplied by the United
Nations and paid for with money the government is allowed to earn
by selling oil. The sanctions, imposed by the United Nations in an
effort to persuade President Saddam Hussein to curb his weapons
program and ease his harsh regime, forbid almost all foreign trade
and have reduced the Iraqi economy to ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Women like Ms. Mohammed do not work mainly for income, like
people in the rest of the world. Without jobs they would have no
alternative but to sit at home, so they work to occupy their minds
and maintain contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics about marriage rates here, but
anecdotal evidence suggests that they have plummeted. One Iraqi
newspaper recently estimated that 70 percent of Iraqis between the
ages of 18 and 40 are unmarried. In interviews this week, women of
all social classes said they knew of almost no young people who
have married in the last eight years or are preparing to marry. It
is a phenomenon that could have widespread social effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, marriage takes a woman out of her home and
gives her independence,'' said a 24-year-old graduate student who
asked to be identified only by her first name, Nebras. ``Single
women must follow very strict rules. It is impossible to have a
boyfriend. Living alone is out of the question. The only way to
have a real life and become a real person is to marry. Nowadays we
can't do that, because sanctions have made it impossible for men to
earn enough to support a family. It is a very difficult situation
for us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nebras is highly intelligent and vivacious and comes from a
well-to-do background. Women with fewer assets face different and
perhaps even more daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sanctions were imposed eight years ago, after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, Widad Abdul-Latif was busy from morning to night
caring for her two sons and seven daughters. Her husband earned a
good living as a tailor, and her sons ran a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the sanctions took effect, her husband's business
collapsed along with that of virtually every other tailor in the
country, since people found themselves without money for new
clothes. Later the grocery store failed for similar reasons. Ms.
Abdul-Latif, now 58, began putting in 11-hour days selling falafel
sandwiches on a street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shameful for women to do work like this, but I have no
choice,'' she said. ``My sons do construction work when they can
find it, but without the few pennies I bring home, we could not
survive. My daughters stay at home all day. They will never marry,
not as long as the embargo continues. Men cannot afford to marry.
As for women, what can we say? Nothing. We can only keep silent.''

<P>
   More than halfway into what they hope will be a nonstop journey
around the world, the three crewmen of the ICO Global Challenge
balloon were speeding across the Pacific Ocean toward the United
States Thursday. Their immediate goal was to try to avoid a patch
of weather that could force them to end their attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The balloonists _ Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand, both
British, and Steve Fossett, an American _ had completed 12,500
miles of the flight by Thursday. They set out a week ago from
Marrakesh, Morocco, and since then have crossed North Africa,
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Japan and heading out over the Pacific late Wednesday,
the balloon entered the jet stream and quickly reached 190 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The balloonists need all the speed they can get to skirt a
low-pressure trough about 1,000 miles away. The depression
threatened to suck the balloon southward toward Hawaii, where wind
patterns would not permit it to get back on course and where an
ocean landing would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Kendrick, the team's operations director in Uxbridge,
England, said in a telephone interview that there was a good chance
the balloon would get safely past the danger zone and arrive over
Oregon late Christmas Day. After that, he said, the balloon should
be able to cross the United States in about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks as if we'll make landfall in Oregon, and
then the balloon may track near Chicago,'' Kendrick said. ``After
that, it's likely to fly over the Carolinas before heading out over
the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the balloon will be flying at or above 30,000 feet over
the United States, if skies are clear it may be visible from the
ground as a small speck in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was looking forward to another milestone: breaking the
balloon distance record, which is held by Fossett. Last August
Fossett, who has made four previous round-the-world attempts on his
own, traveled 14,232 miles from Argentina to a crash landing in the
Coral Sea, breaking his own record.
</P>
<P>
   On the current trip, Fossett joined his onetime competitors,
Branson and Lindstrand, and by midday Thursday they were within
2,000 miles of setting a new record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be relieved to get over the United States,'' Kendrick
said, ``because it's dry land and the weather should be safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ICO Global Challenge team has been deluged with inquiries
about the flight. A spokesman said that in the first week the
team's Internet site, http://www.icoglobal.com, had received more
than 40 million ``hits,'' or visits.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, news agencies reported that China had
barred any future overflights by balloonists. Since balloon flights
also are banned by Libya, Iraq, Iran and Russia, round-the-world
flight attempts in the northern hemisphere may have been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Branson's team was given Chinese overflight permission in
November, but last week, as his balloon was crossing into Tibet
from Nepal, the Chinese government rescinded its permission and
ordered him to land. After intense diplomatic efforts, however, the
balloon was allowed to proceed.

1999: ANOTHER HIGH-RISK YEAR  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas has come and gone, and only a handful of days remain
in what has been for many a truly unusual _ and often painful _
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hal W. Reynolds, chief investment officer of Wilshire Asset
Management, which runs about $10 billion from its headquarters in
Santa Monica, Calif., reflected last week about what sort of a year
it was, and offered some thoughts about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Developments in financial markets in the United States and
around the world have generated a lot of surprises this year. But
has 1998 really been that atypical?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if I would call it unusual. We tend to get
equity corrections every three to four years. The situation in
emerging markets, which began in the fall of 1997, is not an
unusual event, because we have seen boom-and-bust cycles there
before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Large-capitalization stocks have outperformed small caps for
five years in a row now. And the performance of the average equity
fund has badly lagged behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which is up well over 20 percent this year. What does that say?
</P>
<P>
   A. It does not say investors would do better buying individual
stocks than mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The return-to-risk ratio of individual stocks is far inferior to
a well-diversified portfolio. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's index is
not the market. Moreover, about half the stocks that are in it have
returned less than a money market fund this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Long-Term Capital, the hedge fund that almost failed this
fall, provided a jolt to the financial system. What should we take
away from that experience?
</P>
<P>
   A. The lessons to be learned from Long-Term Capital are much
more relevant to institutional investors than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions went into hedge funds because they were very
concerned about high valuations in the equity market and wanted
diversification. But a highly leveraged hedge fund carries similar
or higher levels of risk than staying in equities.
</P>
<P>
   The near-collapse of Long Term Capital stands as a reminder to
require transparency, and to have a good risk-monitoring system in
place. Buying into the best and the brightest, which is how
Long-Term was seen, isn't good enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Markets have been quite volatile this year. Should we expect
more of the same?
</P>
<P>
   A. The first eight years of this decade were a period when
equity risk was the lowest it has been in the post-World War II
era, with volatility running at about 12 percent. In 1998, it was
closer to 20 percent. We think it will be close to that next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A. The characteristics of the stock market are different than
they used to be. We are getting more return in the form of capital
appreciation and less in the form of dividends. That makes stocks a
riskier asset. The dividend yield in 1990 was as high as 4 percent.
Today it is 1.4 percent. That is a pretty dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why will stocks be a risky investment in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a real chance we won't get strong earnings growth
next year. If that happens, we will probably get lower earnings
multiples on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So we think it is a good time for investors to look at sectors
of the market where the risk is less and returns are higher.
</P>
<P>
   One area we like is real estate investment trusts, which have
had a bad year. But the fundamentals are strong, and many REIT
stocks are trading with dividend yields of 6 percent to 6.5
percent. So you get a nice current return and an opportunity for
capital appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Emerging markets are a risky asset class that many investors
seem to have deserted permanently. Is that a wise move?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I don't think it is.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-risk investments like emerging markets require higher
returns but over longer time periods, not necessarily 5 to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In these markets, strong economies may not generate higher stock
prices unless there is higher earnings growth. That requires better
corporate governance and a greater alignment of interest between
shareholders and managers of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities are getting better in emerging markets. They
continue to be very risky, but stock valuations are much better
than three years ago. So the picture is improving.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You like bonds as an asset class. Isn't it hard to get
investors excited about something that yields only 5 or 6 percent?
</P>
<P>
   A. The public isn't that interested in bonds. But we need to
look at these yields relative to inflation, which over the last 12
months is running at under 2 percent. With the global economy
slowing down, it is unlikely that inflation is going to pick up. As
a result, real interest rates are going to remain very attractive.

GOOD IDEAS GOT BIGGER IN '98  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Things bubble up. An idea may be around for years, but
all of a sudden, it's on every magazine cover and Ted Koppel does a
town meeting on it for ``Nightline''.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were many bubbles. Some popped, others floated.
The success of an idea in pop culture is not related to whether it
is a good one. Sometimes it is the utterly trivial that keeps us
talking for months.
</P>
<P>
   This year, we did dry-cleaning, home runs, hurricanes and
professional wrestling. We considered the death of network TV, the
hybrid gas-electric car, and whether El Nin o might not be the
Ultimate Cause, the Prime Mover, the Right Wing Conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   We looked at the Euro, we bashed the press, we tsk-tsked both
sides in the NBA lockout. But these are the top-10 ideas of the
year:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' _ Forget ``South Park;'' it's last
year's news. Nothing on TV, nothing anywhere, better sums up
American culture than this MTV animation, which pits computer
animated media stars against each other in a no-holds barred
catfight to oblivion. Look for Carmen Electra to destroy Jenny
McCarthy, Jack Nicholson to trash-talk Leonardo DiCaprio. In one,
the Artist Formerly Known as Prince faces off with the prince
formerly known as Charles. And don't miss the tag-team slammathon
when Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise face Demi Moore and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   2. Institutionalized Excessiveness _ It doesn't matter if you're
Bill Clinton, Ken Starr or the nation's media, we've all gone
overboard this year. We can't help ourselves. No one seems able to
get off the trolley as we motor our way to Toonerville. Let's face
it, the word ``sagacity'' is no longer in our national vocabulary
and the rest of the world is giggling.
</P>
<P>
   3. Top 100 lists _ It's hard to remember a time when lists took
up quite so much of our attention. Obviously, we don't have enough
time to actually read the books or watch the movies, but we can all
talk about lists. Lists are efficient and give the impression you
have actually done something with your time.
</P>
<P>
   4. Genetic research _ Last year, it was Dolly; this year, it's
whole herds. We have also discovered the genetic blueprint for an
entire organism. Granted, it's a tiny wee worm no one ever heard of
before. But we can gene splice and make it possible for humans to
digest dirt. We just haven't decided whether that's a good thing,
and whether dirt will count as a vegetable in school lunch
programs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Hedge funds _ No. 1 bad idea of the year, come up with by
really smart people, including Nobel Prize winners. It turns out to
be an excellent way to lose money. What is it that is born every
minute?
</P>
<P>
   6. Political accountability _ What do we do with Augusto
Pinochet? What do we do with Slobodan Milosevic? What do we do with
Saddam Hussein? What do we do with Bill Clinton? What do we do with
Newt Gingrich? Only one of these questions has been answered. Yet,
we cannot make up our minds to what extent an individual is to be
held to account. If we become too moralistic, will any policy be
possible? And can any of us stand up to the same kind of
examination we give others? The new Puritanism begins to question
itself.
</P>
<P>
   7. Asteroids _ We're getting nervous. If it could happen to the
dinosaurs, it could happen to us. And it isn't just Bruce Willis in
the movies. Sunday science news is dominated by the real-life
questions of celestial bumper cars. Just because it hasn't happened
in 165 million years doesn't mean it can't happen next week. You
know what they say, ``You can't win if you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Reality programming gone nuts _ Networks are dying and they
look for cheap profits in five ``Datelines'' per week, three
``20/20s'' and even a clone of ``60 Minutes.'' But they're only the
tip of the iceberg. Look to syndication to find real-life car
chases, drug busts and people being eaten by animals. Fiction is
expensive; Jerry Springer is cheap. Someone else's video is even
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   9. Online Shopping _ Sure, we don't really know what happens to
our VISA numbers in the quasi-nimbus space of the Internet. But
Amazon.com seems to have everything. Soon, even Third World
countries will be able to purchase Mirage jets and cruise missiles
online. If things continue, it will soon be possible never to leave
your home ever for anything. You'll even get sunlight at
www.solardisc.com
</P>
<P>
   10. Big mergers _ The century began with trust-busting and it
ends with all the king's horses and all the king's men putting
Humpty together again. John D. Rockefeller gets the last laugh, as
Standard Oil is reincarnated. Ma Bell rises from the ashes. And
what's good for Daimler-Benz Chrysler is good for America. It is
predicted by 2015, Time Warner will be a nuclear power and what's
worse, everyone in America will have a button on his remote and a
finger on the button. &QL;

   For many Americans, December is a month for compulsory shopping
sprees, with the urgency escalating as Christmas approaches. But
for Olivia Hewitt, the seasonal panic goes beyond choosing between
a Furby (if she could find one) or a Barbie for her niece. Instead
she wondered, ``Should I get a fourth pair of glasses, have my
teeth cleaned again, do a marathon session with my therapist or try
acupuncture?''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ms. Hewitt, 31, a paralegal from Fremont, Calif., is
in perfect health, she faces the odd quandary of having to spend
$500 on medical care before the ball drops on New Year's Eve _ or
forfeit the money.
</P>
<P>
   And she is far from alone. Her deadline is shared by many of the
more than 4 million Americans who have Flexible Spending Accounts _
tax-free money set aside by employers for health-care expenses not
covered by insurance. These increasingly popular accounts provide a
hefty tax break on medical-related expenses ranging from
psychotherapy and orthodontia to contact lenses, contraceptives and
artificial limbs. The IRS allows employees to stash away any
amount, deducted from paychecks. Employers benefit by avoiding
payroll tax on that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for everyone,'' said Robert Owen, an owner of
Choice One, a benefits administration company in King of Prussia,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Participants must pick an amount at the beginning of each year,
and any money not spent by Dec. 31 goes back to the boss, who can
use it to pay for administering the program. This use-it-or-lose-it
rule can lead to an unusual spending binge at year's end, often on
goods and services people do not need.
</P>
<P>
   Podiatrists, optometrists, dentists, dermatologists, even
psychotherapists _ any provider of non-emergency care _ love the
program, and don't seem to mind having their holidays interrupted.
Some are even booking New Year's Eve appointments. ``Between
mid-November and late December, anyone who has money left in their
account comes in trying to get rid of it,'' said Krishan Patel, the
manager of Medical Optics, an eyeglass shop in Towson, Md. ``For
us, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   But some health-care advocates say the program may not be so
great for efforts to make health care more accessible to all
Americans. They say it mostly benefits wealthier Americans and
deprives the government of tax dollars that would be better spent
providing medical insurance to the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, though, the immediate problem is the
year-end surplus. Aetna Inc. estimates that at least two-thirds of
its 400,000 customers who have flexible spending accounts find
themselves with an average of $150 at the end of November.
``December rolls around and people suddenly realize that they have
to get busy,'' said Patty Seif, a company spokeswoman. ``No one
likes to lose money.''
</P>

<P>
   But finding a way to spend it often provokes more stress than
satisfaction. With $400 in her account last week, Caroline Power
Gangl was flustered. ``I could get a new pair of prescription
sunglasses or go to the chiropractor and get an adjustment, but it
all seems so unnecessary,'' said Ms. Power Gangl, 35, a public
relations executive in Hershey, Pa. ``If I had crow's feet, I'd go
in for some surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Some try a little creative bending of the rules, which
specifically disallow numerous procedures, like liposuction and
teeth bleaching, by urging doctors to deem all manner of procedures
medically necessary. A California woman suffering from psoriasis
spent down her account on a curative bath in the Dead Sea. Another
tried to use her tax-free savings on exercise tapes; one man
submitted receipts for a new hardwood floor that replaced the
carpeting he said was making him ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will try anything,'' said Debbie Venie Robinson, a
spokeswoman for Cigna Corp. The company did accept the woman's
airfare to Israel as a bona fide medical-related expense. But the
new flooring and the exercise tapes? Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   While the last-minute rush is often frustrating for account
holders, health-care providers can't praise them enough. ``It's
better than Christmas,'' said Carl Zyskowski, the owner of
Eyetopia, a chain of optical stores in Hartford. Like many
opticians, Zyskowski said lots of people find it easier to spend
their leftover savings on saline solution, disposable contact
lenses or designer glasses than submit to another physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Some even call on Dec. 31 and beg the store to charge their
credit card for amounts as high as $300. Then, after the new year,
they come in to use their credit. ``December used to be the slowest
month,'' he said. ``Now it's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cary Silverman, an ophthalmologist in Parsippany, N.J., said
the growth of flexible spending accounts has been a boon to his
laser surgery practice. The procedure, which permanently corrects a
patient's vision, costs $5,000 for both eyes. Depending on the tax
bracket of the patient, that means it is up to $2,000 cheaper for
those using flexible dollars. ``That's a real incentive,'' said
Silverman, who sent out notices to patients last month reminding
them of the savings _ and the deadline. The response has been so
good he has scheduled several appointments on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Zarem, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said he
would have to end his Christmas vacation early this year. ``We're
all jammed up,'' he said, ``but I'm not complaining.'' Physicians
and dentists also like the fact that there are no insurance forms
to fill out; patients simply submit receipts to their accounts
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal tax law does not allow the money to be spent on
purely cosmetic surgery, some patients say they get around the
rules by asking their doctors to describe procedures as medically
necessary. ``We had a woman in here the other day who wanted breast
augmentation and asked us to say it was necessary,'' said Dr. Susan
Downey, a Los Angeles plastic surgeon. ``There can be gray areas,
but this clearly was not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Created by Congress in 1984, flexible spending accounts were
designed to give workers relief from ever-shrinking health-care
coverage. But to gain the tax-free dollars, account holders had to
risk forfeiting unused money at the end of each year. IRS officials
explained that condition by likening the program to health
insurance, noting that you can't ask for your premium back at the
end of the year just because you didn't get sick.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But some health-care experts say this provision has hampered the
growth of the program, which is used by about 20 percent of those
it is offered to, according to the Employers Council on Flexible
Compensation, a Washington-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful, inexpensive money, but a lot of people are
dissuaded by the fear of losing what they don't spend,'' said
Bonnie Whyte, a lobbyist for the council, which estimates that
nearly a million people lost an average of $156 in 1994, the most
recent year for which figures are available. The council has so far
been unable to persuade Congress to make changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., plans to introduce a bill in the
House next year that would give participants the option of rolling
over their accounts from year to year, transferring it into an IRA
or taking any unused money as taxable income. ``The law is silly,''
he said, ``and has the perverse effect of forcing people to
overconsume otherwise unnecessary health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the entire concept is misguided. ``I can't imagine
anything more hare-brained,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health-care
economist at Princeton University. ``I wonder what kind of fiendish
mind is forcing me to get a fourth colonoscopy every year so I burn
down my account?'' Like other critics, Reinhardt said the plan
unfairly benefits those in high tax brackets while lower-income
workers go without any health-care coverage. ``Why are rich people
getting a 40 percent discount on their kids' orthodontia,'' he
asked, ``but gas station attendants have no insurance at all?''
</P>
<P>
   Even while struggling to spend down their accounts, most of
those who use them say the benefits outweigh the year-end stress
and the occasional lost money. Even those who put, say, $5,000 in
an account but spend only $4,000 will probably win out: Assuming a
30 percent marginal tax rate, the account has cost them only $3,500
out of pocket, so they are $500 ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Venie Robinson of Cigna, who called herself ``a poster
child for flexible benefits,'' says she finds plenty of use for the
$1,000 she puts aside each year. Some of it goes toward
deductibles, prescription drugs, contact lenses and co-payments for
visits to the doctor. She has also had elective surgery on her feet
twice, once to treat an in-grown toenail and another time to
correct a hammertoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my daughter is in day care, which is a germ factory, so
I'm constantly finding good use for the money,'' said Ms. Venie
Robinson, who lives in Wilmington, Del. ``If it wasn't for these
accounts, I would probably still be embarrassed to wear sandals in
public.''

ANALYSIS: NEW THREATS TO CHINA'S DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just in case anyone here missed the point, the
state-run news media have given rare publicity to the severe
sentences dealt to three prominent leaders of an alternative
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chinese had never heard of the imprisoned men _ Xu Wenli,
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai _ and for months the local news media
had totally ignored their efforts to form a China Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   But after the sentences this week the press, sending a clear
message to any would-be dissidents, reported that the three
criminals who had threatened national security by promoting an
illegal party had been given sentences of 11 to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   After a draining week of shock and despair those who worked
openly to promote the party, by some estimates 200, are pondering
the next steps for the movement and for themselves. At least one
other organizer was sent to a labor camp. Most remain free, if
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree the intimidation has worked. In Wuhan, where
about 30 people had established an important branch of the party,
activities have been suspended, said Chen Zhonghe, a party leader
who spoke by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people here who sympathized with our goals and
might eventually have joined our party,'' Chen, 50, said. ``But
now, after these trials, it's impossible. Most people wouldn't dare
to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the authorities have made it clear that they intend to
shut down the party, which had become the focal point of the
democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experience suggests that advocates will soon find new
ways to challenge the system.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January 1997, after long prison sentences had
been given to two prominent dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan,
the U.S. State Department declared in a report that no active
dissidents remained in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For most of last year it seemed that way. But toward the end of
the year, as Wei was sent to exile and Chinese-American relations
warmed, advocates sensed a slight easing of controls.
</P>
<P>
   People like Xu, 55, and Qin, 44, both of whom had already served
long prison terms, began faxing statements to colleagues and the
foreign press.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about the time that President Clinton visited China
in June, Wang Youcai founded the party. Almost overnight hundreds
of people appeared who seemed willing to risk everything for the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Even this week, as their senior colleagues were heading for
prison, some party members spoke bravely about carrying on, even
though they spoke on telephone lines that were almost certainly
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Wednesday a leading organizer, Gao Hongming, said:
``The China Democracy Party will continue working for a free
democratic China. And it will do so in a way that is public,
rational and nonviolent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao, 48, recently spent two years in labor camps for
distributing leaflets critical of the 1989 military crackdown on
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. The trials this week, he
acknowledged, had ``greatly slowed the development of a truly
national party.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``because of the achievements of the last six
months the mechanisms for its establishment are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gao said, advocates should work quietly to spread
democratic ideas at the local level. ``The government will feel it
can keep an eye on us,'' Gao said. ``I don't think they'll throw us
all in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown has had the opposite of the intended effects on at
least one person, Jia Wei, 36, a former high school teacher in the
northeastern city of Changchun. Jia said he had believed in
democracy since he was a teen-ager. But he never became involved in
organizing, preferring to use essays and lectures and the
occasional public letter to leaders, although he had recently been
intrigued enough by the democracy party to meet Xu here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This terrible repression has been a massive shock to my
spirit,'' he said of the sentences this week. ``Now I feel the work
of Xu Wenli has to be continued for the good of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct political activities may be necessary. And now I have
to contemplate the possibility of spending time in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   One big unknown for the movement is to what extent younger
people may become involved. Notably, virtually all those who joined
the Democracy Party were veterans of the Democracy Wall movement of
the late 1970s or the 1989 demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many students and other young people are skeptical
about the Communist Party. But few have shown a willingness to risk
their futures.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the event of prolonged economic hardship or
other social traumas. That fact helps explain why President Jiang
Zemin in a speech on Wednesday, his second hard-line speech on
social stability in a week, warned against ``infiltration by both
domestic and foreign hostile forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any factors that could jeopardize our stability,'' Jiang said,
``must be annihilated in the early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is especially sensitive about dissident
activities, because of growing unemployment and frequent protests
by unpaid workers. The Communist Party's great nightmare is a
joining of democracy and labor movements against it.
</P>
<P>
   In another pointed reminder the official People's Daily carried
new court instructions on Wednesday on how the revised criminal
code would apply in prosecutions of illegal publications. Knowingly
publishing or disseminating materials that incite splitting of the
country or overthrow of the socialist system, the instructions
said, would be tried as serious crimes, including subversion of
state power.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday a man who tried to organize a pressure group for
laid-off workers is to be tried in Henan province for endangering
national security, according to the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The coming year is seen as a touchy one, too, because of the
10th anniversary of the crushed Tiananmen Square demonstrations, as
well as the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But the security apparatus needed no special reasons to quash
the China Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Any threat to the supremacy of the Communist Party is, by
definition, a threat to national security. That gave officials a
neat way to explain why the recent trials did not violate the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China
has signed but not ratified. All three defendants were convicted of
subversion.
</P>
<P>
   China, of course, abides by the covenant stipulations on freedom
of belief, speech, assembly and association, said a long commentary
issued on Tuesday by the official New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But because the three convicted democracy advocates imperiled
the state, the commentary continued, ``it is logical that the
Chinese judiciary bring such criminals before the law in order to
protect the human rights of the Chinese people.''

   ISRAEL-GENERAL (Jerusalem) _ Thirty-six years after he joined

and plunged into civilian life in a peculiar role, dubbed by the
media here as ``the great white hope'' of Israeli politics. Shahak,
54, did not announce his candidacy for prime minister. But, even as
he tiptoed, Shahak, a silent shadow over the electoral aspirations
of both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak, finally stepped Thursday into the fray. By Deborah

turmoil over ``unrequited love'' for a former girlfriend and over
his mother's Christian pacifist faith, concludes a ``psychological

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ U.S. consumers took a late-autumn pause
last month from their recent relatively heavy levels of spending,

level in more than a year. Together with the recent performance of
the stock market, those signs point to continued economic
expansion, economists said. By Edward Wyatt.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been a general's maxim at least since the
time of the Romans: Let him who desires peace prepare for war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal lieutenants say they are planning an
aggressive defense in the Senate against the impeachment charges
lodged against Clinton even as he sues for peace in the form of a
speedy and bipartisan resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   But this strategy presents problems for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A combative stance toward the two articles of impeachment voted
by the House last Saturday could be read by conservative Senate
Republicans as a sign that Clinton still refuses to acknowledge
wrongdoing. The White House says it has identified about 20 Senate
Republicans it sees as eager for a trial that would conclusively
establish Clinton's guilt and justify his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Although White House officials profess confidence that they will
prevail in a trial, it could bring into the open some very ugly and
damaging testimony that could further tarnish the president's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can the White House appear too fervent in its desire for
censure. Any punishment the president so avidly seeks, these
critics will contend, cannot possibly be a sufficient rebuke for
his misconduct and for the past 11 months of national trauma.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not hard to imagine the president finding himself in
the same position he was in as the House impeachment vote neared.
Moderate House Republicans had said they might vote against
impeachment only if the president would confess to lying under
oath, something he would not do then, and, his lawyers insist, will
not do now.
</P>
<P>
   The White House must also contend with the Senate's jealously
guarded prerogatives and the fact that its 100 members will serve
as the silent jury for any trial of the president, should it come
to that.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., has already warned the White House
against tampering with the Senate jury, by injecting itself into
decisions about trial procedures or the wording of any resolution
of censure.
</P>
<P>
   The White House faces an additional problem: there is no single
Senate strategy to answer; there may be several separate
strategies, each requiring a different response. Further, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who
will lead the prosecution team in the Senate, has given no sign of
how he intends to present his case.
</P>
<P>
   So where is the way out for Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, who leads the White House impeachment defense
team, put it this way: ``What we want to do is show confidence in
our ability to meet these allegations. We think there are strong
legal and factual defenses against these articles.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not inconsistent, Craig said, to prepare to mount an
aggressive legal challenge to the impeachment accusations while
seeking a plea bargain on lesser charges. It is what any good
defense lawyer would do, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the president had suffered during the House debate
from the conventional wisdom that he was not contesting the facts
of the accusations against him. Craig repeated the White House
contention that even if most of the accusations were true _ which
he is not conceding _ they would not warrant impeachment and
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in the White House and among Democratic partisans
who contend that Clinton should stop pleading for censure and fight
the charges in a trial, although this is not Craig's current
position, nor the president's. These supporters of the president
maintain that the impeachment articles will not withstand the
scrutiny of a trial and that the resulting acquittal will clear
Clinton's name for all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why agree to a censure?'' said Rep. Robert C. Scott, D-Va., a
member of the House Judiciary Committee who voted against all four
impeachment articles. ``That's admitting guilt, and maybe he's not
guilty. It's also something the Republicans cannot prove.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side are Republicans who contend that a trial
may bring to light evidence that can ultimately lead 67 senators,
the necessary two-thirds majority, to vote to convict Clinton and
thus remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is prepared to use a Senate trial to assail the
credibility of Monica Lewinsky and others, whose testimony forms
the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the legal team for Clinton said the president's
lawyers would not flinch from challenging Ms. Lewinsky's
truthfulness on matters where her grand jury testimony conflicts
with the president's.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the heart of the first impeachment article,
accusing the president of perjury before a federal grand jury on
Aug. 17, is the charge that the president lied when he denied
directly touching Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and genitals. Clinton
testified that he had no such contact.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers are prepared to portray these statements
as her word against his with no independent corroboration. They are
also ready to call as witnesses friends of Ms. Lewinsky who will
testify that she frequently exaggerated the details of her trysts
with the president to make it appear that they had a reciprocal
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning'' an impeachment trial, in other words, would have its
costs, both for the nation and for the president. And it is far
from certain that acquittal would give Clinton the historical
exoneration that his loyalists seek on his behalf. He remains only
the second president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vindication?'' one White House adviser mused. ``It's a little
late for that now.''

   President Clinton's impeachment was unlikely to figure
prominently in Christmas Eve and Christmas Day sermons, according
to clergy interviewed Thursday who said they planned to preach
instead on themes like hope and new beginnings, as a way of
addressing the holiday's Christian significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus tonight is a different kind of focus,'' said the
Rev. Doug Slaughter, pastor of Community United Methodist Church in
Ogden, Utah. He added, however, that he thought it appropriate for
clergy to speak on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   One who said she would refer to the political crisis on
Christmas was the Rev. Barbara Crafton, rector of St. Clement's
Episcopal Church in New York. ``My message on this day,'' she said,
``is that we must not allow ourselves as a society to descend and
remain at the level of our basest motivations, but must carry
forward as the very best we can be as people, not the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she was ``struck by the contrast between the good
will and extra mile everyone in this neighborhood goes to at this
time of year. People all over fall over each other being good to
others. That is in such stark contrast to the venality of
retribution, revenge, accusation, defensiveness we see in our
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Bruce, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in
Austin, Texas, said that rather than speak about Clinton, he would
preach on Christmas Eve about ``Christ pulling us toward each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Walter Modrys, pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola Roman
Catholic Church in New York, said he would not mention Clinton in
his homily. ``I think that people in a parish like this are pretty
well informed and have heard a lot of the arguments,'' he said. ``I
think the important thing at Christmas is to address the underlying
spiritual and moral and human issues and values people need to live
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clergy said they chose last Sunday to discuss the House of
Representatives' vote to impeach Clinton, which occurred the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Rick Pittenger, pastor of Vincent United Methodist
Church in Minot, N.D., said that although he did not avoid
controversial issues, he did not plan to mention the impeachment.
``I think people are tired of hearing about it,'' he said, ``and I
think they want to hear some good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Rev. John Hubers, pastor of University
Reformed Church in Ann Arbor, Mich., said he preached on ``the need
for forgiveness,'' although without specifically mentioning the
confrontation between Clinton and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But some clergy said they would make at least a passing mention
of the impeachment. At St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New
York, the Rev. William Tully said he would make ``a very simple
reference'' to the conjunction of the political crisis and the
Christmas season as a way of talking about God, through Jesus,
coming into an imperfect world.
</P>
<P>
   In his Christmas Eve sermon, which he was working on Thursday
afternoon, he had written, ``No matter where we begin in the
Christmas journey, we know we are likely to encounter both the
world as it is, the world the Christ came to save; and the new
world begun in the ministry of Jesus.''

   Sport utilities or sports cars? I'll take the latter, though
today's four-wheel rockets are so good that roads in the Northeast
_ with low speed limits, radar traps and darting deer _ cannot
really test their capabilities. But even when driven mildly, new
Porsches and BMWs stood out, as did more practical, less pricey
machines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AM GENERAL HUMMER ($66,522-$99,645) There are perfectly good
reasons to drive this mammoth, sluggish, uncomfortable, deafening,
costly _ but virtually unstoppable _ vehicle. Like, if you're in
the Army. Or you have a ranch half the size of Saskatchewan. Or
you're a celebrity and want everyone to know it. For most of the
rest of us, it makes no sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   GRADE: D &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUDI A4 1.8T ($24,290-$32,640) Why is the A4 such a joy? Is it
the clean, sculptured lines? The steering, so close to perfection?
The all-wheel drive? Or is it, with the arrival of a free-revving
turbo four-cylinder, the satisfaction of fine German engineering at
prices that start in Subaru territory?
</P>
<P>
   A &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW M COUPE ($42,370) Forget ``Titanic'' and the Monica tapes,
the year's best entertainment was this lean, mean Go Kart on
17-inch wheels. If you'd like to commute in a roller coaster,
here's your ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A(plus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW M ROADSTER ($43,270) With a thumping engine from BMW's ``M''
works, this speedy variant of the Z3 softtop finally lives up to
the styling's promise. Just don't push it too hard; the tail may
wag the dog.
</P>
<P>
   A(minus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW 3-SERIES ($26,970-$45,300) The quintessential sport sedans
have been cautiously remade, with a bit more room, a little more
luxury and an even more solid structure. The 323i and 328i remain
thoroughly wonderful drivers' cars.
</P>

   CADILLAC ESCALADE ($46,525) Of folks who pretended to have more

</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CORVETTE ($38,777-$48,978) Muscular and impressive,
America's sports car is a wild beast: awesome, but hard to keep on
a leash. Long trips may wear on you, but compared with its
predecessors, this 'Vette is easy to live with. A cheaper hardtop
puts it within grasp of the Camaro crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A(minus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET SILVERADO ($15,995-$32,343) General Motors' most
crucial vehicle is new from bow tie to tailgate, with excellent
driving dynamics and a great new cabin. Unfortunately, it doesn't
look much different and it doesn't yet offer four doors. Otherwise,
a class act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER LHS ($29,445-$31,055) Chrysler's luxury leader is a
glorified Chrysler Concorde. Nothing wrong with that, but the LHS
is neither as refined nor as sophisticated as some cars it aspires
to compete with. Still, the design is a knockout.
</P>

   B &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAEWOO LEGANZA ($14,790-$19,360) This Korean flagship has
interesting styling and decent workmanship. But it lists on turns
and bounces on bumps, and the engine stumbles for no obvious
reason. You can't take on Toyota with a car like this.
</P>

<P>
   FORD RANGER ($12,850-$32,690) A freshening for '98 enhanced the

pickups.

   B(plus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI G20 ($21,520-$25,320) Infiniti would have you think
this is a Japanese BMW, a bargain sport sedan to run with the big
dogs. Alas, it's just a puppy. The steering is too slow, the
chassis is too soft, the shifter is too imprecise, the engine is
too meek. Not a Bimmer, but a nice Nissan Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   C(plus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEXUS GS 400 ($45,505-$53,755) BMW's 5-Series has been, in my
view, the gold standard of sedans, a four-star balance of luxury,
performance, style and comfort. Lexus took aim at the 5-Series and
hit the bull's-eye: The GS is fast, poised, comfortable,
exhilarating. It's virtually the equal of the 540i; it may be even
better.

<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ CLK320 ($41,195-$51,795) Proof that Mercedes is
becoming American, the CLK coupe and convertible are
ever-so-slightly-daring and nicely appointed _ a Teutonic update of
the '67 Buick Wildcat.

<P>
   NISSAN FRONTIER
</P>
<P>
   ($12,010-$22,420) As trucks become ever more like cars, Nissan's
small hauler seems stuck in the 70s. It handles nicely and the
workmanship impresses, but it is cramped, uncomfortable, hard-edged
and very old-feeling.
</P>
<P>
   D(plus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE INTRIGUE ($21,735-$27,965) This midsize sedan
impresses more each time one drives it. Solid and stylish in a
quiet way, it is the kind of bread-and-butter car G.M. has needed
for two decades, but had seemed incapable of pulling off.
</P>
<P>
   A &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC GRAND AM ($16,595-$22,200) The '99 remake of this
perennial hot-seller wins, hands-down, the award for Most Improved.
A rigid new body smooths the ride, but the handling falls short of
the promise of the sporty styling.
</P>
<P>
   B(minus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE 911 ($65,795-$84,540) The 911's first redesign in 34
years is stunning, from the coupe's clean, simple lines to
high-speed handling best appreciated on a closed track. The
downside is the window sticker, especially the Cabriolet's, which
makes one appreciate the $42,000 Boxster all the more.
</P>
<P>
   A(plus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO C70 ($37,570-$48,165) The turbo is a screamer. The styling
is _ for Volvo _ a show-stopper. The appointments are posh. Yet
these top-end coupes and convertibles feel unrefined and
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   C(minus) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN NEW BEETLE ($16,425-$21,250) Sure, it's adorable.
Yes, you (your mother/your swami/your financial planner) drove one
of the originals (to Woodstock/to Haight-Ashbury/to Kabul,
Afghanistan). But beyond all that, this is a fine car: stylish,
comfortable, reasonably priced. It scores well in crash tests. The
design is clever, the execution is brilliant and the materials set
new standards for small cars.

MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED: REPORT CARDS FOR THE CLASS OF '98-'99  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)

   In the world of cars, 1998 started as the Age of Aquarius, Part
II, thanks to the frenzy surrounding the rebirth of the Volkswagen
Beetle. But it ended as the Year of the Truck, with light trucks
outselling cars in the United States for the first time, in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks were everywhere. General Motors brought out all-new
full-size pickups, its best-selling vehicles. Chrysler put four
doors on its extended-cab Dodge Ram pickups, and Ford went one
better, offering four-door versions of all its haulers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's big Super Duty pickups, descendants of the big work
trucks one used to see mainly on farms, building sites and the
like, started showing up in the driveways of manicured suburbs. And
after falling short on its first try, Toyota prepared to launch
another strike on Detroit's best-defended fortress: big, brawny
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Another booming subset of the truck market, fancy sport
utilities _ call them ``status utility vehicles'' _ went from very
hot to a full boil. Toyota and Lexus redesigned their big models.
GM brought out luxury models, including the first truck ever from
Cadillac. Chrysler redid its Jeep Grand Cherokee, and other
companies _ from BMW to Porsche to Volkswagen _ made plans to jump
on the off-road bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the most significant vehicle of the year may
turn out to be the Lexus RX 300, which offers the attributes of
both cars and sport utilities. A huge sales success, it is sure to
be widely copied.
</P>
<P>
   In such a truck-centered year, there was plenty of car news,
too. Daimler merged with Chrysler, making the $11,000 Neon a
stepsister of the $130,000 Mercedes S-Class. Mazda, Mitsubishi and
Nissan struggled; Hyundai bought Kia, and Daewoo, another South
Korean car maker, pinned its hopes on college students' selling
cars on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and BMW battled for Rolls-Royce in a bidding war that
BMW seemed to lose, but ultimately won _ getting rights to the
Rolls name for a fraction of what VW paid for the rest of the
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Business aside, how were the cars and trucks of '98? Two
contributors to this page thumbed back through their notebooks, got
out their red pencils and graded some of the vehicles they drove
this year. Criteria were simple: How well did each fulfill its
potential? And more basically, at a time when many new cars are
good but bland, which ones really stood out? As in school, the
teachers have their pets. At least there are no failing grades, and
the year will not have to be repeated. &QL;

LE PEN EXPELS 7 PARTY LEADERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A split of France's far-right National Front party
appears likely after the party's founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had
his former deputy and six other party leaders expelled from its
executive body this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Megret, Le Pen's deputy until the two clashed publicly
this month over strategy for next June's European Parliament
elections, was formally expelled from the National Front's
political bureau on Wednesday along with six of his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen had summoned the seven to party headquarters in suburban
St.-Cloud to explain themselves. They refused to go.
</P>
<P>
   Megret used to describe the Front as a sort of political family
for French voters alienated by corruption, immigration from former
French colonies, European integration and high unemployment, all of
which the party promises to end if it wins power.
</P>
<P>
   One of the six supporters expelled with Megret this week lives
with Le Pen's eldest daughter, Marie-Caroline. She is trying to
organize a reconciliation between the factions.
</P>
<P>
   But another expelled Megret supporter, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, said
Thursday that it seemed likely that two separate National Front
slates of candidates would run in the European Parliament
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that would be a catastrophe, because it would
allow the voters to choose and it would be a sort of primary
election for the right nationally between Jean-Marie Le Pen and
Bruno Megret,'' Le Gallou said.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for the European Parliament, unlike those for France's
national legislature, use a system of proportional representation
that gives parties in each country a share of seats that
corresponds to their share of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen said before the split burst into the open that he hoped
that the party would end up next year with 20 or 21 members of the
European Parliament, which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg. The
National Front won 11 in the last elections, in 1994. It took about
15 percent of the vote last year in elections to France's
legislature, but it has no seats there.
</P>
<P>
   Megret's supporters say they have collected more than 14,000
signatures on a petition for a special party congress Jan. 23-24 in
Marignane, a southern French town where one of the expelled party
leaders is Mayor. Megret's wife, Catherine, is Mayor of Vitrolles,
one of the three others where the National Front controls a
majority in the municipal council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only legitimate National Front will be the one that
emerges from the congress,'' said Serge Martinez, who also was
expelled from the political bureau Wednesday. Le Pen's chief
lieutenant, Bruno Gollnisch, retorted that anyone who attended such
a congress would be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   With Le Pen fighting a criminal assault conviction for attacking
a Socialist campaigner against his daughter during last year's
elections, Megret had suggested that he himself should take his
place at the head of the National Front ticket for the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen wanted his wife to run if he could not, but he can unless
the country's Supreme Court turns down his appeal before next June
and disqualifies him. But a ruling that soon, he said, would be
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   So as things now look, Megret and Le Pen will run at the top of
two separate slates, both calling themselves ``National Front.''
Megret has made clear he believes that Le Pen, with his reputation
and his reckless, sometimes anti-Semitic remarks, is a liability
keeping the National Front from exploiting common ground with other
conservative parties and sharing power nationwide.

ECONOMISTS SEE SIGNS OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. consumers took a late-autumn pause last month from their
recent relatively heavy levels of spending as incomes surged and
personal savings grew for the first time in four months.
</P>
<P>
   Jobless claims also fell last week to their lowest level in more
than a year. Together with the recent performance of the stock
market, which approaches the end of the year at near-record levels,
those signs point to continued economic expansion, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets reacted positively to the news, with the Dow
Jones industrial average rising 15.96 points, to 9,217.99, in an
abbreviated trading session. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
measured a mere 247 million shares, the lowest this year. Broader
market benchmarks were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index and the Nasdaq composite index falling slightly and the
Russell 2000 index, a measure of smaller company stocks, inching
up.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the Federal Reserve might be satisfied with the
economy's progress after three cuts in interest rates this year,
bond traders sent prices lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to
5.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that personal income
grew by five-tenths of 1 percent in November, while spending grew
by one-tenth of a percent. That makes November the first month
since July in which income growth surpassed spending growth.
</P>
<P>
   The December holiday season is likely to have brought more
spending by consumers, however, and perhaps a return to the
negative rate of personal savings, which showed up this fall for
the first time since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the overall trend is still toward spending
and not toward savings, as it has been since the middle of 1997,''
said Kenneth Safian, the president of Safian Investment Research of
White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending is the main fuel of the domestic economy, but
sharp increases in outlays can worry Wall Street that consumers
will have to stop and let their incomes catch up with their bills.
Safian said, however, that the current environment did not carry
such ominous overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend to increased spending is not as severe as it was at
other stock market peaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, too much saving by individuals is seen by some
economists as a precursor to recession. The Commerce Department
said the savings rate, measured as a percentage of disposable
personal income, measured one-tenth of a percent in November,
compared with a negative two-tenths of a percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   The slower growth in spending last month could be traced to two
factors, financial analysts said. Purchases of new cars, which
jumped in September and October after the settlement of a strike
during the summer by General Motors workers, returned to more
normal levels last month. And a spate of mild autumn weather held
back spending on electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also revised its estimate of personal
expenditures for October; it now thinks that spending grew by
seven-tenths of a percent rather than five-tenths of a percent as
previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Jobless claims also moved contrary to expectations, falling by
13,000 last week, to 287,000 claims. Economists had been expecting
claims to rise by about 12,000, according to Bloomberg News. Last
week's level of jobless claims was the lowest since late July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the labor market probably also contributed to
the growth in income, but the gains were spread unevenly across
industries, the Commerce Department reported. Wages and salaries
were nearly flat, when compared with those of the previous month,
in manufacturing and distribution companies. But service companies
reported that they paid about 1 percent more in wages last month
than in October.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the income of farm owners rose by more than 10
percent last month despite continued declines in commodity prices
as subsidy payments by government programs grew.

   He might have called it ``Stadium! Stadium!'' Or, in a more
classical allusion, simply ``The Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Michael Ilitch, the owner of both the Little Caesars
pizza chain and the Detroit Tigers baseball team, last week sold
the naming rights for the Tigers' new stadium to Comerica Bank,
which will pay $66 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ball park, scheduled to open in 2000, will join more than 40
other major league stadiums and arenas in North America that have
been named for corporate sponsors _ about half of all the venues
for professional baseball, football, basketball and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough, in fact, that the commercialized parks merit a
league of their own. So Money and Business has created standings,
based on the year-to-date stock performance of the corporate
sponsors of arenas and stadiums now in use or under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were assigned to divisions based on the locations
of the buildings they sponsor, with eight or nine in each of the
four United States divisions and a separate division for the five
arenas in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The geography keeps Pepsico from competing against itself: Its
Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball team, is
in the Southern division, while the Pepsi Center, future home of
the Colorado Avalanche hockey team and the Denver Nuggets
basketball team, is in the Central.
</P>
<P>
   With the quickening pace of new stadium construction and the
rising demand for naming rights, more expansion teams can be
expected to join the Arena League before long. The Detroit Lions,
owned by William Clay Ford, plan a new stadium next to Comerica
Park, which will be named for the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Finding correlations between stock prices and on-field
performance awaits a sponsor for the research.

FARMLAND INDUSTRIES SELECTS NEW HEADQUARTERS SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In one of the biggest economic development
deals of the year, Farmland Industries Inc. announced Tuesday that
it plans to consolidate area offices near Kansas City International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland, which has about 1,800 area employees, plans to sign a
contract to buy a 122-acre site near the junction of Interstate 29
and Interstate 435 from interests controlled by Floridian William
Parma.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for construction of a 250,000-square-foot building at
the site to house about 900 employees; those employees now work in
seven buildings north of the Missouri River. The company also plans
to build a new headquarters building and move from the current
location at 3315 N. Oak Trafficway.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said no dollar estimate of the multiple phase project
was available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Cleberg, Farmland's president and chief executive officer,
announced that the consolidation would reduce Farmland's operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is convenient to the majority of our employees who
live north of the river and, with excellent highway access, easily
accessible to those who do not,'' Cleberg said. ``It also is
convenient to the airport and to our world headquarters building.
The parcel of land is large enough to give us the flexibility we
need as we plan for the future, and it was fairly priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland and Kansas City attorney Mike Burke, representing
Parma, declined to comment on terms of the land sale.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland noted that the land sale is not final and depends on
several factors, including ``negotiating a satisfactory economic
development package with local and state governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farmland project has been one of the area's most hotly
pursued development plums in recent months. Despite uncertainties
about the final form of the project, and related financial
incentives, city officials expressed pleasure with the news.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland spokeswoman Sherlyn Manson said Kansas City, Platte
County and the state of Missouri had told Farmland to pick a site
and then enter talks about economic development incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been courted by other municipalities,'' Manson said.
``We want to know that the city of Kansas City, Missouri, wants us
to stay here. We just want them to think about retaining business
in the same way they approach attracting new business.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland, one of only a handful of Fortune 500 companies based
in the Kansas City area, is a cooperative owned by about 600,000
North American farmers. It had $8.8 billion in sales in 1998, plus
$3 billion in sales from Farmland's share of business in affiliated
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said it had selected Chicago-based Walsh, Higgins &AMP; Co.
to develop the property. The developer will own the facilities, and
Farmland will lease them. Farmland expects to move about 900
employees into the building in the fall of 2000 and will retain
ownership of the undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said it was negotiating to sell its current
headquarters building to a real estate firm and to lease it back
for an undetermined period. Farmland declined to identify the real
estate firm it is talking to.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland said that within three to five years construction would
likely begin on headquarters at the new site. Walsh, Higgins would
also develop the new headquarters and lease that to Farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland processes and markets pork, beef and grain products. It
produces and markets fertilizer and petroleum products. Some of its
wares in supermarket meat cases include Farmland bacon and Farmland
Black Angus beef. It also owns meat brands such as OhSe.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation will involve only administrative offices and
will not affect production and processing facilities in the area.

OCTUPLETS' FATHER `STUNNED BEYOND BELIEF,' PROFOUNDLY HAPPY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking publicly for the first time since becoming father of
eight world-famous babies, Iyke Louis Udobi had a quick answer for
the all-important question:
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how to change a diaper?
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and said, ``I'll learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his brother-in-law and the doctors caring for his
wife and children, Udobi, who wore a light-blue Nigerian caftan and
matching hat, answered questions, ranging from what his thoughts
were when he first laid eyes on the octuplets to how he and his
wife, Nkem Chukwu, had met.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other recent fathers of multiples who have been
quick to tell the world of their paternal joy, Udobi, who also goes
by the name Iyke Paul Louis Jr., has kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm stunned beyond belief. I'm still taking it
in,'' he said. He went on to express profound happiness and
gratitude for the eight children, who remain in critical condition
at Texas Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi, 41, is a Nigerian-born respiratory therapist who has
lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and earned degrees in
business and respiratory therapy at Texas Southern University. He
met his wife in Nigeria on one of his annual trips home.
</P>
<P>
   They were married five years ago, he said, with ceremonies
conducted both in Nigeria and in the United States. Udobi and
Chukwu, 29, come from large families and have eight siblings
apiece. Chukwu miscarried a set of triplets earlier this year. The
octuplets, all of whom were given Nigerian names with a surname of
Louis, to honor Udobi's father, were conceived with the help of
fertility drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors have said the birth of octuplets is not a medical
miracle, but a medical disaster. They say the outlook for the eight
children is uncertain and their care will cost about $250,000
apiece by the time they are discharged, a total of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi said his wife had been seeing several doctors at a clinic
in Houston, but declined to be more specific about her infertility
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited and grateful to God for giving us these blessings.
Me and my wife are very elated and we thank God, we thank the
doctors, the therapists that made this possible,'' he said. ``We
thank the world that's been praying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When she gave birth, Chukwu had been in the hospital 2 1/2
months, and on strict bed rest for six weeks, the last two
positioned with her head down to take pressure off her cervix.
</P>
<P>
   One girl was delivered naturally on Dec. 8, the other seven were
born Dec. 20, 2 1/2 months premature, by Caesarean section at St.
Luke's, with healthcare workers handing them off bucket-brigade
style to be taken to Texas Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Udobi said he was unable to attend the births because they were
earlier than expected and he could not find anyone to relieve him
at his job in the St. Joseph's Professional Building.
</P>
<P>
   He deflected questions about the charge of misdemeanor assault
filed against him in September. He is scheduled for trial in
February, accused of striking, biting and hitting his 63-year-old
mother-in-law, Janet Chukwu, over the head with a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family has a problem we have worked through. The main
concern now is the welfare of my wife and my kids,'' said Udobi,
who has been visiting his infants daily.
</P>
<P>
   His brother-in-law Oni Chukwu, echoed his remarks: ``There are
times when there are problems. These have been worked out. The
family is together.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to make something clear. We're here talking about
the lives of babies that might actually . . .'' he said, pausing,
then adding, ``Some of them are sick and need prayers, need support
of all kinds. Let's focus on the good news this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Kirshon, a high-risk pregnancy expert at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital, said the mother is very weak due to her
prolonged hospitalization and medication and has not seen them
since they were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what she's gone through in the last three months, she's
making steady progress,'' Kirshon said, adding that she would be
hospitalized at least through the weekend. ``She's had lots of loss
of muscle mass. She's quite weak. As she gathers her strength,
she'll soon be seeing the babies.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies continued to make progress, too, as doctors on
Thursday stopped their sedation and gave them caffeine to improve
their breathing. Seven of the eight were expected to be breathing
on their own, without the help of ventilators, by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest, Odera, will remain on a ventilator for weeks. The
surfactant, a chemical given to the newborns to help their lungs
function, had very little effect on her, said Dr. Leonard Weisman,
chief of neonatology at Texas Children's. He said her lungs may
have been compressed by the crowded conditions in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's substantially more ill than the others,'' he said. It's
a good sign that she has been weaned from 100 percent pure oxygen
to 70 to 75 percent, he said, ``but it can change dramatically. In
one day it can all turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Odera is the hospital's smallest survivor, weighing just 10.3
ounces at birth, or 320 grams. The smallest baby ever to leave the
hospital weighed substantially more at birth, 444 grams.
</P>
<P>
   The infants' pediatrician, Patti Savrick, said she was
``guardedly optimistic'' about Odera. ``She has done better than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Udobi's brother-in-law, Oni Chukwu, said support has come from
diverse quarters, including the Roman Catholic church, Houston's
estimated 50,000-member Nigerian community, businesses and
individuals. On Thursday, the Embassy of Nigeria in Washington,
D.C., announced a $10,000 gift to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, our family, both here in the U.S., Nigeria and all over
the world, are extremely, extremely grateful for the outpouring of
support,'' Oni Chukwu said. ``There are absolutely no words to
express our joy at this time. I wish I could make my smile a little
bit wider, but I can't. I'm the proudest uncle. (The octuplets are)
the most wonderful gift, especially at this time of year.'' &QL;

 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Thirty-six years after he joined the army, Gen.
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak turned in his uniform on Thursday and plunged
into civilian life in a peculiar role, dubbed by the news media
``the great white hope'' of Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a battery of cameras outside a military
discharge center near Tel Aviv, Shahak, 54, did not announce his
candidacy for prime minister. He voiced no political opinion beyond
a call for ``togetherness.'' But even if he tiptoed, Shahak, a
silent shadow over the electoral aspirations of both Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and the opposition Labor Party leader, Ehud
Barak, had finally stepped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in general a time to hold hands with everyone possible
and to surrender everything that has to do with the ego,'' Shahak
said. But then he added, his blue eyes flashing a photogenic
steeliness, ``There will be a new way, and this new way is my
way.''
</P>
<P>
   One political cartoon published Thursday portrayed Shahak, a
former paratrooper who radiates what many here see as decency,
parachuting into a sea of sharks. He is expected to present himself
as a centrist candidate in elections to be held in the spring,
after Parliament's vote on Monday to dissolve Netanyahu's already
disintegrated government.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli public does not know much about Shahak's political
opinions, which may be one reason he leads most polls; one on
Thursday showed him trouncing Netanyahu, 48 percent to 33 percent,
with 18 percent undecided. (The same poll shows Netanyahu, with the
same 33 percent, losing to Barak's 45 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Shahak is from the old school of Israeli politics. A sabra, or
native-born Israeli, he comes from an Ashkenazi family that reaches
back five generations in the region. A career military man, he was
groomed by the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and retired as
army chief of staff. A lifelong member of the elite, he belonged to
a small circle of influential leaders that carried the sobriquet
``the Jacuzzi gang,'' for their weekend meetings at luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the New York Times office here this fall,
Shahak portrayed himself as a political moderate who supports the
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, a view he said reflected a
deep-seated majority sentiment among Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe without question that the peace process must move
on, even though it won't be easy, not with the Palestinians, and
not, eventually, with the Syrians,'' he said. ``But even with the
rest of the Arab world, compromise will come. It has to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he remained deeply disturbed by the assassination three
years ago of Rabin, his mentor, Shahak also expressed distaste for
the crude and turbulent political discourse that has dominated
Israeli politics. ``Obviously we need to make peace inside as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak professed to be constrained by army rules from stating
his views too explicitly. But he is notoriously frugal with words,
and seemed uneasy making political pronouncements anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis have criticized the public for falling in love
with Shahak's body language. ``He appears to have good judgment and
to be serious,'' wrote Yitzhak Deutsch in Hatzofe, the National
Religious Party paper. ``He is experienced. But this man has not
stood before the public. He has not presented his identity card.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing whether Shahak is a hawk or a dove, a social liberal
or conservative, Israelis have pounced on the idea of a political
center (however vague), in large part out of frustration with the
two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Likud is riven by in-fighting, struggling to redefine itself now
that its overriding mission, defending the land of Israel against
territorial compromise, has been abandoned in pragmatic support of
the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, acknowledging that it has too long been considered a
party of the elite, is fighting to recreate itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the center is seen as a refuge for defectors from both left
and right.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the center is crowded. Dan Meridor, a Likud member and
former finance minister under Netanyahu, announced his candidacy
for prime minister earlier this week at the head of an undeclared
centrist party. But he and Shahak are likely to join forces, and
Shahak has said he would yield to Meridor if the polls showed him
to be running stronger against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, it has been a week to be stomped by former allies
and opponents alike.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, joined the list of those
considering challenging him for the leadership of Likud, and
Olmert, who met Thursday with the disaffected defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, is probably the strongest contender inside the
Likud. Mordechai has also met with Shahak to consider joining
forces with him.
</P>
<P>
   So nervous are Shahak's opponents that they have factored him
into their negotiations to set an election date, which is now
expected to be some time between late March and late April. They
calculate that a later date is preferable, figuring that Shahak's
popularity will decline once he advances his political views, in
part because he is not a commanding speaker.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shahak was born in Tel Aviv, where his father owned a movie
theater, and is married to a journalist, Tali, the first woman to
serve in Israel as a military correspondent. They have five
children, ages 5 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   After attending military boarding school in Haifa, he joined the
army at 18, enlisting at the same military center where he was
discharged Thursday. He steadily worked his way up the ranks,
serving as a paratroop commander in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli
wars, and earning two Medals of Valor.
</P>
<P>
   He served as deputy chief of staff to Barak, the Labor leader,
and some former military associates believe the two would still
work best as a team. But Shahak, who succeeded Barak in 1995,
reportedly believes that Labor cannot win an election.
</P>
<P>
   A critical assessment in the newspaper Haaretz says Shahak was
an undistinguished chief of staff who did not initiate any major
changes in the army's military doctrine or organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin brought Shahak into the peace talks as lead negotiator of
the details in the 1995 interim agreement with the Palestinians.
But under Netanyahu, who did not believe the military should be
involved in political negotiations, Shahak was frozen out.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Shahak and Netanyahu were formal at best.
``There was no friendship,'' Shahak said. ``He never invited me to
his house, and he is definitely not in my circle.''
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned Thursday morning, Shahak drove to President
Ezer Weizmann's home in Jerusalem. Weizmann can grant him a
dispensation that allows him to enter politics before the usual
100-day, postmilitary waiting period expires.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Weizmann's house, Shahak crossed the street to hold his
first public political meeting, in a raggedy protesters' tent where
he listened as the mothers of soldiers killed in Lebanon, who are
rarely heeded here, vented their anger. He said little more than
that the policy on Israel's engagement in southern Lebanon had to
change sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not quick to leave. He gave the women their due, and
when he left, the mothers, with their sons' photographs pinned to
their sweaters, held their hand-lettered signs a little higher.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A brutal, four-day freeze has destroyed more than
a third of California's annual citrus crop, inflicting upwards of a
half-billion dollars in damage and raising the prospect of tripled
orange prices in supermarkets by next week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Golden State, cold, dry air from the Gulf of
Alaska sent temperatures below freezing beginning Monday, with
readings in the high teens and low 20s in the agriculturally rich
Central Valley early Thursday _ the worst cold spell since a 10-day
freeze in 1990. Farmers frantically ran wind and irrigation
machines overnight, but officials pronounced the lemon crop a
near-total loss in the valley, and said perhaps half of the state's
orange crop was lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a time of joy, but it's been a bitter
disappointment,'' Bob Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm
Bureau in Sacramento, the state's largest agricultural
organization, said of the Christmas-week freeze. ``We've had more
than our share of challenges from Mother Nature this year, with El
Nino early on bringing excessive moisture and cold weather that
delayed planting and increased pest infestation and disease
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, agricultural officials said, the late planting meant
that more of the state's navel orange crop remained on trees than
usual this week and thus susceptible to freezing. California grows
about 80 percent of the nation's oranges eaten as fruit, and 90
percent of the lemons, and wholesalers said the retail prices of
oranges could triple in the next few days. Lemon prices are likely
to rise as well. (Prices of frozen orange juice will probably not
be greatly affected, because most juice oranges are produced in
Florida.)
</P>
<P>
   In some California markets, wholesalers reported that the price
of navel oranges had gone from 35 cents a pound Tuesday to 90 cents
a pound Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus industry accounts for well over $1 billion of the
state's $27 billion agricultural output. But from the Central Coast
to the inland desert Imperial Valley, the cold also threatened
crops from avocados to strawberries and celery.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze hit especially hard in the towns up and down the San
Joaquin Valley, which took years to recover from the last big
freeze and where some counties already have unemployment rates of
upwards of 15 percent, three times the national average. Officials
were preparing to seek state and federal disaster aid next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, it was way too cold for way too long,'' said
Gary Kunkel, assistant agriculture commissioner in Tulare County,
which has 100,000 acres of orange groves _ about half the state's
production _ and estimated today that 85 percent of the citrus crop
remaining on trees was already lost, about $370 million of its $500
million annual total.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some places below 25 degrees for 13 or 14 hours at a
time,'' Kunkel added, noting that warmer weather predicted for this
weekend was coming too late to do much good. ``Imagine watching
somebody just tear up your annual paycheck right in front of your
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   When oranges suffer a hard freeze, the juice sacs inside
crystallize and burst through the membranes. When the flesh thaws,
the juice seeps out and evaporates through the skin, leaving the
insides dry and inedible.
</P>
<P>
   Because of El Nino-related planting delays and poor pollination
caused by excess moisture the California citrus crop was already
expected to be about 20 percent below last year's, said Keith
Collins, chief economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already on track to have a much reduced crop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze capped a year of weather-related calamities around
the nation that produced mixed results for the nation's agriculture
industry. The moist El Nino conditions led to record yields on
winter wheat in Texas and the Plains states and record summer heat
and drought caused declines in cotton, cattle and other crops and
commodities from California to Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, continued warm weather and drought has resulted in
sharply lower citrus crop forecasts. The Florida Department of
Citrus estimates this year's harvest will produce 190 million boxes
of oranges, down from last year's record harvest of 244 million
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, fires and drought in central Florida caused an
estimated $150 million in damage to crops and destroyed $400
million worth of timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's particularly curious, even stunning, about this year,
is that for all the weather turmoil we still wound up with many
near-record crop yields,'' in corn and soybeans in states like
Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the high yields also produced low prices for many crops, and
together with the weather-related damage in selected areas, led to
passage of the biggest agricultural relief measure in the nation's
history, $5.7 billion, Collins said. ``There are air pockets of
financial stress all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Smith, an orange-grower in Orland, Calif., about 100
miles north of Sacramento, knows that stress first-hand. He expects
to lose his entire 75-acre crop this year, more than 100,000
cartons, which would have brought him $50,000. He and other farmers
who formed a packing plant will have to lay off about 40 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point right now, the chances of anything being
harvestable are just about nil,'' Smith said. ``We'll know better
when we go in next week and start cutting fruit, but at this point,
if there was anything salvageable, I'd be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Smith has lost his entire crop to a
freeze in his 13 years of farming, and the federal crop insurance
he buys will cover only about half his expected loss. His family
will have to rely on income from his wife's job and a part-time job
he works in the summers, but he dismissed any suggestion of leaving
farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to realize that growing oranges is always going to
be a risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lindsay, Calif., the LoBue Bros. packing plant, Tulare
County's largest employer, laid off 450 of its 500 employees
Wednesday, and company officials said it could be two weeks before
they know whether they will need their usual crew of pickers and
packers for navel and Valencia oranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four hundred and fifty people are not going to show up on
Monday, they're not going to get paid, they're not coming to
work,'' said Joe LoBue, the company's marketing director. ``And we
don't know when they will come back. If in fact these people don't
go back to work for a long period of time, it starts to affect the
whole economy of the county here. In 1990, you had a lot of people
that showed up at food banks, a lot of people who ended up on
welfare, a lot of people who couldn't get jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ward, a citrus farmer in Exeter, Calif., about halfway
between Los Angeles and San Francisco in the San Joaquin Valley,
was up at 4 a.m. today, checking water pumps and wind machines
designed to raise the temperature on his 250 acres. Despite the
efforts, Ward, a fifth-generation farmer, said the damage was
severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way of life I know,'' he said. ``I'm 60 years
old and it's too late to start over. I don't know what else I'd do.
I've done it pretty much all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it,'' he added. ``It's going to get tight around
here. We're not going to upgrade any new equipment. We're just
going to get by as best we can, and see what happens next season.''

   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ A sustained assault by Serbian forces on
this area in northern Kosovo province ripped apart a tenuous
two-month cease-fire Thursday, as more than 40 armored vehicles and
tanks fought through the day with separatist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the international monitoring mission intended to help
build confidence and spur talks between the government and the
rebels questioned whether it was becoming pointless _ and too
dangerous _ to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack, which diplomats said was the worst violation
since the cease-fire went into effect, came after 11 days of combat
and assassinations in which, international monitors say, the two
sides have shown that they do not intend to solve their differences
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have gone looking for trouble and they have found
it,'' said William Walker, the U.S. diplomat in charge of the
monitoring mission. ``If the two sides are unwilling to live up to
their agreements, 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 unarmed verifiers cannot
frustrate their attempts to go after each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors were allowed into Yugoslavia under the threat of
NATO air strikes in October. At that time the Belgrade government
also agreed to withdraw many of its forces from Kosovo and to stop
its attacks on the rebels. The ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army agreed to a cease-fire and to enter good-faith
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring mission is part of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. There are about 600 observers in Kosovo
now, and the plan is to have about 2,000 in place by the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   But with Kosovo seemingly racing toward all-out war again, a
British major general, John Drewienkiewicz, who is deputy head of
the monitoring mission, wondered Thursday night if Europe and
America would continue to contribute observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we put the lives of our young men in danger to help
people who have not kept their solemn agreements?'' asked
Drewienkiewicz. ``The states contributing forces will not see them
caught in a meat grinder. They will pull out instead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As if to highlight the danger, foreign officials say an observer
parked in front of a military barracks Thursday was told by the
police that soldiers would shoot him if he stayed more than two
minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the assault Thursday was part of the
investigation into the assassination of a state security official
in Podujevo on Monday, a claim dismissed by diplomats. ``You don't
need 40 armored vehicles, including tanks, for a murder case,'' a
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, fighting continued sporadically in the area
around Podujevo, with small-arms fire and what appeared to be
occasional mortar rounds.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat said fighting would probably pick up
again on Friday because it seemed as if government forces had been
prevented from taking their principal objective, the village of
Gornja Lapastica.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to back off,'' he predicted. ``I think they
will come back and pound the KLA again. If that happens, all of
Kosovo could go up in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   International monitors said the rebels had used anti-tank
weapons to inflict a surprising amount of damage on the
government's armored vehicles. While the rebels had anti-tank
weapons during combat over the summer, they had not used them
effectively and usually fled from government attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel commanders and international observers say that in recent
months rebel forces have received new weapons and more rebels are
trained in using them. In Thursday's fighting, monitors said, rebel
forces often stood their ground and forced government troops to
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats point to the rebels' recruitment drive and their
rearming as indications they are not interested in serious
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, a long column of government troop transports,
armored vehicles and tanks was moving back to its base south of
Podujevo. Some of the armored vehicles showed heavy battle damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make the Albanians feel pretty cocky,'' a
senior Western diplomat said. ``They're going to want to keep on
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian civilians said the attack began about 8:30 on
Thursday morning with what sounded like mortar or artillery fire
directed at the village of Gornja Lapastica.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said they fled when they saw the tanks coming. They,
and perhaps 300,000 other ethnic Albanians, fled government forces
over the summer when the police and soldiers tried to rout the
guerrillas but ended up terrorizing and radicalizing most of the
people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In houses near the village Thursday, villagers sat and stared
with wide, terrified eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the summer when we spent the whole time trying to
escape,'' said Zade Hoxha, 80.
</P>
<P>
   Sabid Kopalla, who was working in his carpet store in Podujevo
when the fighting started, said: ``They put snipers on all the tall
buildings in town. Then they began firing everywhere, but I think
they were shooting to make people afraid and go inside, not to hurt
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A construction worker, Lytfi Salihu, said the only conceivable
response from the rebels was to step up attacks on government
forces. ``They are ones who attack us, and our people must protect
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian police officer was shot to death and three others were
wounded in attacks Tuesday. Last week started out with the murder
of six Serb youths in a coffee shop and a government ambush that
killed 36 rebels trying to smuggle in weapons from Albania.
Saturday a Serbian government official was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The government is faced with a particular problem in this area.
Not only are Serb civilians threatening to form vigilante groups to
protect themselves, but the town is on the main road to the rest of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   During the cease-fire, rebels had taken up positions close to
the center of the town and along the road, thus threatening the
government's ability to control the road, or even resupply its
forces in Kosovo.

MONTANA COURT OVERTURNS SET-YOUR-OWN SPEED LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By JIM ROBBINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. _ Montana's one-of-a-kind daytime speed limit _
written in law as whatever speed is ``reasonable and proper'' but
widely interpreted as wide open _ has been struck down by the
Montana Supreme Court, prompting fears that the lack of even the
vague limit will lead people to drive at breakneck speeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-3 ruling on Wednesday, the court said the law was
unconstitutionally vague and did not give drivers fair notice of
what speed was fast enough to be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court held that based on speed alone you cannot cite
somebody because they don't reasonably know what speed will violate
the law,'' Beth Baker, Montana's chief deputy attorney general,
said Thursday. ``The Highway Patrol will still be citing for
careless or reckless driving but won't be issuing tickets based on
speed alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the speed limit was brought by Rudy Stanko, a
cattle buyer in Billings who had contested three tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked a cop how fast I could go and he never gave me an
answer,'' Stanko said Thursday. ``They said it's up to the
discretion of the cop and that ain't right. Let us decide how fast
we want to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court threw out a speeding ticket Stanko had
received for traveling 102 mph, it upheld two reckless driving
counts _ one for traveling 117 mph, the other for 121 mph. Both
violations were on two-lane highways as he crested a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's legislature will convene in January and plans have
been drawn up by state officials and legislative leaders to impose
a numerical limit: 75 mph on interstate highways, day and night,
and 70 mph on two-lane highways during the day and 65 at night.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's current nighttime speed limits are 65 mph on
interstates and 55 mph on two-lane highways, and those are not
affected by the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the old rule, called the ``basic law,'' brought a
$70 fine. Under the proposed new law, anyone traveling less than 10
miles over the limit would be fined $25 with no mark on the
license. The fine would be higher for higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Barry Stang, who opposed a move to re-instate a
numerical limit in the Legislature two years ago, now favors the
new law. ``Two years on the road with the crazies out there''
changed his mind, he said. He drove 50,000 miles in 1998 alone, and
said it was worrisome to be ``going along at 80 and someone from
out of state, who doesn't understand the road conditions, passes
you at 100.'' He said he expected that the bill would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Montana is the only state without a numerical daytime speed
limit. Before a federal 55 mph limit was imposed to save energy in
the 1970s, Montana's ``basic law'' was any speed deemed
``reasonable and proper.'' When the federal limit was repealed by
Congress in December 1995, Montana's basic law was automatically
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The number of traffic deaths has risen since the speed limit was
repealed in 1995, though not by much. In 1994 there were 202
deaths, in 1995 215, in 1996 196, in 1997 261, and so far in 1998
223.

PATRIOTS-JETS A CLASH OF PHILOSOPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It isn't just the Patriots vs. the Jets, or
Pete Carroll vs. Bill Parcells. Sunday's regular-season finale is a
battle of philosophies, new vs. old.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has rebuilt the Jets by bringing in his usual
assortment of veterans _ Keith Byars, Dave Meggett, Pepper Johnson,
etc. _ whom he utilizes not only for their performance on the
field, but to help motivate other players.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, meanwhile, have gone with younger players in an
attempt to stay a top team now, and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's as different a philosophy as those Parcells and Carroll
have in regard to how they run practices. Parcells runs rough and
tough practices, with hitting every day, while Carroll has his
players work one day a week (sometimes two) in pads and uses the
rest of the time for repetitions of the plays the team will be
using in a particular  &UR; week &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Which way was the best in 1998? Both teams made the playoffs.
But one development of note: When the Patriots suffered major
injuries to many of their key starters, the younger players had to
step in, ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a faster, younger, more athletic team,'' Carroll
said Thursday. That may be the end result, but it appeared to hurt
them at times during the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, last Sunday against the 49ers, some of the young
players played crucial roles in the win. Second-round pick Tony
Simmons started at one wide receiver spot and caught five passes
(though he dropped two others). Fullback Chris Floyd, a third-round
pick from Michigan, blocked well and showed signs he may be a
decent runner, too. Defensive end Greg Spires had a sack and four
tackles, making two huge plays at crunch time. Rookie Robert
Edwards ran decisively and went over the 1,000-yard mark for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sticking with these guys,'' said Carroll. ``We knew as
young players it was going to take time to experience playing in
this league and what it takes to be successful at this level. But
as time has passed, we've seen improvement from each of them. They
all show talents that are helping us now and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are still confident in the decision they made on
Curtis Martin. The statistics for Edwards and Martin are
comparable, although the Jets running back now is claiming he had a
leg injury the first 10 weeks of the season. Martin has gained
1,185 yards and has a 3.5 yards per carry average. He has scored
eight rushing touchdowns. Edwards has gained 1,068 yards, has a 3.8
yard average, and has nine rushing scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received good production from Robert, but the big factor
is the upside is so big because of the way it's worked out,'' said
Carroll. ``It's still a work in progress, but we can see that
Robert is going to be a top back in this league for years to come.
We know there'll be improvement with things like consistency. But
we're not unhappy with any aspect of what he's done for us in his
rookie season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Jets don't have their share of younger
players. Rookie Jason Fabini starts at right tackle. Second-year
linebacker James Farrior is a big part of the their substitution
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells did bring in good young players during his four-year
stint with the Patriots and recently even beamed about the fact
that seven of the players he had a hand in bringing to New England
have gone on to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been criticized in some circles for keeping
all but one of their draft picks the last two years. In fact, the
Patriots have kept the most draft picks on their 53-man roster of
any team in the league _ 10. One of them, Ron Merkerson, a
linebacker from Colorado, was placed on injured reserve during
training camp. Last year, receiver Tony Gaiter was cut, put on the
practice squad, cut in training camp, brought back for two weeks,
and then cut again. Otherwise the picks are intact.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing the Patriots are trying to prove is that they
can pick players without Parcells around, and that the players they
selected after they were awarded draft picks when the Jets signed
Parcells can help make up for the loss of a great coach.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will get their final Parcells pick after this
season. If the Jets go deep into the playoffs, that would give the
Patriots a pick somewhere at the end of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Patriots have received seldom-used running back
Sedrick Shaw, sometime starting left guard Damon Denson, and
Simmons. For the loss of Martin, the Patriots were awarded a
first-rounder (they took Edwards with the 18th pick) and a
third-rounder (Floyd).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, another of the Patriots' young players, Tebucky Jones,
their second first-round pick, will get to go one on one against
Pro Bowler Keyshawn Johnson when New England switches to its
substitution packages in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   This was the matchup Carroll and vice president of player
personnel Bobby Grier envisioned when they drafted Jones,
considered a surprise and risky pick at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is they'll go up against each other a lot over the
years,'' said Carroll. ``Tebucky is a big-time athlete and even
though the perception is he didn't contribute that much (this
season), he came along tremendously. Really, just as we had hoped
he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, philosophies will clash Sunday. And, more than ever, the
young players on the Patriots need to continue to grow up.

CARDINAL LAW DECRIES SHREDDING OF WELFARE SAFETY NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his annual Christmas message, Cardinal Bernard Law
condemns what he sees as the shredding of the welfare safety net
for thousands of destitute children at a time of unprecedented
prosperity in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the message published in The Pilot, the newspaper of the
Archdiocese of Boston, Law notes that up to 12,000 children and
their families will be dropped from the welfare rolls this month as
the state's new two-year limit on cash assistance begins taking
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Another 4,000 poor children born over the past 30 months have
never received public assistance because they were conceived while
their mothers were on welfare, Law says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What child is this that we treat with such indifference and
contempt?'' Law asks. ``When we no longer welcome new life _
including the child born of a poor mother _ as a sign of hope and
wonder, does not our celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ
become emptied of its truest and deepest meaning?''
</P>
<P>
   However, state policy makers argue that the old welfare system
had ensnared children in a cycle of inter-generational poverty, and
the best way to break that cycle is to push able-bodied parents to
become positive role models by working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the cardinal and the state have the best interest of the
children at heart,'' Dick Powers, spokesman for the Department of
Transitional Assistance, said Thursday. ``We just disagree on how
to help them most.''
</P>
<P>
   In his message, however, Law says that thousands of families
left the welfare rolls over the past two years, although half of
the caregivers in those families apparently did not have jobs and
most of those who did were not earning enough to climb out of
poverty, Law says. At the same time the welfare caseload was
falling, the child poverty rate increased 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new welfare laws have been harshest to children,'' Law
says.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal urges the ``people of this archdiocese and
Commonwealth'' to exhibit the same compassion and generosity for
poor children in Massachusetts and in other parts of the world that
they showed for victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Law says these needy children also include the 230,000 Iraqi
children under age 5 who have died of malnutrition and dysentery
over the past eight years and the countless others whose lives
remain at risk because of the ``deadly weapon of embargo'' placed
on their country.

<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ The bulldozers have reopened the
highway below her house in the village of Balin, clearing away tons
of earth that slid down the mountain during a hurricane in
November, plowing under houses, gardens, animals and 17 human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   The growling machines have smoothed over the ugly gash in the
earth and molded a new dirt road. Trucks rumble through Leila
Marina Morales' life again, linking the country's interior to the
sea, as they always did before.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a hole in the universe where her family once
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it seems as if everything is a dream, as if my family
has gone on a trip and will return,'' Ms. Marina Morales, 27, a
housewife, said peering up at the sheered mountain that swallowed
her mother and three sisters on Nov. 2. ``But at the same time I
must accept that they died.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the vast storm called Mitch mauled this hilly
and poor country in late October, Hondurans like Ms. Marina Morales
are still trying to come to terms with the disaster and their
losses, both personal and financial.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch was the region's worst natural disaster this
century. It left several thousand dead and hundreds of thousands
homeless, while crippling the economies of Honduras and Nicaragua.
By some estimates, the storm caused at least $5.4 billion in damage
to infrastructure and crops, international lending institutions
say.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nicaragua and Honduras were devastated by the storm, though
Honduras bore the brunt, with nearly every part of the country
affected, whereas damage in Nicaragua was concentrated in pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a flood of immigrants or a new round of instability in
Central America, the United States has pumped about $170 million
dollars in disaster relief into Honduras in the last seven weeks
and has canceled about $40 million of Honduras' enormous debt.
Nicaragua has received similar levels of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of food and medicine have been shipped in and ferried to
remote villages, mostly by U.S. military helicopters and cargo
planes. More than 800 U.S. military engineers have helped open
roads and build fords across rivers where dozens of bridges were
washed away.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has even announced he will delay deporting
illegal Honduran immigrants from the United States. Yet Honduras _
one of this hemisphere's poorest countries before the storm _ still
barely functions and will need months more of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Though some roads are passable, the country's tattered
infrastructure can now be washed away by one hard rainfall, U.S.
military officers here say, and it will take billions of dollars to
repair the bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people are still trying to dig out from under mud
that buried riverside towns of hard-hit regions. Thousands of
others are camping in makeshift tents or living in temporary
shelters, relying on handouts from the United Nations and the
Catholic Church. Many towns still have no potable water and their
sewerage systems have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to do more,'' the U.S. housing secretary, Andrew
Cuomo, said on a visit here this month to announce an aid package.
``You had a country that was just struggling to get to their feet
and this was a serious setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse than the destruction of houses has been the loss of
jobs. Uncounted thousands of farmers, factory workers and
plantation hands have either been laid off or have lost their
crops, poultry and livestock. Most say they have no way to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic outlook dismal at best, many younger Hondurans
here who can obtain visas are already migrating to the United
States in search of work. Other young people have decided to take
the illegal route through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have at least five friends who have gone to Mexico and are
waiting there trying to get over the border into the United
States,'' said Kevin Sarrios, 21, a cabdriver in San Pedro Sula.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sarrios has decided to stay in Honduras despite the lack
of jobs and tourists, his wife left just after the storm's wrath
for a six-month stint as a domestic servant in Colorado, leaving
him with their year-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hondurans have fewer options. On the main highway outside
the once-thriving town of La Lima, a banana-growing center in the
Sula Valley in the north, hundreds of banana plantation workers and
farmers are living in a squalid row of tents and shacks.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent rainy afternoon, children with no shirts clutched
themselves against the chill air. Many were suffering from
respiratory illnesses and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering in a light rain, Catarino Cortez Gomez, 35, reached
into a pocket with his calloused hands and carefully pulled a
notice from his former employer, Turnbull Agroindustria Asociada, a
banana grower, to show to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the words with his index finger, Cortez explained that
he has been laid off for at least four months because the storm
destroyed the banana plantations. His two young sons huddled next
to his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to live by the grace of God,'' he said, ``because we
don't have anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the refugees in this sad row on the highway, Cortez
saw his small house sink into the mud when the floods came during
the hurricane. The zinc roof was washed away. All his belongings
were destroyed. He waded to higher ground with his sons on his
back. He says he has no savings and no way to make money if the
banana companies do not hire again. His family is living in a tent,
eating beans and flour distributed by a Catholic charity. ``We lost
everything in that house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the town of La Lima, city workers with backhoes and
bulldozers were working away at the tons of mud left behind in the
streets by the floods. Nearly everyone in this town of 75,000 wore
heavy rubber boots to wade through the thick ugly muck still
covering all the streets. Here and there, homeowners struggled with
shovels to clear mud out of their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months after the hurricane and we are still trying to get
the mud out,'' said Carlos Ramos, a 64-year-old contractor, leaning
on a shovel in foul-smelling muck. ``What's bothering us the most
is all the sewage that's flowing into the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   German Henriquez, the municipal official in charge of public
works, took a break from the cleanup efforts to tick off the town's
woes. The floods washed away more than 175 houses, damaged 400
others and killed at least 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   The waters destroyed four major bridges, damaged most of the
roads and wrecked 80 percent of the sewers. Raw sewage now runs out
into mud-filled streets in many neighborhoods. Though La Lima has
received about $367,000 from the central government to clean up,
officials here estimate it will take about $44 million to repair
the town's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, La Lima's major employers _ a subsidiary of
the Chiquita Brands International and several smaller plantation
owners _ have announced severe layoffs, and it will be at least a
year before they rehire. About 700 families, many of them connected
to the banana industry, are living in tents. ``We are destroyed
financially,'' Henriquez said.
</P>
<P>
   La Lima is not alone. Several other similar-sized Honduran towns
_ like Pespire and Choluteca _ are in the same condition. Other
small cities on the northern coast were cut off. To reach La Ceiba,
for instance, trucks and buses must still ford a wide fast-moving
river and pedestrians are forced to cross on a narrow cable bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of smaller communities are also struggling to recover
from vast flood damage with even fewer resources. One of the
worst-hit villages was La Guacamaya, a hamlet about 20 miles west
of San Pedro Sula, in the shadow of the mountains that mark the
Sula Valley's eastern boundary.
</P>
<P>
   During the storm, a landslide in the mountains blocked the small
river that runs through La Guacamaya and created a lake. On
Thursday, Oct. 29, the waters broke through the temporary dam and
crashed down the mountain, flooding the town. About 82 of the
town's 400 houses were buried to their rooftops in mud and the main
bridge linking the village to the nearest large town, El Progreso,
was washed away. Local officials managed to evacuate the town
before the water rose too high, and no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a team of U.S. Navy engineers from Gulfport, Miss.,
cleared away much of the mud along the village's main street and
built fords around the destroyed bridge. But the people in La
Guacamaya say it will be a long time before their village recovers.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, most of the men in the town work in a nearby
sugar plantation. The owners, having lost much of their crop, have
halved the workers' salaries, from $30 per week to less than $15.
Dozens of families are camped next to the wreckage of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Griselda Flores and her husband, Jose Pinto, managed to escape
the floods just before their three-room house was buried in mud and
water. Pinto woke the family and carried his two youngest children
on his back to higher ground. For the last month, the Pinto family
has been living in an improvised shack next to what remains of
their home, which now resembles the ruins of an archeological site.
Their seven acres of land were stripped of corn and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto has been laid off by the sugar plantation. The family is
surviving on handouts from the World Food Program and a few clothes
donated by other charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been living without shoes, clothes, nothing,'' Ms.
Flores said. ``Without work it's not possible to recoup what we
have lost, but someday perhaps, we can, little by little.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Pinto family is lucky. Houses can be rebuilt.
For the family members of at least 3,000 people known to have died
here and more than 2,000 reported missing, there is no hope of
recovering the past.
</P>
<P>
   In Balin, the village about 50 miles south of San Pedro Sula
where 17 people were buried in a mudslide on Nov. 2, many family
members of the victims and their neighbors are talking about
moving. Some say they are nervous the landslides may happen again.
Others simply cannot bear the memory of the terrible night when
they woke to a sound like the world ending and the screams of
survivors half-buried in mud and rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would leave here if I could, but we have no place to go,''
Ms. Marina Morales said as her 2-year-old daughter climbed into her
lap. ``We are all sad. We are trying to recuperate, but it's
something very hard. Four members of my family are gone.''

   Can Too Many Options Slow Down a Company? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to employee stock options, it seems, there can be
too much of a good thing. A new study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a
management consulting firm in Bethesda, Md., found that those
companies that grant the largest number of stock options
substantially underperformed their stingier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The study tracked the 1997 performance of 940 companies in
various industries. Watson Wyatt divided the companies into three
groups, based on potential dilution to their shares if the options
already granted, as well as those available for future grants, were
exercised.
</P>
<P>
   That dilution, expressed as a percentage of shares outstanding
and commonly referred to as ``overhang,'' was a hefty 18.7 percent
for the top third of the companies surveyed. This group returned a
median of just 13.5 percent to shareholders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the middle third of the companies surveyed, whose
shares would be diluted by just 10.6 percent if all the options
were exercised, returned a median of 16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And, it seems, the chief financial officer can be too
parsimonious with options as well. The bottom third of companies
surveyed, with potential share dilution of just 5.7 percent,
returned 16.2 percent, more than the spendthrifts, to be sure, but
still less than the middle group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very high overhang lowers returns; very low overhang hurts
returns,'' said Ira T. Kay, global practice director of executive
compensation consulting at Watson Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   The options glut has raised the hackles of institutional
investors, especially those with holdings in the high-technology
industry, which tends to grant relatively more options to
employees.

<P>
   Slower Days for Value Stocks
</P>
<P>
   If it seems as if your value stocks are spinning their wheels,
it probably isn't a reflection of your stock-picking prowess. Last
month, the difference in 12-month performance between the S&AMP;P/Barra
Value and S&AMP;P/Barra Growth indexes was the largest in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The growth index was up 33.74 percent in the 12 months through
Nov. 30, while the value index was up just 13.25 percent, according
to Putnam Investments. (The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
returned 23.66 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with economic sensitivity in a slowing
economy,'' said Thomas V. Reilly, chief investment officer for
global value at Putnam, who cited lowered inventories that have
affected the energy, chemical and paper industries. ``These are
traditional value areas.''

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New Kind of Sector Fund
</P>
<P>
   Investors seeking exposure to a particular industry now have a
new vehicle on which to place their bets. Last Tuesday, the
American Stock Exchange started nine Select Sector SPDR funds,
open-end index mutual funds created by dividing the S&AMP;P 500-stock
index into its component industries.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are a spinoff of the Amex's popular Spiders, Standard
&AMP; Poor's depository receipts, trusts started in 1993 that let
investors track the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Like Spiders, the Sector SPDR fund shares trade on the Amex and
have low annual fees, just 0.65 percent. Because they are traded
like ordinary shares of stock, however, investors must pay
commissions to buy and sell them, which they can do throughout the
trading day.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 39 sector funds of Fidelity Investments levy
annual fees ranging from 1.05 percent to 2.5 percent. Investors pay
a 3 percent front-end sales load. If they sell shares held fewer
than 30 days, they pay an extra 0.75 percent fee. Otherwise, they
pay a flat fee of $7.50. The Fidelity funds are priced hourly.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Sector SPDR funds cover industries from consumer
services to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the better deal? That depends, said Russel J. Kinnel,
head of equity funds research at Morningstar Inc. ``The advantage
of SPDR's is that you can trade them more frequently, they hold
almost no cash and they are more precise than actively managed
funds, which all define their sectors differently,'' he said. But,
he added, long-term investors may benefit from active management.

SCALABRINE TURNING HEADS AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brian Scalabrine is always surprised when he
watches himself play basketball, and it has nothing to do with how
many points he scored or rebounds he grabbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the videotape, I'm like `Man, I'm like nobody else
out there,''' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   All Scalabrine sees is the colorful glow of red hair sticking
out among the players. It's impossible to ignore in person, and it
``looks even brighter on tape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine is easily turning heads besides his own at USC, and
it has little to do with his locks. The 6-foot-9 junior-college
transfer is arguably the Trojans' best player and possibly its most
impressive big man since Cliff Robinson played in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   With his muscular 240-pound body and Opie Taylor persona, even
Scalabrine's teammates needed a couple of minutes before the season
started to realize the considerable talent they were getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image a lot of people have is that white guys are not that
athletic,'' USC guard Jeff Trepagnier said. ``But when Brian was
here during his recruiting visit last year, he shocked everyone
when he played with us. He was dunking and running the floor and
just killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Scalabrine is only stunning USC's opponents. He's averaging
a team-high 15.9 points and 7.6 rebounds per game, shooting 55.4
percent from the field and has led USC to a 7-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever thinks I can play. I don't ever turn heads,''
Scalabrine said, obviously referring to his basketball ability and
not his hair.
</P>
<P>
   If Scalabrine is a bit of a hidden gem, it's because he didn't
play organized basketball until his freshman year of high school,
and because he grew up in Enumclaw, Wash., a small farming town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no talent, no skills,'' Scalabrine said. ``They only
liked me my freshman year because I wore a size 17 shoe. They
thought I would be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine did have one factor in his favor: An intense desire
to work and improve his game. It was driven in part by his aversion
to being just another player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a fear in life of being an average person,'' Scalabrine
said. ``I didn't ever want to grow up to be an average guy. It's
kind of a competitiveness I have.''
</P>
<P>
   That work ethic led him to former UCLA center Swen Nater, who
lives in Enumclaw. Nater saw an unpolished kid with a great work
ethic, and decided to start tutoring Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was raw in the sense that he had a lot of ability but not
the fundamentals,'' Nater said. ``I worked with him on fundamentals
a lot. He has a tremendous mind for grasping information and
putting it into practice. I would just gave him a pointer and he
really soaked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nater improved Scalabrine's ballhandling by having him dribble
two balls at the same time, one high and one low. It's not unusual
at USC games to see Scalabrine lead a fast break, dribbling the
ball like a guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually could play shooting guard,'' Nater said.
</P>
<P>
   Does Scalabrine remind Nater of his famous red-headed UCLA
teammate, Bill Walton?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot different, those two,'' Nater said. ``Brian's a
small-town kid, but he has a good, common-sense approach. He's got
a good balance and perspective on how he wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be safe to say Scalabrine is the best redhead in Los
Angeles since Walton.
</P>
<P>
   But he's too modest to admit being concerned about accolades or
the attention he has received in barely a month of Division I
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spotlight is nice, but it's still a team sport,''
Scalabrine said. ``I didn't look at coming to USC like I would
prepare myself to be the Man. I looked at it like I had to prepare
myself to be on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, some people think Scalabrine could have gone to a bigger
basketball power. But coming out of high school, there were few
scholarship offers and he didn't have the grades anyway. So he
attended Highline Community College in Des Moines, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine started to receive attention after playing on a
Basketball Congress International All-Star team in Seattle, which
he only made after a few coaches pulled some strings.
</P>
<P>
   The experience turned out to be an epiphany for Scalabrine, even
if he scored just one point in his first five games with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My breakthrough was to make the team. If I hadn't gotten on
that, I wouldn't have met a lot of people who helped me,''
Scalabrine said. ``That was such a turning point in my life. I
might be a Division II player or I might not even be that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who witnessed the transformation was then-Highline
coach Joe Callero, who is also from Enumclaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just one of many faces,'' Callero said. ``But in six
months, that was the most improvement I'd ever seen a kid make.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year at Highline, Callero took Scalabrine and guard
Quincy Wilder to a JC camp in Cal State Dominguez Hills. Scalabrine
was so dominating that more than 40 schools had called him by the
time he got back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for USC, it had already been recruiting Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of got me before all the hype,'' Scalabrine said.
``I could have gone to a bigger school, but I felt I fit in here. I
could never say if I didn't go here I wish I could have gone to
another school.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those schools Scalabrine spurned was Nater's alma mater,
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted me just because they didn't want me to
come here,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Callero has been hired as assistant at USC, and Scalabrine
and Wilder are both on the team, there has been plenty of
speculation that the trio arrived as a package deal, which Callero
denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't get what they want, they come up with their
own implications,'' Callero said. ``Any implications, they only
come when you're successful. We finished over a two-year period (at
Highline) with a 63-2 record. They say the wind blows hardest when
you're at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine would never consider himself to be a special-enough
player to worry about such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a big deal when I came down here,'' he said. ``I
think everybody thought USC got a pretty good role player to come
off the bench, and take a couple charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. He's already got NBA scouts charting his progress.
And he's got his own unique nickname: Big Redd. That's with (begin
ital)two(end ital) Ds, not one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a stick of gum,'' Scalabrine said. ``I got a little
bit of character.''

MILLIONS OF PRUDENTIAL CUSTOMERS STILL WAITING FOR SETTLEMENT
FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ill., Mass., N.Y.)  (dw) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1991, a Prudential life insurance agent suggested that Irvin
R. McMath and his wife, Anna, replace their $75,000 policy on
McMath with two $100,000 policies, one on each of them.
</P>
<P>
   They had not felt they needed more insurance, McMath said the
other day, but they bought it anyway, on the understanding that
when they reached 65, each would have $100,000 to $125,000 to draw
on to supplement Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent's sales pitch centered on income retirement
benefits,'' McMath said. ``But I've since learned that we do not
have policies that provide these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The McMaths, who live in Skokie, Ill., are among millions of
policyholders that Prudential Insurance Co. of America agreed to
compensate to end a class-action suit contending that for more than
a decade, company agents made false promises. Often, the suit said,
they told customers that they could trade in old policies for more
coverage at no extra cost, that premiums would vanish after a few
years, and that the policies they were buying were retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, though, can be slow, and some critics say the process
is needlessly complex. Two years after the insurer said it would
pay unhappy customers at least $410 million, and perhaps as much as
$2 billion, the compensation program is running months behind
schedule, and across the country, people are complaining. In
Massachusetts, the attorney general's office says it gets six to
eight calls a day from Prudential policyholders. In Florida, the
Insurance Department says it receives 75 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the calls,'' said Joanna Connolly, an assistant state
attorney in Massachusetts, ``are: `Where is my claim?' `What's the
delay?'''
</P>
<P>
   The McMaths, also waiting for answers, say they have been making
phone calls to the company and sending letters and documents back
and forth for 17 months. ``You talk to different people on their
help line and you get different answers,'' McMath said.
</P>
<P>
   A Prudential spokesman, Robert DeFillippo, said that the insurer
understood the frustration but that ``to do the kind of evaluation
that insures a fair and equitable settlement takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the settlement was approved by a U.S. district court
judge and by regulators in every state, and reaffirmed by a federal
appeals court, critics, including some regulators, have argued that
the deal is better for plaintiffs' lawyers and Prudential than for
customers. The lawyers are seeking fees totaling $90 million, and
Prudential sidestepped potential punitive-damage awards in
individual suits.
</P>
<P>
   The most that customers can get, provided they demonstrate that
they were misled, is a refund of their premiums paid, plus interest
and minus annual charges while the policy was in effect.
Alternatively, they can receive a paid-up policy or a conversion of
their policy into an annuity. Customers who file a claim, but do
not submit supporting material, can buy something else from the
company _ life insurance, an annuity or a mutual fund _ at a
discount or get a low-interest loan to pay Prudential premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement is totally inadequate,'' said Michael P.
Malakoff, a Pittsburgh lawyer who has been trying both to overturn
the settlement and to reduce lawyers' fees. ``It doesn't give
anyone very much. Those who have not affirmatively sought
restitution lose the ability to make claims later. And it could be
years before many policyholders realize they have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, two Prudential customers who sued
separately won jury awards of $25 million each, but settled for
presumably lesser amounts rather than wait for the company's
appeals to play out.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1997, Prudential notified the owners of 10.7 million
policies that they might be eligible for claims. About 1.6 million
filed claims, including about 500,000 who indicated they would
settle for discounted insurance, say, or a low-interest loan. The
holders of the approximately 1.1 million other policies were
required to complete 16-page questionnaires. At that point, about
500,000 dropped out, leaving roughly 650,000 policies for
Prudential to consider for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the owners of most of the policies, 9.6 million of
them, decided not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   This shows, said DeFillippo, the Prudential spokesman, that as
the company has maintained, ``the vast majority of these people
were not misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy Crawford, a deputy insurance commissioner in Florida, sees
it differently. ``Did you ever get anything in the mail and it was
too much to read, and you just tossed it?'' she asked. ``That's
what people did in this case. In Florida, we had 300,000 people
eligible. Only 80,000 filed the first forms and only 50,000 are
still in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Camil, a financial investigator for the Florida attorney
general's office, said in a deposition in August involving other
Prudential litigation that a former senior Prudential executive
told him the company had conducted focus groups to see if people
understood the compensation procedures. ``After determining that
people could not understand them,'' he said, ``they went forward
and mailed them.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo acknowledged the focus groups but said it was
``simply not true that we deliberately sent out material that was
unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Connolly, who has been overseeing the settlement in
Massachusetts, said the delays had resulted in part from problems
with Prudential's computer system. In addition, Prudential
executives, disregarding a court order, destroyed thousands of
documents related to disputed transactions. More documents were
destroyed in a fire. Trying to figure out which customers making
claims had documents missing also slowed things down, DeFillippo
said. Under the terms of the settlement, customers' claims are to
be upgraded if there is evidence that their records were destroyed,
and they may be offered a policy refund, annuity or other
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   By its own timetable, Ms. Connolly said, Prudential was supposed
to have evaluated the claims on all 650,000 policies and notified
customers of its conclusions by May. But by the end of last month,
New York regulators said, 85 percent of the claims had been
evaluated and a little more than a quarter of the findings had been
reported to policy owners.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Keren, the New York regulator following the settlement,
said Prudential had pledged to get the remaining evaluations done
by the end of the year and to notify most policy owners by the end
of March 1999. Policyholders have 45 days to accept or appeal
Prudential's findings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meantime, customers remain frustrated. On a spreadsheet
projecting how McMath's $100,000 policy was to perform, his agent
wrote, ``Retirement Fund to Assist with Social Security Income.''
The agent had drawn an arrow to highlight the amount of cash
available to McMath at age 65. It read $39,528, not $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   McMath, who is 52 and provides technical support to Internet
users, said he and his wife only remember the agent talking about
the larger amount. They trusted her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this matter hadn't been brought out,'' McMath said,
referring to the suit, ``I probably would never have looked at the
papers until the time for retirement arrived.''

OBSERVER: A FEW WORDS AT THE END 
</HEADLINE>
  (Commentary) 
(sw) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it is Christmas, a day on which nobody reads a newspaper
anyhow, and since this is the last of these columns titled
``Observer'' which have been appearing in The Times since 1962, I
shall take the otherwise inexcusable liberty of talking about me
and newspapers. I love them.
</P>
<P>
   I have loved them since childhood when my Uncle Allen regularly
brought home Hearst's New York Journal-American with its wonderful
comics, Burris Jenkins cartoons and tales of rich playboys,
murderous playgirls and their love nests. At that age I hadn't a
guess about what a love nest might be, and didn't care, and since
something about ``love nest'' sounded curiously illegal, I never
asked an adult for edification.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays Uncle Allen always brought The New York Times and
read himself to sleep with it. Such a dismal mass of gray paper was
of absolutely no interest to me. It was Katzenjammer Kids and
Maggie and Jiggs of the King Features syndicate with whom I wanted
to spend Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At my friend Harry's house I discovered the New York tabloids.
Lots of great pictures. Dick Tracy! Plenty of stories about
condemned killers being executed, with emphasis on what they had
eaten for their last meal, before walking _ the last mile! The
tabloids left me enthralled by the lastness of things.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, I was admitted to practice the trade, and I marveled
at the places newspapers could take me. They took me to suburbs on
sunny Saturday afternoons to witness the mortal results of family
quarrels in households that kept pistols. They took me to hospital
emergency rooms to listen to people die and to ogle nurses.
</P>
<P>
   They took me to the places inhabited by the frequently
unemployed and there taught me the smell of poverty. In winter
there was also the smell of deadly kerosene stoves used for
heating, though their tendency to set bedrooms on fire sent the
morgue a predictable stream of customers every season.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of those smells has been a valuable piece of
equipment during my career as a columnist. Columnists' tendency to
spend their time with life's winners and to lead lives of isolation
from the less dazzling American realities makes it too easy for us
sometimes to solve the nation's problems in 700 words.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have taken me into the company of the great as well
as the greatly celebrated. On these expeditions I have sat in the
Elysee Palace and gazed on the grandeur that was Charles de Gaulle
speaking as from Olympus. I have watched Nikita Khrushchev, fresh
from terrifying Jack Kennedy inside a Vienna Embassy, emerge to
clown with the press.
</P>
<P>
   I have been apologized to by Richard Nixon. I have seen Adlai
Stevenson, would-be president of the United States, shake hands
with a department-store dummy in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   I have been summoned on a Saturday morning to the Capitol of the
United States to meet with Lyndon Johnson, clad in pajamas and
urgently needing my advice on how to break a civil-rights
filibuster. I have often been played for a fool like this by other
interesting men and, on occasion, equally interesting women.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John XXIII included me in an audience he granted the press
group en route to Turkey, Iran and points east with President
Eisenhower. The pope's feet barely reached the floor and seemed to
dance as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers took me to Westminster Abbey in a rental white tie
and topper to see Queen Elizabeth crowned and to Versailles in
another rental white-tie-and-tails rig to share a theater evening
with the de Gaulles and the John F. Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to newspapers, I have made a four-hour visit to
Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, breakfasted at
dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the marble pool of a
Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up a persistent family of
fleas in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran I have ridden in a press bus over several miles of
Oriental carpets with which the shah had ordered the street covered
between airport and town to honor the visiting Eisenhower, a man
who, during a White House news conference which I attended in
shirtsleeves, once identified me as ``that man that's got the shirt
on.''
</P>
<P>
   I could go on and on, and probably will somewhere sometime, but
the time for this enterprise is up. Thanks for listening for the
past three million words.

COMMENTARY: KEEPING THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week ago, my wife and I took a hard fall on a slippery
pavement in New York. Shook us up, but no harm done _ maybe some
good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we recalled promises I made after I began writing
about persecuted religious minorities abroad. I had promised myself
I would keep writing about all persecuted minorities but never
gloss over what Western governments like to forget _ that now most
people arrested, tortured or slaughtered for their religion are
Christians. I did continue. But I also had promised that no column
on persecution would be my last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How foolish, I said. How could I know, when I wrote a column
telling off Saddam Hussein or somebody, whether the next day a
harder crack on a pavement or a car flying around a corner, or a
grossly undeserved heart attack or other injustice would make that
column my last.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this Christmas Day I am making sure my promise outsmarts any
other endgame at least once more:
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of American Christians pray in their churches each
week, oblivious to the fact that Christians in many parts of the
world suffer brutal torture, arrest, imprisonment and even death .
. . for no other reason than that they are Christians. . . . They
have been persecuted and martyred before an unknowing, indifferent
world and a largely silent Christian community.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven countries where Christians are currently enduring
religious persecution are China, the Sudan, Pakistan, North Korea,
Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Egypt, Nigeria, Cuba, Laos and Uzbekistan.
They evidence a worldwide trend of anti-Christian persecution based
on two political ideologies _ Communism and militant Islam.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I quoted that in my first column on religious persecution, in
1997 _ from ``In the Lion's Den,'' by Nina Shea, a human rights
army in herself, now director of the Center for Religious Freedom
of Freedom House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unknowing, indifferent _ only a few months ago at a dinner, one
of America's richest and pleasantest men and the headmaster of a
noted private school, a minister, both said they knew nothing about
the persecution of their fellow Christians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Governments know. They are silent for 30 billion pieces of trade
silver.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Bill Clinton, breaking his pre-election promises, sold
to China the American commitment to human rights for Chinese and
Tibetans. What he got in return was the permission to continue
business with China, a kindness that costs America $50 billion
annually in export-import loss, strengthens China with American
missile technique and escorts Beijing into U.S. politics. And it
frees China from administration action or denunciation for the
arrests of more Christians who refuse to worship in
government-regulated churches, and more long prison sentences to
Chinese who believed the Communists might allow another political
party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the price America paid, read ``Year of the Rat'' by Edward
Timperlake and William C. Triplett II (Regnery) and learn as much
as your stomach can bear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tibet got something in return for the Clintonian assurances of
Chinese reasonableness. It got a Chinese stonewall to the Dalai
Lama's eagerness for talks, and more repression.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But millions of American Christians backed by many Jews and
Buddhists rebelled against the persecution. In China, in the Sudan,
where Christians are slaughtered by government armies _
everywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working in churches, organizations and Congress, in November
they defeated administration opposition to legislation that creates
a commission to monitor persecution worldwide, and to suggest
penalties to the president. The weakness is that he can waive the
penalties. The strength is that a year-round spotlight can be kept
on persecution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Republicans named four strong-minded fighters for
religious freedom: former Sen. Bill Armstrong, former Assistant
Secretaries of State John Bolton and Elliott Abrams, and Nina Shea.
Democrats and the White House have yet to be heard from about their
combined five appointments.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans who won the bill should make sure the spotlight does
not go out through weak administration appointments, unprotested
waivers, press inattention. Stay organized, on the phone to
Congress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so that there will be another day to fight for religious and
political rights, don't fall on slippery streets.

   For Niche Food Makers, Some Unlikely Hits
</P>
<P>
   You never know what is going to take off in the world of
specialty foods, or how.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Trappist monks have turned a tidy dollar for their
abbey in Gethsemane, Ky., by selling fruitcake, cheese and bourbon
fudge they make. Their kitchen methods are steeped in tradition,
but they have tried to keep their sales practices up to date: They
added order-by-fax to their mail-order operation a few years ago,
and this year they ventured onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In came the flood. By early December, their site on the World
Wide Web, www.monks.org, had attracted 1,600 orders, far more than
the 75 brothers of the Abbey of Gethsemani could keep up with
working four and a half hours a day each _ practically every minute
they are not sleeping, reading or praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't hire outside people and they have a limited
capacity,'' said Ray Schuhmann, president of the Kinetic Corp.,
which operates the Web site for the monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of food,'' said Brother Anselm, head of the abbey.
</P>
<P>
   The monks have unplugged the fax machine and stopped taking
orders on line.
</P>
<P>
   Priorities Straight
</P>
<P>
   Angry at the United States for its missile attacks on Iraq
earlier this month, the national unions of pharmacists and doctors
in Jordan called for a boycott of American drug companies last
Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. The next day, Jordanian
authorities approved Pfizer's anti-impotence drug, Viagra, for sale
in the country. Organizers said Viagra would be exempt from the
boycott because no substitute is available. ... Twice this year,
the Zapata Corp., a former Bush family oil company that now makes
fish oil and sausage casings, has tried to turn itself into an
Internet stock through acquisitions. Twice the stock has surged,
only to tumble when plans unraveled. What did the company announce
last week? That it would try again (no details given). What did the
stock do? It soared. &QL;

   On Executive Wish Lists: Icy Nights and Natty Dogs
</P>
<P>
   If there is a theme to their New Year's resolutions, it is to
get out of the office and breathe some fresh air. Movers and
shakers of the American business scene were asked what personal
goals they have set for 1999, and vigorous outdoor exercise headed
the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go hiking in Patagonia,'' declared Edward Vick, the
chief operating officer of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., the New York
advertising agency. ``I've been hiking in places all over the
world, but I've never been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick, who is in his mid-50s, says he has been hiking ``ever
since my knees started to give out,'' forcing him to give up
running. He worries that he has only about five more years before
the hiking trails, too, are denied him. So he is thinking
worldwide. Vietnam, where he fought 30 years ago, is also on his
wish list.

   Dr. Daniel Vasella, president of Novartis AG, the world's
biggest health care company, rattled off six ambitious goals for
his company but only one for himself. Vasella, who lives in
Switzerland, hopes to vacation next year in Alaska, long one of his
favorite playgrounds. ``I want to go to Alaska in the winter, when
the wolves are out and howling in the night and the moon is white
and gorgeous,'' he said. So what if daylight lasts only two hours?
``I'd go ice fishing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira M. Millstein, a partner at the New York law firm of Weil,
Gotshal &AMP; Manges and an expert on corporate governance, said he
wanted to make 1999 a relaxing year, spending time as he wants _ on
``my family, GM and a few other trusted clients, teaching at Yale
and spreading the gospel of good corporate governance
internationally.'' Pressed for more on his personal resolutions,
Millstein said, ``I'd like to stop falling off bicycles.''

   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said he wants to go to the dogs, or rather, wants a
certain kind of dog to come to him. Roth, 78, takes his two St.
Bernards, Tsunami and Zigfried, along on political campaigns. His
goal for 1999? ``To find a St. Bernard that doesn't shed and
doesn't drool,'' he said.

   A Quiet Night for the Trump Clan
</P>
<P>
   If anybody is planning a mega-party to usher in the new
millennium on New Year's Eve 1999, surely it should be Donald J.
Trump, the Manhattan real-estate mogul known for appearing
courtside at the U.S. Open with socialites and models affixed to
his arm and for throwing lavish parties in his lavish apartments
and inviting party-circuit figures like the rap impresario Sean
(Puffy) Combs.
</P>
<P>
   So, what'll it be, Trump? A Caribbean cruise? Dinner for 600 at
Cipriani? A midnight schuss in Gstaad? ``I'm not doing anything,''
he said, a touch of pride in his voice. What? Is the great party
marathoner humbled?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Trump said. ``But I just decided that I will spend that
New Year's Eve at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., with my
children, and with my son Donny, because his birthday is on Dec.
31.'' (The younger Trump will be turning 21.)
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it is to make plans a year in advance, other
figures in the business world are either following Trump's lead and
making it a Blockbuster night, or going to unusual lengths to honor
the passage of the millennium. Bill Fischer, a travel agent whose
roster of 400 wealthy clients includes Jonathan Tisch, the
hotelier; Bruce Wasserstein, the financier; Sanford I. Weill, the
chairman of Citigroup, and Diane Sawyer of ABC News, said his
clients were already busy making plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are lying low,'' Fischer said, in hushed, secretive
tones. ``And others are making big, big plans. Certain people want
to be in Paris. Certain people want to be in Hong Kong. Certain
people want to be in the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said one his clients was making plans to hire a yacht _
currently anchored in the Caribbean _ for a cruise in New York
Harbor on the big night. ``You're talking about two weeks of travel
to get the boat here, and then back to the Caribbean,'' Fischer
said. ``It costs a fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   His utterance of the word ``fortune'' is meaningful, considering
he won't even book a client on a bus to Newark until his agency is
paid a $10,000 membership fee. His clients, he said, will variously
be attending a ball at Versailles, flying around the world on a
Concorde and staying at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, booked solid for
New Year's 1999 since 1995. But Fischer declined to say who was
heading where.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have money,'' he said. ``They're not the type of
people who want'' _ he paused _ ``other people to know what they
are doing.''

   FREEZE IN CALIFORNIA DECIMATES CITRUS CROP
</P>
<P>
   A four-day freeze has destroyed more than a third of
California's annual citrus crop, inflicting nearly $500 million in
damage and leading to predictions that orange prices would triple.
</P>
<P>
   Across California, cold air from the Gulf of Alaska sent
temperatures below freezing on Monday, with readings in the high
teens and low 20s in the agriculturally rich Central Valley on
Thursday _ the worst cold spell since a 10-day freeze in 1990.
Officials pronounced the lemon crop a near total loss in the valley
and said perhaps half the state's orange crop was lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   A CASE OF USE IT OR LOSE IT
</P>
<P>
   More than four million Americans who have Flexible Spending
Accounts _ tax-free money set aside by employers for health-care
expenses not covered by insurance _ must spend what is left in
their accounts before Jan. 1 or forfeit the money. Some health care
advocates say the program encourages unnecessary _ and therefore
wasteful _ medical care.
</P>
<P>
   HELP OFFERED FOR HOG FARMERS
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture secretary announced steps to slow the slide in
hog prices and offered farmers hope for easier credit.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN EXPRESS AND CHASE SETTLE
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan said it had reached a settlement with American
Express, two days after the charge-card giant filed a lawsuit in
federal court contending that Chase used false advertising and
deceptive acts in marketing its platinum credit cards. The terms of
the settlement were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ISUZU MOTORS TO CUT 4,000 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu Motors, a Japanese affiliate of General Motors, said it
would cut 4,000 jobs and sell assets in an effort to return to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN TO START LOAN PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's central bank said it would start a plan to help home
buyers and industrial companies get loans as the island's economy
grows at its slowest pace in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END MIXED IN SLOW TRADING
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which closed three hours early because of the
holiday, ended mixed in the slowest trading of the year. The Dow
rose 15.96 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,217.99. The S&AMP;P
500, which had set records for three straight days, fell 2.27
points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,226.27. Nasdaq also
retreated from its record, falling 9.51 points, or four-tenths of a
percent, to 2,163.03.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell for a fourth session, driving the yield on the
30-year Treasury to 5.21 percent from 5.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SANOFI IN TALKS TO SELL UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Sanofi, France's No. 2 drug maker, said it was in talks with
suitors interested in its cosmetics and fashion unit after LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest luxury-goods
maker, bowed out of bidding.

   TRYING TO IGNORE ANTITRUST SHADOW
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft embroiled in an antitrust case, ceaselessly
depicted as the bully of the cyberworld, the company's nearly
15,000 workers at its headquarters outside Seattle have a rude
reminder that the software giant is not necessarily the master of
its own fate. The case lurks on the Microsoft campus as a large
menace that no one really wants to acknowledge but one that can
hardly be ignored.

<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo _ The phones have not worked in years. The
banks are empty. The cars were looted in the last rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   So it is a little surreal, amid the hardship of another
rebellion, to watch a grubby group of men walk into a shop here
called Big Joe's, peel open a wadded piece of paper and pluck out
the ultimate luxury good: an uncut diamond weighing nearly two
carats. The food shops may be bare, but a dealer sits with his
chest pocket full of $100 bills, waiting for diamond diggers to
come in from the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the wealthiest country in the world, and yet we have
nothing,'' said Bolea Zetu, 40, a diamond dealer at Big Joe's,
casually offering up the great paradox about much of Africa, but
Congo in particular: that it is so rich but so achingly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the main diamond mining area 400 or so miles south of
this rebel-held city in the northeast, diamond digging here is
mostly small-time.
</P>
<P>
   Men chance several months, or years, in holes in the forest
floor near towns like Buta, Banalia, Lubutu. Many are lucky: one of
the major shops here says that in good times it buys up to 2,000
carats of diamonds a month from local diggers and sells mostly to
foreign traders.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not good times. On Aug. 23, rebels seeking to
overthrow President Laurent Kabila took Kisangani, the largest city
in what has since become a huge swath of eastern Congo controlled
by the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds play a major role in that insurgency: now that the
foreigners have fled, industry analysts and dealers say, the rebels
as well as Ugandans and Rwandans, whose countries back the rebels,
are buying up diamonds, presumably to help finance the war. Most
experts believe that the rebels' next target is the center of
Congo's diamond mining area, the city of Mbuji-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   It is there that Kabila's forces and his foreign allies,
Zimbabwe particularly, are reported to be building up their
defense. But the rebellion has been hard on the diamond businesses
here, whose shops are decorated with loud signs painted with gems
and wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   Elumbu Kalokola Kennedy, the president of the city's association
of diamond dealers, said that before the rebellion last year that
ousted the Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and brought Kabila
to power, there were 465 dealers. After he took office, the numbers
shrank to 342. That number has slowly dropped to a new low of 47
since the latest rebellion began in August.
</P>
<P>
   The prices? ``Oh-la-la, a catastrophe!'' Kennedy said in French,
the language of the Belgians who colonized Congo in the late 1800s
largely on the promise of the nation's great wealth in gold, ivory,
rubber and palm oil.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he said, he could buy a small diamond _ a
quarter carat or less _ for $160 and sell it for $190. (U.S.
dollars are the currency here unless a dealer wants to offer a
small incentive to a digger. Then he might add something extra in
Congolese francs, which are valuable only in sackfuls.)
</P>
<P>
   After Kabila came to power, he could buy the same diamond for
$140 to sell it at $160. Now, he said, he buys that diamond for
$100 to sell at $110.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bush, the diggers don't want to dig anymore,'' Kennedy
said. ``They know at this moment their diamonds are worth
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The prices used to be fairly uniform, dealers said, when they
could call brokers in Antwerp or Kinshasa, Congo's capital. But now
there is almost no way to get in touch with the outside world. The
problem was evident on a recent day at Big Joe's, when three men
came in with two diamonds, weighing 2.2 carats together, and began
haggling. They rarely spoke aloud what price they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, dealers and sellers alike madly punched numbers into
calculators, each performing his own mathematical theater, and then
showed the other side the result. (In an attempted sale at another
dealer, four beeping calculators blazed at once.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking too much,'' said Gaby Mbula, a dealer who has
been the manager of Big Joe's since its Lebanese owner fled. ``The
diamonds are not really nice. They have some imperfections.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lungwa Mulumbi, 28, the man in charge of the two diamonds,
would come down only a little. He wanted $615. Mbula was willing to
give $550, which another dealer pulled out of his pocket to make
the money less theoretical. The deal died. Mbula said greed was not
necessarily the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe those guys who were here were right about the price,''
he said. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   With the lack of foreign buyers, he and Zetu said they have so
few places to sell that they are stockpiling what they buy _
waiting for the day this latest war is over, its duration measured
in unsold diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you brought $1 billion you couldn't buy all the
diamonds we have,'' Zetu said. ``One million would last you five
hours.''

SOME VOTERS ARE SWITCHING PARTY IN WAKE OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a small, but telling sign of the political
fallout from the House impeachment vote, a handful of local
election officials in various parts of the country say a surprising
number of people have officially changed their party registration
from Republican to Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the number of party switchers is far too small
and occurring in far too few places to qualify as any sort of
national trend. Typically they number less than 100 in localities
where the total registration among Republicans and Democrats is in
the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, county election officials say it is rare during this time
of year for anyone, even this small number, to change party
affiliation. A month after the election with thoughts generally
focused on the upcoming holidays, politics and party registration
is the last thing on voters' minds, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is significant for this time of year,'' said Deborah Clark,
deputy administrator for the Florida Election Division office in
Pinellas County. ``During the holidays our file is usually pretty
static. So this is different from the same time frame in previous
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark said that her office, which encompasses the Clearwater
area recorded 75 people dropping their Republican registration
between Dec. 7 and Dec. 21, at the height of the House impeachment
action. Of those, 55 registered as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about 100 people change from Republican to Democrat
in the last week to week and a half,'' said an election official in
Polk County, Iowa, which includes Des Moines, and who asked not to
be identified. ``Some of these guys have been Republican for a long
time. It's very unusual for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are scattered instances of party switching that
appear to be connected to the Dec. 19 vote by the House to impeach
President Clinton, election officials in a large number of counties
say they have not discerned any movement away from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had anybody do it,'' said Rebecca Khalifa, the
deputy registrar of Voters in Portland, Maine ``In the past two
weeks, I don't think there's been one single person who's done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When party switching has occurred it has caught the eye of some
local election officials, especially when there seems to be no
apparent explanation for the change.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press this week reported a number of people
switching parties in Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties in
northern California. Again, the numbers were very small _ 20
requests to change parties in Contra Costa, 10 people switching a
day in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials say changes are surprising since California
recently went to an open primary system, making party registration
less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unusual for us to get any requests for party
change,'' said Steve Weir, the Contra Costa elections chief.

INVESTING WITH SCOTT M. BLACK: KOBREN DELPHI VALUE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Maine)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
(af) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management, a
Boston money management firm with $915 million in assets, has
preached the merits of deep value investing. With his thick Down
East accent, Black, a native of Portland, Maine, was always ready
to pull out a passel of research showing how small-capitalization
value stocks outperform other equities.
</P>
<P>
   Encountering a sizzling record like Black's, people listened.
Since he started Delphi in January 1980, Black has returned 17.6
percent, annualized, to investors, net of fees, through June 30.
That compares to just 14.4 percent for the Russell 2000 index of
small-cap stocks, according to Ibbotson Associates, a research firm
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Black's minimum investment, $5 million, deterred many. But now,
for the first time, retail investors are able to invest with Black,
through the Kobren Delphi Value fund, a new no-load fund with a
$2,500 minimum that is being marketed by Kobren Insight Group, a
money manager in Wellesley Hills, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Why the 19-year wait to start a mutual fund? ``When we looked at
the economics, we didn't want to compete with the likes of
Fidelity,'' he said, adding that pressure from investors finally
got the better of him. ``We keep getting calls from people who want
to invest with us, and I had to turn them away. Here's a way for us
to capture that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Need anyone fret that his style will be diluted in the mutual
fund format? No, he said. ``I don't get tempted to stray,'' Black
said. ``What we do isn't glamorous, but it works consistently over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, 52, is also known in the art world for buying
Impressionist art at what many consider bargain prices. He bought
``Deux Femmes Fait le Lit,'' a Toulouse-Lautrec oil of two
prostitutes making a bed, at Christie's in November. A deal? ``Oh,
yes,'' he said. ``It was well under $1 million. If you like the
subject, it's a fantastic Toulouse-Lautrec. It's been exhibited
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He brings a similar eye for quality to his deep value investing
style.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at companies, Black watches for growing earnings and
revenues, for example, along with returns on equity of 15 percent
or more. Often, that means passing up restructuring plays. ``We
don't like cost reductions, which only work short-term,'' he said,
adding that he likes to keep turnover in his portfolio to below 50
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   He also favors cash-generating companies with solid balance
sheets. Cash exceeds debt in 40 percent of the companies he owns.
</P>
<P>
   For banks and insurers and what he calls other ``mundane
businesses,'' he pays no more than half the normal market multiple
of price to earnings, and he sells a stock as the ratio reaches
those of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   For asset-rich companies, like oil concerns, he buys at a
discount to, say, proven reserves. For media companies, he uses his
estimate of their takeover value. In both cases, he sells as the
discount disappears.
</P>
<P>
   With an overall P/E ratio of just 14, based on anticipated 1999
earnings, the stocks in Delphi Management's accounts have some of
the lowest valuations in the small-cap universe. ``We're absolute
value players, not relative value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, unlike many value managers, he does not shrug off
technology companies. ``At times we'll own tech, but they have to
be down and out, selling at close to book value with a prospect of
rebound for their earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, that means drawing a bead on a beaten-down target and
waiting for an improvement in the earnings outlook. Black is now
watching Silicon Valley Group, a semiconductor equipment maker,
which closed at $10.75 a share on Thursday, down from its 52-week
high of $27.875 because of the cyclical nature of the business as
well as slack demand in Asia. Its book value is $17, but he is not
yet ready to buy. ``There's more bloodletting to come, because the
earnings power hasn't come back on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black has been adding to his holdings in Grey Advertising, which
he started buying in 1982 at less than $5 a share. Grey now sells
for $348.50 a share, less than 13 times Black's 1999 earnings
estimate of $27 to $28 a share. That compares with P/E multiples of
more than 29 for two rivals, Interpublic and Omnicom. Grey has yet
to recover from the August selloff, is illiquid and not closely
tracked on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the pricing flexibility of advertising companies.
``It's what Warren Buffett used to refer to as a `royalty rent
franchise,' '' he said. ``There's not another business in the U.S.
that can mark up its prices 5 percent every Jan. 1.'' Black thinks
Grey's return on equity will be 18 percent going forward.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, Black began buying shares of Claire's
Stores, a retailer of costume jewelry, at $14 a share; it now
trades at $18.875. ``It's a legitimate 15 percent grower with more
than $120 million of cash on its balance sheet and no debt,'' he
said. The company has annual sales of $300 a square foot in its
stores, a figure he calls ``amazing'' compared with the norm of
$150 to $225 at rival stores.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, he expects the retailer to have a return on equity of
25 percent and earnings of $1.60 to $1.65 a share, giving Claire
Stores a P/E of under 12.
</P>
<P>
   He is also finding wealth in oil-related stocks. ``I'm
bottom-fishing the energy stocks because they've been blown out _
energy prices are so low,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   One favorite is Cabot Oil and Gas of Houston, a natural-gas
producer whose output is growing 10 to 12 percent annually. ``I
like to buy growth, not just assets in the ground,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying shares last October at $13 to $14. The stock
closed at $15 on Thursday, just five times the low-end of his
expectations of per-share cash flow next year. Black puts the
company's breakup value at $22 a share, so it sells for a 32
percent discount; many rivals command premiums.

   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ In a week when temperatures in the 20s with
low gray clouds, sleet and whipping winds made this central
Arkansas city where Bill Clinton grew up uncommonly cold and
gloomy, many residents' feelings about the president would surely
warm his heart.
</P>
<P>
   From Rocky's Corner, the bar and restaurant that was a favorite
of his mother, to the Hot Springs Country Club, and from Hester's
cafe, where some of the local political pundits gather for
breakfast, people defend Clinton despite what they acknowledge to
be his moral mistakes, attack Kenneth W. Starr for
``hound-dogging'' a trail they think would have been best left cold
and rail against their congressman, who voted for the two articles
of impeachment that the House of Representatives adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Of 65 people interviewed, 10 said they would like to see him
ousted, and two more said he should resign. But the rest were in
his corner, some for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never voted for him before in my life, but I would vote
for him now,'' said Cliff Crook, a furniture store owner who had
stopped at Rocky's. ``He hasn't done anything anybody else hasn't
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Crook denounced the impeachment votes cast by Rep. Jay Dickey, a
Republican whose district includes Hot Springs, and predicted
continued public support for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good for the country,'' Crook said, ``no matter what kind
of reputation he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Simonovich, the owner of Rocky's, who proudly pointed out
the table that was once frequently occupied by Clinton's mother,
the late Virginia Clinton Kelley, often after her visits to the
Oaklawn Park race track across the street, said the president could
``still take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some did lament what they saw as the unfulfilled potential
of Clinton's second term. One was Wendy Watterson, a recent college
graduate and resident of nearby Arkadelphia, who had stopped by
Rocky's for a pizza. Ms. Watterson was herself a White House intern
in 1996 and, she said, had three ``face to face'' meetings with
Clinton, always with many others around. So, she said, she was
surprised at disclosure of the president's Oval Office encounters
with Monica S. Lewinsky, whom she never met.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watterson, who favors censure of the president rather than
his removal, said: ``What is really disappointing is that he had
such lofty goals, especially about a real dialogue on multicultural
issues, that in the end will be overcome by something unfavorable
and very personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moore, a manager for a stereo manufacturer, attacked the
investigative methods of Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Starr had a vendetta against Clinton,'' Moore said.
``A $50 million hound dog will eventually force someone into a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hester's cafe, about a mile south of Rocky's, there was
greater disappointment directed at the conduct of the president
himself. Almost everyone who was asked whether his behavior
reflected badly on the state said it had damaged the country as a
whole far more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our man _ he was bad, but we've got to forgive him,''
said John Bates, a builder. ``He's not hurt Arkansas as bad as he's
hurt the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the toughest on Clinton was Zeke Hogeland, a retiree, who
said the Senate ought to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked the man since he was in high school,'' Hogeland
said. ``He was a spoiled brat who could do no wrong in his mother's
eyes. If he had not lied under oath, this would never have come
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, especially men, saw a distinction between lying, on
one hand, and lying about sexual matters, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about lying about having an affair with an
intern,'' said Larry Johnson, a builder, ``that's not lying. That's
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Jackson, a waitress, saw politics behind the effort to
drive Clinton from office, and was also critical of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman is going to be a multimillionaire because of what
happened, and he's going to lose his career,'' Ms. Jackson said.
``If I were Hillary, I would sue Monica for alienation of affection
in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL CUT
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson was one of several people angered by congressman
Dickey's votes for impeachment. In a telephoned response to the
criticism, he said, ``I expected the harsh reaction, and I hope I
can explain to the voters it was a vote of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might join those members of the House who voted
for impeachment but have since appealed to the Senate to consider
censure, Dickey replied: ``I've released myself completely from the
final results. Whatever happens in the Senate will be completely
acceptable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the oldest part of the downtown section of Central Avenue,
known as Bathhouse Row, luncheon diners at the upscale Faded Rose
restaurant were largely opposed to the president's ouster. Shirley
Robins, who works at a mental health center, said: ``He's been
hounded from the minute of his election. It's just a shame that his
personal life got in the way of his career. He could have done a
lot more. He's got me hypnotized _ like Elvis Presley.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL CUT
</P>
<P>
   At St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, about five miles south
of downtown, Dr. Devi Jayaramanm, a pathologist who was a longtime
friend of Mrs. Kelley, a nurse-anesthetist, said of her son, ``It
would be bad to kick him out of office when he's doing a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Mrs. Kelley, Mabel Taylor, a nurse, said: ``I
love Bill. I think he should be punished but not kicked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves black people,'' said Ms. Taylor, who is black. ``He
grew up around them, and it made no difference to him or Virginia
whether you were black or white.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Stag Room of the Hot Springs Country Club, where about 15
members, mostly retired, were gathered for card games, the heated
positions on both sides of the issue generally subsided into
mutters when an interviewer asked for names. Of the several who
identified themselves, one was Scott Campbell, former chief
prosecutor here in Garland County, who said the president ought to
be allowed to complete his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be accomplished if Bill Clinton were removed?''
Campbell said. ``How would it affect the dollar, the economy, the
market and, maybe most important, the foreign situation? These are
not offenses that would interfere with his carrying out his duties
as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell added, as a prosecutor ``I never charged anyone with
perjury.'' Jim Guerin looked up from his cards to say, ``The pope
couldn't stand up under this investigation.''

THE YEAR'S BEST AND WORST MEDIA BLABS AND JABS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fifty-two weeks worth of stray sports media notes,
goats, quips and quotes and smokes and chokes:
</P>
<P>
   Nice theory, but slightly flawed logic: After the Dodgers signed
Kevin Brown to the $105 million contract, Sandy Alderson, the
executive vice president of Major League Baseball, said it about
Dodgers/Fox owner Rupert Murdoch:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this says more about someone's fall prime-time
schedule than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But in the fall of '99, NBC _ not Fox _ has the rights to
the National League Championship Series as well as the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Watch it once on TV and you'll understand: Major League Soccer
commissioner Doug Logan was so peeved that ESPN didn't cover a game
earlier this month when DC United beat a Brazilian team in the
InterAmerican Cup that he blurted out:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they were too busy filming one of those nice, slick
promos they do, or they were getting their tuxes fitted for the
ESPYs.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words from The Almighty Duck: ABC/ESPN chief Steve
Bornstein said it after Disney signed a five-year, $600 million TV
deal with the NHL:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make money. This is a marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you count the next labor dispute: NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue stated to him what seemed to be the obvious last January
after Fox, CBS and ABC pledged almost $18 billion in rights fees:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no downside for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about job security: It was a late September game when the
Dodgers, suffering through a miserable season, fell behind 8-0 to
the Giants. Vin Scully had the perfect caption to not just the
game, but to all that happened to the team in 1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``May I ask you a personal question?''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are any of you keeping score of this one?''
</P>
<P>
   Longer pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Jeff Kent followed with a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   More job security: Kings center Ray Ferraro, in a December
Sports Illustrated story that chronicled a day in the life of the
team, finds out he's a scratch for that night's game and won't
participate in the morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've got nothing to do for the next 75 minutes,'' Ferraro
says, gesturing to the TV in the locker room, ``except watch ESPN2
workout shows _ soft porn in the morn.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years during the playoffs, Ferraro has been
honing his broadcasting skills as a studio analyst for ESPN2's
``NHL2Night.'' That's a hard-core show for puck fans.
</P>
<P>
   What job security? CBS golf producer Lance Barrows, on why
analyst Gary McCord was left out of the network's coverage of the
1998 Masters last April even though the Augusta National Golf Club
had given a reluctant OK to bring him back the last two years:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had such a great coverage last year, I'm superstitious. I
want to keep everything the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst sit-com fears not coming true: Some baseball people
worried that attendance would suffer on May 14 _ the night of the
final episode of ``Seinfeld'' airing on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, attendance at ballparks that night was greater in some
cities _ including Dodger Stadium _ than it was the night before.
The Dodgers drew 30,867 for a game against Philadelphia after
attracting 28,604 the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of intelligent people know how to run their
VCR,'' theorized Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Best sit-com sports line: In the final episode of ``Seinfeld,''
it's Frank Costanza (Jerry Stiller) who stands up in the courtroom
and yells at Yankees owner George Steinbrenner on the witness
stand:
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you give $12 million to Hideki Irabu?''
</P>
<P>
   Best piece of irony to everyone except NBC: Exactly one year
after Jerry Seinfeld told the network he was doing his last season,
the Peacock airs Jimmy Stewart in ``It's A Wonderful Life'' this
afternoon because the NBA lockout knocked out its traditional
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Best add to insult: Showtime replays ``The Game'' NBA exhibition
today at 4:30 p.m. Only 450,000 out of 18 million homes that have
the premium cable channel tuned into it live last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So obvious even TV Guide caught it: ESPN ``SportsCenter'' anchor
nerd Bob Stevens earned a ``jeer'' in the June 7 issue when he
``snidely wondered `whatever happened to''' St. Louis Blues player
Doug Wickenheiser during a story on NHL first-round picks that
never panned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Blues fan would tell Stevens that Wickenheiser has been
battling cancer and the team even had a charity game for him
earlier this season,'' the jeer pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Worst moonlighting job: Fox allows each one of its NFL studio
guys to do other stuff for the network, but James Brown's work
hosting Fox's ``World's Funniest!'' video show has to be the most
degrading.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on an episode in November, when the dapper Harvard
graduate hosted a night that was a tribute to home-video shots to
the groin. Brown told viewers if they counted the number of groin
hits during the show and mailed in their guesses, they could win a
$5,000 prize. Brown even went so far as to define a groin hit as
``those shots to the privates.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop calling it a sport: By our count, there was a figure
skating competition _ something called a World Extreme Team
Championship Fire-on-Ice Rock-n-Challenge Short, Medium and Long
Program Exhibition Presented by Coors (Please Don't Drink and
Skate) from Kitchener, Ontario _ on a major network at least once
each weekend this year.
</P>
<P>
   Worst network decision: ABC ``Monday Night Football'' starts 40
minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting ratings fluke: ABC's ``Monday Night Football''
ratings have been 15-plus in Los Angeles over the 13.8 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Worst technical gaffe: NBC resistance to using the score graphic
during any of its sports event coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Best technical gadget: The first-down stripe on NFL Sunday Night
Football that ESPN broke out at midseason. Soon, CBS picked up its
own version. Fox plans to have one for the NFL playoffs. And ABC
will use it on the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ABC ``Monday Night Football'' may use it next, but with the
technical workers' strike, just producing a respectable broadcast
this season has been challenging enough.
</P>
<P>
   Worst career move: Magic Johnson, talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   Smartest career move: Chris Myers leaving ``Up Close'' for Fox
Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   Second smartest career move: Gary Miller, to L.A., to accept
role of ``Up Close'' host starting Jan. 11 after nearly watering
down his career last year.
</P>
<P>
   Loudest career move: Keith Olbermann, back to L.A., to resurrect
Fox Sports News. And he hasn't even started yet.
</P>
<P>
   Year's best media maven: Ashley Judd, already the star of a
University of Kentucky club hockey poster featuring her with just a
jersey and blue toe-nail polish, put on a Wildcats basketball
jersey for the cover of November's issue of Kentucky Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that's good and meaningful,'' the actress and
Wildcats alum told the Lexington Herald-Leader. ``I could care a
rat's hooey about hockey.'' &QL;

MANY EAGER TO EMBRACE NEW EUROPEAN CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When Fernando Sarabia Blanco travels around Europe these
days, he totes home, besides souvenirs and memories of tasty meals
and good hotels, piles of useless change. For when European banks
exchange one currency for another, they rarely accept coins, only
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got boxes of coins from every European country,'' he
said. ``It's very annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarabia Blanco, 52, an executive at Europa Metalli, a metals
trading group, says he is not the sort of person who will ``run
after every novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, come January, when 11 European countries _ Italy, Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland and Finland _ have a single common currency,
Sarabia Blanco says he will be in the front ranks of those who will
use the euro.
</P>
<P>
   True, euro coins and notes will not be available until 2002, so
European pockets will continue to jingle with German marks (a euro
is worth nearly 2 marks), French francs (6.6 a euro) and Italian
lire (1,945 a euro).
</P>
<P>
   But Sarabia Blanco's bank account will be denominated in euros,
and the Diners Club and Visa cards he carries will be payable in
euros. His phone bill from Telecom Italia, the national carrier, is
already denominated in both lire and euros, and monthly statements
from Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, where he has his account, are
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Europeans are eager to use the euro _ now worth
$1.17 _ and expect to see benefits in cost and efficiency in travel
and personal finance as a result. By one estimate, about 35 million
Europeans use several currencies on a daily basis, and more than a
quarter of the 372 million people in the 15-nation European Union
travel each year, for business or pleasure, to another European
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These constituencies,'' said David Hopkins, manager of the
euro program at General Motors Corp.'s European unit, ``will
readily embrace the euro as a form of payment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Louis Harris poll in six euro countries in
November, 58 percent of Europeans expect the single currency to
have a positive effect on their daily lives. The survey, of 2,535
people in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Spain and Portugal,
found that 52 percent thought they were sufficiently well informed
about the changes that faced them.
</P>
<P>
   Purchases in euros will be possible from the start. Auto-rental
companies, like Avis and Hertz, will accept euros as well as
national currencies come January, and automakers, like General
Motors, will list prices in both forms.
</P>
<P>
   And when Europeans travel, if they watch their costs, they will
pay as much of their way as possible without using cash. Banks that
change euros for local currencies will continue to charge a fee to
do so, so to save, experts say that Europeans like Sarabia Blanco
will desert cash in favor of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, taxis in Brussels take credit cards, and highway tolls
are paid that way in Spain,'' Sarabia Blanco said. ``Until now, the
more you paid cash, the more the banks earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Europeans are in step with business
executives like Sarabia Blanco. Among the elderly, and in the rural
population, those who rely primarily on cash and do not use banks
much will be slow to feel the euro's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Fulvio Loffredo, 31, a textbook publisher from Naples, is
skeptical. He intends to list prices in euros, he said, but he
added: ``I think we're a bit ahead of our times. In reality, I
don't believe people will be buying schoolbooks in euros for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Vanzi, head of private banking at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto,
says he expects customers to divide into two categories: ``those
who've already accepted the euro for its advantages and don't
resist, and those who are anchored in the old system.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how fast Europeans begin using euros depends in part on how
soon their employers begin doing so. Europa Metalli, where Sarabia
Blanco works, will move quickly to embrace the euro, unifying for
example its copper-purchasing business throughout Europe; he
expects to be paid his salary in euros sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Carone, however, has no idea when his employer, the
Italian government, will do so. While Sarabia Blanco's salary is
deposited directly into his bank account, making a euro transfer
simple, Carone, 56, an adviser to the foreign affairs committee of
the Italian Parliament, is handed a monthly paycheck. The
government in Rome, like governments elsewhere in Europe, says it
will not be prepared to operate in euros until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carone was an early enthusiast of a single currency. In
1995, he worked as a civil servant at European Union headquarters
in Brussels, tendering contracts from companies in East European
countries, like Poland, that were denominated in European Currency
Units. Since it was created in 1979 as a basket or weighted
combination of 12 European currencies, the ECU has spawned a
commercial paper market, as well as personal checks, credit cards
and even bank accounts and bank loans in ECUs.
</P>
<P>
   In countries with high inflation and volatile currencies, like
Italy, banks often counseled customers to use European Currency
Units, and Carone did so, opening an ECU account where he worked,
at a Brussels branch of Paribas, the French financial services
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Italians who had taken out loans in ECUs were badly burned
in 1992, when the lira collapsed, losing 30 percent of its value
against other other basket currencies, because they had to repay
their debts in lire. Some renegotiated mortgages; others sold their
homes to pay back their debts. By 1996, the lire-ECU exchange rate
had stabilized, ECU borrowing rates were a fraction of those for
lire, and Carone said friends were financing homes and other large
purchases with European Currency Units.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Come January, Carone will slip imperceptibly into the euro. His
ECU account at Paribas automatically becomes a euro account, and
thanks to his East European experience, he has a better feel than
most here for what a euro is worth. ``People's salaries, the price
of an airplane _ I know how to express these things in euros,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency, in his view, has already brought benefits,
not so much from the euro itself as from the financial environment
its introduction is creating. The fiscal austerity needed to
qualify countries for the euro pushed down interest rates, making
borrowing easier; currency-exchanging fees will be avoidable.
</P>
<P>
   To purchase a home for his son, Carone is negotiating a bank
mortgage. In 1984, when Sarabia Blanco bought a house, Italian
mortgage rates were 13 percent; now, Carone will pay about a third
of that. When European central banks cut their lending rates early
this month, the mortgage rate dropped a further half-point, Carone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the need to get government accounts in order for the
euro forced many countries, including Italy, to sell nationalized
industries, and newly privatized phone companies, airlines and
utilities, no longer coddled by public ownership, have cut costs
and reduced prices to hang onto customers.
</P>
<P>
   Where he banks, Carone may convert his lira account for use with
both lire and euros, or open a new account in euros alone.
</P>
<P>
   Carone thinks that the euro will push people to use noncash
forms of payment. About 80 percent of European commerce is now
handled that way, according to experts, and many payments are made
by bank-to-bank transfers. And while many Americans still pay
monthly gas, electric and credit card bills by check, Europeans
have long used automatic bank transfers, and such noncash payment
activity will likely increase.
</P>
<P>
   If there are benefits to be reaped from use of the euro,
however, there is also a price to pay, Carone said. For one thing,
merchants, by rounding off prices when converting from local
currencies to euros, will be tempted to charge more for their
goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most Europeans are not yet familiar with price listings in
euros. In countries like Italy and Belgium the adjustment will be
greatest, since their money has long done without decimals. But the
euro, like the dollar, will be divided into 100 cents, and a Roman
who subscribes to a daily paper, and pays his bill in euros, will
find himself paying, instead of 1,500 lire per paper, about 80 euro
cents, a mere 8/10 of a euro. Consumers may well be confused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sarabia Blanco says that the euro's smaller, more
manageable numbers can only allow greater clarity in the long run.
In Italy, where the dollar now trades around 1,667 lire, government
budgets run into the trillions of lire _ numbers that few can
meaningfully digest. ``They're mastodonic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarabia Blanco says his next step is to have a look at his
investment portfolio with a view to widening the spread of his
investments across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In January, securities markets in the 11 participating countries
will denominate stocks and bonds in euros, enabling him to compare
at a glance securities prices throughout Europe. And indeed
throughout Italy, long lines formed in recent weeks in banks and at
postal savings windows as Italians reshuffled their portfolios.
That was because Italian government bonds now traded in minimum
lots of five million lire, or $3,000, must be realigned into new
lots of 1,000 euros, or $1,170. Investors may either hold onto the
remaining amounts until maturity, sell securities or make
additional purchases to round off the amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gianfranco Altafin, branch manager at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto,
said it was a time for bankers to be close to their customers.
``It's a period of great attention to customer service,'' he said.
Since June, his employees have been taking courses to assist
customers with the euro starting Monday morning, Jan. 4, when the
new currency will in practical terms be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's allowed to take off,'' he said, ``on the second and
third of January.''

   MONTREAL _ Pierre Beaudoin won't deny it: These days, he often
finds himself staring out his office window, scanning the skies for
snow clouds.
</P>
<P>
   That may not come as a surprise. He is, after all, president of
the recreational products division of Bombardier Inc., whose Ski
Doo snowmobiles have been in a sales slump for two years. But other
executives at the company's headquarters here are not nearly as
sensitive to the vagaries of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   For Bombardier has come a long way from its beginnings in 1942
as a Canadian manufacturer of snowgoing equipment which expanded
into snowmobiles in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The company has grown into a global transportation giant whose
revenues are increasing at a rate of 20 percent a year. It builds
and sells subway cars, trains, airplanes and other motorized
vehicles to clients that range from the New York City subway system
to Shandong province in China. Snowmobiles are now just a small
part of the company's $6.1 billion annual business.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, but aggressively, Bombardier (pronounced
bohn-BAR-dee-ay) has built itself up. The company has succeeded in
part by trying to be like a local company when it enters new
markets and regions, usually by taking over a government-owned
business or entering into a partnership with the local government.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bombardier is still very much a Canadian institution with
close ties to the government in Ottawa, which has helped the
company more than once. Cozying up to government officials, of
course, is not uncommon in aerospace and mass transportation,
businesses in which the customers are often government agencies and
the capital outlays are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And Ottawa officials know that Bombardier, like many other
successful Canadian businesses, needs to look beyond its limited
domestic market and focus on exports. Roughly 88 percent of the
company's revenue comes from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bombardier's close relationship with the Canadian
government has at times drawn fire from competitors, who complain
that Ottawa unfairly props up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deliberate and determined policy by the government of
Canada to support the aerospace industry by whatever means
available,'' said Valdemar Leao, director of the economic
department in the Foreign Ministry of Brazil, the home of Embraer,
Bombardier's chief rival in the regional-jet market. ``And if you
talk about aerospace in Canada, you have to talk about
Bombardier.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bombardier acknowledges that it has received
assistance from the Canadian government, but it says that such help
consisted of repayable loans, not subsidies, available to other
manufacturers and not specially set aside for Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a company that has not sought to draw much attention
to itself, such criticism has often thrown a spotlight on
Bombardier both at home and in the many foreign countries where it
does business. Consider the following cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the company's first major contracts in the United
States _ a 1982 deal to build 825 cars for the New York City subway
system _ caused an uproar because the Canadian government had
provided $563 million of low-interest loans to finance the bid. The
U.S. Commerce Department ruled that Canada had illegally subsidized
the sale and was prepared to fine the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority of New York $91.2 million _ the estimated amount of the
illegal subsidy. The fine was withdrawn when the MTA agreed not to
buy foreign-made subway cars again for three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Bombardier bought the de Havilland division of Boeing Co.
in 1992, the province of Ontario helped by acquiring 49 percent of
de Havilland's equity. Last year, Ontario agreed to sell its share
to Bombardier for $34 million, but government opposition leaders
and Bombardier's rivals complained about the sweetheart terms of
the deal _ the purchase price was payable over 15 years at an
interest rate of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a complaint now before the World Trade Organization, Brazil
accuses Canada of providing Bombardier with millions of dollars in
loans that are actually prohibited export subsidies. That complaint
followed one Canada filed on behalf of Bombardier, accusing Brazil
of providing subsidies that let Embraer use export financing to
discount the price of its jets by $2.5 million each, stealing
business from Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Bombardier's bid to build 252 subway cars for a new line
in Mexico City was rejected last year, Canada's ambassador to
Mexico, Marc Perron, undiplomatically accused the municipal
government of chicanery. He later resigned. Prime Minister Jean
Chretien stepped in and wrote to the Mexican president, Ernesto
Zedillo, asking him to investigate Bombardier's rejection. The
competing bid was also eventually rejected. A new competition is to
be held, but no selection will be made until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Beaudoin, Bombardier's 60-year-old chairman, _ and
father of the 36-year-old Pierre _ does enjoy a close relationship
with Chretien, who is also from Quebec. And over all, Yves Allaire,
Bombardier's vice president for strategic planning, described
Bombardier's relations with the Canadian government as ``good to
moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   But are they good enough to ask for favors?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, not favors in the sense of anything that is not part
of standard programs,'' Allaire said. ``The only favor, quote
unquote, we asked is that they go to the WTO to fight off Brazil,
and it took us two years to get Canada to go. So that could be
considered a favor, but if it's a favor, it took a long time
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In its submission to the WTO on Bombardier's behalf, the
Canadian government stated that ``none of the impugned programs,
activities or transactions is a prohibited export subsidy.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy may be difficult to avoid for a company that has a
reputation for being a gutsy organization willing to take big
risks.
</P>
<P>
   It has enjoyed particular success in aerospace, a business that
Bombardier timidly entered in 1986 with the purchase of Canadair, a
wobbly aviation company, from the Canadian government. Now,
Bombardier is the third-largest civilian aerospace company in the
world behind Boeing and the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bombardier has received a total of 166 orders for its
small regional jetliners _ an aircraft niche it practically
invented.
</P>
<P>
   (On Monday, Bombardier won an additional $580 million order for
25 70-seat jets from Horizon Air, a unit of Alaska Air Group.)
</P>
<P>
   It builds Learjets, luxury private jets, and even a workhorse
water bomber used by forest-fighting services in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier is also one of the world's largest rail and subway
contractors. Anyone who regularly rides the New York City subway
has sat in a car assembled by Bombardier at its plant in
Plattsburgh, N.Y., and the company is at work on another 680 subway
cars worth more than $900 million.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier will also run and maintain the new light-rail link
planned for Kennedy International Airport, the 150-mile-an-hour
trains that will run on Amtrak's Northeast corridor and as many as
500 intercity railcars for China's Ministry of Railways. Earlier
this month, it signed a $1.8 billion contract to build locomotives
and train coaches for the Virgin Rail Group in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While snowmobiles and Sea-Doo jet skis have been reduced to just
a small part of Bombardier, until recently they accounted for
approximately a third of the company's profit. In the latest
monthly report, though, recreational vehicles showed no profit at
all. But there was a flood of orders in the aerospace and rail
divisions. For the third quarter, the company, which has 47,000
employees, earned $81 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombardier is almost like a portfolio,'' said Ronald Schwarz,
executive director of equity research at CIBC Wood Gundy, an
investment bank in Toronto. ``At any given time, one segment may
not be performing as it should, but it will be offset by a better
than expected performance by another segment of the portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Beaudoin (pronounced bo-DWAN) has said that a key to
Bombardier's success is the slow pace of its diversification, and
its willingness to walk away from opportunities that are not as
promising as they first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company dropped its original bids for
Canadair, Learjet and de Havilland, and agreed to complete the
deals only when its first offers, or close to them, were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier has also shown an ability to take initiative in the
face of dashed opportunities. When energy prices soared in 1973
after the Arab oil embargo, snowmobile sales fell by half. As one
response, Bombardier made a bid to build cars for the new Montreal
subway, and it won, thus entering the mass-transit business.
</P>
<P>
   And when snowmobile dealers had trouble getting financing from
banks, Bombardier started its own capital and financing group.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier often buys the advanced technology it wants, usually
at bargain rates. For example, Bombardier's 1986 purchase of the
financially troubled Canadair gave it access to the technology
behind the small Challenger corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the company invested an amount equivalent to half
its market capitalization on the design of a 50-seat regional jet
that just about everyone else thought the industry did not need.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the design of the jet's wing and how it is
affected by ice have been raised recently by an official of the
U.S. Transportation Safety Board. Bombardier officials say that the
wing design has been proved safe in 18 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now developing a new, larger regional jet. In a
cavernous building near Dorval airport outside Montreal, crews of
workers crawl over the enormous wing assembly of the new Canadair
700, a 70-seat regional jet. The aircraft was designed at a total
cost of $431 million, including a government development loan of
$63 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Bombardier is already working on plans for a 90-seat jet
that would bring it closer to direct competition with the smallest
Boeing and Airbus airliners.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to help from Canada, Bombardier has received a hand
from the Mexican government. The company bought the decrepit
Concarril locomotive works in central Mexico from the government
almost seven years ago, with the expectation that the government
would ensure that Bombardier had enough contracts to keep the plant
busy.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the company won a contract to renovate cars for the
Mexico City subway, and to build some new ones. It is also
assembling 275 locomotives under subcontract to General Motors
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The locomotives are typical of the way Bombardier works in an
increasingly integrated North American market. Their electrical
systems are made in Ontario. Their powerful motors come from
LaGrange, Ill. All the parts for GM's locomotive division are
assembled by Mexican workers employed by Bombardier, and some are
sold to Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway, which uses the
locomotives to haul mile-long coal trains through the American
West.
</P>
<P>
   But Bombardier's sprawling plant is still working at only 60
percent of capacity in part because the company did not get the
contract for the new Mexico City subway line.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Brown, the president of the aerospace unit who will
replace Beaudoin as Bombardier's president and chief executive as
of Feb. 1, said complaints that the company succeeded only because
it rubbed elbows with government officials were off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of competition,'' Brown said, ``but it should
be on a fair basis.''

A TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO AN EPIC SHIFT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Andrew Windsor is already nostalgic. ``It will be a real
shame,'' said Windsor, head of retail operations at Thomas Cook,
the British travel services company, to see venerable European
currencies like the French franc, the Spanish peseta and the
Italian lira just disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers, he said, ``see using foreign notes and coins as an
exciting and integral part of their holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The romance is lost on Geoffrey H. Lipman, president of the
World Travel and Tourism Council. Emptying his wallet during a
recent phone conversation, he listed the bank notes he found.
``Pounds sterling, Belgian francs, American dollars,'' Lipman
groaned. ``And before I cleaned it this week, I had German marks,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgic or not, come Jan. 1, travelers to Europe will
encounter 11 nations undertaking a historic shift _ the replacement
of their currencies by the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the changes won't be immediately obvious. In most
places in the euro zone, prices will still be posted in the old
local currencies. Travelers who need cash will still have to change
dollars for marks, francs, lire or other familiar bills. Euro coins
and bills will not appear until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning on Friday, the local currencies _ whatever image
of monarchs, heroes or landmarks they bear _ will all be
denominations of the euro, in much the same way as nickels and
dimes are denominations of the dollar. Travelers changing money
will, in fact, be trading dollars for euros, but pocketing them in
the form of marks, francs or the like.
</P>
<P>
   If travelers want to deal in euros right away, they can _ by
avoiding cash. Thomas Cook (presumably cursing the change all the
while) will join American Express in issuing new euro-denominated
traveler's checks. Credit cards and debit cards will also allow
payment in euros, though it will depend on whether the store, hotel
or airline is prepared to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you can request it, and if you have a dollar-denominated
card, your monthly statement will show the transaction in the euro
amount, then translate it into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors should do business in euros whenever possible, experts
say, because it will encourage retailers to post prices in euros,
making costs easier to compare throughout Europe. In some cases, it
may also create competitive pressures that can drive down prices.
``Our advice to travelers,'' said Sally Brown, a spokeswoman for
American Express, ``is to take note of these price differences from
country to country.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the use of a common currency across a wide swath of
Europe should produce significant benefits for visitors _ though
not without certain risks.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented this month at a meeting in Washington, the
National Business Travel Association, a group of American corporate
travel managers, said the euro would ultimately eliminate many
expenses of changing money, which it estimated at $13 to $14 a
transaction. The common currency will also enable travelers to
easily spot price differences for travel services.
</P>
<P>
   The danger? The euro will also shine a floodlight on corporate
expense accounts. Without the cloud of receipts in a dozen strange
currencies, the boss back home will more easily spot profligacy,
the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ease of comparable pricing could place an added burden
on the business traveler, who will be held more responsible by his
company in identifying savings that cannot be controlled by the
corporate travel manager, like business meals,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   These possible effects are not lost on corporate travel
managers.
</P>
<P>
   In an American Express survey, 58 percent of European business
travelers said that, once the euro arrived, they would broaden
their search for less expensive travel services across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, conducted earlier this year among 200 business
travelers, 70 percent said they thought travel companies like
airlines and car rental agencies would be forced to cut prices as a
result of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, corporate travel departments that insist on doing
business in euros will have to invest to update their computer
software, and they may need to renegotiate contracts for bulk
services with airlines and hotel chains. But if overall prices
start falling because of the euro's introduction, travel companies,
facing lower profits, may be less willing to negotiate discounts
for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the travel industry, fearing that prices will drop, has
been in no hurry to embrace the euro, according to Reinhard
Schulte-Braucks, a European Union official who helps companies
prepare for the new currency. ``They don't want the competition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business and leisure travelers alike will find a
continent in transition in the new year, noted Hasan Alemdar, euro
program manager for Visa International in London.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, like Germany, there will likely be separate cash
registers for marks and euros; in France and Spain, stores will
probably accept payment in the local currency or in euros at the
same point of sale. In a third group of countries, including
Belgium and Italy, many stores may not be ready to trade in euros,
so they will require payment in the old local currency and merely
give the customer, by way of information, the euro amount on a
separate receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise travelers to count their change carefully _ and
not to count on any windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like switching from Celsius to Fahrenheit,''
Schulte-Braucks said. ``It doesn't get warmer or colder; you don't
get richer or poorer.''

GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES STEPS TO HELP NATION'S HOG FARMERS  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a holiday radio address to the country's
troubled pig farmers, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced
steps Thursday to slow the slide in hog prices and offered the
farmers hope for easier credit.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the Agriculture Department would temporarily stop
lending money for construction of new pork-production plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the crux of the problem is oversupply, we want to stop
any government action that could exacerbate the situation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman also said the department hoped to ``nail down in the
next few days'' actions to make it easier for farmers ``whose
long-term outlook is positive'' to get credit. He encouraged
farmers to be more aggressive in applying for the department's
loan-guarantee programs.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's announcement coincided with the bleakest winter
in memory for many hog farmers. A 250-pound hog that fetched $118 a
year ago brings about $45 today, a five-decade low, and many
farmers face bankruptcy in 1999 if the trend is not reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman also announced that his department's inspection branch
would speed a program to eliminate up to 1.7 million hogs that may
be carrying the pseudo-rabies virus. Though the virus does not
affect humans, it is fatal to dogs, cats and other domestic
animals. The ability to certify hogs as virus-free through the
eradication program would open new foreign markets to U.S. pork
products, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longer term,'' Glickman said, ``we are taking a hard
look to determine whether prices are truly competitive and whether
producers are being treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pig farmers are making far less money than they were a
year or two ago, shoppers are not paying less at the supermarket.
In trying to explain that contradiction, some retailers have said
they are reluctant to lower prices now for fear they would incur
shoppers' resentment if they had to raise them sharply in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, the nation's
leading pork-producing state, said he welcomed an investigation of
industry prices.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's remarks also were greeted warmly by the American
Farm Bureau Federation and the National Pork Producers Council,
whose president, Donna Reifschneider, called the official's actions
``a positive first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has been trying for months to reduce
the supply of pork, by encouraging federal agencies to buy more and
by increasing exports, both through regular commercial channels and
through food-aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spirit of the season, I'm reminded of the movie `It's a
Wonderful Life,' when Jimmy Stewart called on all the folks in his
town to not panic, to come together,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Exports, as measured in volume, are up 19 percent this year and
have more than doubled since 1992, Glickman said, and domestic
consumption remains healthy. But U.S. hog farmers have been
victimized, in a sense, by their own efficiency. There are far
fewer of them today than 40 or 50 years ago, yet this year they
have produced a record 19 billion pounds of pork.

WHO'S THE NEXT McQUARTERBACK? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Cade McNown on the December banquet circuit
in New York, Louisville and Orlando, the Bruins took a week-long
look at their young quarterbacks. While the future isn't clear,
it's not as murky as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges must
evaluate the four returning quarterbacks in a month of spring
practice and prepare two players for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see who the first guy will be, then make a decision on
No.2,'' Toledo said. ``We need to come out of spring with two
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an early look at the contenders:
</P>
<P>
   _Sophomore Drew Bennett has been McNown's backup for two seasons
and will be the only returnee with game experience, however scant.
He's one of UCLA's best athletes, fast and mobile, but the concern
is arm strength. His passes tend to flutter. Familiarity with the
complex offense makes him the heavy favorite for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   _Redshirt freshman Scott McEwan, of Thousand Oaks, has improved
significantly since last season. He's big and strong but lacks the
mobility of McNown and Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of strides,'' Toledo said. ``He's what we
thought he was when we recruited him.''
</P>
<P>
   _Freshman Cory Paus, of New Lenox, Ill., resembles McNown
physically, although he's right-handed and, at 6-foot-2, is
slightly taller. He has a solid arm, he's tough, and he has shown
glimpses of McNown-esque leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of ability,'' Toledo said. ``He throws a little
better than Cade did at this stage. The players like him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus isn't as experienced as Bennett or even McEwan, but don't
count him out.
</P>
<P>
   _Freshman Ryan McCann, of Agoura, injured his back and missed a
December scrimmage and practice time. He's big and gifted, but he's
got a slew of bodies ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   _Recruit J.P. Losman, from Venice, hopes to graduate this winter
and enroll at UCLA in time for spring practice. He's the most
talented of the group, with mobility, accuracy and a rocket arm.
But it's unlikely a true freshman can outplay four returnees.
</P>
<P>
   Contract update: Sources said UCLA officials have agreed in
principle on a new contract that will make Toledo one of the
highest-paid coaches in the Pac-10. (He's currently ninth, at
$453,000 per season.) However, it may be weeks before the
slow-moving administration finalizes the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One of Toledo's greatest concerns is that athletic director
Peter Dalis, who hired Toledo on Jan. 4, 1996, is nearing
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could bring a new guy in who doesn't know Bob Toledo from
the man in the moon,'' Toledo said. ``That's why I want some
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is seeking a seven-year deal with a rollover clause.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell update: The Bruins have delayed a decision on Freddie
Mitchell's Rose Bowl availability until early next week. Toledo is
skeptical that Mitchell, who has made a remarkable recovery from a
Sept. 19 broken femur, will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put him in a position where he could hurt
himself more,'' Toledo said. ``And we've got good chemistry on
offense. We don't need him to come back. After Christmas, we'll
have a better gauge.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mitchell does participate, Toledo said, it'll only be for a
few plays.
</P>
<P>
   Practice update: The Bruins will return to campus Saturday and
hold a brief afternoon workout. All post-Christmas practices are
closed to the public.

BUYING A CAR? THINK LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)

   EINOD, Germany _ If Europe worked in line with economic theory,
Wolfgang Marschall would probably be scared to death about the
euro. But he isn't, and his reasons illuminate much about the way
Europe works in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Marschall is general manager of Auto Friesen, a sprawling car
dealership in this small town just a few miles from the French
border. The lot looks like any other _ colorful flags to attract
attention, signs promoting the latest specials and hundreds of new
cars on display.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ordinary dealers, Marschall makes his profit by
euro-arbitrage. Instead of ordering Volkswagen Passats from German
factories, he buys them from other car dealers in Spain, Italy or
Denmark. Then he imports them back into Germany, where he still
manages to undercut standard dealers' prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in December, Auto Friesen was offering a fully loaded
Passat for 36,590 Deutsche marks _ or $22,175 _ about 13 percent
less than the price quoted by authorized dealers in Frankfurt.
Audi's luxurious A6 Avant was on sale for 69,900 marks, or $42,363,
about 5 percent less than the standard price.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just German cars. Marschall also trades in Fiats,
Chryslers, Hondas and most other brands sold in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best deal right now is on Jeep Grand Cherokees,'' he said,
strolling through his lot on a snowy afternoon. ``I bought them in
the Canary Islands, which has been having a very special offer on
them. They're about DM 20,000 below the standard price.''
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Not at all. Because incomes in Spain are only about
75 percent of the European average, most car makers offer much
lower base prices to Spanish dealers than those in Germany or
France, forgoing profits to maintain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Marschall and other gray-market resellers readily exploit the
price differences because there are no tariff barriers on cars
shipped within the European Union. In Germany, gray-market dealers
sell 300,000 cars a year; conventional dealers sell more than 4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the euro argue that the new currency will create
``transparency'' in prices, forcing companies to harmonize their
prices across national borders. If so, that would take away the
resellers' arbitrage play. But Marschall betrays little worry about
losing his niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have known about these price differences for years
already,'' he said. ``If the car companies equalized prices, we
would be hurt. But I don't think they will do that, because we're
really too small a problem for them. If they dropped their prices
in Germany, they might take our sales. But they would lose much
more money on all the other cars they sell.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, car company executives say price differences on their
products across Europe have narrowed considerably in recent years.
Nonetheless, they have remained easy targets for gray marketeers.
Few consumers travel from France to Spain for cheaper perfume, but
many are willing to make the trip if it means saving several
thousand dollars on a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car industry is the most heavily criticized industry on
this question, but it is one of the best behaved,'' said Wolfgang
Schneider, vice president of public and government affairs at Ford
of Europe, in Cologne. ``If you look at price differences within
the euro zone, they are within a band of 10 to 15 percent, net of
tax differences. That's much less than in most other consumer
products.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not always the case; a Ford Mondeo at Auto Friesen is
about 30 percent cheaper than the standard dealer's price in
Frankfurt. But there is evidence to support Schneider's view,
notably in the case of Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, VW had been notorious for charging far less in
other European countries than in Germany, while systematically
blocking dealers in other countries from selling to German
re-importers. The European Commission fined the company more than
$100 million last year for the latter practice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Volkswagens are easier to get and the price variations
are modest. Most VW's available at Auto Friesen are priced only
slightly less than at authorized dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some disparities are likely to remain for quite some
time, because they are based on tax differences among European
countries. In Denmark, which has an extremely high luxury tax on
car sales, many car manufacturers lower their base prices to stay
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Re-sellers like Marschall take advantage, because they don't
have to pay the luxury tax if they are shipping the cars directly
to Germany. Indeed, not counting tax differences, automobile
executives say, European car prices don't vary much more than those
between different regions of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, car executives acknowledge, prices will remain lower
in the European Union's less-affluent countries until incomes catch
up to their wealthier neighbors' _ assuring Marschall and his peers
a thriving business, euro or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Spanish standards of living are equal to those in the
rest of Europe,'' said Schneider of Ford, ``there will be price
differences.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EVEN A GHOST LOSES A BIT OF SPEED AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gause Ghost doesn't move quite as quickly or as stealthily
as once upon a time, and sometimes even needs the support of a
cane. The Gause Ghost doesn't even move so quickly in his car
anymore _ a champagne-colored 1994 Oldsmobile _ and, the indignity
of it all, he is even more or less grounded when night falls.
</P>
<P>
   And when Joe Moore Sr., the onetime speedster from Gause, Texas,
known as the Gause Ghost and, more formally, Jo-Jo Moore when he
played outfield for the New York Giants in the 1930s and early
1940s, visits his son's home these days, he gets a particular
reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's getting into evening,'' said Joe Moore Jr., son of
the Ghost, ``I'll tell him: `Daddy, it's getting late. You've got
45 minutes to drive back before it gets dark.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's twenty-five miles from Gause (or Hearne, where the post
office is located) to Bryan, where Joe Sr. lives, having moved to
the Grand Court retirement home in 1995, four years after his wife,
Jewell, died, and shortly after the house he bought with his World
Series checks burned down. ``He's really not supposed to drive in
the dark anymore,'' Joe Jr. said. ``But if you don't watch him, he
will.''
</P>
<P>
   And Friday will be more of the same when the Gause Ghost visits,
though just a little bit different. There will be some 50 friends
and family _ including his two grandchildren and two
great-grandchilren _ at the birthday bash for him in his son's
home. It will combine with a Christmas party, for Joseph Gregg
Moore, born on Dec. 25, 1908, will celebrate his 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And it would not be unusual for him to share some of his
baseball stories with his family and friends. After all, he played
12 years in the major leagues, all with the Giants, and finished
with a .298 batting average, playing also in three World Series and
three All-Star games. He played for John McGraw, and played with or
against Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio and Bill Terry
and Carl Hubbell and Dizzy Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the grandchildren and great-grandchildren look at
him as if he's describing something out of the Dark Ages,'' said
Joe Jr. ``But it's good times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ghost _ returning to health after having left the hospital
last month with prostate problems, gray-haired and with a pair of
hearing aids and purchased teeth, a little shorter and a bit
heavier than when he played at 5 feet 11 inches, 155 pounds _ may
tell about the time there was a ``rhubarb'' in the Polo Grounds
infield between the Giants and the Cardinals. He sat down in left
field waiting for it to end.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly he saw Pepper Martin, the Cardinal third baseman, come
running out there. ``I thought, `Oh, oh, this doesn't look so
good,' '' Moore recalled by telephone from the retirement home the
other day, his voice stronger than expected. ``I said, `What are
you doin' out here?' And he said, `I'm gonna sit with you. The last
time I got into one of those scraps I got hit in the mouth and
never saw it comin', turned me upside down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Or Moore would recall Carl Hubbell: ``One of the best pitchers
of all time. Give him a one-run lead and that's all he'd need to
win. But don't give him 10 runs because he'd allow 9 and have you
runnin' all over the outfield. But he'd still hold that one-run
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides all-star games, Moore opposed Ruth when the slugger, at
career's end, played briefly for Boston in the National League in
1935. ``He could still hit the ball,'' said Moore, ``but not with
the same regularity. Age can take care of a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   He watches a substantial amount of ball games on television,
particularly those of the closest home team, the Houston Astros,
and, as his son said: ``Daddy's not always real complimentary about
them. He questions their resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think they're in it more for the glory than for
winning,'' said Moore Sr. ``We used to catch those kinda balls in
the outfield, and not pull up short on the first bounce. And we
didn't sit out with any little injury. We didn't dare. Or someone
else would take our job.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were playing today, he said, he believes he'd be making
``three or four million a year.'' Which sounds to be in the ball
park. What does he remember about the World Series he played in?
``The last one I played in'' _ 1937, against the Yankees _ ``I got
nine hits in the five-game series. Tied a record that hasn't been
broken.'' He recalled that in his first Series _ 1933 against
Washington _ he tied another record with two hits in one inning,
and off the same pitcher, Alvin Crowder. ``And he was having a big
year,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from baseball after the 1941 season, he returned
to Gause in central Texas and bought a farm and ranch. ``We spent a
lot of time chasing after cows,'' said his son. ``It was a simple
life and Daddy was happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added birthday treat for Moore, a newly created
organization, the New York Giants Historical Society, founded by
its president, Stuart Leeds, a contributing cartoonist for The New
Yorker, has dedicated the first publication of its newsletter,
``Giants Jottings,'' to Jo-Jo Moore, the oldest living former
Giants player.
</P>
<P>
   And will Moore be doing anything special for his birthday?
``Puttin' on another year on myself,'' said the Gause Ghost. ``One
good thing _ my mind's still good. And that's worth a whole lot.''

EXCLUSIVE: MOYNIHAN COMES OUT AGAINST REMOVING CLINTON FROM OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York made clear
on Thursday that President Clinton should be censured but not
removed from office, warning that the moves to oust Clinton might
threaten to ``very readily destabilize the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out for the first time about possible Senate action,
Moynihan questioned whether the charges were strong enough to merit
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had consulted many of his colleagues and was
increasingly confident that there was support among Democrats and
Republicans to move rapidly to cut short a prolonged impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   His comments will bring a measure of relief to the White House,
where some officials had feared that Moynihan, who has broken with
the president often in the past, might again turn on Clinton. His
seniority, scholarship and independence make him an influential
member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an indispensable nation and we have to protect the
presidency as an institution,'' Moynihan, a Democrat who has been a
fixture of American politics for five decades, said in a telephone
interview from his home here, where he was preparing for a Senate
trial by reading The Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a commander in chief,'' he said. ``You could
very readily destabilize the presidency, move to a randomness.
That's an institution that has to be stable, not in dispute. Absent
that, do not doubt that you could degrade the republic quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   While Moynihan stopped short of saying exactly what form of a
compromise he would endorse, he left no doubt of his support for
censure. Asked if he backed censure, he replied, ``You obviously
can infer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan declined to say whether he thought a censure deal could
avert a full trial in the Senate, and he did not disclose with whom
he has met in the Senate to discuss the matter. He also did not
explain why he believed Clinton's actions did not warrant his
conviction by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Moynihan is known for his strict interpretation of the
Constitution, supporters of a censure compromise had feared that he
might argue that censure had no constitutional basis. He had been
critical early on of Clinton's failure to adequately apologize for
his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his conduct after it became
public. And in a television interview weeks ago, he said that
perjury might be an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is particularly credible because it would be
difficult to portray Moynihan as acting out of concern for his own
electoral prospects; last month, he announced that he would not run
for re-election when his fourth term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was driven by partisan loyalty or by his
concern for the presidency, Moynihan said emphatically, ``It's the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on Thursday, Moynihan expressed great annoyance
that Clinton staged a rally with two busloads of congressional
Democrats on the South Lawn of the White House after the
impeachment vote in the House. He suggested that Clinton had turned
a somber day for the nation into a political spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rally was meant for the president's spirits, that was
just fine,'' Moynihan said. ``If it was meant to influence the
Senate, that's just wrong. We take an oath. Our oath is to the
Constitution, to uphold and defend the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan also invoked his concerns about the Constitution when
asked whether he would support levying a fine on Clinton as part of
a censure arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad, bad, bad!'' he said of the idea. ``Wrong, wrong wrong!''
He explained: ``I'm sure the people who are proposing it are doing
so in perfectly good faith. Impeachment is not about punishment.
The Constitution is very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who think Clinton should pay a fine, he said, ``It
might be dealt with elsewhere. We are not a court.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his belief that a compromise would be reached, Moynihan
said he could not be certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `Do these allegations rise to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors?' '' he asked. ``And we will have to
judge. We will have to make up our minds. The list, high crimes and
misdemeanors, begins with treason, bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he made clear that he was not pleased with how the
House acted in voting to impeach Clinton, Moynihan refrained from
directly criticizing the other chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, they had responsibilities on the House side and they
carried them out in a manner that is not enviable,'' he said. ``No
one would wish that on them. I don't have any animus whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Imploring people to read the Constitution, Moynihan said, ``Pick
up the Constitution. Read it. They came to their judgment. Now it's
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not suggest a timetable, the senator said he hoped
that there would not be a drawn-out trial. He said that even if a
proceeding ran for a month, he did not consider that particularly
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a month in the beginning of a new Congress?'' Moynihan
asked. ``We never do much more than organize, go back home for a
bit and wait for the State of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Republicans would suffer politically from
the party's handling of impeachment matter, Moynihan snapped, ``Oh,
I don't know and I don't care. This is a time to think of the
Constitution.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter A. Zelman, a self-described health policy wonk and a
sometime composer of political-parody ditties, wrote a song about
Jerry Brown, the former California governor, who was running for
president against Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Jerry Brown and he's always a-changin','' Zelman sang,
borrowing, presciently as it turned out, from ``The Times They Are
A-Changin,' '' the Bob Dylan anthem. Last month, in his latest
metamorphosis, Brown was elected mayor of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Zelman, too, is no slouch at switching careers. He went
from consumer activist, battling for adoption of a Canadian-style
health insurance system in the 1970s, to market-based managed-care
advocate in the early 1990s, as a deputy state insurance
commissioner of California and later, an official on the Hillary
Rodham Clinton health policy team.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, after a stint as an author and academic lecturer, he
was appointed president and chief executive of the California
Association of Health Plans, a managed-care lobby, a move that some
former colleagues viewed as defecting to the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing new about the revolving door that spins
government regulatory officials into industry and retreads
prosecutors as criminal-defense lawyers, Zelman's switch created a
special stir in the intense world of health policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad he came over to our side,'' said Charles N.
Kahn III, president of the Health Industry Association of America,
a national trade group that includes several California health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a terrific hire,'' added Karen Ignagni,
president of the American Association of Health Plans, a group of
HMOs and other managed-care companies. ``He's smart, he's
hard-working, and he has a very high degree of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, insurance industry critics took a
harsher tack. ``He's sort of a man without a country,'' said Harvey
Rosenfield, president of the California-based Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which favors tighter government
regulation of HMOs. ``I would rather be dog catcher than represent
the HMOs. He's got a thankless task trying to protect an industry
that is doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelman, who celebrated his 55th birthday last Sunday, was born
in Long Island City, N.Y. He was student body president at the
Little Red Schoolhouse, a private school in Manhattan's Greenwich
Village; graduated from the University of Michigan in 1965; studied
for a year at the London School of Economics, and earned a PhD in
political science from the University of California at Los Angeles.
His doctoral thesis was on the impact of Vietnam War critics on the
United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He let his red hair grow bushy and taught at several California
colleges. In the 1970s, he campaigned for Tom Hayden, the antiwar
protester and a defendant in the Chicago Seven trial, in his
unsuccessful bid to become a United States senator.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 70s to the late 80s, Zelman was executive director
of California Common Cause. At its parties, he handed out ``Flak
Catcher Awards'' to consumer activists who stood firm when attacked
by business lobbyists. He also played the piano and sang ``The F.
and I. Blues,'' his tune that poked fun at bankers on the finance
and insurance committee of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   After helping Rosenfield win voter approval of Proposition 103,
which made insurance commissioner an elective office in California,
Zelman ran for the job. He was defeated by John Garamendi, who
appointed him deputy in charge of consumer affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After two years with Garamendi, he went to Washington in 1993 to
work on the Clinton health plan. Then he worked briefly at a
federal health policy agency, wrote two books and lectured under
the auspices of the Harvard University School of Public Health. He
returned to California last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wanted something more activist, more directly
involved in policy,'' he said. He declined to discuss his new
salary, which is not public information because he is not a
registered lobbyist. Zelman said he learned a lot about health care
economics in Washington, but as the Clinton plan went down to
defeat, he, too, was rejected. ``The political people saw me as a
health policy person,'' he said. ``The health policy people saw me
as a politico.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelman, who still calls himself a ``liberal policy wonk,'' jokes
that his hair has turned ``HMO gray.'' But he says he is working
for consumers at the California Association of Health Plans. ``Most
people might view my new job as a great leap,'' he said. ``But a
lot of people don't understand the economics of health care and the
value that managed care has brought in terms of lower health care
costs, and the potential that it has to improve health care
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry critics bridle at this version of his job description.
Harry Snyder, director of the West Coast office of the Consumers
Union, called Zelman's portrayal of his role ``naive.'' And Beth
Capell, a lobbyist in Sacramento for unions and consumer groups,
labeled a legislative proposal backed by Zelman for giving HMO
members a chance to challenge their treatment ``completely
inadequate and a farce.'' She contended that the HMOs would have
too much influence over the process.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the field took a more nuanced view. Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which supports health
policy research, said Zelman was ``a strong consumer person'' whose
appointment ``signals an industry that knows it has an image
problem.'' Altman added, ``He will probably try and do a little
more than the industry wants and probably not as much as the
consumer groups want.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate pat on the back came from Hayden, the once
fiery left-wing radical who has settled into the political system
as a liberal Democratic state senator from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally's role will be to try to support reforms that the HMOs
can live with,'' Hayden said. ``He won't be able to stop reforms.
He'll be right in the mix of it.''

MICROSOFT WORKERS REMAIN LOYAL AS LAWSUIT CONTINUES

   REDMOND, Wash. _ On the pine-covered campus with its man-made
waterfall, much remains the same at Microsoft's world headquarters.
The sodas are still free. Employees are encouraged to take breaks
by congregating on the many basketball courts or around whimsical
game machines, all part of what is known at Microsoft as the
``Sneakernet,'' the face-to-face contact that company officials say
is vital, even as people here spend much of the day communicating
via computer.
</P>
<P>
   And workers continue to swap stories about the famous ``e-mails
from Bill,'' the messages that can pop up at any hour of the day
from the company's co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates. One
employee in the games group recalls a predawn missive from the
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried out the new version of Monster Truck Madness,''
Gates wrote. ``Here are five things I liked about it and here's
what I think we could do better.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the company embroiled in a critical antitrust case in
the nation's capital, and ceaselessly depicted by federal
prosecutors and competitors as the ruthless bully of the cyber
world, the nearly 15,000 workers here have a rude reminder that the
high-tech behemoth is not necessarily the master of its own fate.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they generally say they remain focused on their own
projects and simply trust that company lawyers will prevail in
court, the case lurks on the Microsoft campus, a large menace that
no one really wants to acknowledge but that can hardly be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 75-year-old neighbor and he keeps telling me, `I feel
so bad for you, because I worked for AT&AMP;T and we went through all
that,''' said Rick Thompson, vice president of the hardware group,
who is in charge of everything from a futuristic remote control for
computers to product development of an interactive children's toy,
referred to at the company as the ``Barney Project,'' as in the big
purple dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson tells his neighbor that the analogy with the breakup of
the telephone company does not hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say, `Oh, Nevada goes to this one, Illinois
will go to this one,''' Thompson said. ``Microsoft is not at all
like that. It's not the way things work. I just don't think it's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case may not be known for years. And in an
industry where technology seems to change at warp speed, many
Microsoft employees seem perplexed when asked about the critics'
contention that the company can flatten its competition or dominate
markets at will.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the view that Gates has expressed repeatedly, they
insist that the company has to run just as scared as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that right now there are three kids in a garage
somewhere coming up with an idea that will make me have to rethink
everything I know about what I'm doing today,'' said Marissa
Martinez, a program manager for a group that makes sure company
products are immune to the year 2000 problem. ``We rely on having
that competition. That's just the way this industry is.''
</P>
<P>
   Though virtually no one here says that the antitrust case has
distracted them from their work at the company, the matter can take
a psychological toll. The company is an American success story and
remains widely admired, but the praise is no longer universal, and
snippets of news coverage include things like this recent testimony
from a government witness: ``Microsoft cannot point a gun to
people's heads, but they can make them an offer they can't
refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear many of the young workers here (the average age of
employees is 34.4) tell it, proffering a Microsoft business card no
longer draws a standard response of ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major bummer,'' said Todd Stevens, a 28-year-old
product manager in the action games group. ``It used to be when I
told people what I did at Microsoft, they'd want to know what game
I was working on. Now it's `What's going on with that trial?'''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens shrugs off criticism of the company, likening it to a
college football team that wins a bunch of national championships.
``You either love Notre Dame or you hate Notre Dame,'' he said with
a laugh. ``Everybody has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, especially those whose job it is to worry about
integrating a range of Microsoft products, the criticism is more
bothersome, especially the argument advanced by Microsoft critics
that the company could easily separate technical features like its
Internet browser from the rest of its software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating when you're trying to do what you think is a
really good thing,'' said Julie Larson, group program manager for a
unit that develops software for designing and managing World Wide
Web pages. ``I think they don't fully understand what customers are
asking for. They want this increased seamlessness between different
applications. This is all driven by what people are asking us
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., of course, government lawyers are arguing
almost the opposite position, that the company has insisted on
knitting its own program for searching the Web and other features
into its Windows software in a relentless bid to control the
market, not to make things more efficient for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As the case unfolds and that issue is debated, many on the
campus are angry that the government is already offering solutions
as radical as dismantling the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this discussion about breaking up the company borders on
the wacky,'' said Brad Smith, an associate general counsel for
Microsoft. ``From our perspective, it's really unfair and
unreasonable that government lawyers are out there touting these
aggressive remedies before Microsoft has even put its first witness
forward in the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company fights its legal case, it is certainly waging the
battle on other fronts as well. ``Microsoft and the freedom to
innovate,'' proclaims its site on the World Wide Web, perhaps
framing the matter a bit one-sidedly, and asking, ``What's your
opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   And Gates, presenting a public image far different from that of
the rapacious baron described by prosecutors, has been out
dispensing grants for libraries and vaccines and talking on ``The
Rosie O'Donnell Show'' last week about the intricacies of potty
training for his 2{-year-old daughter, Jennifer Katharine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right in the middle of that,'' Gates, the world's
richest man, whose wife is pregnant with the couple's second child
(referred to by some employees here as ``Gates Version 2.0''), told
Ms. O'Donnell. ``She watches `Once Upon a Potty.' It's her favorite
video, and `Everybody Poops' is her favorite book. She's getting
the concepts down but she's not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gates has been vilified in some circles, he clearly
remains revered on the company campus. Some people seem more
incensed by the personal attacks on Gates than by the criticism of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know John D. Rockefeller,'' said Kevin Eagan, a
director of business development in the hardware group, referring
to the mogul whose dominance over oil markets at the turn of this
century has invited endless comparisons to Gates' control over
computer software. ``But I do know Bill Gates, and in 30 or 40
years when I tell my kids what it was like to work for Bill Gates,
I'll tell them this was a normal guy who really was incredibly
passionate about technology.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sposato, 31, a lead program manager who has been
designing computer games since he was 13, said: ``I don't get the
feeling he wants to control everything or anything like that. He
cares very much about certain problems and issues in technology,
and he wants to come up with solutions. That's what really drives
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And many other employees described Gates as an accessible leader
who welcomes e-mail and motivates with notes of his own. ``It was
just great to know he tried the game,'' said Jose Pinero, a product
manager, describing Gates' e-mail concerning Monster Truck Madness.
``He cares about what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the dangers posed by the antitrust case, company
officials say it has had no effect on their ability to recruit
workers. Stafford Mays, a senior diversity specialist who travels
around the country in recruiting efforts, including assembling a
force of 700 summer interns, says the matter is ``totally
irrelevant'' as far as young applicants are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't come up,'' Mays said. ``They all want to know
if they can work on the next version of Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   They also ask numerous questions about what Gates is really
like, said Mays, though that is a curiosity that clearly extends
far beyond the circle of prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell people I work for Microsoft,'' said Edie Adams,
hardware usability and ergonomics manager, ``they always want to
know: `Have you ever met Bill Gates? Have you ever been to Bill
Gates' house?''' (Virtually every employee meets Gates; invitations
to his mansion overlooking Lake Washington are a rarer privilege.)
</P>
<P>
   Many people who work here expressed confidence that the company
would win the antitrust case, and several pointed to America
Online's planned $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape Communications
Corp., a deal they say will create a mega-competitor and render the
question of a Microsoft monopoly moot. More broadly, though, they
insist that the company will continue to face fierce competition on
all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they can't imagine anything other than Windows,''
the operating system that drives nearly nine out of every 10
personal computers, said Erik Strommen, a designer of children's
products for the company. ``Well, just blink. That's the way things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees expressed the fear that Microsoft could win the
legal battle but lose the competitive war, its ability to set the
technological pace sapped by the fight in the courtroom. Others,
though, insist they cannot imagine that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to be personally involved'' in the courtroom
battle, said Thompson, the hardware group vice president. ``I'm
able to keep working on great products every day without
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added: ``It bugs me that the perception is out there
that Microsoft is not an innovative company. I think we're an
unbelievably innovative company.''

 Workers' Comp Lags Inflation  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My cousin was injured on the job last year when his
right palm was punctured by an injection molding machine. The
insurance company had him evaluated by a doctor, whose final report
concluded that his hand was permanently disabled by 5.75 percent.
The insurance company offered him total compensation of $2,280 for
his injury. Doesn't my cousin deserve more than this? The doctor
said he is cured, but he still suffers from pain in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  California's workers' comp system was set up decades
ago to provide a relatively easy and straightforward way to
compensate people who have been hurt on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the system does allow thousands of injured workers to get
help without having to face long and costly court battles.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has its arbitrary and bizarre aspects _ some of
which your cousin has discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Your cousin has reached a point where the workers' comp system
considers him ``permanent and stationary.'' That means his injury
has healed as much as it is ever going to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The system then assigns numerical values to particular injuries,
based on how much an injury limits activities like gripping objects
or moving a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Each numerical value _ in your cousin's case, 5.75 percent _
automatically triggers a certain level of compensation that is set
by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Want some gruesome examples? If your thumb is amputated, that's
considered a 16 percent disability and gets you $8,600. If you lose
your arm at the elbow and can't use a prosthesis, that's considered
a 75 percent disability and gets you $108,000.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason your cousin's payment is so low is that since
1984, the Legislature hasn't increased compensation levels for
injuries that leave people with disabilities of less than 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain dollar figures attached to certain injuries,
which sometimes are pathetically small,'' said Julius Young, a
workers' comp attorney with Boxer &AMP; Gerson in Oakland. ``That
$2,280 figure (for a punctured palm) isn't fair, but it's in the
ballpark for what the system says a 5.75 percent injury is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   What recourse does your cousin have? He can try to challenge the
medical opinion that said he was only 5.75 percent disabled. He
might also be able to sue a third party, such as the manufacturer
of the machine that injured him.
</P>
<P>
   Your cousin should talk to an experienced workers' comp
attorney. He can get a referral from his local bar association or
from the California Applicants' Attorneys Association at (800)
648-3132.
</P>
<P>
   He may also want to place a call to his Assembly representative
or state senator _ telling them it's high time they raised
compensation levels to keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Contributions
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company recently instituted a 401(k) savings plan, with
automatic withdrawals from our bimonthly paychecks. How much time
does an employer have to forward our contributions to the
investment firm? We were under the impression that our
contributions would be directly deposited, but this is not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Most employers transfer money to 401(k) accounts
immediately, according to Deene Goodlaw, an attorney with Sigman
Lewis &AMP; Feinberg in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law doesn't actually require firms to transfer
401(k) money at once.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must transfer employee contributions into their 401(k)
accounts ``as soon as practical,'' or within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   They have even longer _ up to 90 days _ to transfer  &LR; employer &LR; 
contributions into workers' 401(k) accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials left such a large window of time so it would
be as easy as possible for employers to offer 401(k) plans. But
that window also creates a potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, there have been a lot of problems with
employers going bankrupt in the interim before employees'
retirement contributions have been deposited,'' Goodlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   If your company is holding onto your 401(k) contributions for a
week or two, there's not much you can do about it. But if the
company is holding onto your money for more than 30 days, you
should file a complaint with the local office of the U.S. Pension
and Welfare Benefits Administration, a division of the Department
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Low Waitress Wages
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work as a waitress in Colorado and earn $2.25 an hour. Is
this legal? Or should I be getting minimum wage?
</P>
<P>
   A: Colorado's minimum wage law is modelled on the federal one,
which allows companies to pay less than minimum wage to employees
who receive tips.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law and Colorado state law say that most employees must
receive a minimum of $5.15 an hour. But waitresses and other tipped
employees can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour, as long as their
base wage and their tips add up to the equivalent of the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, your wages of $2.25 an hour are probably legal.
</P>
<P>
   But here's an interesting note: In some other states like
California, your wages wouldn't be legal.
</P>
<P>
   First off, California's minimum wage is $5.75, higher than the
federal standard. And secondly, California doesn't allow a lower
base wage for tipped employees.
</P>
<P>
   So if you were doing the exact same job in the Golden State,
you'd be bringing home a bit more gold _ $5.75 an hour plus all
your tips.
</P>
<P>

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NBA HAS GONE TO POTTERSVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no George Bailey in this holiday tale, no
central figure who is, spiritually, the richest man in the pro
basketball lockout. There are only those so spoiled by wealth, so
drunk with fame, that they have forgotten to whom they owe their
wonderful life.
</P>
<P>
   The Frank Capra classic is being shown on NBC Friday evening
instead of the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, but if only
there were a tailored remake, an angel to help David Stern and all
his players understand how their careers could have otherwise
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Two angels, in fact, might have co-starred in the role of
Clarence, given a slight variation on the original theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, commissioner, there is no more Christmas Night game,
because, without us, the ratings were never good enough to get it
going,'' Magic Johnson would have said.
</P>
<P>
   And Larry Bird would have informed Michael Jordan that the
United Center doesn't even exist, saying, ``The league never became
important enough, so Jerry Reinsdorf never had the money or the
power to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Johnson's and Bird's grass-roots appeal, I wonder how
globally celebrated Jordan would be, and how brilliant a star-maker
Stern would be, how much the master manipulator David Falk would
be.
</P>
<P>
   Would there have been a National Basketball Association takeover
of U.S.A. Basketball, a Dream Team, a Barcelona Olympics? Would
there have been taxpayer-financed largess for owners, more than $9
million a year for Stern, $100 million payouts to players, and the
resulting windfalls for Falk?
</P>
<P>
   Would teams teetering on the edge of bankruptcy during the early
1980s still be in business? Would there have been hundreds of
ownership millions shared and player jobs created by expansion into
cities like Minneapolis and Vancouver?
</P>
<P>
   Would the players be the out-of-touch lot they have exposed
themselves as these last few months? Would Stern have dared to jet
off to Aspen while his shuttered league burns, and hard-core fans
boil?
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner,'' Bird would drawl in the movie remake, ``you
have no vacation home, because you never made enough money to buy
one. You can't even ski.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The finals never did make network prime time,'' Johnson would
chime in. ``You had to put your championship games on cable, just
like hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson won his first championship with the Los Angeles
Lakers, in 1980, he had one of the sport's greatest individual
performances in the Game 6 title-clincher _ a game shown in the New
York market by CBS on delayed tape because it could not out-rate a
rerun of ``Dallas.'' That's where the NBA was when Johnson and Bird
created an instant rivalry, East versus West, black versus white.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the latter component was exploited, the best of the
NBA transcended color because Johnson and Bird were too good and
too compelling to be cast as one-dimensional props. They were rare,
selfless artists on teams that won. Best of all, they were populist
by nature, eminently likable, the forgotten, crucial element of a
labor war coldly defined by both sides as a battle over $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Without its makeup, today's NBA looks more like Lionel Barrymore
than Jimmy Stewart. The owners and players keep faxing out
proposals, taking out full-page ads, when shockingly few care.
Assuming the Jan. 7 ``drop dead'' date produces a settlement
between Stern and Billy Hunter, who met Wednesday night in Los
Angeles, the public apathy should terrify them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without us, you had no magic,'' Johnson would tell Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had the international air space to fly in,'' Bird would
tell Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Bird didn't invent the NBA, but they surely did
reinvent it, and then Madison Avenue took notice, and the money
poured in, and the players, from Jordan on down, joined Stern in
the grand sellout, of arenas and values.
</P>
<P>
   I recall once asking Stern if he was worried about the
escalating ticket prices. He shrugged and remarked that most NBA
fans watch games at home. Stern had a corporate vision for this
baby, and the players never did complain about that race card,
about an audience growing richer and whiter with each passing year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when they threaten a new ``players' league,'' they talk as
if Patrick Ewing will be commissioner and they won't need
underwriting from some new corporate daddy. Lightheaded from their
rare leverage, the owners make cancellation of the season sound no
more injurious than sending kids to their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, college games crowd the airwaves and fill the breach,
and every time a buzzer sounds, another NBA fan gets his or her
wings, and flies away.

AIR FORCE CALLS PILOT IN COLORADO JET CRASH A SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Colo., Ariz., N.Y.)   (bl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Air Force pilot who flew his attack jet into a
Colorado mountainside last year was in mental turmoil over
``unrequited love'' for a former girlfriend and over his mother's
Christian pacifist faith, a ``psychological autopsy'' by the Air
Force has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials concluded last year, basically for lack of a
better explanation, that the 32-year-old pilot, Capt. Craig Button,
committed suicide when, on April 2, 1997, he broke formation from
his unit instead of proceeding on a training run and then flew it
from southern Arizona to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological report, which was released earlier this
month because of legally enforceable requests made by The Tucson
Citizen under the Freedom of Information Act, was an attempt to
explain why. It was based on interviews with about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also dealt with another mystery of the flight: what
happened to the four 500-pound bombs that were on board the plane
but never found. Loud explosions in northern Arizona and near the
Colorado mountain towns of Telluride and Aspen that were heard by
58 witnesses cited in the report indicate that Button may have
dumped the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's parents, Richard and Joan Button of Massapequa,
N.Y., angrily reject the conclusion that he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pulled that out of a hat: that he must have done it
himself, which I think is a lie,'' said Richard Button, a retired
Air Force lieutenant colonel, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Button, who served in the Air Force during World War II, the
Korean War and the Vietnam War, noted that his son's plane broke
from formation just after it had been refueled in the air. ``There
must have been some kind of air contamination,'' Button said. ``We
think he was disoriented, that he wasn't able to control his
airplane for a period of time. We think that caused the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site, just below the summit of a 13,365-foot-high
granite peak in the Holy Cross Wilderness, investigators did not
recover enough human remains to determine whether Button had
suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. But they did determine
that he was not using drugs or alcohol before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers were able to retrieve about two thirds of the $9
million war plane and much of its ammunition. The bombs, sometimes
called ``tankbusters,'' were never found. After a second search
four months ago, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the area to
hikers, posting warning signs showing what the missing bombs looks
like.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling out an accident caused by loss of consciousness, the
Air Force investigators noted that Button's A-10 Thunderbolt
climbed from its altitude of 6,000 feet during the flight exercise,
and threaded its way through 14,000 foot high peaks. An avid skier,
Button had skied in the Colorado Rockies, had been reprimanded by
the Air Force for often going out of his way to fly over the
Rockies and had talked about one day leaving the Air Force to fly
commercial jets out of Denver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his final flight, Craig Button, a New York City native,
roared over New York Lake at 300 miles an hour, missed Craig
Mountain by two miles and crashed into Gold Dust Peak.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force report, based on interviews with friends, fellow
fliers and relatives, sketches a picture of a ``perfectionist'' who
was inwardly torn by his relationships with his mother and a former
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Before releasing the report, the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations blacked out almost all the names of people
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Two points were not a part of the report. After Button's plane
disappeared, but before its wreckage was found several days later,
rumors circulated widely that he was connected to right-wing
paramilitary groups and had taken the jet and its payload for use
by those organizations. After the wreckage was found, rumors had it
that Button was gay and that torment over military policy on
homosexuality had led him to take his life. But the report as
released did not mention anything about those rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Button, raised as an only child of elderly parents, broke as a
teen-ager with the faith of his parents, who are Jehovah's
Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is a Jehovah's Witness, raised me to think that
joining the military is wrong,'' Craig Button, wrote as a
23-year-old Air Force cadet to a commander.
</P>
<P>
   A classmate from the Reserve Officer Training Corps told an Air
Force investigator that Craig's ``mother would not allow him to
wear his ROTC uniform in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's half-sister, Susane Button, told an Air Force
investigator that his mother wanted him ``to leave the military for
the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Brian Gross, a pilot who shared an apartment with Button at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, near Tucson, Ariz., said that in the
month before the disappearance, Button's ``mother became
increasingly vocal in her negative feelings towards her son's job
and role in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Button was said by many friends to have revered his
father, and his father's half-brother, Lt. Donald Hurlburt.
Hurlburt, a B-17 pilot who flew over Germany in World War II,
crashed in Florida in 1943. Hurlburt Field in Florida is named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks before the crash, Button seemed to some people
to be disillusioned with his life in the military. A former
landlord in Texas recalled to an investigator that in two telephone
conversations prior to his death, the pilot seemed ``out of
character,'' saying that he was ``learning to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Button has declined to be interviewed by reporters about
her son's death. But she talked with Air Force investigators on
April 17, 1997, while her son was still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She advised there were no arguments with her son over religion
during their visit in Tucson,'' the Air Force interviewer wrote,
referring to a weeklong visit by the parents to their son, a visit
which apparently ended amicably one week before his last flight.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, his father said Button had
gotten along well with his mother during the visit and had talked
enthusiastically about a coming transfer to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no arguments between the two,'' said Button's
father. ``There were no flareups, no extreme arguments relating to
any faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Jehovah's Witness
group which arranged the telephone interview with Button, also
provided a statement on their faith and military service:
``Jehovah's Witnesses choose to abide by the principle outlined in
the Bible to `beat their swords into ploughshares.' However, they
do not interfere with or oppose individuals who choose to serve in
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source of turmoil for the young pilot was a ``lost
love'' for a former classmate who had turned down his vague
proposal of marriage three years earlier. By 1996, the captain told
his friends, he had gotten over this Air Force flight instructor.
But around Christmas 1996, the woman, who was coming out of another
relationship, called him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the captain told a friend that he had thrown away her
Christmas card unread, proof, he said, that he had gotten over the
relationship. On Tuesday, April 1, 1997, Button broke a three-month
silence and called the woman. She was in a work meeting but took
down his new telephone number and said she would call him back.
Just the day before, Button bought a videocassette recorder and a
videotape of ``Bridges of Madison County,'' one of his favorite
movies. That evening, while the phone never rang, he watched the
movie, about a doomed love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the crash, the woman, unaware of it, tried to
call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dramatic example of a man who seems to have
everything going for him in his life, yet cannot have the woman he
loves passionately,'' the Air Force report concludes. Referring to
the male lead in the movie, it added, ``Did Craig Button see
himself in this Clint Eastwood role?''

WHY WALL STREET IS LOSING OUT TO 40 ACRES AND A MODEM  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich., Wyo., R.I.)  (af) 
 By JOEL KOTKIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ While his investment-banking peers brave
crowded airports and pack into jets bound for long-awaited ski
vacations, Saeed Abtahi isn't planning to do anything but walk out
his front door. He doesn't have to: He lives here in the Wasatch
Mountains _ at an elevation of almost 8,000 feet _ with ski slopes
all around him.
</P>
<P>
   When, after 10 years at Bankers Trust in New York and London,
Abtahi decided to strike out on his own in 1996, he couldn't think
of a good reason for living or working in a big city, or even a
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his 11-person investment firm, Hunter Capital Group,
has arranged $1.3 billion in private financings out of a low-rise
office building in this ski resort of 12,000 people, a former
mining town an hour's drive from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   With modern computer and communications technology, investment
bankers like Abtahi are finding that they can do business
successfully from almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a modem country now,'' Abtahi said. ``This allows for a
movement _ maybe 10 to 15 percent of the high-end people _ to
operate anywhere they want, including places like Park City.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend could have ominous implications for major financial
centers. As manufacturers and financial back-office operations have
deserted central cities, scholars like Saskia Sassen of Columbia
University and many urban planners have maintained that urban core
regions can still thrive by dominating so-called producer services
like investment banking, money management and financial consulting.
</P>
<P>
   But the digitization of financial services _ Abtahi's ``modem
nation'' _ threatens even that dynamic. Already, more than
two-thirds of the leading on-line brokerage firms are based away
from New York City, in places like New Jersey, California or
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, according to David Krell, chief executive of the
International Securities Exchange, the very idea of the trading
floor and centralized financial markets will become as obsolete as
vacuum tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide the information, the order flow of a
traditional market, but with the efficiency of an electronic
marketplace,'' said Krell, whose firm, based in New York, is
developing a screen-based options trading system that it hopes to
put in service in January 2000. ``Our market-makers don't have to
be in New York, San Francisco, Chicago or Philadelphia _ they can
be in Sun Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   With anywhere to choose from, many of the new breed of rural
financiers are attracted to Jackson Hole, Wyo. The sprawling town,
with a year-round population of just 6,400, is home to at least two
important financial market players: the Brandywine mutual funds and
the Data Broadcasting Corp., which supplies financial and market
information to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandywine funds, with more than $5 billion in assets, are
run by Freiss Associates and the fund manager Foster S. Freiss from
a two-story log cabin-style office building.
</P>
<P>
   Data Broadcasting, with 760 employees scattered around New York,
California and Utah, is managed from the outskirts of Jackson Hole
by two other Wall Street players, Allan R. Tessler and Alan J.
Hirschfield, who was once a top executive with the Wall Street firm
of Allen &AMP; Co. and is a former president of 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's driving growth in places like this is not only
technology, but the fact that people can now get both quality of
life and do their business,'' Hirschfield said. ``It's creating a
new exodus from urban areas, particularly among younger married
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, places like Jackson Hole; Santa Fe, N.M.; the Colorado
Rockies, and the New England coast are prime magnets for affluent
baby boomers, according to William H. Frey, a demographer at the
Population Studies Center of the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   They are migrating in large-enough numbers to make places like
Aspen and Snowmass among the most expensive in the nation, with
median home prices often higher than in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these refugees are like Richard Jaycobs, who postponed
having children until his late 30s and now is based on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big generational thing playing out now,'' said
Jaycobs, formerly a fund manager with the Computer Trading Corp.,
who grew up in Brooklyn but moved to Nantucket three years ago, at
the age of 36. ``I see people my age _ this is really about raising
children _ and they don't want to stay in the city or do the long
commutes,'' he said. ``They have the contacts enough that they can
make the life style choices.''
</P>
<P>
   His new financial risk-management consulting firm, Acknowledge
Systems, is based in Nantucket, though it still has a presence in
New York. After all, some of the young finance experts and
programmers it employs are not quite ready to settle down in a
sleepy New England village. But as these people age and contemplate
having families, Jaycobs believes, they will become more amenable
to moving to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Urban cores, of course, still possess important advantages,
notably elite business schools, unique agglomerations of
specialized service providers and an exciting cultural environment
that remains attractive to many young, skilled people. But their
hold on the nation's financial elite is no longer unchallenged and
may well fade.
</P>
<P>
   Abtahi, for one, is counting on it. He wants to entice three or
four more Wall Street investment bankers up to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone complains about worrying about getting laid off, so
it's easy to recruit,'' he said. ``People who come here, they all
have this incredible reaction: This is a great way to live.''

FOR '99, NO LIMIT TO EXCITEMENT IN GOLF 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The past year in golf was intriguing because of what happened,
and because of who made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected Mark O'Meara or Se Ri Pak to win two majors.
Even people who did not care about golf found themselves caring
about Casey Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 17-year-old named Justin Rose became the darling of the
British Open. When an amateur named Matt Kuchar smiled his way
through the Masters and the U.S. Open, fans smiled back.
</P>
<P>
   Look for more unexpected and compelling moments between the
first tee shot and the final putt of 1999. Three international
events making up the new World Golf Championship _ each offering a
$5 million purse and a $1 million first-place check _ will bring
together the world's best players more often.
</P>
<P>
   The first WGC tournament, the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship in February, will feature the world's 64 top-ranked
players.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of seeing head-to-head matches such as Tiger
Woods versus Ernie Els; Justin Leonard versus David Duval, or Greg
Norman versus Colin Montgomerie should provide attractive theater.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative new events, coupled with the growing purses in
other tournaments, will allow the rich to get richer. Twenty-six
golfers on the PGA Tour earned more than $1 million last year. Glen
Day, Scott Hoch, and Scott Verplank all won more than $1.2 million
without winning a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, with prize money even higher, the number of
millionaires will undoubtedly increase. But it could create a class
system of tournaments, possibly inducing star players to skip
lesser events and focus on the big-money events instead.
</P>
<P>
   Individual story lines will also make 1999 interesting. Norman,
back from shoulder surgery last spring, will write the next chapter
of a career that has been successful, heartbreaking, but never
boring. Woods begins 1999 as the world's No. 1-ranked player, but
his mystique has been diminished. Eight golfers won more often on
the PGA Tour in 1998 than did Woods, whose lone victory in America
came at the BellSouth Classic in April.
</P>
<P>
   Woods carries enormous expectations after brilliantly winning
three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles, then dominating during his
first nine months after turning professional.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is so good, people forget Woods is so young; he turns
23 next Wednesday. While he lost his flair for the dramatic last
year, Woods became a more consistent player, leading the tour in
top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains to be seen if Woods will clearly separate himself
from other top players in his generation. Duval, Leonard, Els, Jim
Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood have all yet to turn 30
years old. O'Meara, Montgomerie, Davis Love 3d and Vijay Singh are
in their primes.
</P>
<P>
   That formidable group will make it difficult for Woods, or for
any player, to dominate like Jack Nicklaus, who won 18 majors
during his career. So while, Woods does not hide his desire for
greatness, to approach Nicklaus' record in majors presents Woods
with a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods looking to win his first major since his memorable
1997 Masters victory, and Duval, Mickelson and Montgomerie looking
to win their first majors at all, each of the four majors will be
much-anticipated as always.
</P>
<P>
   When the players arrive for the Masters in April, they will see
a different Augusta National. The second and 17th holes have been
lengthened, clusters of trees have been added to tighten the 15th
and 17th fairways, and the 11th green has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 1999 U.S. Open will be held at Pinehurst (N.C)
Course No. 2 for the first time. The British Open will be held at
Carnoustie Golf Course in Scotland, where Tom Watson won his first
British Open title in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship will be held at Medinah (Ill.) Country
Club, where Hale Irwin won his third United States Open title in
1990. The Ryder Cup, the biennial pressure cooker won by Europe in
1995 and 1997, will be held at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour had one of its
most exciting seasons in 1998, topped by the United States Women's
Open, which may have been the year's best overall tournament. Pak
won a 20-hole Monday playoff over the 20-year-old amateur Jenny
Chuasiriporn, who forced the playoff by making an incredible
50-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who is just 21 years old, has the potential to be the
LPGA's biggest attraction since Nancy Lopez. Meanwhile, Annika
Sorenstam, who became the first LPGA player to end the year with a
scoring average under 70, leads a young group of under-30 players
like Pak, Karrie Webb, Brandie Burton and Pat Hurst who give the
LPGA a solid foundation to build on. More talent is on the way,
with Chuasiriporn and Grace Park, the 19-year-old U.S. Amateur
champion, turning pro in the not-to-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   The big question on the Senior Tour concerns whether anyone will
challenge the supremacy of Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan. In the last
two years, Irwin has won an incredible 16 senior events, while
Morgan has won 12. Give them both credit, particularly Irwin, for
playing superb golf. But the Senior Tour needs a shot of variety.
Tom Watson, Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins all turn 50 years old in
1999, so the Senior Tour has a potential influx of new
attention-getters on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But as 1999 prepares to start, 1998 proved that a year in golf
can take more interesting turns than a 40-foot putt at Augusta.
There will be drives that sail out of bounds and putts that lip
out, but at least there will not be a lockout. For that, golfers
can be thankful.

VIRGINIA GRAHAM, 86, PIONEERING TALK SHOW HOST DIES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT 
(ATTN: Ill.)   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Virginia Graham, who went from writing radio soap
operas in the 1940s to becoming one of the most successful and
enduring of the early television talk show hosts, died on Tuesday
in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of New York Hospital in
Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1950s when she succeeded Margaret Truman as
hostess of NBC Radio's ``Weekday'' series, in which she was teamed
with Mike Wallace, she quickly became known for her spontaneity,
irreverence and her ability to get good interviews from those who
appeared on her shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first second I went on the air, I have been easy to
communicate with,'' she said in 1965. For two decades, she presided
over a series of television talk shows, among them ``Food for
Thought'' from 1956 to 1961; ``Girl Talk'' (1963-69); and ``The
Virginia Graham Show''(1970-72).
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl Talk'' was enormously successful and in its heyday it
drew an average audience of 2 million who tuned in five days a week
to watch Miss Graham interview the most celebrated women of the
day, including Olivia De Havilland, Pearl S. Buck, Gloria Swanson,
Louise Rainer, Ilka Chase, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Marian Javits,
Hermione Gingold, Barbara Walters, Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers.
Miss Graham thought of the show as the ``20th-century time
capsule'' and as the cornerstone of ``Women's Glib.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, she was seen frequently on Jack
Paar's ``Tonight'' show, and occasionally served as a substitute
host on `Strike It Rich'' and ``The Big Payoff.'' She also appeared
on the ``Roseanne,'' ``Rosie O'Donnell'' and ``Tom Snyder'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   She was also active in charity work, raising many millions for
the American Cancer Society (she survived cervical cancer in the
1950s and spoke of it widely and often) as well as the foundations
set up to research cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and kidney
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Graham's husband, Harry Guttenberg, who ran a well-known
theatrical costume company, died of kidney disease in 1980. She
wrote about her experience in ``Life After Harry: My Adventures in
Widowhood,'' which became a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Graham was born on July 4, 1912, in Chicago, the daughter
of David S. Komiss, a women's clothier, and the former Bessie J.
Feiges. Her grandfather was Joseph Ben Benjamin, a rabbi at
Chicago's Temple Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   She attended the University of Chicago, where she majored in
anthropology and received a Phi Beta Kappa key. She then studied
journalism at Northwestern University, and received a master's
degree.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, she worked first as a photographer's
model and in 1934 did some fashion reporting for radio station WBBM
in Chicago. In the 1930s she wrote scripts for commercials that
were used on WMCA, a New York radio station.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, she contributed scripts for such radio soaps
as ``Stella Dallas,'' ``Our Gal Sunday'' and ``Backstage Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her work in television, she appeared on the
stage, including a Chicago production of Neil Simon's ``Barefoot in
the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote several books, the last of which, ``I Love Antiques
but I Don't Want to Be One,'' is scheduled to be published next
fall by Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Graham is survived by a daughter, Lynn Bohrer, and a
granddaughter, Jan, both of New York; and a grandson, Stephen, of
Singapore.

PERSONAL BUSINESS DIARY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DANIEL M. GOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOSE BLUE M&AMP;Ms WERE JUST THE BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   As we hurtle headlong into a new year and draw that much closer
to a new millennium, it's probably better if we don't all clash.
</P>
<P>
   The Color Marketing Group, an international association of 1,500
color designers from all manner of consumer and commercial
industries, expects that the hottest colors in consumer products
this year will be shades of blue _ blue moon, blue planet and
Cancun Blue, to be exact _ partly because of a rising demand for
nature-based colors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the group's news release, ``cooler, lighter product
colors'' reflect ``the positive attitudes generated by the strong
U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other feel-good hues in 1999 include Apache red, which the group
called ``very centered''; sea grass yellow, ``a complex color that
can act as a neutral, a new yellow or a new green''; toffee brown,
and ``par four'' green.
</P>
<P>
   These colors should already be showing up in product lines, a
result of the group's forecasts in 1997. Indeed, 1999 is already
old news for the group, which has committees analyzing the dominant
themes for 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, for example, the natural-colors trend will veer a bit
toward what the group calls ``ethnic and cultural blending,''
reflecting globalization in general and, in particular, the Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Colors projected for 2000 include
neutrals like ``biscotti'' and ``wasabi'' _ which the group
describes as a ``hue from Asia, where foliage is more yellow than
in North America and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   THE BOSS MAY FEEL YOUR PAIN
</P>
<P>
   Leaner? Meaner? Even as mergers and acquisitions make layoffs a
permanent part of the business landscape, a new survey of corporate
America suggests that management has reversed its attitude about
the notion that companies have a responsibility to improve the
lives of their employees _ both on the job and off.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 86 private and publicly held companies by
Rewards Plus of America, a benefits company based in Baltimore, 91
percent of the managers agreed that their companies felt
responsible for bettering the lives of their employees. As little
as five years ago, Rewards Plus said, most of the same companies
promoted the idea that workers were responsible for their own
careers and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive pressure seems to be driving the reversal, with 47
percent of those surveyed acknowledging that they had changed their
attitudes to keep up with their rivals in recruiting and retaining
employees. And how might these newly sensitized companies improve
their workers' lives? One way is with extra benefits like free life
and home insurance _ perks, by the way, that Rewards Plus offers.

EMILIO MIGNONE, 76, ARGENTINE RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emilio Fermin Mignone, who became a leading campaigner for human
rights in Argentina after his daughter was among the thousands who
disappeared in the military regime's ``Dirty War'' two decades ago,
died of cancer on Monday in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   As founder and director of the Center for Legal and Social
Studies, Mignone was regarded as Argentina's best-known campaigner
for human rights, particularly from 1976 to 1983, when the country
was under military rule.
</P>
<P>
   His organization, one of several rights groups, specialized in
documenting kidnappings, murders and torture by the military and
trying to file legal actions to establish accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Mignone had a distinguished career before the military took
power in 1976. A lawyer, he had worked for the Justice Ministry in
the '50s and spent the early '60s in Washington as an official of
the Organization of American States, specializing in educational
policy.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Argentina, where he was founding rector of a new
university in Lujan. By 1976 he had retired and was writing
textbooks about civic education.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, on a May morning at 5 o'clock, a group of armed
men entered the family's house and arrested Mignone's daughter
Monica, 24, the third of his five children.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend, Juan Mendez, now director of the Inter-American
Institute of Human Rights in San Jose, Costa Rica, said Mignone
painfully recalled how he had told his daughter to go with the men,
who showed army identification, saying he would seek her release in
court.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the scale of disappearances was not widely known,
and Mignone, a devout Roman Catholic and a Peronist, had faith in
due process.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw his daughter again. She had been active in a
volunteer group of Catholics who were working among the slum
dwellers of Buenos Aires. Mignone and his wife, Angelica, spent
weeks approaching courts and ministries and met high military
officials. Despite writs of habeas corpus, they learned nothing of
the young woman's whereabouts or fate.
</P>
<P>
   They contacted church officials, and again they felt spurned.
Years later Mignone wrote ``Dictatorship and Church,'' in which he
criticized the inaction of the church in Argentina in that period.
</P>
<P>
   He became a leader of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights,
an umbrella organization formed shortly before the military seized
power. Realizing that a more narrowly focused organization was
needed to gather documentation and offer legal help, he founded the
Center for Legal and Social Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Government opponents were pursuing varied strategies. Mrs.
Mignone became a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a
group of parents of ``the disappeared'' who held vigils near the
Presidential Palace while holding up posters with the names of
their missing children. Other groups sought to generate protest by
uniting religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   Mignone's center compiled records on the missing and the
tortured that were essential when, after the restoration of
democratic civilian rule, a commission established that 11,000
people had disappeared and been killed and that at least an
additional 10,000 had been kidnapped and detained for long periods.
The center also located mass graves where the remains of some of
the disappeared were found.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the military was in power, Mignone's center filed
suits to determine accountability. In a complex class action known
as the Perez de Smith cases, Mignone on four occasions persuaded
the Supreme Court that the government that had appointed them
needed to acknowledge the fact of the disappearances and to account
for specific circumstances raised by the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was having clandestine military units' ordering, by
radio, police patrols to withdraw from regions, ceding ``free
areas'' to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said another of Mignone's contributions was forging links
with foreign governments and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He traveled a great deal and he kept the question of
Argentina's military rule before the international community,''
said Mendez, who was born in Argentina. ``Whenever foreign figures
came, they would visit him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1981, two weeks after Mignone had returned from
Geneva, where he had testified about the disappearances to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, he and five other directors of the center
were arrested, and the offices were raided. An international outcry
followed, and all six were released in a week.
</P>
<P>
   With the restoration of elected civilian government, the Center
for Legal and Social Studies remained functioning to monitor and
report on civil rights and abuse of power. Mignone returned to his
interest in civic education and prepared a three-year high school
curriculum that linked themes like the history of military
governments, the democratic way of life and the breakdown of
institutional order.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion he spoke out in protest, as he did in January, when
he joined demonstrators who opposed government plans to raze the
Navy Mechanics School, where many of the disappeared had been
killed. He appealed to President Carlos Saul Menem, who in the name
of reconciliation wanted the complex destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call for national unity, a sort of pacification, in
a place where at least 4,000 Argentines have been murdered and
tortured by the Navy,'' Mignon said.
</P>
<P>
   By that time he had learned that the people who had taken away
his daughter were from a Navy unit, but he did not mention it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, surviving are two daughters, Isabel del
Carril of Washington and Mercedes, of Buenos Aires; and two sons,
Fernando, of Rome, and Javier, of Edmonton, Alberta.

AUTOS ON FRIDAY: INTERNATIONAL TOYOTA SEEKS A COZY SPOT IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM DIEM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Recessions are chilling Japan and much of the developing
world, but it's springtime in Europe for Toyota Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has invested heavily here in this decade, and its
planning is about to pay off. When European Union quotas on
Japanese imports end in 12 months, Toyota will be ready with new
models, expanded factories, more dealers and its high-margin Lexus
luxury brand.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, Toyota is No. 3, after General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. Its weakest region has been Western Europe, where it had
less than 3 percent of the market in 1997. But this year it passed
Nissan to become the biggest Japanese auto company in Europe, and
by 2005 it plans to nearly double European sales to 800,000 units.
That will make it bigger in Europe than Citroen and nearly as large
as the BMW Group, including Rover.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Toyota started construction of a second European
factory, near Valenciennes, France. Starting in 2001, Toyota will
build 100,000 units of a new small car, the Yaris, there. The Yaris
will compete head-on in France with other ``city cars'' like the
Renault Clio, Peugeot 106 and Citroen Saxo.
</P>
<P>
   A step up, in the popular European segment where cars like the
Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus compete, Toyota is selling more
Corollas. In September, Toyota started building Corollas on a
second assembly line at its factory in Derby, England. Last year,
Toyota made 115,000 cars in Britain; in 2001, it will be capable of
building 220,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects support the added assembly capacity. In
September, Toyota began expanding its Welsh engine plant, where
capacity will rise to 400,000 units in 2001, from 100,000 today.
Toyota developed the Yaris at its European design center in
Brussels; in July, it said it would move to a new design center, on
the Cote d'Azur of France, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company established Toyota Motor Europe
Manufacturing in Brussels to coordinate purchasing and logistics
for the French and British plants. The employees are moving into a
building there used as the corporate headquarters for Toyota Motor
Manufacturing and Engineering, which is familiarly known as Toyota
Motor Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Toyota opened Le Rendez-Vous, a $5.4 million
showroom on the Champs Elysees in Paris where browsers can receive
information about Toyotas but not actually buy a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get direct information from customers'' at the
showroom, Tatsuo Takahashi, president and chief executive of Toyota
Motor Europe, said in a recent interview. ``And it has some kind of
symbolic meaning. Toyota is on the Main Street of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Another symbol was the recent quiet announcement that the
company would start offering the Toyota Century, a V12-powered
limousine that rivals Rolls-Royce, outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota said that only 10 to 20 of the cars would be sold in
Europe annually, but the Century will put the company in the
premium luxury class where BMW, DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen all
plan to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus brand will bring higher volumes of luxury cars. Last
year, Toyota dealers with Lexus franchises sold 8,200 of the LS 400
and GS 300 models. Next year, when a third model _ the IS 200 _
will be available, Lexus will become a second distinct brand in
Europe, with separate showrooms as it has in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, we'll sell 10,000 in Europe,'' said Juan Jose Diaz
Ruiz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Europe and its
highest ranking non-Japanese executive on the Continent. ``Long
term, we'll sell 25,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The IS 200 was designed to compete against the BMW 3-Series, the
Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the Audi A4. Toyota says it has not
decided whether it will sell the car in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The IS 200 is the key for Lexus, Diaz Ruiz said. ``We will be
able to enhance the range, build an exclusive dealer organization,
and build awareness and interest in the Lexus brand,'' he said.
``Our goal for 2005 is 800,000 sales, of which 50,000 are Lexus.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Japanese carmakers are also assaulting the European
market. For example, Honda will introduce four new models next
year. In France, it plans to add 45 dealers by 2000, for a total of
180, and increase sales in that period by 36 percent, to 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi expects its European sales to grow 18 percent by
2000, to 330,000, and Nissan will introduce 16 cars here in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on Japanese car sales are to end as the year 2000
starts. Japanese auto imports were once restricted by the
governments of Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, European Union politics resulted in a Europe-wide
``gentleman's agreement'' with the Japanese that limits their
imports into Europe in total, and into those five countries
specifically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for example, the quota in Europe is 1,167,000 imported
Japanese vehicles; the limit in France is 111,100. The total
European market is about 15.2 million units.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese responded to the quotas by building assembly plants
in Europe, learning the markets, setting up design studios and
engineering centers, and generally preparing for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   No Japanese maker has been more thorough in its planning than
Toyota, which has increased employment at its Brussels headquarters
to 760, from 140 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota's way is to make an effort and step-by-step grow,''
Takahashi said. ``Toyota has about 3 percent of Europe's market.
Our goal is achieving 4 percent of the market. The next goal is 5
percent. For imported cars, that is a big market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota had 2.8 percent of the European market in 1997, 7.8
percent of North America and 29.6 percent of Japan. It will be
impossible to get 10 percent in Europe, Diaz Ruiz said, because
there are many European makers with home markets to rely on.
Despite the end of quotas, European makers like Fiat, Volkswagen
and Renault ``will continue to be heavily supported by the culture
of Europe,'' Diaz Ruiz said. ``About 30 percent of the market is
captive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diaz Ruiz did note that Toyota was the market leader in
Ireland and Greece, two countries with no local automakers and no
history of restrictions on Japanese imports.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has the money to finance its ambitions, in Europe and
elsewhere. This year, it opened its third plant in the United
States, in Princeton, Ind., and its second in Brazil. Besides the
plant in France, it has one under construction in India. &QL;

THE JOB TO FORGET  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. After taking night courses in business and finance over the
last three years, I have moved from office support to management
and now work at an entertainment services company. My resume shows
that I'm not one to hop from place to place, yet after just four
months at my new employer, I'm deeply unhappy and want to move on.
How do I explain my desire to leave so soon?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't torture yourself over one bad decision. And don't
bother trying to concoct a complicated cover story for why you want
to flee after such a short time. It's time to face your mistake,
admit it and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell your employer that you were mistaken as to what
being in the job would be like and that you now see that it's not a
good fit for your talents,'' said Edward Emde, chief executive of
Blessing/White, a consulting firm in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Take responsibility for your mistake, agreed Marti D. Smye,
author of ``Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus?''
(Macmillan, 1998). ``Often people blame the organization, instead
of saying, `I didn't do a good assessment for myself,' '' she
observed.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how miserable you are, don't just drop your two weeks'
notice on the boss's desk. Express your regret over any problems
your departure may cause and offer to stay long enough to help find
a replacement, Ms. Smye advised. Promise to make your successor's
transition as painless as possible. ``How you leave is more
important than staying in a job you don't like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, before breaking the news to your employer, you should
determine exactly what the problem is. Do you hate the bureaucratic
nature of the company? Or its unstructured work style? Or do you
dislike being in charge? Your boss will want to know why you are
leaving, and you should be prepared to offer a more thoughtful
explanation than simply, ``I'm unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, in seeking other jobs, you will need to
articulate how they will suit you better than your last position,
Emde said. That can assure hiring managers that you've learned from
your mistake and are now far less likely to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you're being straightforward, however, don't forget
the first law of job-hunting: Accentuate the positive. Don't
emphasize your recent career fiasco when calling on prospective
employers, advised Tom Jackson, author of ``Guerrilla Tactics in
the New Job Market'' (Bantam, 1991).
</P>
<P>
   Four months wasn't really enough time to get settled, so you
might not even want to update your resume to include your last job,
he said. You need to be honest, however, so mention in your cover
letter that the job hasn't proved a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   And in all correspondence, he said, focus less on your last
position and more on the type of environment where you think you'd
be most productive. ``Put forward what it is you want and what you
can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure you know what that is. Your next employer is
likely to be much less understanding if, come spring, you decide
you've made another horrible mistake.

<P>
   When Lea Cloud, 29, a project architect, opened the door to a
trailer on a remote college campus in western New York, she was
confronted by a table full of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really intimidated,'' Ms. Cloud said. The trailer was
the construction headquarters for a major addition to a library,
and she was in charge. ``I was afraid they were going to ask me
something I didn't know the answer to,'' she recalled, ``and they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But she got through the experience, and the renovation to the
Reed Library at the State University of New York at Fredonia won an
award from the American Institute of Architects in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is part of an anomaly, a small group of women changing
the face of architecture, a profession long dominated by men. In
1995, she and Victoria Rospond, a classmate at the Rhode Island
School of Design, started CR Studio.
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute, women own only 7 percent of the
15,000 member firms; 18 percent of all architects are women,
compared with 26 percent of physicians and 27 percent of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   No woman has the name recognition of Frank Gehry, Richard Meier
or I.M. Pei. Only Maya Lin comes close, but many regard her as more
a sculptor than an architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about architecture is that unless you win a
competition, the process of getting larger and larger commissions
is very slow,'' said Charles Gwathmey of Gwathmey Siegel &AMP;
Associates of New York. ``Architects my age have proven themselves.
We've been working 40 years. Unfortunately for women, this group
today are the pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been progress. In 1997, the institute said, 31 percent
of the graduates of architecture schools were women, up from 25
percent 12 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Women agree that the prospects are looking up. ``I think that
now it's easier to be a woman architect than in any other period,''
said Frances Halsband, principal of her own firm in New York. One
reason is that architects are often chosen on the basis of design
competitions, where the work, not the sex of its creator, is
all-important. And some clients are trying hard to hire more women,
Ms. Halsband said.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Fisher, a clothing designer who commissioned CR Studio
for a showroom on Seventh Avenue in the garment district and a
store on West Broadway in SoHo, said of Ms. Cloud and Ms. Rospond:
``They were young and talented. I liked that they were women. I
felt that they understood what I was trying to do. They understood
my sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The store on West Broadway _ with its minimalist design and
public garden for use by shoppers and area residents _ won CR
Studio its latest coup, a 1998 Architecture Design Citation from
the New York chapter of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Rhode Island school, Ms. Cloud spent
13 years with Pasanella, Klein, Stolzman &AMP; Berg Architects in New
York, becoming an associate within five years. But she wanted to
become a partner, and when that didn't happen, she decided to join
Ms. Rospond, who had opened her own office in 1991 after working
six years for a New Jersey developer, designing and detailing
large-scale office buildings and doing site planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up in the era we grew up in, and both of us
having fathers who had their own businesses, we knew and understood
the risks of starting our own business,'' Ms. Cloud said. Still,
she revels in controlling her own projects, instead of being a name
on the list of architects at a big firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all ours,'' she said. ``If we did it right, it's because
we did it right. It's our accomplishment. And if we did it wrong,
it's because we did it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they have started modestly. An institute citation
won by Ms. Rospond in 1995, for the Takashimaya Tea Box Cafe at 693
Fifth Avenue, hangs next to a postcard on a partition in the office
they share with another architect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Rospond is concerned with gaining recognition. ``I
want to be in the show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, their show is getting good reviews. Bill Swinson,
director of the Millburn (N.J.) Free Public Library, where CR
Studio was picked to design a $2 million renovation, said, ``We
looked seriously at five applicant organizations'' before choosing
CR Studio, the only one owned by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though CR Studio didn't have the length of experience as
the others,'' he said, ``the building committee was really taken
with their approach to the esthetics, work flow and traffic flow.''
</P>
<P>
   CR Studio's latest project is the renovation of the Frederick H.
Leonhardt People's Center at the Museum of Natural History in New
York, which is a place for lectures, films and performances that
try to attract people who may not be typical museum visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking to get your typical architectural firm,''
said Teddy Yoshikami, the museum's manager of multicultural
programs. ``It was unusual that they were women.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the pair are not eager to stay anomalies. They strongly
encourage other women to start their own architectural firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out there and do it,'' Ms. Rospond said. ``There aren't
enough women in architecture who are in the position of being the
boss.''

SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HANGING ON  
(FOR RELEASE SUN., DEC. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market has been so volatile, so scary, this year that
you'd think it would have tossed off investors the way a dog shakes
off water after a bath.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the market took a huge dip last year, and right
around the time investors were really panicking, it came back, only
to retreat this past August and then roar back again.
</P>
<P>
   Although stocks shot up last week, their erratic behavior has
created a nervousness among investors that could have a lasting
effect on the market. An economist told me recently that he
believed the next time the market corrected, many investors would
get out and stay out.
</P>
<P>
   Some professional investment strategists are even questioning
the buy-and-hold strategy popularized by Warren E. Buffett _ buying
stocks in well-run companies and hanging on _ saying it may be time
to scale back on equities and load up on Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, baby boomers have generally stayed put. But signs are
multiplying that many of us are having second thoughts. We are
coming to realize that our huge market gains have more to do with
sheer luck than our own brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   We became cocky because just about any stock we bought went up.
Buy, buy, buy and hold turned out to be a successful strategy, but
how high did our SAT's have to be to figure that out? Sure, boomers
lived through the crash of 1987, but that turned out to be a juicy
buying opportunity for those with some market savvy. I made a good
move by stocking up on the Coca-Cola Co. two days after the crash.
Then again, I also bought Toys ``R'' Us. Altogether, not much of a
track record.
</P>
<P>
   One clue to how investors will react next year is their current
behavior, and statistics from the Investment Company Institute show
skittishness. Before last August's plunge, investors were pouring a
net average of $21 billion a month into stock mutual funds; they
yanked out $11.7 billion in August and then tiptoed back in with
net inflows of $6.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in
September and October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another clue is to listen to the talk around the pool. Many
members of the Westminster Whales Masters Swim Team, an adult swim
team in Atlanta, watch the market closely. In the last year, as the
market danced around, they made some moves. But the message I get
from them is that while they are still tinkering with their
portfolios, they are doing so with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not smart enough to pick the peaks and valleys,'' said
Walter Gillikin, 39, a team member and a senior vice president at
Wachovia Bank. ``There's plenty of smart people who can't even do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when stocks fell this year, Gillikin, the father of twin
11-month-old boys, remembered the buying opportunities of 1987. So
this time he shifted some investments, selling some stocks and
funds to buy stock in Tellabs and Medtronic and put more money into
a stock index fund. Altogether, he moved about $35,000 around.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the swim team, Deborah Maslia, 37, is single
and a health care consultant for Ernst &AMP; Young. When the market
fell last year, she adjusted the contributions she was making into
her 401(k) plan, lowering the portion going into an overseas stock
fund and putting more into a domestic stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money I put in is money I could lose and be O.K.,'' she
said. ``For that reason, I haven't really changed my strategy. I
don't get in it for quick gains.''
</P>
<P>
   When the market fell in August, she just watched. ``I had the
willies,'' she said. ``I didn't know if I had the nerve to jump in
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting two children through college has made Mary Pat Mayer, a
46-year-old single mother, very conservative. To cut costs, she
refinanced her home and cut back her contributions to her
Individual Retirement Account. She has also taken out a home-equity
line of credit to help with college costs.
</P>
<P>
   But after the market fell in August, she sensed an opportunity
and asked her broker what to do. Buy, he said, so she sold shares
in a couple of mutual funds and bought stock in Worldcom, now MCI
Worldcom, and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be poor when I retire,'' she said. ``I want to
believe the people who say, `Buy it and hang in there.' That's the
kind of investor I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The common thread is this: As many people did in '87, these
investors are looking at market dips as opportunities to pick up
bargains _ but they are not putting new money into the market
beyond what they were planning to invest in retirement plans. They
are continuing payroll deductions for those plans and rejiggering
the portfolio mix. It is as though they have seen the darkness and
didn't like it much.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maslia's willies have not gone away, and she plans to be
even more careful next year. ``I'll be more watchful because of
what happened this year,'' she said. ``Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.''

JOSEPH ESHERICK, SAN FRANCISCO ARCHITECT, DIES AT 82 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Pa., N.M.)   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Esherick, a self-effacing architect who won acclaim for
his people-friendly designs and turned an old canning factory in
San Francisco into a renowned shopping complex, died on Dec. 17 at
a hospital in San Francisco. He was 83 and lived in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, Esherick, Homsey, Dodge and Davis, said that he died
of heart failure after several months in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal kind of building is one you don't see,'' Esherick
liked to say. Accordingly his buildings were designed to blend into
their surroundings and serve their occupants, not shout his name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Esherick was awarded the gold medal of the American
Institute of Architects, making him one of only 47 recipients since
1907 and putting him in the company of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le
Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and other giants. He was cited as an
``outstanding designer, an educator steeped in the arts, and a
humanist with a deep concern for the betterment of the profession
and our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, he seemed taken aback by the honor. ``I was
surprised that somebody whose achievements have been so modest and
simple and sort of ordinary was getting recognized,'' he said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Turning away a commission once to design a ``signature''
building at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., he said:
``I'm not interested in doing a signature building, but I would be
interested in doing a good building to satisfy somebody's problem.
My signature isn't part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal style reinforced the message. Tall and laconic and
sometimes likened by friends to Gary Cooper, he sported a cropped
beard and favored khakis and stone-washed denim work shirts, often
with a colored T-shirt peeping out underneath. In his younger years
he raced BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the man himself, Esherick buildings were ``nice,'' said
Gerald Gurland, chairman of the Architectural Dialogue Committee of
the American Institute of Architects, director of museum
development of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and a former
associate of the architect Richard Meier.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work was very restrained, nice, pleasant, personable,''
Gurland said. ``He was not a form-giver. He seemed to have a gift
to make buildings pleasant. His houses were very natural and fit
the California environment.''
</P>
<P>
   A faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley for
more than 40 years, Esherick influenced generations of architecture
students, teaching that buildings should be designed from the
inside out, making form secondary to aspects like views and light.
``Beauty,'' he said, ``is a byproduct of solving problems
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Cannery near Fisherman's Wharf, completed in
1967, Esherick designed the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which opened in
1984 and incorporated elements of the old Cannery Row in Monterey,
Calif. His other notable projects include Wurster Hall for the
College of Environmental Design at the University of California at
Berkeley, called the first large pre-cast concrete structure on the
West Coast, and the demonstration homes at Sea Ranch, which seem to
disappear into the landscape of the Sonoma coast south of
Mendocino.
</P>
<P>
   He also designed Stevenson College at the University of
California at Santa Cruz and many buildings at Stanford University
and at Mills College in Oakland. His last project was an innovative
public elementary school and community center for parents, the
Tenderloin Community School, now being built in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Esherick had a fondness for craft and workmanship. When he
designed a chapel for the YMCA in Berkeley, he included a wooden
cross he had carved.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1914 in Philadelphia and apprenticed with his
uncle, Wharton Esherick, an artist and furniture-maker. He received
a bachelor of architecture degree from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1937 and moved to the Bay Area the following year.
After serving in the Navy in World War II he opened his own firm in
1946. He joined the faculty of the UniveRcity of California at
Berkeley in 1952 and served as chairman of the architecture
department from 1977 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Norma; three daughters, Lisa, of
Berkeley, and Julie and Maria, of San Francisco, and two sons,
Joseph W., of San Diego, a China scholar and author, and Peter, of
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in The New York Times in 1989 after he won his
AIA medal, Esherick told of his various hobbies: fly-fishing,
bone-carving and reading James Joyce and histories of the age of
discovery. ``My problem is that I like everything,'' he said. ``I
get fascinated with geology, or I get fascinated with
anthropology.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, typically, he turned self-effacing. ``I get fascinated
with anything I don't understand, and since I hardly understand
anything, I have a very busy life.''

BIN LADEN DENIES ROLE IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. intelligence authorities
consider one of the world's most dangerous terrorists, has denied
that he had any role in the deadly bombings of two American
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not involved in the bomb blasts, but I don't regret what
happened there,'' bin Laden told the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan,
The Associated Press said. The AP said it had obtained its
information from an independent Pakistani news agency, which spoke
to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden said he knew some of the men suspected in the Aug. 7
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 250 people
and wounded several thousand. ``These are two men whom we respect
and hold in the highest esteem,'' he said through an interpreter in
a separate interview broadcast tonight by ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden did not specify which two men he was talking about.
The federal authorities have indicted at least 14 people, including
bin Laden, in their investigation of the embassy bombings and what
investigators have called a global terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   They also suspect bin Laden of financing the 1996 bombing of an
American military apartment complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19
servicemen were killed and several hundred people wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden told his interviewers that he was not at his
Afghanistan headquarters and training camp when the United States
attacked with cruise missiles on Aug. 20 in retaliation for the
embassy bombings. A pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan that
administration officials said was believed to be involved in
chemical weapons production for bin Laden was also hit. About two
dozen people were killed in the two missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the missile strikes, bin Laden said, he survived an
assassination plot ordered by a prince in Saudi Arabia, which
expelled bin Laden nearly a decade ago. ``They were offered large
sums of money in return for assassinating me, but I was not hurt,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing camouflage garb and seated in a tent that ABC News said
had been set up in the Afghan wilderness for the interview on
Wednesday night, bin Laden renewed his fatwa, or religious decree
calling for attacks on the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the Muslim nation would rid Islamic
countries of the Americans and the Jews,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, which ABC News said was conducted by Ramiullah
Yusufzi, its news producer in Pakistan, was bin Laden's first
public appearance since the August attacks, but it produced no
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about suspicions that he is trying to obtain chemical and
nuclear weapons, he said: ``If I seek to acquire such weapons, this
is a religious duty. How we use them is up to us.''

STAR FADED FAST; NOW LOVITTO FIGHTS TO PROLONG LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1972, he was the Rangers' star of the future. Except baseball
eventually didn't work that way for Joe Lovitto. As it turned out,
neither did the rest of his life go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important gift Lovitto will open this morning at
his Arlington home is the one he gave himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's the gift of living. The will to live does not come
gift-wrapped or only once a year. Lovitto fights it for 365 days,
win or tie. Losing has never been a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've got it figured,'' he said this week, laughing,
``is the day the doctors in Houston tell me I'm totally cured of
cancer, I'll get hit by a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   At nationally acclaimed M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, the
medical staff has seen it all when it comes to the horrors of
cancer. But Lovitto is somewhat of a legendary M.D. Anderson
patient. The fact he's still here this morning, opening his gifts,
is why the doctors call Lovitto a man ``with nine lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since he heard a diagnosis of testicular
cancer, Lovitto has had nine ``major'' surgeries, lost half his
stomach, one kidney, and the use of the other kidney. Since June
1996, he has spent more than 250 days in the hospital in Houston,
and made some 40 other ``day'' trips to Houston for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The news also doesn't get better. A new tumor has been found in
his stomach. Dreaded chemotherapy will start again in January, with
surgery to follow at some point. But first things first for
Lovitto. There's Christmas to celebrate with his wife, Kathy, and
their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this started, I didn't have a clue about what was
ahead for me,'' Lovitto, 47, said. ``But I become more
strong-willed about it every day. There was a time in '96 when I
was in bed for six weeks and taking pain killers with both hands,
and I finally told my wife I couldn't take it any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what kept me going then, and keeps me going now, is the
support of my family and my friends. I want my daughters to grow up
with a real father, because they've had to put up with me when I'm
on chemo. That stuff causes some nasty mood swings.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for his kidney failure, Lovitto goes to dialysis
three days a week, four hours a session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I hate that,'' he said, ``but it's either go and live, or
don't go and die. So, what's the option?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better because of dialysis. I didn't know how bad
I used to feel until I started feeling good again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 20-year-old in '72, Lovitto showed up in Arlington with the
body of a lean, mean baseball machine. As then manager Ted
Williams, the Hall of Famer, once said about the
outfielder-infielder, ``God had a baseball player in mind when he
made Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   The one knock on Lovitto was being too ``carefree,'' that he
didn't take the game seriously. But actually, he was hiding arm and
shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally asked to be checked by the doctors, the Rangers
sent me all over the country. But doctors kept telling me it was
nothing, that it was in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   When the problem was finally discovered, it took eight hours of
surgery to correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hurt anymore, but my career was also over,'' said
Lovitto, who remained in Arlington after retiring from baseball in
'75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out in baseball that I had a high tolerance for
pain,'' he said, ``but I had never planned on testing that
tolerance again. Now, it's kind of what my life has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitto admitted he waits on the new round of chemotherapy
``with dread, but I decided a long time ago I wouldn't quit. I
can't. My family means too much to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like God is ready for me to be healed, but
he's also made it clear he isn't ready for me to die. I've been
told several times in Houston that if this treatment or that
surgery didn't work, then there was no hope. They didn't work
either, but I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovitto never became a major-league baseball hero, but years
later, in his private fight to live, he has become a more important
kind of hero.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is a celebration of life. And today, Joe Lovitto
celebrates another day of survival.

IN A PARADISE OF TOYS, A SERIOUS PURPOSE: SAVING LIVES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.)  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., far
from the intrigue of the capital and even farther from the North
Pole, employees of the Consumer Product Safety Commission test toys
of every description for dangers and defects.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hundemer, an engineering technician, has tested toys at the
agency for two decades. He has cultivated a scrupulous and
unforgiving eye for potential hazards and quickly detects whether a
toy is up to standard _ whether it is safe as well as inviting
beneath the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a killer,'' Hundemer said, pointing to a fluorescent
yellow rattle with an unusually thin stem and tiny ball at the tip.
``The end could get jammed in a baby's mouth so easily and cause
choking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundemer's office is a 5-year-old's paradise. A bookcase
overflowing with brightly colored tops, dolls, toy cars, and
jacks-in-the-box covers the back wall. A sign reading ``Caution:
Adults at Play'' adorns his door.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garrett, the acting director of the engineering
laboratory, said: ``After years in the private sector, I realized
that I could get a job with the government doing about the same
thing. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Toy Fair in February, giant manufacturers like
Mattel and Hasbro, as well as small toy companies from around the
country, gather in New York City to display their wares.
Representatives from the CPSC attend the show and examine all the
new toys. They discuss potential problems with the manufacturers
and then work with them to insure that potential hazards are
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big retailers don't want to recall their products,'' said
Kathleen Begala, the CPSC director of public affairs. ``With
mailings and bad press, it's a very expensive process for them, and
so there is an incentive to cooperate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that injuries kill more children than any illnesses, the
CPSC, which has requested just over $57 million for its 2000
budget, performs four tests on toys it reviews.
</P>
<P>
   One, the template test, examines small parts of a toy that could
catch in a child's throat and affect breathing. Hundemer uses a
truncated cylinder that represents an average child's mouth and
throat. Any piece of a toy that fits into the cylinder is
considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Another, the sharp-edge test, uses a special tape to indicate
whether any side of an object could cut the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The force test determines how easily parts of stuffed animals,
like eyes and noses, can be removed from the toy. Hundemer users an
instrument that resembles pliers to grasp the eye of a stuffed toy,
for example, and applies 15 pounds of pressure, about the strength
of a 2-year-old. He tries to rip off the part for about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the impact test, a toy is dropped four and a half feet to
test durability. ``We use something pretty cheap,'' Hundemer said.
``It's called gravity.'' If pieces of the toy break off, and the
shards of plastic fail the template test, the toy is considered not
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC officially approves toys that survive the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Like veterans telling war stories, Ms. Begala and Hundemer
recalled some of the most troublesome toys. They remembered the
Cabbage Patch doll accused of ``eating'' a child's hair, the
Chinese slap bracelets made with cloth and sharp metal that could
cut a child and Woody, the cowboy with plastic spurs that had sharp
edges and a small plastic badge.

   MIYAKE-FASHION (Undated) _ Issey Miyake is easy to pack. This is
often the first thing a smart woman will tell you when you ask her
why she wears Miyake's clothes. You can roll his dresses into a
ball, they take up practically no room in your luggage, they weigh
almost nothing, and when you arrive at your destination you just
unroll and wear them. You can brown bag it around the world. In
``Issey Miyake: Making Things,'' a show of the last 10 years of the
Japanese designer's work now on view at the Cartier Foundation for
Contemporary Art in Paris, Miyake stages a witty play on the ease
of traveling with his clothes. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

   CITY-OF-ANGELES-VIDEO (Undated) _ On July 4, a month after
``City of Angels,'' the motion picture, began its inevitable
journey toward videotape, ``City of Angels,'' the soundtrack,
became the No. 1 album on the Billboard chart. Today, more than
five months after the movie disappeared from the theaters, ``Music
From the Motion Picture `City of Angels' '' remains firmly
entrenched among Billboard's top 40 albums. Having earned
quadruple-platinum status (four million units sold) and spawned two

weeklong run to quality for the Oscar race, before a nationwidfe
release in January. Made a year ago on a puny budget of $4 million,
a sum that no doubt would have had the movie's jaded industry types
in stitches, ``Hurlyburly'' features a powerhouse ensemble that
includes Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Anna Paquin, Chazz
Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn and Garry Shandling, playing an

   DANCE-YEAREND (subslug) (Undatee) _ Among the titans, Jerome
Robbins was arguably the most original of choreographers. He
regarded the New York City Ballet as a continuing experiment and
his death in July robs the company of a major creative voice that
influenced its profile for 50 years. Along with Michel Fokine,
George Balanchine, Antony Tudor and Frederick Ashton, Robbins was

   DESMOND-RICHARDSON-DANCE (Undated) _ In an advertisement now
running for ``Fosse: A Celebration in Dance,'' the ballet and
modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in profile, his hands on
his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle on his head. One leg
is straight and the other bent. He wears ballet slippers. Sheathed
only in tights and a vest, his remarkably muscular body looks
sculptured. In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater
in New York City, where it opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in

world of operatic singing. Even more noteworthy, her success comes
at a time when opera houses are flush with excellent mezzos. Yet
thanks in large part to her rapport with audiences, Ms.

   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ Executives from the major
classical-music recording companies often speak about their work
with a sense of mission. But it is hard to discern much mission at
this time of market glut, as the major labels seem to flail about,
desperately trying to figure out what will sell. The glut comes not
just from further reduplications of the standard repertory by
heavily promoted new performers but also from countless reissues of
almost anything, and gimmicky collections like ``The Best of
Tchaikovsky'' or ``Ten Tenors in Prayer.'' By Anthony Tommasini.

fodder during sweeps periods, the thrice-yearly ratings matchups
that determine advertising rates for the entire year. These
mega-mini-series or mega-movies _ NBC calls them Big Events _
contain exotic locations, stellar international casts and/or lavish
special effects. A majority contain all three. A typical two-hour

   KENTE-CLOTH-ART (Undated) _ Kente cloth's iconic powers are both
considerable and quite possibly singular. For centuries, Asante and
Ewe royalty in Ghana have worn gloriously colored kente of fine
silk on state occasions. The garments have lent a grandeur to the
festivities, and more important, they have been a means for
chieftains to proclaim their authority and wealth. Small wonder
that kente has become an almost universal totem of black identity.
``Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente and African-American Identity,''
an exhaustive exhibition at the Newark Museum organized by Doran H.
Ross, the director of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the
University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Anne
Spencer, the curator of Africa, the Americas and the Pacific at the
Newark Museum. For the uninitiated and aficionados alike, its 185
examples of traditional and modern kente offer insight into the
fabric's history, evolution and cultural significance. The exhibit
remains on view in Newark through Jan. 3 and then travels to the
Fowler Museum, the National Museum of African Art in Washington and
the Detroit Museum of African-American History. By Fletcher

EDITORIAL: THE MOMENT THAT MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever fallen in love, you know what it means to live
in a land where all the songs are suddenly true. There are times
when Christmas is like that, too. Not at first, of course, not when
Thanksgiving is still a week away, and the outside thermometer
sticks at 60 and the first Christmas catalog is already months old.
Not when you think about the shopping left to do and, worse, the
wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   When the season has barely begun and you see a late-night clip
of George Bailey running the length of Bedford Falls, overcome with
joy, he seems a little more keyed up than he did the year before,
and you can't help thinking, ``That won't last.'' The same goes for
Alastair Sim and his bed-curtains. You realize one afternoon that
you've never heard anyone say ``Bah, humbug!'' and really mean it.
</P>
<P>
   But all the reluctance in the world never slowed this season
down, just as all the childlike wishing in the world never sped it
up. In the department stores you walk through a nimbus of sample
perfumes, and some of it sticks to you. The same goes for the
spirit of Christmas. In early December, it is just a phrase. Then
one day, on one of the many corners of Rockefeller Center, an
elementary-school class marches in place, counting off boot-camp
fashion, when ``Jingle Bells'' breaks out among them. It sounds as
insurrectionary as the ``Marseillaise.'' It is impossible not to
smile and let a little of that rendition of ``Jingle Bells'' cling
to you.
</P>
<P>
   Some people love every bit of Christmas, right up to and
including Burl Ives singing ``Holly Jolly Christmas.'' Plenty of
people can get no further than the Pretenders' wonderful version of
``Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' or Berlioz's ``L'Enfance
du Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in a warm year such as this one has been, there is
usually too much Christmas for just one day. To a child, an Advent
calendar is only a ticking clock, but to adults with the cruel
frost of King Wenceslaus playing in their heads, it is a way of
pacing the holidays, giving themselves a chance to measure up
gradually to something they remember from a time when they were
children.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Christmas catches up with each of us sooner or later _
perhaps in the satisfaction of finding just the right present,
perhaps on Christmas Eve when again the decree goes out from Caesar
Augustus, perhaps on the morning _ here at last _ when the tree is
knee-deep in torn wrapping paper and discarded ribbon, and perhaps
not at all until we find a way to make this holiday bear upon
someone who does not expect it. But one by one the Christmas songs
become true again _ and if only for a moment, then that is the
moment that matters.

AFTER WAKE-UP CALL, MODANO SNAPS DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the kind of hit that would have made Mike Modano crumble
in the past. It was the kind of hit that would have had Modano
feeling sorry for himself, either writhing in pain on the ice or
slowly pushing himself up off his stick while the action flowed the
other way and his team gave up an odd-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's'' the kind of hit Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman
Dimitri Yushkevich put on Modano when he knocked the Stars center
for a loop a minute into Wednesday night's game in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, might have fazed the old Modano. But not
Wednesday. Modano, instead, bounced up from the hit that would have
easily qualified as a ``pancake'' in football, and scored three
goals to lead the Stars to a 5-1 whipping of the Eastern
Conference's then-hottest team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank him for hitting me,'' Modano said. ``It kind
of woke me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano could laugh afterward. He earned his first hat trick
since Oct. 10, 1997, and only the fifth of his career. The first
goal broke a seven-game, goal-scoring drought. The third gave him
11 on the season and tied him with linemate Jere Lehtinen for the
team's lead in goal-scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just him, the whole line is clicking,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ``The line has chemistry. The wingers are
looking for Modano so they can give him the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one of those wingers is sniper Brett Hull, that's
saying something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're all about playing defense first,'' Hull said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process of playing defense, the Stars' top line is
really starting to roll up points. It has 31 of the Stars' 94 goals
and 68 points.
</P>
<P>
   When the first line is clicking and the other lines also are
scoring goals, it's easy to put together a 10-game (7-0-3) unbeaten
streak. The Stars have not fallen since a 4-1 loss in Vancouver on
Dec. 4. Amid one of the toughest months in team history _ 15 games,
including a franchise-record 10 on the road _ the Stars are 8-1-3
in December with three games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing much better five-on-five, and that's been a big
key,'' Hitchcock said. ``The season is starting to settle in and
you can't rely on the power play anymore like we did earlier in the
season. We've had, what, two chances in the past two games, that's
what we have to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a strong top line, strong support play, more
offensive-minded defensemen and strong goaltending has resulted in
the Stars' playing their best hockey of the season to post a
league-best 20-5-6 record. They have even dispatched the Phoenix
Coyotes, who for much of the season kept the Stars from being the
best team in their own division, let alone the best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   After the Coyotes' 4-3 loss against the Chicago Blackhawks on
Wednesday night, the Stars have more points (46) than the Coyotes
(42). The Stars also lead in winning percentage at .741, compared
to the Coyotes' .724.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are two games shy of tying the franchise-record
unbeaten streak of 12 games (9-0-3) set in 1981-82, and they
already have matched the 10-game unbeaten streak they had last
season, also set in December _ when Modano was nursing a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really a part of the team last year until after
Christmas,'' Modano said. ``That's why now it makes things a lot
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A healthy season and a good smack by Dimitri Yushkevich _ Modano
really does have much to be thankful for during the holiday season.

N.Y. JUDGE DENIES FOOD STAMPS TO ABLE-BODIED IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advocates for the poor, who had hoped to force New
York state to provide food stamps to thousands of able-bodied legal
immigrants who have not become U.S. citizens, lost a lawsuit this
week when a judge upheld the state's denial of such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Harold Tompkins of state Supreme Court in Manhattan said
state officials acted reasonably when they decided to provide food
stamps only to legal immigrants who are at least 60 years old, or
younger than 18, or disabled. The state program was created last
year to help legal immigrants who were denied federally financed
food stamps under the federal welfare law of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state's policy ``targets the limited funds available to the
assistance of those most likely to need help, that is, the elderly,
the infirm and minors,'' Tompkins wrote in his decision, which was
signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focusing benefits on those categories of persons most likely
to need assistance is well within the Legislature's authority as
having a reasonable basis,'' the justice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Lee, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, which filed the
lawsuit against the state in August in partnership with lawyers at
the Welfare Law Center, said the advocacy groups would appeal the
justice's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision marks the second legal defeat for advocates who
have been trying to restore benefits that were denied legal
immigrants under the federal welfare law. Last year, advocates lost
a similar suit against the federal government when a judge ruled
that federal officials, who control immigration, had the right to
deny benefits like food stamps to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In the case decided this week, the lawyers sued the state on
behalf of people affected by the state's policy, claiming officials
violated equal-protection provisions of the federal and state
constitutions when they denied food stamps to more than 31,000
impoverished, able-bodied immigrants between the ages of 18 and 59.
Those provisions, the lawyers said, did not allow state officials
to choose which poor people would receive aid.
</P>
<P>
   New York's constitution also requires the state to provide for
the needy, and the plaintiffs' lawyers charged that the food stamp
denial also violated that legal obligation, leaving many people
struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins did not address the state's constitutional obligation
to provide for the needy, however. Instead, he cited federal
rulings that found that reasonable policies do not ``offend the
Constitution simply because the classification is not made with
mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some
inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the lawyers for the poor had failed to prove that the
state's policy lacked a rational basis.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit included Geraldo Alvarino, who
said in legal papers that he ate only one meal a day, and Francisco
Santos of Catskill, N.Y., who said he relied on food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is sympathetic to the plight of the plaintiffs and
their real need,'' Tompkins wrote. ``However, it cannot ignore the
settled principles of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Ms. Lee, the Legal Aid Society
lawyer, said yesterday. ``We believe the decision is wrong. And as
a result, more people are going to go hungry than need to.''
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, a spokesman for the state's Office of Temporary and
Disability Assistance, which runs the food-stamp program, said
state officials were pleased with the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York state is doing more than most states and more than
the federal government requires on this issue,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen states created food-stamp programs for poor legal
immigrants who are not naturalized citizens in response to the
federal welfare law. Some of those states, including New York,
restricted participation.
</P>
<P>
   The New York lawsuit appears to be the first in the nation to
challenge restrictions on a state food-stamp program for
immigrants.

EIGHT KILLED AS BUS CRASHES ON NEW JERSEY PARKWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A white and silver bus carrying 23 people from
Brooklyn to Atlantic City for a day of casino gambling spun around
on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey on Thursday, slashed
through a guard rail and plunged down an embankment, rolling over
several times. Eight were killed and 15 were injured, many
critically.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately determined. No
other vehicle was involved, and an overnight snow had been plowed
from the parkway, which was snowbanked but dry. Witnesses, however,
said speeding and snow patches may have been factors, and officials
said the driver had a record that included tickets for speeding and
other infractions, an accident and suspensions that required
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of an apparently speeding tour bus suddenly
spinning around and flipping on its side at 10:35 a.m., of victims
hurtling surrealistically through shattered windows as it tumbled
down a 100-foot slope and halted on its side, a wreck with moaning
passengers trapped in its mangled interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first one on the scene,'' said Lamar Jenkins, 32, a
bus driver who saw the accident from behind, pulled over and leaped
out, stunned at the carnage sprawled over the snowy parkway median
near the Cheesequake Rest Area in Sayreville, 25 miles south of
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were lying on the ground,'' he said of the victims, men
and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s. ``People were crying for help.
People were bleeding. I saw a woman with her leg off. That snow on
the ground, it was red. The snow was red! It was like a war. There
were bodies everywhere, some not moving at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was bitterly cold, with temperatures in the 20s, and an icy
wind scythed over a bleak landscape strewn with victims, boxes,
bags and other possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins saw the driver of the overturned bus, Valentin Viner,
52, whom he had known for three years. ``He looked in my face and
there was nothing I could do for him,'' Jenkins said. ``He got up
and walked around. He had a serious cut over his left eye and he
was just walking like he was in a daze.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a crowd of passing motorists had stopped. Workers from the
rest-area service station ran up. Calls for help went out. Blankets
were brought to cover the bodies. Then, amid a wail of sirens,
rescue vehicles began swarming to the scene: state and local police
officers, firefighters, medics, rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some were rescued a half-hour after the accident, while others
were trapped for up to an hour. To reach some of the victims,
rescue workers had to dig underneath the bus and raise it slightly
with cables and winches. They also cut through the bottom of the
bus, shearing off a portion toward the rear.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2:30 p.m., four hours after the crash, when the last
passengers, all of them dead, were removed from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Shut off by the tangle of rescue vehicles, all southbound
traffic on the parkway _ three express lanes and three local lanes
_ was halted for hours. A trickle of cars was allowed to pass in
the local lanes then, but the express lanes were closed until late
afternoon on one of the busiest days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, as the last of the dead were taken away and
efforts turned to the less urgent business of removing the
shattered bus, Lt. Daniel Cosgrover, a spokesman for the New Jersey
State Police, said eight people had been killed and all of the
other 15 on board had been injured, six critically.
</P>
<P>
   The injured were taken to University Hospital in Newark,
Memorial Medical Center in South Amboy, Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital in New Brunswick and Raritan Bay Medical Center
in Perth Amboy. They were 47 to 78 years old, residents of Brooklyn
mostly, and were suffering from various head and internal injuries,
broken bones, severe lacerations and hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Viner, the driver, a Russian immigrant, was in stable condition
at Memorial Medical Center, and was to be interviewed Thursday
night by the State Police. No charges were filed against him
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington
dispatched a team of investigators, who arrived in the late
afternoon. A spokesman said the team was sent because of the large
number of deaths and because the agency was conducting a special
study of bus accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The bus that crashed, officials said, is owned by Bruins
Transportation, of 300 Liberty Ave., Brooklyn, and was operated by
SGS Travelscope, 1620 East 16th St., Brooklyn, which organizes
tours to Atlantic City and other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Department of Transportation said it
inspected 13 Bruins buses between January and September and passed
all but two, which were taken out of service, repaired, reinspected
and put back in service. A department spokeswoman, Maureen
McCarthy, called it an average inspection record.
</P>
<P>
   But the driver, Viner, who trained as a mechanic in Russia and
came to the United States five or six years ago, had a spotty
record, according to the New York State Department of Motor
Vehicles. Joseph Picchi, a spokesman, said Viner obtained a license
to drive buses in November 1994, and had an accident that involved
property damage only in Queens in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His license was suspended in 1995 for failure to pay a ticket.
After his reinstatement, he was convicted of speeding in 1997, of
failure to stop for a school bus later that year and of speeding
last March. Having accumulated more than nine points for these
infractions, his license was suspended in March. It was reinstated
in June after he took a retraining course, Picchi said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance said Viner, who is married and has two children,
made runs several times a week to Atlantic City. His passengers,
who paid $22 for the round trip, bought tickets in pharmacies,
grocery stores and other outlets in Brooklyn, and from travel
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Viner on Thursday began his run shortly before 9 a.m. and made
10 stops in Brooklyn to pick up 22 passengers, all bound for the
Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort, which was to give a
gambler's-lure rebate of $18 to each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the accident occurred near Exit 124 on a stretch
of the parkway that is split into three express and three local
lanes, divided by a wide, gullylike median. The right local lane
was still unplowed, officials said, and the bus was in the left
lane, beside a guard rail and a snow bank.
</P>
<P>
   The speed limit there changes from 55 to 65. Viner's speed was
unclear, but Jenkins, the bus driver who was following, said he
thought his friend's bus skidded on a patch of snow while speeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that I think he did wrong was speed,'' he said.
``Speed always plays a part in weather like this. I have a governor
that keeps me at 65 miles an hour. I was trying to catch him, but I
couldn't. I just backed down and thought, I'm not going to catch
him. He was going faster than 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the bus, for unknown reasons, spun around,
shot through a guardrail and plunged down the embankment, striking
a sewer cap on the grass berm as it went down. It rolled over three
or four times, its windows shattered and as many as 10 people were
hurled out before it came to rest on its side, a few feet from the
express lanes and a busy underpass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people alive inside the bus,'' said Craig Conley,
27, who ran over from the service station. ``It was kind of
surreal. You feel helpless.''

SANDERS TO OBTAIN 2ND OPINION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders will have his
sprained left toe examined Tuesday by specialist Dr. Bill Hamilton
in Florida, but Sanders is not optimistic about his iffy status
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has missed five-plus games and is questionable to
play again this season, said he is getting the second opinion at
the urging of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he is frustrated about being sidelined during what
he called one of his best seasons, and said he has turned his
health over to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much it's \Rseeing Hamilton\S going to
help,'' Sanders said. ``He may be able to tell me something more in
depth. But I don't think anything can be said to get me on the
field quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has a point, considering that the only option other than
rest is surgery, which would end any chance of him playing in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders will not play against the Washington Redskins on Sunday
night and is likely to be doubtful for the Cowboys' first-round
playoff game the first weekend in January. However, he has not
given up hope of playing in the playoffs and is eying a return for
a possible second-round game in Atlanta against the Falcons, the
team he began his NFL career with in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, based in New York, has performed surgery on Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith.
LAFLEUR EXPERIENCES DISCOMFORT
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur (sprained knee) practiced yesterday but
complained of discomfort, causing coach Chan Gailey to take a
wait-and-see approach to LaFleur's status for the Redskins game.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur, who has missed two games, is a key factor in the
Cowboys' power running game. Coaches were hoping to get him back
into the flow before the playoffs. Gailey said it will be a
game-time decision. Playoff tickets available Several thousand
tickets are available for the first-round playoff game. The Cowboys
will play either Tampa Bay, the New York Giants or Arizona at Texas
Stadium. Ticket prices are $52 to $72. Call Ticketmaster at (214)
373-8000 or (972) 579-4800. The Cowboys' ticket office number is
(972) 579-4800.
HE SAID IT
``I can't evaluate the year until the year is over. It's hard to
determine right now how successful a season it's been because we're
still in the middle of it. I'm proud of the fact we won the
division. But for those of us in this locker room, that wasn't the
ultimate goal coming into the year.'' _ Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman

FATAL FIRES EXPOSE FLAW IN SAFETY CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS and KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twice in the last week, buildings designed to save
lives in the event of a fire turned instead into deathtraps, when
human error foiled the fireproofing systems that were meant to
isolate and contain deadly flames, smoke, heat and gases.
</P>
<P>
   The two incidents, which claimed the lives of three firefighters
at a burning Brooklyn apartment building last Friday and four
residents in a Manhattan high-rise fire on Wednesday, have focused
renewed attention on New York City's fire code and its approach to
fire safety in high-rise residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fire safety experts said that in the case of high-rise apartment
buildings, the city relies heavily on fire-resistant construction,
intended to contain a fire until firefighters arrive, while the
rest of the state and most of the country have moved to require
sprinkler systems in tall residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A system of structural fire barriers like New York City's can _
and, in most cases, does _ work, the experts said. But it is
vulnerable. For the system to function as intended, the room or
apartment where a fire has broken out must be closed off. A human
mistake as simple as leaving a door ajar, as occurred in the two
most recent fatal fires, can cause the safety system to break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is really the only major city in the country that has
this philosophy,'' said Jonathan Barnett, associate professor of
fire protection engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Center for Fire Safety Studies in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that their fire code has proven its worth
because, over all, fire deaths are declining. But, as underlined by
the two most recent fatal fires, many of the fire-safety
innovations introduced in the city during the last 20 years _
self-closing doors to seal off stairwells and apartments,
fire-rated doors and walls to contain fires, fire-rated concrete
block construction _ can be undone by human error.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brooklyn fire on Dec. 18, an elderly woman left the door
open behind her as she fled a fire in her 10th-floor apartment,
turning the hallway into a wind tunnel for a fireball that engulfed
three firefighters. City officials are investigating why the
supposedly self-closing steel door did not shut on its own and why
a sprinkler system in the building's hallway had been turned off.
That system was not required by the city code, but had been
installed by the federal agency that managed the residence.
</P>
<P>
   At the fire in Manhattan, Fire Department officials said
residents propped open a self-closing door to the apartment where
the blaze started on Wednesday morning. Fire and smoke escaped into
the hallway and were sucked into a stairwell when firefighters
opened the door. Four people on the stairs were killed. The two
fires appear to have given new political impetus to stalled efforts
to require sprinkler systems in tall residential apartment
buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has suggested in recent days that he will
push for legislation to require all new apartment towers to have
sprinkler systems. At the same time, the City Council's Housing and
Buildings Committee has scheduled a hearing on potential sprinkler
legislation in the coming weeks, said Rica Rinzler, the committee's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinklers are now required in apartment towers only when the
building has a compactor chute, which is difficult to seal off and
can be difficult for firefighters to reach if a fire breaks out in
the chute itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkler systems are already required for some types of
buildings: new high-rise residential hotels and office buildings
taller than 75 feet, nightclubs, department stores, some factories
and warehouses, nursing homes and single-room-occupancy hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said his department would
support new and tougher legislation to require sprinklers in
residential high-rises. But he said any new laws should strike a
balance between fire-safety imperatives and the cost of the new
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has to realize that buildings are much safer,'' Von
Essen said. ``We have fewer fire fatalities than we have ever had.
There were 145 fire fatalities last year. That was the lowest in 37
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, there have been 101 fire fatalities,'' he
continued. ``Things are better than they ever were. Could
conditions be safer? There are always ways to improve.''

EDITORIAL: CONFUSION OVER THE PUERTO RICAN VOTE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The only clear message from the recent plebiscite in Puerto Rico
is that the question of the island's political future remains
deeply divisive. Congress' failure to sponsor orderly balloting
that would give the island's 3.8 million voters a meaningful say
about their political status has not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the House passed a bill that would have set up
a congressionally approved referendum for Puerto Ricans on whether
the island should retain its current commonwealth status, seek
statehood or become an independent nation. If statehood or
independence received a majority vote the federal government would
develop a transition plan, leading to a vote by Congress for a
status change within 10 years. Both the Republican and Democratic
parties have long supported Puerto Rican self-determination. But
the Senate blocked the legislation and simply said it would review
the outcome of any nonbinding local vote.
</P>
<P>
   The recent ballot, prepared by the Puerto Rican government, was
crowded with five options: statehood, commonwealth, independence,
free association or none of the above. Negative campaigns mounted
by both the statehood and commonwealth camps contributed to ``none
of the above'' picking up 50.2 percent of the vote. Much of that
was a protest vote from the pro-commonwealth camp, which saw the
ballot as misleading. The statehood option, championed by Gov.
Pedro Rossello, received 46.5 percent of the votes, far more than
the other options but not enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate has focused on what is possible under a
commonwealth status. Puerto Ricans currently have U.S. citizenship,
and are subject to federal laws and the draft. But they do not pay
federal income tax and do not vote for president or elect voting
members of Congress. Some commonwealth supporters fear that
statehood would jeopardize the island's Spanish-based culture, and
have argued that getting enhanced rights from the federal
government is possible without becoming a state. Pro-statehood
advocates reject that position as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can reduce the confusion by crafting a referendum with
input from Puerto Rican leaders on all sides that accurately
reflects the options available. ``None of the above'' does not move
Puerto Ricans any closer to defining their future.

2 ARE ACCUSED OF BEARING AWAY GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A family in Queens got an early-morning visit
Thursday, but it wasn't Santa Claus who was sneaking into their
house.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was two men who walked into the family's home on
146th Street shortly after 6 a.m., loaded up a laundry cart with
Christmas presents from the living room, then calmly walked out
with the loot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men took the gifts to the house of one of the men a
block and a half away on 147th Street, authorities said. But as any
aspiring Santa probably knows, people bearing gifts in the snow can
often leave behind telltale tracks, and in this case, police said,
the tracks led straight to the house of Timothy Jackman, 22.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived at the house, they said, they found Jackman
and Hakim Jones, 21, also of Queens, on Jackman's bed, sifting
through Barbie dolls, video games, stereo equipment and jewelry
that bore a striking resemblance to the gifts missing from their
neighbor's home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers who confronted the men, Vincent Papasodero,
26, said that the case against the men began to look even better
when the officers spotted a framed picture of the woman whose home
had just been burglarized, Miroslava Alexander, 42.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects did little to hide their crime, said Papasodero,
who investigated the thefts with his partner, Officer John Lynagh,
31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cart they used to steal the stuff was also stolen from the
house, and it left tracks that went right up to the house, where we
found the suspects,'' Papasodero said. ``Then when we were let in
the house, we found them lying on the bed, going though the
proceeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the stuff was theirs until we asked about the photo
of the complainant,'' he said. ``Then they stopped talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Papasodero said that the men had entered the victims' home
through a rear door, though it did not appear to have been forced
open. He added that Ms. Alexander, who had recently moved into the
neighborhood, called police after hearing a strange noise in her
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was certainly relieved to see her stuff again,'' he said,
noting that Ms. Alexander had bought the gifts for her three young
children.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that he felt lucky that the investigation
involved ``particularly dumb criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackman and Jones were charged with burglary and criminal
possession of stolen property, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police returned the gifts to the family.

EDITORIAL:   CLEANING UP AFTER THE PENTAGON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Panama, The Philippines)    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces are withdrawing from military bases all over the
world, but in many cases what they are leaving behind is dangerous
to the local population and environment. Fuels, cleaning fluids,
lubricants and other chemicals are leaching into groundwater, and
unexploded shells linger on testing grounds long after U.S.
soldiers leave.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panana Canal Treaties, which require the United States
to give up its bases there at the end of next year, Washington must
take all ``practicable'' measures to remove hazards. Washington
contends it has done that, and is now balking at paying for the
cleanup of the bases, whose chemicals are contaminating the
groundwater. Panama contends that unexploded bombs have killed 21
people in the last 20 years. The Pentagon says the figure is lower.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the Pentagon has begun to dispose of
waste safely. It is also removing hazardous waste, or paying to do
so, at bases in important allied countries such as Germany and
Canada. But in most nations base agreements are decades old, signed
long before anyone paid attention to environmental damage. Where
there is no legal obligation, Pentagon officials say, Congress bars
them from spending money for cleanup after the base is closed. Many
congressmen feel the security provided by a U.S. military base was
payment enough.
</P>
<P>
   This view is not a popular one in countries that lack the money
to clean up, or even evaluate, hazards. When the United States
pulled out of the Clark and Subic Bay bases in the Philippines
beginning in 1991, it left dozens of sites where toxic chemicals
and asbestos had been dumped or buried in unsecured landfills.
These may now be the cause of disease among people living nearby.
Washington has paid the Philippines nothing for cleanup and has
released only perfunctory information about the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   New laws are needed to provide the Pentagon with funds to repair
its environmental damage and develop new technologies for sweeping
up live bombs. The risks do not stop at the border, and neither
should U.S. accountability.

   (NYT24) UNDATED -- Dec. 24, 1998 -- SANTA-NORAD-FLOATER, 12-24
-- These are computer-generated photos provided by NORAD, the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, showing the progression of
Santa Claus during the start of his Christmas run. The progression,
starting clockwise from upper-left, was said to have been started
at 1:00 p.m. EST and shows how Santa has advanced every hour ending
at 6:00 p.m. when the last photo posted is seen at lower left.
NORAD is a joint American and Canadian military organization
responsible for the aerospace defense of both America and Canada.
This year's Santa tracking program is the 42nd conducted by NORAD
and the 44th overall. NORAD's predecessor, Continental Air Defense
Command (CONAD) started the tradition after a local store's
advertisement for kids to call Santa on a special ``hotline''
included a misprinted telephone number. Instead of Mr. Kris
Kringle, the number put kids through to the CONAD
Commander-in-Chief's operations ``hotline.'' Since that time, phone
calls from children have been responded to personally by Canadian
and American NORAD personnel. (/New York Times Photo)

ABOUT-CARS-YEAREND, 12-24 -- Sure it's adorable. But the Volkswagen
Bug, seen at top, is also a fine car. Along with being stylish and
comfortable, it is reasonably priced between $16,425-$21,250. The
Porsche 911 has seen its first redesign in 34 years. The downside
is the window sticker, especially the Cabriolet's, priced between
$65,795-$84,540. (Volkswagen, top, Porsche/New York Times Photo)

EURO-CARS, 12-24 -- The Toyota Century, a V12-powered limousine
that rivals rivaling the Rolls-Royce, outside Japan. Toyota said
that only 10 to 20 of the cars would be sold in Europe annually,

County just south of Porterville on Thursday. A brutal, four-day
Christmas freeze has destroyed more than a third of California's
annual citrus crop, inflicting upwards of a half-billion dollars in
damage and capping a year of weather-related calamities around the
nation, from the drenching winter storms of El Nino to summer
drought in Texas and fires in Florida. (Monica Almeida/New York

   (NYT10) JERUSALEM -- Dec. 24, 1998 -- ISRAEL-GENERAL-1, 12-24 --
Thirty-six years after he joined the Israeli army, Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak turned in his uniform Thursday and plunged into
civilian life in a peculiar role. Though he showed no political
leanings during his departure ceremony, Shahak, a silent shadow
over the electoral aspirations of both Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, finally
stepped today into the fray. Shahak is seen here in a portrait
taken in July. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York Times Photo)

 EDITORIAL: DeLAY GOES OUT OF BOUNDS  
 (See also IMPEACH-CLINTON, IMPEACH-VOTERS)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Just as the move to censure President Clinton is gaining
momentum in the Senate, the House Republicans' chief hatchet man
has arrogantly tried to block its progress.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, the majority whip, is inviting senators who oppose a
lengthy trial over removing Clinton from office to view some
mysterious evidence against the president that has not been made
public or disclosed to the White House but is available only to
House members.
</P>
<P>
   This claim of secret evidence is an insult to due process and an
improper intervention into Senate deliberations. The Senate's
obligation is to weigh evidence in the open and stick to the
official case brought by the managers of the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of exactly what the evidence is against Clinton are
muddy. Some is said to relate to Kathleen Willey's charge that the
president groped her and to an accusation that Clinton forced
himself on a woman 20 years ago, when he was attorney general of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Before the impeachment vote in the House, some wavering
Republicans were invited to look at the material, just in case
anyone thought the charges brought by Kenneth Starr and Republican
investigators on the House Judiciary Committee were not enough to
support impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was right to object then and even more right
now. Neither Starr nor any other investigator saw fit to include
these allegations in their charges that the president committed
perjury and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's notion that evidence can be brought to bear on senators'
decisions even though it is kept secret from the public is
repugnant to any standards of justice and to the need for open
procedures in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee debated the evidence for some time
and laid out its findings for all to see. It had ample opportunity
to bring out any material it saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the House has approved two articles of impeachment, it
is the Senate's turn to respond. It is simply inappropriate for a
House leader to reach across to the Senate and try to put his
thumbs on the scale with hidden material the House had every chance
to bring out in a responsible form but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry leadership vacuum in the House is making it possible
for DeLay to make mischief. Now that Speaker Newt Gingrich and the
one-time speaker-to-be Robert Livingston have gone home to nurse
their own self-inflicted wounds, House Republicans have settled on
Dennis Hastert as the next speaker. If Hastert does not call DeLay
off quickly, he will end up a front man rather than a powerful
speaker.

   (NYT24) UNDATED -- Dec. 24, 1998 -- SANTA-NORAD-FLOATER, 12-24
-- These are computer-generated photos provided by NORAD, the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, showing the progression of
Santa Claus during the start of his Christmas run. The progression,
starting clockwise from upper-left, was said to have been started
at 1:00 p.m. EST and shows how Santa has advanced every hour ending
at 6:00 p.m. when the last photo posted is seen at lower left.
NORAD is a joint American and Canadian military organization
responsible for the aerospace defense of both America and Canada.
This year's Santa tracking program is the 42nd conducted by NORAD
and the 44th overall. NORAD's predecessor, Continental Air Defense
Command (CONAD) started the tradition after a local store's
advertisement for kids to call Santa on a special ``hotline''
included a misprinted telephone number. Instead of Mr. Kris
Kringle, the number put kids through to the CONAD
Commander-in-Chief's operations ``hotline.'' Since that time, phone
calls from children have been responded to personally by Canadian
and American NORAD personnel. (/New York Times Photo)

AIR FORCE CALLS PILOT IN COLORADO JET CRASH A SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Subs 2nd graf to remove `it'.) 
(ATTN: Colo., Ariz., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Air Force pilot who flew his attack jet into a
Colorado mountainside last year was in mental turmoil over
``unrequited love'' for a former girlfriend and over his mother's
Christian pacifist faith, a ``psychological autopsy'' by the Air
Force has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials concluded last year, basically for lack of a
better explanation, that the 32-year-old pilot, Capt. Craig Button,
committed suicide when, on April 2, 1997, he broke formation from
his unit instead of proceeding on a training run and then flew from
southern Arizona to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological report, which was released earlier this
month because of legally enforceable requests made by The Tucson
Citizen under the Freedom of Information Act, was an attempt to
explain why. It was based on interviews with about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also dealt with another mystery of the flight: what
happened to the four 500-pound bombs that were on board the plane
but never found. Loud explosions in northern Arizona and near the
Colorado mountain towns of Telluride and Aspen that were heard by
58 witnesses cited in the report indicate that Button may have
dumped the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's parents, Richard and Joan Button of Massapequa,
N.Y., angrily reject the conclusion that he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pulled that out of a hat: that he must have done it
himself, which I think is a lie,'' said Richard Button, a retired
Air Force lieutenant colonel, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Button, who served in the Air Force during World War II, the
Korean War and the Vietnam War, noted that his son's plane broke
from formation just after it had been refueled in the air. ``There
must have been some kind of air contamination,'' Button said. ``We
think he was disoriented, that he wasn't able to control his
airplane for a period of time. We think that caused the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site, just below the summit of a 13,365-foot-high
granite peak in the Holy Cross Wilderness, investigators did not
recover enough human remains to determine whether Button had
suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. But they did determine
that he was not using drugs or alcohol before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers were able to retrieve about two thirds of the $9
million war plane and much of its ammunition. The bombs, sometimes
called ``tankbusters,'' were never found. After a second search
four months ago, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the area to
hikers, posting warning signs showing what the missing bombs looks
like.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling out an accident caused by loss of consciousness, the
Air Force investigators noted that Button's A-10 Thunderbolt
climbed from its altitude of 6,000 feet during the flight exercise,
and threaded its way through 14,000 foot high peaks. An avid skier,
Button had skied in the Colorado Rockies, had been reprimanded by
the Air Force for often going out of his way to fly over the
Rockies and had talked about one day leaving the Air Force to fly
commercial jets out of Denver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his final flight, Craig Button, a New York City native,
roared over New York Lake at 300 miles an hour, missed Craig
Mountain by two miles and crashed into Gold Dust Peak.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force report, based on interviews with friends, fellow
fliers and relatives, sketches a picture of a ``perfectionist'' who
was inwardly torn by his relationships with his mother and a former
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Before releasing the report, the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations blacked out almost all the names of people
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Two points were not a part of the report. After Button's plane
disappeared, but before its wreckage was found several days later,
rumors circulated widely that he was connected to right-wing
paramilitary groups and had taken the jet and its payload for use
by those organizations. After the wreckage was found, rumors had it
that Button was gay and that torment over military policy on
homosexuality had led him to take his life. But the report as
released did not mention anything about those rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Button, raised as an only child of elderly parents, broke as a
teen-ager with the faith of his parents, who are Jehovah's
Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is a Jehovah's Witness, raised me to think that
joining the military is wrong,'' Craig Button, wrote as a
23-year-old Air Force cadet to a commander.
</P>
<P>
   A classmate from the Reserve Officer Training Corps told an Air
Force investigator that Craig's ``mother would not allow him to
wear his ROTC uniform in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's half-sister, Susane Button, told an Air Force
investigator that his mother wanted him ``to leave the military for
the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Brian Gross, a pilot who shared an apartment with Button at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, near Tucson, Ariz., said that in the
month before the disappearance, Button's ``mother became
increasingly vocal in her negative feelings towards her son's job
and role in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Button was said by many friends to have revered his
father, and his father's half-brother, Lt. Donald Hurlburt.
Hurlburt, a B-17 pilot who flew over Germany in World War II,
crashed in Florida in 1943. Hurlburt Field in Florida is named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks before the crash, Button seemed to some people
to be disillusioned with his life in the military. A former
landlord in Texas recalled to an investigator that in two telephone
conversations prior to his death, the pilot seemed ``out of
character,'' saying that he was ``learning to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Button has declined to be interviewed by reporters about
her son's death. But she talked with Air Force investigators on
April 17, 1997, while her son was still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She advised there were no arguments with her son over religion
during their visit in Tucson,'' the Air Force interviewer wrote,
referring to a weeklong visit by the parents to their son, a visit
which apparently ended amicably one week before his last flight.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, his father said Button had
gotten along well with his mother during the visit and had talked
enthusiastically about a coming transfer to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no arguments between the two,'' said Button's
father. ``There were no flareups, no extreme arguments relating to
any faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Jehovah's Witness
group which arranged the telephone interview with Button, also
provided a statement on their faith and military service:
``Jehovah's Witnesses choose to abide by the principle outlined in
the Bible to `beat their swords into ploughshares.' However, they
do not interfere with or oppose individuals who choose to serve in
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source of turmoil for the young pilot was a ``lost
love'' for a former classmate who had turned down his vague
proposal of marriage three years earlier. By 1996, the captain told
his friends, he had gotten over this Air Force flight instructor.
But around Christmas 1996, the woman, who was coming out of another
relationship, called him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the captain told a friend that he had thrown away her
Christmas card unread, proof, he said, that he had gotten over the
relationship. On Tuesday, April 1, 1997, Button broke a three-month
silence and called the woman. She was in a work meeting but took
down his new telephone number and said she would call him back.
Just the day before, Button bought a videocassette recorder and a
videotape of ``Bridges of Madison County,'' one of his favorite
movies. That evening, while the phone never rang, he watched the
movie, about a doomed love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the crash, the woman, unaware of it, tried to
call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dramatic example of a man who seems to have
everything going for him in his life, yet cannot have the woman he
loves passionately,'' the Air Force report concludes. Referring to
the male lead in the movie, it added, ``Did Craig Button see
himself in this Clint Eastwood role?''

PATAKI REJECTS YEAR'S APPEALS FOR CLEMENCY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breaking a longstanding year-end tradition among New York
governors, Gov. George Pataki on Thursday declined to grant
clemency to any of the hundreds of state prison inmates who
petitioned him for early release this year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision represents the first time in Pataki's four years in
office that he has rejected every clemency application from inmates
who claimed that their behavior in prison was so exemplary that
they qualified for early release.
</P>
<P>
   The last governor to reject every clemency appeal made to him
was Gov. Mario Cuomo, in 1989. Inmates who are granted clemency are
immediately eligible for a parole hearing. In the past, the state
Board of Parole has released most of the prisoners whose sentences
were commuted by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, like Cuomo before him, has used his power to grant
clemency sparingly. In 12 years, Cuomo commuted the sentences of 35
prisoners, far fewer than previous governors, like Hugh Carey, who
granted clemency 150 times in eight years. Pataki has granted
clemency to 13 inmates since taking office four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York's governors historically announce grants of clemency
around the holiday season. To be eligible, an inmate must have
served at least half of his or her minimum term and have shown
progress toward rehabilitation or have a terminal illness or a
chronic disability that would be lessened by release from prison.

VOLS' CENTER SET TO RETURN AGAINST UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The curse of the anterior cruciate ligament has struck women's
college basketball again, but fortunately for the University of
Tennessee, the latest injury is less serious than feared.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the left knee
ended the season of Sue Bird, the freshman from New York City who
was starting at point guard for Connecticut (8-0), the nation's
top-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tennessee (9-1), the three-time national champion and ranked
second this season, has lost its starting center, Teresa Geter, for
its game against 15th-ranked Rutgers (9-2) at Madison Square Garden
on Jan. 3, the first appearance of women's collegiate basketball at
the Garden since the 1981-82 season. But Geter is expected to
return for the Vols' game against UConn on Jan. 10 at Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Geter, a 6-foot-3-inch sophomore from Columbia, S.C., hurt her
right knee Monday night during Tennessee's 100-77 victory over
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dr. William Youmans, the school's orthopedic surgeon,
performed arthroscopic surgery to determine whether Geter had a
tear in her anterior cruciate ligament that would need
reconstructive surgery. A complete tear would probably have ended
her season.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Tennessee, Debby Jennings, said that doctors
found the ligament was only stretched. Geter was scheduled to leave
the hospital Friday and is expected to resume practice in two weeks
in anticipation of playing against UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Geter was playing 24 minutes a game and averaging 7.4 points and
5.4 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, meanwhile, will be regaining a player.
</P>
<P>
   Kyra Elzy, a quick 6-1 shooting guard who tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in her right knee last Feb. 1, will return when
the Lady Vols resume practice Sunday.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We made our list and checked it twice, from Tara
Lipinski to Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   We showed it to Santa who was appreciative of our aid; Billy
Hunter got to the elves and convinced them they're underpaid. So
life at the North Pole this year has been especially chilly, like
the fans' reception when the poor Eagles play in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   Santa was subsisting on apple cider and putting in longer days
than Bill Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   With our gift ideas in his hand Santa called for his sleigh;
throwing his sacks in the back he told Rudolph to lead the way.
After making his last delivery Santa looked back; then we heard him
scream ``Unlike Cal Ripken Jr. my streak is intact!''

BASEBALL TO FINE BEESTON OVER CLEMENS' CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens may still be traded, or maybe he won't be, but his
agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays has put Major League Baseball
in the embarrassing position of taking disciplinary action against
its No. 2 official, Paul Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball lawyer said Thursday that officials had already
decided that Beeston, the president and chief operating officer of
Major League Baseball and the former Blue Jays president, will be
fined.
</P>
<P>
   An official declined to confirm or deny that decision, saying it
was the province of Commissioner Bud Selig to announce such
matters, but he suggested that Toronto and other clubs would be
fined for violating established procedures in the Clemens matter.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston and the Blue Jays would be fined for entering into an
agreement when they signed Clemens two years ago that they kept
secret by not submitting it to the American League as part of the
contract. The Blue Jays could also be fined for giving other teams
permission this month to speak to the pitcher and his agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not follow the letter of the law,'' Gord Ash, the Blue
Jays' general manager, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ash declined, however, to acknowledge the existence of the
written, unsubmitted agreement with Clemens. Initially, it was
believed that Beeston had given Clemens only an oral commitment
that the team would trade him if he felt the Blue Jays were not
going to be contenders. But since Clemens asked a few weeks ago to
be traded, the existence of a written agreement has become known.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials said Thursday that the agreement covers five
points. One gives Clemens the right to request a trade; another
gives him the right to approve the team to which he would be
traded. A third gives him the right to request a trade to the
Houston Astros after any season during the four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that right, the officials said, was not spelled
out, but both said it involved the pitcher's agents, Randy and Alan
Hendricks. The officials said Clemens wanted to be able to request
a trade to the Astros in the event the Hendricks brothers, who live
in Houston, bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hendricks, Clemens' chief representative, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said at a news conference in Houston on Tuesday that he
was withdrawing his request to be traded and that he was prepared
to remain with the Blue Jays. However, Ash said he was prepared to
resume talks with interested clubs, though probably not until the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got far enough down the road with a few clubs that we owe
it to ourselves to go back and talk,'' he said by telephone from
his home in Toronto. ``There were players on the table who could
improve the Blue Jays dramatically. But I'm not driven to do
anything that doesn't work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash said he was not part of the original agreement with Clemens,
but, he added, ``My position has been to follow the spirit of the
agreement, which was if Roger asked out, we'd move him.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeston, who traveled to Clemens' home in the Houston area in
December 1996 and persuaded him to choose the Blue Jays over the
Yankees and the Cleveland Indians, declined to comment on any
aspect of the Clemens case. He became baseball's No. 2 official
during the pitcher's first season in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office sent a memo to all clubs last week
reminding them of two policies dealing with the signing and trading
of players: no unreported side deals are permitted and thus are
unenforceable, and clubs cannot talk to another team's signed
player without permission of the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Permission, the memo reminded clubs, is given only if the
player's team reaches agreement with another team on a trade for
the player. Then, if the acquiring club desires, it can get 72
hours to speak to the player and his agent about a new contract or
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hendricks, with the Blue Jays' permission, has spoken with
several teams even though the Blue Jays have not made a deal with
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams could be fined, a baseball official said, because
they continued talking to Hendricks even after they were told to
stop. He declined to identify the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have been perhaps the most aggressive in trying to
acquire Clemens but have balked at the high price, both in players
they would have to give the Blue Jays and in money they would have
to commit in a new contract to Clemens to secure his approval for a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers and the Indians also have been interested. The
Yankees have spoken with the Blue Jays but have been reluctant to
pay the price for Clemens. The Mets also talked to the Blue Jays
but declared themselves out of the running.

men to kick their heroin habits, his sons now urge their pupils to
study and read and sit up straight and not be late.
</P>
<P>
   Where the sons once shot baskets with addicts on a backyard
court, they now do the same with 60 schoolchildren, most of them
poor, some from homes broken by the newer ills of the streets, AIDS
and crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The sons, Ivan and Hans Hageman, grew up in Exodus House, a
residential drug treatment center in East Harlem once run by their
parents, the Rev. Lynn Hageman, who died in October, and his wife,
Leola. Although the family was not wealthy, Ivan and Hans were able
to attend prep school and college with the help of academic
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Ivy League educations and careers in privileged
pockets of the law and education, they have returned and given the
``family business'' a new life. Five years ago, their parents
ailing, the sons took over Exodus House, turning it into a private
middle school called the East Harlem School at Exodus House.
</P>
<P>
   In a converted tenement at 309 East 103rd St., the Hagemans have
blended their unorthodox childhoods, Ivy League educations and
street credentials to create a school that is increasingly drawing
notice from educators for its success in placing poor minority
children in respected public and private high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan and Hans have done a really phenomenal job in designing
and organizing a program for inner-city youth that gets them
focused and excited and enthusiastic about learning,'' said Dan
Levine, admissions director at the Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall School
in Waltham, Mass., a private school that has accepted four Exodus
House students since the school opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That design and organization derive from their unusual
upbringing. As children, they walked in natty prep school uniforms
past addicts on the streets outside their Harlem house. They played
football with John F. Kennedy Jr. at the prestigious Collegiate
School in Manhattan, then came home and played basketball with men
only dimly aware of who he was.
</P>
<P>
   They attended the finest universities _ Princeton, Harvard,
Columbia _ but were always aware that others from their
neighborhood lacked basic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was anger-provoking,'' Ivan Hageman, 39, recalled earlier
this month when discussing his passage through such disparate
worlds, ``because you saw the inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Harlem School, he says, is about erasing that
inequality, about giving disadvantaged children the rigorous
academic preparation that will carry them to success.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus behind the school's founding mirrors that of a
growing number of such efforts nationwide, as entrepreneurial,
maverick educators, underwritten by foundations or private donors,
set up small urban schools that provide poor children with an
alternative to failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Like other independent alternative academies, the East Harlem
School has small classes, none larger than 15 students, and an
unconventional approach, starting with a year-round schedule and
with a school day that runs from 7:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Exodus House addicts lived under strict rules, so do the
East Harlem students, all to keep the focus on learning, the
Hagemans say. To the chagrin of some students, dating is
prohibited. Lateness brings a 45-minute after-school period of
total silence.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are asked to sign their children's homework and forbid
them to watch TV on school days. The students wear uniforms and are
scolded if they slouch at their desks or interrupt one another.
</P>
<P>
   All but five of the students come from families who qualify for
public assistance. Some have lost parents to drugs, disease or
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the staff members are rebounding from the pain of
the streets. Luis Isaac Roman is a high school dropout who was in
and out of jail on drug charges for several years. Now, Roman, 23,
spends mornings as a maintenance worker for the school, and
afternoons as its gym teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The students describe the school as a haven from the fistfights
and neglect they encountered at their former schools, even though
the three hours of homework per night and strict rules take some
getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect a lot from you here,'' said Jason Rodriguez, 13,
an eighth-grader. ``They really emphasize being successful here and
going on to great colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula appears to be working. In the previous school year,
eighth-graders scored well above the national norm on the
Stanford-9 achievement test, a standard examination given in public
schools, and all but one graduate was accepted at a competitive
boarding school or an alternative public high school in New York
City.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lynn and Leola Hageman opened Exodus House in 1963 and moved
their two sons and daughter, Erika, into the building in 1967. In
1984, with government financing for drug treatment programs drying
up, Mrs. Hageman turned Exodus House into an after-school tutoring
center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hans Hageman decided that Exodus House could do more
than supplement the spotty education many children in the
neighborhood were getting. He said he thought he could reach
children in their difficult adolescent years _ fifth through eighth
grades _ when many go astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw sweet kids who wanted to talk things out but at the same
time I was seeing the poor state of education they were
receiving,'' Hageman, 40, recalled of the students he had tutored
as part of his mother's program.
</P>
<P>
   He approached his brother, who had also struggled to reconcile
the privileged education he had enjoyed with the feeling that he
did not deserve so much more than others from his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan was reluctant. More than Hans, he wanted some distance from
home to spread his wings. Besides, he wondered, where would they
get the money?
</P>
<P>
   The Robin Hood Foundation, a charity run by Wall Street business
executives, provided a seed grant of $50,000 to start the school,
in large part at the request of Kennedy, who is on the
organization's board of directors. Last month, the foundation gave
the school an additional $25,000 grant.
</P>
<P>
   The school opened in the fall of 1993 with the two brothers as
teachers and 13 students _ bright but underachieving children who
passed aptitude and creativity exams designed by Ivan Hageman.
</P>
<P>
   The school has grown to include 60 students, four full-time
teachers and a handful of volunteers. Hans is now the executive
director and Ivan the principal.
</P>
<P>
   The school survives on donations to cover its $500,000 annual
operating expenses. Tuition is $1,100 a year, and parents pay what
they can afford based on a sliding scale, a system intended to give
them a sense of ownership of the school, Hans Hageman said. The
brothers do not keep a waiting list but say they turn away a
handful of interested students each year.
</P>
<P>
   From her apartment in the East Harlem School building, Mrs.
Hageman beamed at the thought of what her family had accomplished.
``We always wanted to be role models,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: PHOENIX HELPS SPIRITS RISE ON CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Gaffey remembers everything about last
Christmas, at least the important parts. It was a busy day. He was
in the kitchen cooking dinner for himself and his companions. The
menu included chicken and yams.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more detail:
</P>
<P>
   He was in Rikers Island prison, charged with selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   You could also toss heavy drug use onto his pile of sins. ``I
was a garbage head,'' Gaffey said. ``I did any kind of drug
imaginable. It got to the point where I was robbing from my family,
taking money from my grandmother's bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anything different now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned I'm worth something,'' he replied. ``My life is
not based just on trying to destroy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like a visit from the ghost of Christmas past
in this season of personal stock-taking. It helps you see yourself
more clearly. It helps even more if, like Gaffey, you have managed
to travel far in a year and can see the outlines of a new life
lying just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost cast its spell even on Michael Rossi, who has rejected
Christianity and embraced Islam. ``I really don't believe in
Christmas,'' he said. ``But I believe in hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So do Renee Peters, Danny Rickenbacker and Francisco Valentin.
As Christmas approached, they all sat together at the
drug-treatment residence run by Phoenix House in Long Island City,
Queens, looking back on the personal hell they were in a year ago
and the struggle to get themselves straight.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas Day, Valentin, 33, was also a Rikers inmate, in a
holding pen where dinner was ``a frank or something.'' Rossi, 45,
was in a federal prison, a convicted drug dealer, ``traveled out
and jailed out.'' Ms. Peters, 36, was getting high with a
girlfriend, tossing away money that should have gone to buy her
young son a bicycle. Rickenbacker, 40, was driving a bus but also
fighting a nasty drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs were my priority,'' he said. ``My family was secondary.
Me and my wife went to the store with my credit card to get toys
for my kids. But I maxed out on the card. I couldn't get the kids
what they wanted. I felt bad about that. I know what my parents did
to make me feel good at Christmas, and the guilt made me feel even
worse. So I got high, just to get rid of the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether on their own or at the insistence of a judge, all of
them wound up at Phoenix House, where abstinence from drugs and
alcohol is the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people mistake abstinence for change,'' said Cesar Sosa,
a director at the residence who led the group discussion. ``But it
takes more than that. We have to get them to believe in their
capacity to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peters senses that transformation is under way. ``This is
the first Christmas I'm sober _ I'm serious,'' she said. ``My
family's trusting me now. I'm more caring. Only a selfish person
would take all her money and spend it on getting high.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hopes that he bottomed out last Christmas. ``I felt
numb,'' he said. ``It was horrible, and I was tired of it. I was
tired of disappointing everybody. Most of all, I was tired of
disappointing myself. I'm growing up in here, and it's about time
Francisco grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the residents, there will be no visits with family today.
This weekend, yes, but not on the holiday itself. The potential for
emotional overload is too great, Sosa explained.
</P>
<P>
   But they all know that this may be their most important
Christmas ever. After all, what is the basic message of those
Christmas ghosts in the Dickens fable if not that it is never too
late to change, to shake off the shackles of the past? And if that
sounds a bit corny or melodramatic, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person like myself who has been out of society and has
manipulative ways, he has to see how not to live,'' Rossi said.
Gaffey added: ``Thank God, we are all here, because we could be out
on the street, or in jail, or doing God knows what to satisfy our
deviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, deep down, each of them suspects that this is not
really the most important Christmas. That distinction falls to next
Christmas and where they will be then. Nowhere is it written, they
know, that their lives will be permanently turned around.
</P>
<P>
   But for Valentin, fear of failure is no match for a phone call
from his teen-age son the other day. ``He's a trouper,'' Valentin
said. `` `It's all right, pop,' he said. `Next year's going to be
OK.'''

NO PROGRESS FROM PRIVATE NBA TALK
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without lawyers, players or a public announcement, Commissioner
David Stern and the union director, Billy Hunter, held a secret
meeting Wednesday night in an attempt to salvage the National
Basketball Association season.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, held in the Los Angeles office of Leonard Armato,
the agent for Shaquille O'Neal and Hakeem Olajuwon, was the first
between Stern and Hunter since Dec. 12, when negotiations broke off
after 30 minutes. It came as a surprise since Stern and Hunter were
on vacation and had not revealed that they would meet.
</P>
<P>
   But while the circumstances surrounding the meeting seem to
suggest progress, there was apparently no movement toward ending
what threatens to be the most costly labor dispute in the history
of professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely no progress was made,'' said Brian McIntyre, the
league spokesman. ``The meeting lasted a few hours and nothing
happened. They might meet again this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports reported that the two sides had met again Thursday,
but the league denied it. ``There was not another negotiating
session,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer.
``That didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With Stern and Hunter refusing to budge from their positions,
the sides rehashed the issues that have stifled talks for weeks.
Just hours before the meeting, Stern begrudgingly set a deadline of
Jan. 7 for a settlement to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   If the sides cannot come to an accord by then, Stern will
propose that the league's 29 owners cancel the season at a special
board of governors meeting that day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the urgings of the union, Stern had refused to issue a
deadline. Hunter and numerous players had been calling for a
drop-dead date for weeks in order to create a sense of urgency that
would perhaps force the sides to accelerate the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Wednesday's session could be seen as a step
in that direction, as both Stern and Hunter inconvenienced
themselves to meet. Stern flew in from Aspen, Colo., where he had
been vacationing since last weekend, and Hunter traveled from
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   What role Armato played in getting the two together is unknown,
but he has served as a mediator between Stern and Hunter in the
past, flying to New York a few weeks ago to help the sides convene
for a meeting that produced little progress.
</P>
<P>
   Armato declined to comment on Wednesday's talks. One of the
largest stumbling blocks in negotiations remains the league's
insistence on obtaining cost certainty. The owners have proposed
that players with seven to nine years of experience be limited to
earnings of 30 percent of the salary cap. The figure would increase
to 35 percent for players with at least 10 years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which has agreed in principle to maximum salaries for
players with less than seven years of experience, will not accept
the league's proposed limitations on the older veterans. Meanwhile,
the league will not agree to the minimum salary demands of the
union. For instance, the players want rookies to earn at least
$375,000 a year, but the league is offering $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sides also differ on how to divide the NBA's more than $2
billion of revenue. The owners want to limit the player salaries to
53.5 percent of the basketball-related income, while the players
want 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While no date for another meeting has been set, McIntyre and
Mishkin said the sides may meet over the weekend. ``It's being
discussed but nothing has been scheduled yet,'' Mishkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the next meeting will be in Manhattan and include both
sides' full negotiating committees, or be the fourth tete-a-tete
between Stern and Hunter, is not known. But Jerry Colangelo, the
Phoenix Suns owner and a member of the league's labor relations
committee, said he saw no point in going to New York unless the
sides have determined that progress would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to New York so many times it's ridiculous,''
Colangelo said from his home in Arizona. ``We're prepared to come
back if there's truly, truly something to talk about, but I'm not
interested in any more rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many players, who refuse to believe that the season may
be canceled, Colangelo has become skeptical. His opinion is the
opposite of the 16 star players who competed in last weekend's
``Game on Showtime'' in Atlantic City, and gave assurances that
play would begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been optimistic about what eventually might take
place but I've been wrong more times than not during this whole
process,'' Colangelo said. ``Right now, I'm very pessimistic. The
bottom line is that we're getting down to the wee hours and my
disappointment is big time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Colangelo's fears are realized, the NBA would earn the
distressing distinction of becoming the only major professional
sports league to lose an entire season to labor strife. Even major
league baseball, which has had eight stoppages since 1972 and lost
the 1994 World Series to a players' strike, has never had an entire
season wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to avoid such a disaster, the NBA mailed its latest
proposal to the players last week. Since then, Karl Malone and
Kevin Willis have challenged the union's direction, saying that
Stern's latest offer is a good one. Thursday, Norman Blass, the
agent who represents Mookie Blaylock, Keith Askins and Derrick
McKey, became another discontented voice, telling the Associated
Press that the players should hold a closed vote on the league's
latest proposal. Willis suggested a secret vote Tuesday. &QL;

SAILING ALONE AT CHRISTMAS, BOMBARDED BY ANGRY SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUSAN B. ADAMS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two sailors linked by misfortune and tenacity were battling
mountainous waves Thursday as the 14-yacht fleet pressed on toward
Auckland, New Zealand, and the finish of Leg 2 in the 1998-99
Around Alone race.
</P>
<P>
   The French solo sailor Isabelle Autissier faced gale-force
headwinds in the Southern Ocean as she coaxed her damaged yacht PRB
toward Tasmania for repairs, an Australian Maritime Safety
Authority spokesman told Agence France-Presse on Thursday. And the
American Josh Hall filed a riveting account of the dangers involved
in driving a 60-foot yacht in angry seas.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Autissier, fourth in the 27,000-mile race around
the world, was expected to reach Tasmania late Christmas night to
make emergency repairs to the mainsail and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strange celebration for Isabelle,'' said a spokesman for
Autissier, ``whose only Christmas present will be a piece of new
sail track. But it's a priceless gift because it means she can
continue her voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Autissier intends to set sail to complete the
6,884-nautical mile leg from Cape Town, South Africa to Auckland.
But northerly winds in excess of 33 knots ahead of a cold front due
to pass over Tasmania on Saturday threaten to slow the progress of
a yacht which, because of damage, cannot increase or reduce its
mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will experience, if not gale-force, very close to
gale-force winds tomorrow,'' an Australian Bureau of Meteorology
spokesman said. ``The northerly winds will intensify throughout
tomorrow as the cold front approaches the coast. It could make
headway quite difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   At one stage, Autissier had led the 16 yachts that set out from
Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 26, but she has been substantially set
back by the sail damage and the Tasmanian detour. Two yachts have
dropped out of the fleet, and at last report the leader in Class I,
Giovanni Soldini of Italy, was 1,222 miles from Auckland, with Marc
Thiercelin 237 miles back in second and Mike Golding third.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Autissier was rescued from the Southern Ocean by
the Royal Australian Navy at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $6
million Australian dollars ($3.6 million U.S.) after her yacht was
disabled during the BOC Challenge round the world race.
</P>
<P>
   Like Autissier, Hall lost his boat in the 1994-95 race and had
to be picked up in the mid-Atlantic by the Australian competitor
Alan Nebauer. His current experience sounds similarly demanding:
</P>
<P>
   ``By midnight Tuesday, the yacht had become more of a submarine
as we powered along, surfing on the growing swell, hitting 25-27
knots boat speed,'' Hall said in an e-mail. ``Most of the time,
solid water was gassing across the cabin windows and into the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing down below having to hang on, white-knuckled,
as we hopped, skipped and torpedoed our way into the blackness.
Outside, the amount of solid water sweeping the deck was amazing. I
opened the door to a veritable Niagara Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   As conditions worsened, Hall decided that it was prudent to
lower the mainsail. To accomplish that, he had to crawl out onto
the deck, clip himself to the rail to keep from being thrown
overboard, and loosen a halyard, the line that hoists the sail. The
maneuver proved to be even more harrowing than it sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clipped on and crawled to the mast for the halyard
release,'' Hall wrote. ``As far as the eye could see the black
ocean was slashed with white streaks where waves were breaking. The
sea was angry and the sky screamed at it; this is a raw night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The halyard released, hands almost numb with cold already, I
squirmed around to crawl back and froze as I felt the boat rise
awkwardly to a huge wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of those microseconds that at the time feels like an
age, I knew I was about to get nailed _ hard. I swung to give the
mast a bearhug just in time to meet half the southern Indian Ocean
marching down the foredeck. My white-water ride ended up hard
against the running backstays at the back of the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the experience, Hall remains in high spirits. He is
actually enjoying sailing in the Southern Ocean, tested by what
yachtsmen believe are the world's most challenging nautical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely and utterly awesome down here, not sure if
it's very smart to be here, but it is awesome,'' Hall wrote. ``I do
feel sad that I am missing the run-up to Christmas at home, though.
Our boys will be so excited by now, and I'd like to have seen
that.''

SENATORS URGED TO CONSIDER UNPUBLISHED CLINTON EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE McCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
As U.S. senators consider how to proceed with a trial of President
Clinton, some House members are urging them on with tales of lurid
evidence hidden away in a govern ment office building.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., joined in waving the bloody shirt
Wednes day, volunteering on talk radio that the secret information
portrays Clin ton as a ``sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., is concerned about the fuss over
the mystery evidence because it was excluded from the House
Judiciary Committee report that was used as the basis for
Saturday's vote to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg voted for impeachment but, he said, he did not review
the evidence before he voted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., was one of the congressmen who did
review the evidence. In remarks that ap peared in The Arizona
Republic on Sunday, the day after the impeach ment vote, Salmon
said of his reaction to the material: ``I came away nauseated.
There are things that go far beyond what we've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg said he decided not to look at the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not comfortable with that,'' Shadegg said. ``I'm a
lawyer. I was aware that some arguments could be made that this
material could not be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg declined to discuss the nature of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do so could foreclose the Senate from making an appropriate
decision at some point,'' Shadegg said.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg stopped short of criticizing his colleagues for touting
the mate rial except to say, ``I understand it to be executive
session material.''
</P>
<P>
   Government rules prohibit outside discussion of issues
considered in executive, or secret, session.
</P>
<P>
   The material was supplied to the Judiciary Committee by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr as part of his investigation of
Clinton but was not included in his impeachment report, which
detailed the president's sexual encounters with former White House
aide Monica Lewinsky and subse quent attempts to cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr's evidence was turned over to the Judiciary Committee
in September, entire sections of the Starr report were deemed too
sensi tive for public view and blotted out. The Starr report opened
with a list of explanations for the redactions, including
``national security,'' ``pri vacy'' and ``personal identifying in
formation.'' A fourth category was labeled ``sexual description.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eule, chief of staff for Hayworth, described the secret
files as ``re dacted material that was sent over by the Independent
Counsel's Office. It was redacted by the Judiciary Com mittee to
protect people's privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of
justice, House members were invited to view the materials, which
had been avail able only to the Judiciary Committee in executive
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   None of the congressmen who re viewed the material, which is
under armed guard, was supposed to dis cuss the documents, but at
least one member of Congress has acknowl edged that they contain
unsubstan tiated hearsay accounts of illicit sex dating back 20
years, when Clinton was attorney general of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts are believed to involve several women identified as
``Jane Doe'' in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton
by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state employee who said Clinton asked
her for sex when he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth was Christmas shopping Wednesday when he heard a discus
sion of the secret files on his car radio. He dialed talk-radio
station KFYI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot confirm or deny the content of what is under seal,''
Hayworth said. ``Sadly, it appears that the president of the United
States has a pattern as a sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg would say only that ``it's not going to help his case''
if the material is introduced at a Senate impeachment trial. When
the Senate convenes Jan. 6, members will decide how to proceed and
what evidence to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under criminal procedures, this information might be relevant
or admissible to show absence of mis take, or intent,'' Shadegg
said. ``That's not a judgment for me to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported House
Republican leaders as saying said ``they don't rule out''
introducing new evidence against the president about women other
than Monica Lewinsky in a Senate trial, including the cases of
Kathleen Willey and another woman who claimed to have had an affair
with Clinton. &QL;

OPENER LOOKS LIKE EVENT OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ A new thoroughbred racing year begins Saturday at
Santa Anita Park with the promise of good times ahead, thanks to
dynamic new management, higher purses and expanded simulcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But there's some old business to take care of first. Starting
with the opening-day Malibu Stakes, we may finally identify the
most talented 3-year-old of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-furlong Malibu, the first of 10 Grade I stakes scheduled
for the four-month Santa Anita season, marks the comeback of Golden
Eagle Farms' Event of the Year, the undefeated colt who was favored
to win last May's Kentucky Derby before a training injury knocked
him out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet won the Derby and the Preakness, Victory Gallop beat
Real Quiet in the Belmont, and Coronado's Quest later beat Victory
Gallop; those three are likely to get all the votes for the
3-year-old championship. But many handicappers suspect Event of the
Year was better than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   If that assessment is correct, the son of Seattle Slew should
dominate the soon-to-be 4-year-olds in the Strub Series that
includes the Malibu, the 1 1/16-mile San Fernando Stakes on Jan. 16
and the 1[-mile Strub Stakes on Feb. 6, and should have a good shot
to beat older horses in the March 6 Santa Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big test,'' said Richard Mandella, who has trained
Event of the Year since the summer.
</P>
<P>
   When he was trained by Northern California leader Jerry
Hollendorfer, Event of the Year won three races at Bay Meadows by a
combined 15 lengths, then stepped up and won the Jim Beam Stakes at
Turf Paradise by five lengths while earning the highest Beyer speed
figure (114) of any 3-year-old in the first three months of '98.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year hasn't raced in the nearly nine months since.
He sustained a slab fracture of his right front knee in a workout
eight days before the May 2 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The healing seems to have gone really well,'' Mandella said
this week. ``He couldn't do better than he's been doing in the
morning. The only thing in the back of your mind is that he does
have a (surgical) screw in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can train him and do all that stuff, and you can send him
out in the afternoon and he's not the same. Maybe there's a little
twinge in it and he doesn't want to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year, to be ridden for the first time by Corey
Nakatani, is a 5-2 favorite on the Malibu morning line, ahead of
the coupled entry of Sea of Secrets and Yarrow Brae at 7-2 and
Artax at 4-1. The 11-horse field includes eight stakes winners.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these horses have faced each other before. D. Wayne
Lukas-trained Yarrow Brae was the runner-up when Event of the Year
won the Jim Beam. Sea of Secrets just beat Artax by 8{ lengths at
Hollywood Park in the latter's return from a shin injury received
while finishing 13th in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Artax trainer Randy Bradshaw thinks Sea of the Secrets should be
favored in the Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Event of the Year's coming off a long layoff with serious
injury and has a screw in his knee, so there's a question mark with
him,'' Bradshaw said. ``In my opinion, if Sea of Secrets runs that
same race he ran at Hollywood, he's the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Event of the Year runs anything like his Jim Beam, it
isn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   The $200,000 Malibu will be run as the eighth of nine races on a
noon card Saturday. Santa Anita will be open eight of the next nine
days, with Tuesday the only blank on an opening-week schedule that
features seven stakes with purses of $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-day season, which runs through April 19 with racing most
Wednesdays through Sundays, will begin amid unusual optimism:
</P>
<P>
   _The purchase of Santa Anita earlier this month by industrialist
and horse owner Frank Stronach has eased the worst fears about the
track's future. Stronach says he's committed to keeping Santa Anita
in the racing business while adding stores, restaurants and
amusements to the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making alternate plans for income anymore,'' said
trainer Vladimir Cerin. ``There's renewed hope.''
</P>
<P>
   _The passage in August of a Jan. 1 reduction in state license
fees _ the percentage of wagers collected for taxes _ should
translate into an increase of 8 to 9 percent in average purses. And
that should draw more and better horses to California racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   _The loosening of restrictions on out-of-state simulcasts will
allow California fans to watch and wager starting Jan. 1 on full
programs from Florida (Calder, and later Gulfstream Park) and New
York (Aqueduct, and later Belmont Park).
</P>
<P>
   One symptom of the good feeling _ and another good reason for it
_ is the return to full force of the D. Wayne Lukas barn. The
four-time Eclipse Award-winning trainer said he'll make Santa Anita
his focus this winter after concentrating on Gulfstream last year
and saddling only 15 winners at the major Southern California
tracks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has nominated 21 horses for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, this is the premier meet in the country,''
Lukas said. ``In terms of purse structure and quality of racing,
you just can't beat it.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: MCGWIRE-SOSA AND KINER ELEVATED A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another year of sports television and business is nearly over,
so it's time to revisit my musty notes to see if anything
intelligible shakes out.
</P>
<P>
   BEST STORIES: 1. Beanie Babies take over baseball. 2. National
Football League TV rights sell for $18 billion. 3. Rupert Murdoch
buys Dodgers, and Yankees are nearly bought by Cablevision. 4.
Cleveland Browns sell for $530 million. 5. Islanders vacate Nassau
Coliseum fearing scoreboard would fall. 6. Fox and ESPN scramble to
carry Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race; ESPN shows McGwire's
61st, Fox his 62nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHEN GOLFERS ATTACK!'': No, it's not a new Fox prime-time
show, but Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus testifying, coldly, on
tape against Casey Martin's right to use a golf cart because of his
right leg, which is badly atrophied because of a lifelong
circulatory disease.
</P>
<P>
   INDELIBLE IMAGES: 1. McGwire embracing Roger Maris' family after
his 62nd home run. 2. Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy hanging onto
Alonzo Mourning's leg during wild playoff fracas, looking like a
scarecrow in a tornado. 3. Michael Jordan hitting National
Basketball Association finals-winning shot. 4. Teeth falling from
Warner Wolf's mouth during Channel 2 sportscast. 5. David Wells
wearing a leisure suit on ``Late Show with David Letterman'' after
pitching his perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT: Ted Turner jumps from his seat during an
interview to check his Time Warner stock holdings: ``Ha! I made
$150 million today!''
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE NO SHAME? Upper Deck slices a vintage Babe Ruth bat
into 200 pieces for insertion into trading card backs. Good news:
company says the bat wasn't used for a significant home run. That's
like shredding a speech written by Winston Churchill because it
wasn't the one that coined the term ``Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST AD FOR THERAPY: Keith Olbermann quits 14-month-old news gig
on MSNBC, credits his therapist for making him realize he loved
sports all along (he just hated his old employer, ESPN). So, he
takes a million-dollar deal to become the undisputed anchor star of
Fox Sports News. Somewhere, Jung has scored a biscuit in a basket.
</P>
<P>
   WAITING FOR REPRISALS: No longer National Football League TV
partners, irked NBC and Turner plan a new spring-summer pro
football league that is expected to begin next year. NBC, TNT and
TBS would carry the games, but there is no league title (Revenge
League?), cities (Hell, Michigan, is a start) or nicknames
(Visigoths? Vandals? Ditkas?).
</P>
<P>
   EXPERIENCE _ QUITE A CONCEPT: While players and coaches continue
to move directly from the field to broadcast booths and studios
with uncertain results, ESPN's Solomon Wilcots and Fox Sports Net's
Jackie Slater worked for several years honing their craft. Not
surprisingly, they show polish, poise and personality.
</P>
<P>
   REQUIEM FOR A TOY: Fox retires its glowing puck for NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   FREE FRANK GIFFORD! ABC replaces the Giffer with Boomer Esiason
in the ``Monday Night Football'' booth, then sends Frank to play
nominal role inside a sound-proof booth in new pre-game show from
the ESPN Sports Zone sports bar in Baltimore. Maybe next season,
ABC should let Frank be co-host of the show with Art Donovan, the
loquacious and opinionated former Baltimore Colt. Then put Chris
Berman in the booth.
</P>
<P>
   NETWORK DINING: If ESPN can start the Sport Zone chain, and Fox
can begin a line of airport sports bars, will NBC launch the
Olympic Plausibly Live Restaurant, where meals are served on
tape-delay in time for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   BAD MOVE-GOOD MOVE: NBC hires Isiah Thomas as its No. 1 NBA
analyst (bad move), then hires Doug Collins (good move) in
midseason to join him, then shifts him to the studio show
(potentially good move) if there's an NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   TIMING IS EVERYTHING: With the lockout in force, the NBA opens
posh NBA Store on Fifth Avenue. When greed is the word about
players and owners, why not sell $8,000 Waterford vases etched with
the figure of Larry Bird driving to the basket or $30,000 replica
Bulls championship rings? So far, the store hasn't begun selling
the $250 Patrick Ewing cell phone, which stays glued to your ear
during gritty labor talks.
</P>
<P>
   RETRO REPLAY? The failed bid to revive instant replay for the
NFL playoffs did not include a retroactive attempt to reverse a bad
yard-line spot on a third down run by the Giants' Gifford during
the 1958 championship game won by the Colts, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY FOR 1999: After the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl, ABC's Keith
Jackson will retire as the network laureate of college football.
Who will succeed him? ABC won't say. But if you heard ESPN's Ron
Franklin announce the UCLA-Miami game last month, you'd choose him:
he has style, he calls a solid game and he sounds like Al Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   PROFILE IN COURAGE: Ralph Kiner showed real heart by continuing
to call Mets games for Channel 9 and Fox Sports New York despite
suffering from Bell's Palsy. His voice was slow and distorted, but
he was still the same amusing and insightful Ralphie Boy. He
improved dramatically by season's end. Here's to a full recovery in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And here's to a wonderful holiday season, filled with watching
entirely too much TV.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ JAN SCHLICHTMANN, a lawyer who specializes in cases
involving pollution and the environment, is having trouble keeping
things straight. There is the reality of his own life, and then
there is the slightly spruced-up version, the Hollywood version
that opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened when he visited a film set in Los
Angeles. The scene being filmed was supposed to have taken place in
his office in Boston about 15 years ago. He felt as if he fit right
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing all these boxes and shelves of books and
pleadings all over the floor,'' he said between bites of a green
salad at a Manhattan restaurant the other night, ``and someone
said, `We want Schlichtmann over here,' so I went walking over.''
</P>
<P>
   But reality intruded. The person being summoned was JOHN
TRAVOLTA, who plays Schlichtmann in the film ``A Civil Action,''
which is based on the acclaimed 1995 book by JONATHAN HARR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do look at myself as a character,'' Schlichtmann declared,
adding that reading the book and seeing himself on film have been
``like great therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years have passed since Schlichtmann filed a lawsuit
claiming that industrial pollution was to blame for a cluster of
leukemia deaths among children in Woburn, Mass. The book has been
on the best-seller list for about two years. Schlichtmann said he
has always been comfortable in the spotlight and enjoys revisiting
his past as interpreted by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long since given up proprietary interest in my life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Canapes Lite
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes the price of being an A-list guest is
B-minus eating habits: too many nights of grazing at cocktail
parties where waiters serve hors d'oeuvres that would make a
calorie-, cholesterol- or salt-conscious type _ somebody trying to
lose a few pounds, for example _ think twice about reaching for the
politely offered silver tray.
</P>
<P>
   At a benefit for the National Hypertension Association last
month, the hors d'oeuvres included what the waiters described as
beef Wellington: beef-filled puffs of pastry, heavily salted. The
buffet dinner included roast beef and mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't try to curtail all salt,'' DR. WILLIAM MANGER, a
founder of the association, said. ``One time we did that years ago.
We had practically a saltless dinner, which wasn't too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the food at the party last month, which took place at the
Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue, Manger said, ``I didn't
find any of it salty, but I didn't try every hors d'oeuvre and
didn't try every dish. If it had been for a group of hypertensive
patients, I might have said let's go light on the salt, but you
can't do that to people who go out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center did, with help from some celebrity chefs (and a
celebrity who is also a chef), all of whom set out to demonstrate
that healthful food prepared in large quantities can still taste
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `My patients complain that they go to a lot of
benefits and it's very hard to eat,''' said the director of the
center, DR. ROBIN GOLAND. ``They further point out that one in 12
people have diabetes and there's a lot of heart-healthy food but
next to nothing that's diabetes friendly.
</P>
<P>
   I said, `I wonder if we couldn't interest some chefs in cooking
healthy for diabetes.' That fits into the premise of our center,
which is to live with a chronic illness. We have to work it into
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So she recruited ERIC BLAUBERG from 21, SCOTT BRYAN from Siena
and Indigo, and MICHAEL LAMONACO from Windows on the World. ITZHAK
PERLMAN, better known for his skills with a violin, volunteered a
recipe of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who did not have diabetes, they thought it was
phenomenal food by world-class chefs,'' Goland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who came couldn't believe that this was OK for
people with diabetes, because sometimes they're under the
misapprehension that you need to eat prisoner's rations.
</P>
<P>
   People often delay going to the doctor because they think we're
going to take away the good stuff.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
In another intriguing twist during the course of the 177-day
lockout, NBA commissioner David Stern met with Billy Hunter,
executive director of the National Basketball Players Association,
just hours after Stern set a possible deadline for canceling the
rest of the season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stern and Hunter met late Wednesday in the Los Angeles office of
agent Leonard Armato, who represents Lakers center Shaquille
O'Neal, among others. Stern flew in from Aspen, Colo., where he was
vacationing, and Hunter flew in from Oakland, Calif., where he was
visiting family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we talked is positive because we hadn't spoken
in a week and a half,'' Hunter told Fox Sports on Thursday at Los
Angeles International Airport. ``What we basically did was, we
tried to clear up the negative air that had developed over the last
week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to sit down for a further discussion that might be
meaningful, that might go somewhere. Because we both know time is
running.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meeting between the two in almost two weeks,
but like most of the other meetings, reportedly there was little or
nothing accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely no progress was made,'' said NBA spokesman Brian
McIntyre. ``There may or may not be another meeting over the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   There had better be if the sides want to avoid losing the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is scheduled to deliver a report Jan. 7 to the NBA's Board
of Governors on how the labor-relations committee is faring in its
talks with the union. If he thinks no progress is being made, Stern
will recommend canceling the season on that date.
</P>
<P>
   But if he thinks significant progress has been made toward
reaching a new collective-bargaining agreement, Stern will
recommend allowing the negotiations to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, the NBA never had lost a game because of
labor problems. But since the lockout began July 1, the league has
canceled 360 games, including today's scheduled doubleheader that
would have had New York at Chicago and the Lakers at Phoenix _ the
first games of the season in what was to be NBC's television deal.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout has cost the players $500 million in salaries, and
there is no end in sight. Stern and Hunter are trying to correct
that, attempting to reach a handshake agreement they can take to
their respective negotiating committees.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Armato, who has helped set up at least
one previous meeting between Stern and Hunter, was among a group of
agents rumored to be trying to lobby for a modification of the
proposal Stern mailed to each NBA player last week.
</P>
<P>
   In that deal, only players with a minimum of 10 years of
experience would be eligible for what is called a
maximum-player-salary contract, a seven-year deal worth 35 percent
of the salary cap. Players with less experience _ zero to six years
and seven to nine years _ would be eligible for a maximum of 25
percent and 30 percent of the cap, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But the agents supposedly are lobbying for an NFL-like
franchise-player designation that would make any so-named player,
regardless of experience, eligible for a salary at the 35-percent
level.
</P>
<P>
   The agents are concerned that few 10-year veterans would receive
the highest-paid seven-year deals, so they would like to expand the
number of players eligible for the maximum salary.
</P>
<P>
   So young players such as Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan and Keith Van
Horn would be able to sign rich contracts immediately. The
difference would be tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the numbers in Stern's proposal, Iverson would be
eligible for a seven-year contract at 25 percent of the cap, which
would total $74.5 million _ an average of $10.64 million over seven
years. But if Iverson were able to sign for 35 percent of the cap,
he would get $115.5 million, an average of $16.5 million. Quite a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the franchise-player modification would affect
Stephon Marbury of Minnesota, which has Kevin Garnett signed to a
six-year, $126 million deal. One would assume Garnett would wear
the franchise-player designation for the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal were modified according to the agents' plan, the
young stars _ and their agents _ would be happy. Clearly, something
has to be done, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the union is unhappy with several key points in
Stern's proposal, among them the owners' definition of the
so-called cap hold.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, the salary for a Larry Bird-exception free
agent counted 150 percent against a team's salary cap. Whatever
space remained under the cap when signed players and unsigned
Bird-exception free agents were totaled was how much a team could
offer another's free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new proposal, the cap hold would rise from 150
percent to perhaps 400 percent, meaning teams would have
significantly less room under the cap to sign another team's free
agent, which translates into significantly less freedom of movement
for players.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the lack of middle-class exceptions for
veterans. The owners' proposal sets aside one middle-class
exception, but many in the union think there should be at least
two, fearing many teams will sign players to two or three of the
maximum salaries available (depending on their level of
experience), have a couple of young players slotted into
rookie-level contracts, have the one middle-class exception player
and then fill out the roster with minimum-wage guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to give up the high end,'' said free agent Eddie
Johnson. ``That's not what we're fighting for. We're willing to
give those guys up. But our problem is this: Where is that money
going to go? That's the point. We'll take Patrick Ewing and say,
`OK, you're not going to make $20 million a year. You're going to
make $15 million.' Now, what we say to the owners is, `What are you
going to do with that extra $5 million? Are you going to filter it
down to the middle-range guys or are you just going to pocket it?'
That's the argument right there. That's what we're fighting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those are the minor changes to which Utah's Karl Malone
referred last week when he deemed Stern's proposal fair and
acceptable if it was tweaked.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone answered Stern's talk about possibly ending the
season Jan. 7 by saying: ``If Stern says no season, so be it. I
won't get down on one knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, players such as Toronto's Kevin Willis have talked
about asking Hunter for a secret ballot on Stern's proposal,
believing it will pass, and a handful of agents have been urging
such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Blass, who represents Mookie Blaylock and Derrick McKey,
among others, thinks such a secret ballot would pass by a 2-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have lost half a year's salary,'' Blass said.
``They'll never make that back. So what value is it to them to
continue this? What they are doing to basketball is not helping. I
asked for a closed vote. If the union votes to refuse the last
offer, I'm satisfied. How can Billy Hunter say this deal is no good
for the players? Shouldn't the players decide that?''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Glass, who represents free agent Matt Maloney, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would find an awful lot of players voting selfishly, to
preserve their own particular situation _ without any foresight,
without any understanding of where this is all going,'' Glass said.
``So it would be unfair to put it up for a vote. The union's
responsibility is to represent 410 players _ not only the stars,
not only the middle class, not only those with guaranteed
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a vote to 200 players with guaranteed contracts,
and on one hand you say, `OK, say yes and you'll get your money and
feed your family now, but on the other side, it's a horrible deal
for the future,' what's going to happen? They'll still vote for it.
That's just reality. That's the unfortunate truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In other lockout-related news, Texas District Judge David Medina
scheduled a hearing for Wednesday in Houston on a lawsuit by
Denver's Nick Van Exel, New York's Marcus Camby and Toronto's
Reggie Slater, all of whom have NBA contracts but want to be
cleared to play basketball in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Locked-out players are allowed to go overseas to play, but those
with existing contracts would be forced to return and honor those
contracts should the lockout end.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by agent James Bryant, alleges USA Basketball
is conspiring with the NBA to keep the players from going overseas,
and asks for an injunction against USA Basketball. Bryant would
like the players to play overseas this season and then return as
free agents next season.

MOSS, WITH SKILLS AND STATS, IS VIKINGS' RISING STAR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The play is called ``dot left slot hound right
divide'' and it is not your ordinary football play. That's because
it is often called for Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss,
who is not your ordinary football player.
</P>
<P>
   The play is a deep route for Moss, and no one runs them like he
can. He causes more jaws to drop per catch than any other receiver
in football today. After only 15 career games, Moss is developing
into the Lawrence Taylor of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that play, his 4.3-second speed in the 40-yard dash, a
vertical leap of more than 40 inches, great hands and football
smarts that nicely complement his physical skills, Moss is a
formidable offensive weapon, and the sensation of this year's
National Football League rookie class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already good on offense, but he took us to another
level,'' said coach Dennis Green, whose Vikings are 14-1 heading
into Saturday's game against the Tennessee Oilers. ``He's made us
explosive early, and that takes a team out of its game. They have
to chase us, play catch-up, then our defense gets into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green added: ``I can't think of the last player who has brought
as much excitement to the NFL as a rookie as Randy has. Not only is
he a great athlete, he's a great competitor. He believes he can
lead us to not only one Super Bowl, but a couple of them. How many
rookies have that kind of confidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Compare Moss, who has 64 receptions, to any of the great
receivers in their rookie seasons: Jerry Rice, Lance Alworth, Fred
Biletnikoff, Charlie Joiner, Michael Irvin, Herman Moore, Art Monk,
Cris Carter, Andre Rison, Steve Largent. None had 16 touchdown
catches in their rookie seasons, as Moss does. None had 10
touchdown catches of at least 40 yards, tying Elroy Hirsch's record
set in 1951, as Moss has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   None was close to Moss in receiving yards. With 1,281 yards,
Moss needs 193 Saturday to break the rookie record for receiving
yards, set in 1960 by Bill Groman of the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Vikings crushed Jacksonville last Sunday, 50-10, to
claim home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, Moss was asked
if he is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' he said. ``I just know that when
our offense is clicking, I feel like it's hard to cover me. It's
very hard to cover me.''
</P>
<P>
   What that deep route for Moss boils down to, minus the football
jargon, is quarterback Randall Cunningham using a play-action fake
to the running back, usually Robert Smith, and then throwing the
ball to Moss, who runs as fast as he can, as far as he can,
stretching the defense like a rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   Double-team him, as Green Bay tried unsuccessfully earlier this
season, and he will still outleap the players to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Single cover him? Don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, when we run that play in practice, I just
watch it and enjoy it,'' Cunningham said, ``and I know when we run
it in a game, most of the time it's going for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss' abilities, a great coaching job by Green and his staff,
and depth have made the Vikings the most powerful offense in
football.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has scored a league-high 530 points, and if the
Vikings score 12 against Tennessee _ a virtual certainty _ they
will break the single-season scoring record of 541 points set by
the 1983 Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have scored more points in their last four games _
50, 38, 48 and 46 for a total of 182 _ than any other team in a
four-game stretch in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Moss is a big reason why. But how has Moss, the 21st overall
pick in last year's draft from Marshall University, turned the NFL
into his personal record book? Especially considering the
skepticism that surrounded him before the draft because of his
legal problems in high school and college?
</P>
<P>
   First, it's as simple as talent and size. Moss is 6 feet 4
inches and is often covered by defensive backs who are 4, 5 and
even 6 inches shorter than he is. As Green pointed out, there is
usually a man in Moss' face when the ball is thrown deep, and Moss
just outjumps the defender trying to stick with him. Or Cunningham
will throw the ball short, and Moss will still snag the catch
because he is great at making midair adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Green and Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick
have opened up the playbook. In the past two years, the Vikings
used more conservative formations featuring two backs and two tight
ends. Now, with Moss, they often go to three and four wide
receivers because of the depth at the position with the veterans
Carter and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Moss' physical skills overshadow the fact that he is
becoming a savvy professional. During a recent practice, Moss
corrected a mistake made by the sixth-year wide receiver Chris
Walsh, who was running a route in the wrong direction. Billick said
Moss' football maturity goes beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this season,'' Moss said. ``I feel good
about what I've been able to accomplish. I'll be honest _ I thought
I could have this kind of impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a mentor to Moss, was asked what about Moss has amazed
him. ``I haven't been necessarily amazed,'' Carter said, ``because
I knew he would have a tremendous impact in the NFL, not only
talent-wise, but because of the system we run. He would not have
had the kind of year he has had in, say, New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams don't have the kind of talent we have, or a great
offensive system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Moss excels because he is good, but also because
the Vikings have an abundance of weapons and a system in which its
receivers thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Those weapons include Carter, who this season became just the
third player to record at least 100 career touchdown catches (Rice
and Largent are the others with 163 and 100, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith, the halfback, is healthy and last week
rushed for 101 yards; Andrew Glover is the most underrated tight
end in football; Minnesota's offensive line has played better than
any other except perhaps Denver's, and Reed, who has missed time
recently with a back injury, is a top wide receiver who should be
back for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, because their skill players on offense and defense
are so fast, will be difficult to beat in the post-season. They
have averaged 35.2 points a game on the speedy artificial turf in
the Metrodome and given up only 11.6 points.
</P>
<P>
   The team that faces Minnesota in the playoffs will know that at
some point ``dot left slot hound right divide'' is coming. Knowing
it is one thing, stopping it, and Moss, is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams try these intricate ways to slow Randy and our
offense,'' Cunningham said, ``but I guess you could say what
they've tried hasn't worked very well.''

 By NEAL FARMER  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A group of Houstonians backed by the Touchdown Club of Houston,
Astrodome USA and the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau is
trying to bring a college football bowl to Houston, perhaps as soon
as 1999.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston group has been contacted by Jerry Ippoliti,
commissioner of the Mid-American Conference in Toledo, Ohio, to go
through the application process. Ippoliti started the Motor City
Bowl in Pontiac, Mich., and the Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of filling out the application with the
NCAA,'' Ippoliti said. ``I've visited with people in Houston twice.
I think the process is going well.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Houston group has the necessary $2 million
letter of credit to host a bowl, Ippoliti repeated, ``The process
is going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sources with the Touchdown Club said bank officers have been
interviewed about securing the credit, but that part of the process
is in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   Ippoliti and organizers are optimistic they can bring the bowl
to Houston in 1999, even though the policy of the NCAA football
certification committee is to have bowl organizers wait two years
before the inaugural game.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, local organizers continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at three steps,'' said George Koening, vice
president of sales and marketing for Astrodome USA. ``One, to
identify conferences and tie-ins; two, to work out a TV deal; and
three, then go out and get a title sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Koening said he and Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau
officials have been in contact with NCAA officials about 10 times.
He said the Astrodome tentatively has reserved Dec. 26, 1999, for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Puryear, president of Astrodome USA, said stadium officials
have not made lease arrangements with Ippoliti but have indicated
they are willing to host the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see big-time college football in Houston,''
Puryear said. ``(Ippoliti) is trying to gain conference support,
and if he can gain conference commitments he can get a TV
commitment. Then, he can come back locally and get a sponsor's
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Curry, a Touchdown Club board member and former club
president, said the board has met with Ippoliti twice and that no
one is against the idea, although some are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are very interested in supporting and getting a
college football bowl for Houston,'' Curry said. ``I mean, if Boise
and Shreveport can support a bowl, we should be able to, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry helped run Houston's last bowl, the Bluebonnet Bowl, which
folded in 1987. Curry thought the event was going well until the
game was moved permanently to New Year's Eve in 1976 to satisfy
television needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they stick us with a Dec. 31 bowl, it will go the way of
the Bluebonnet,'' he said. ``I remember when the Bluebonnet was on
a Saturday afternoon and there would be 50,000 a game _ even when
it was outside at Rice Stadium and I froze my butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice University officials also are interested in pursuing a
Houston-based bowl and will help even if the bowl lands at the
Astrodome. Rice associate athletic director Steve Moniaci, who is
in charge of facilities at the school, said Rice officials want to
be part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we would be, since we hosted the Bluebonnet Bowl
before (1959-67 and in 1985),'' Moniaci said. ``We'd be interested
in hosting any bowl that was feasible for the city of Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Koening said the Houston group has contacted officials from the
Western Athletic Conference, Conference USA, the Southeastern
Conference and the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   WAC commissioner Karl Benson said the WAC is interested in the
bowl and is waiting to see what happens. C-USA commissioner Mike
Slive also said he was interested in the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston group includes Harris County officials, because
after April 1, 2000, Harris County becomes the landlord of the
stadium. Shea Guinn, director of sports and conventions for Harris
County, said he attended the two meetings with Ippoliti. Any
commitments past April 1, 2000, will require approval of the
county, Guinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can put together a bowl and we can help with having
the facility available _ and the numbers work for us in terms of
running the place _ we'd love to see it,'' Guinn said. ``That's
kind of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston bowl group, which has been a loose association of
interested parties, recently added the Touchdown Club as a sponsor.
The club has come up with several names for the bowl, with Energy
Bowl the leading contender. Others are Space City Bowl, Azalea
Bowl, Bayou Bowl and Oil Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope,'' said one club member, ``is that Enron or Texaco or
some oil and gas company will sponsor it if it is called the Energy
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bluebonnet Bowl debuted in 1959 when a crowd of 55,000 saw
Clemson defeat TCU 23-7 at Rice Stadium. The game moved to the
Astrodome in 1968 and went out of business following the December
1987 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluebonnet name no longer can be used, because organizers of
the bowl owed money to teams when the bowl folded, and a bowl with
the same name would be liable, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluebonnet Bowl owes approximately $400,000 to four schools.
They are Texas and Pittsburgh, which played the last game in 1987,
and Colorado and Baylor, which played in the 1986 contest.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be a stumbling block for the Houston bowl to be
in place by next December. NCAA football certification committee
policy is to have bowls give proposals in April, followed by
another April presentation the following year, said Mark Jones,
staff liaison to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones says certification has been given after only one year
of the process to the Humanitarian and Motor City bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial application requires two appearances before the NCAA
subcommittee,'' he said. ``There have been cases where exceptions
are made and the committee has granted some waivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the previous waivers was that each bowl just
missed a January deadline to apply for the two-year process, so the
bowls were granted an experimental 1{-year process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know that there is a January deadline to apply
for a bowl if you ask after January,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 21 bowls with 22 games this year, Jones said. The
Jeep Aloha Bowl Christmas Doubleheader Classic is considered one
bowl even though there are two games _ the Aloha and the Oahu, he
said. These do not include preseason games or the Heritage Bowl,
which is a Division I-AA game.
</P>
<P>
   When 10-2 Wyoming was left out of the bowl process in 1996, it
seemed like a good idea to add bowls. In 1997, the NCAA approved
the Humanitarian Bowl and the Motor City Bowl. This year, the Music
City and Oahu bowls will debut.
</P>
<P>
   But there are three other bowls also on track to play in 1999.
They are the Gateway Bowl in St. Louis, the Mardi Gras Bowl in
Mobile, Ala., and the Freedom Bowl in San Francisco or San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If Houston succeeds and joins the bowls in Missouri, Alabama and
California, there will be 26 bowl games, requiring 52 teams. There
were 55 NCAA Division I-A bowl-eligible teams this year. Some
believe that would be too many bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need another bowl like we need another impeachment
hearing,'' Richard Green, a special assistant for the Liberty Bowl
in Memphis, Tenn., told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the edge,'' Ron Guenther, chairman of the NCAA
subcommittee on bowl certification, told the AP. ``I don't think it
would happen, but can you imagine if we had a bowl and no team to
play? Now that would be funny, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said the NCAA has no ceiling on the number of bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who want to put on bowls, and
college football is popular throughout the country,'' Jones said.
``Plus, the bowls do put some positives into the community. I think
the ones that have greater community support have more of a chance
to be successful.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Unless he put on a red-and-white suit and slid down
chimneys last night to drop off presents, Mack Brown would be
hard-pressed to improve his image in the eyes of University of
Texas fans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas came early for UT fans when Brown became head football
coach of the Longhorns late last year. Some would say he hasn't
taken one false step since he took the job, which is no easy task
at a school that places extremely high demands on its football
team.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has led Texas to an 8-3 record and its first Cotton Bowl
appearance since 1991, an amazing turnaround over last season's
4-7. But it's more than just his skill as a coach that has endeared
Brown to the Longhorn faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has a personality that makes Santa Claus look like a
grump, something UT alumni love and something his predecessor, John
Mackovic, never managed. But Brown scoffs when people suggest he
has done everything right in his first year at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mess up every day,'' Brown said. ``But we have enough great
staff members to get things back in line when I do mess up. I'm
really happy here, and I think when you enjoy what you're doing,
things are more positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody who is miserable do a great job in
their job for a long time. I just think happy people have a better
chance of being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be happy when you win, but Brown wasn't sure that
was possible when practice began last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't know what to expect,'' Brown said. ``After
the 4-7 season, the kids struggled some with their confidence
level. In spring practice, we weren't very good. We made some
progress, but you worry about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually goes either really well or really poorly. There's
not usually an in-between with that first year.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived from North Carolina, after leading the Tar Heels
to back-to-back 10-win seasons, Brown's first order of business was
to develop a rapport with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to build up a certain level of communication so you
can get some trust,'' Brown said. ``We knew two of our first three
games were against top-five opponents, so we felt like we would
have a confidence problem with the team early in the season unless
we were better than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's calculations proved correct when the Longhorns took
their lumps at UCLA and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very poorly in the first half against UCLA (a 49-31
loss) and were beaten soundly by Kansas State (48-7),'' Brown said.
``But I think it's a real credit to the assistant coaches and the
kids that they were able to hang together. We kept fighting
throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to go whip a Top 10-ranked Nebraska team on the
road and later defeat a Top 10-ranked Texas A&AMP;M team here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most UT fans see the 20-16 win over Nebraska as the turning
point of the season, but Brown thinks the change came in beating
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Oklahoma was the turning point,'' Brown said. ``At
that time they (the Sooners) were 2-2 and off to a good start, and
it's such a big game for this school. When we were able to beat
them 34-3, I thought it sent a message to the kids that we might be
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I saw confidence in them as a football
team, especially with our defense. It was the first time we played
sound defense and we made some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown could see players starting to believe in themselves by the
time the Longhorns played Nebraska on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we went to Nebraska feeling like we had a
chance to win,'' Brown said. ``But before the Oklahoma game, I
don't think we were sure how good we could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns were better than most people thought they would be
this season _ which will lead to even higher expectations for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Texas always is going to have high
expectations, but we want high expectations,'' Brown said. ``This
(coaching) staff has won 28 games in the last three years, so our
expectations also are very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win, and the truth is we won some games this year
where the team we beat probably was better than we were. We just
want to play the best we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has set a standard that could be hard to equal next year
for a team that loses seven offensive starters, including Heisman
Trophy winner Ricky Williams, All-America guard Ben Adams and
All-Big 12 receiver Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose all the players we're losing on offense and a
team leader like (middle linebacker) Dusty Renfro on defense,
there's no question the challenge is out there,'' Brown said. ``But
I like high expectations because I think it makes the kids play
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to have some players next year step up and play
better than they've ever played in their lives to be able to have a
good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he learned this seasonthat Texas fans are wise, and
reasonable, about what they want from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans in this state appreciate a good game plan
because they understand football,'' Brown said. ``And they also are
smart enough to know UCLA and Kansas State were better teams than
us at that time this year, but as long as we did our best and made
a good effort, they look toward the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans could have turned on us in the second or third week,
but I think they helped us by sticking with us. The thing we wanted
to do this year was have some fun. Three sellouts at the end of the
year were fun.''
</P>
<P>
   College football is fun again in the state, thanks in part to
strong seasons by both the Longhorns and Texas A&AMP;M. Brown said the
ultimate goal for him and Aggies coach R.C. Slocum is to keep the
best Texas high school players in the state for their college
years, and shoot for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``R.C. and I talked about this when I first got here,'' Brown
said. ``We can bring the national championship back to Texas. You
have to be lucky to win all your games, but if you do in the Big
12, then you will be in he hunt for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas State would have been this year if they hadn't lost
their last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is believed to be headed toward its best recruiting haul
of the decade, and A&AMP;M isn't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Brown believes the success of other Division I schools in the
state this season gives high school athletes plenty of choices
without leaving Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason for any kid in Texas to ever look
outside again,'' Brown said. ``Rice came back and played well at
the end of the season; Baylor has a great new coach in Kevin Steele
that I know their fans will be excited about; Texas Tech and TCU
are in bowl games; and SMU is competitive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for us to have all these schools winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brown still plans for the Longhorns to come off with
the cream of the crop among the high school talent. When asked what
he can do for an encore, Brown hopes someday soon Texas will win a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a place where you can do it, and that's what we're
trying to sell,'' Brown said. ``It has been done in the past, and
we have tremendous facilities from which to draw. We have
everything here we need to make a run at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid is concerned about national TV, we have that. If he
is concerned about winning, we have been able to do that. I think
most kids want to stay close to home if they can find what they
want, and that's what we're trying to give them.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Arizona State dealt Texas A&AMP;M a triple dose of bitter medicine last
weekend, but apparently it's a prescription that could make a
healing basketball program vigorous for the remainder of the
1998-99 season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sun Devils on Saturday night came into Reed Arena, the
Aggies' brand-new home, and took the hosts into triple overtime for
only the second time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was a heartbreaking 96-91 loss. But team
confidence and the resolve to achieve beyond expectation through
the rest of the year were galvanized, said 6-8 sophomore Aaron
Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurt as much as anything's hurt us in a while,'' Jack
said Tuesday. ``We had our chances to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting to win those games. We're all disappointed.
I'm sure for the fans it was a great game to watch. It hurt us, but
I thought we did some really good things. We've made a lot of
tremendous strides since last year. I think the main thing is our
mentality, as far as us expecting to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit some big shots and done that sort of thing. I think
we're more mature, (that) our mentality is more of a winning
mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Melvin) Watkins has helped us tremendously with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins is in his first season at A&AMP;M. In only a couple of
months drawing up the X's and O's, he had carried the Aggies to
seven wins (7-1 overall) before meeting the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Aggies' best start in six years. The win total equals
A&AMP;M's entire output for the 1997-98 season, former coach Tony
Barone's last.
</P>
<P>
   Jack said A&AMP;M would have been hard-pressed even to get to three
overtimes in a game last season. But Saturday, said Watkins, isn't
exactly something the Aggies want to hang their hat on.
</P>
<P>
   By no means, the former coach at North Carolina-Charlotte said,
should a triple-overtime loss be considered a moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in moral victories around here,'' he said.
``Surely I was proud of our kids. We kind of wore down there, but
we gave a valiant effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanne Jones led the Aggies with 26 points and seven rebounds.
But Aldine's Jerald Brown, who has had an up-and-down first two
years, may have typified the inspired effort Watkins has spurred
on.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this season, Brown reached double figures
with 19 points, matching his second-highest career total in a game.
</P>
<P>
   He skied for nine rebounds, had two blocked shots and was
3-for-6 from behind the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Watkins has made a huge difference in virtually every
phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team this year, we're focusing in,'' he said. ``We've got
a fresh start, a new coach coming in, bringing a new offense in,
giving us confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stepping up and playing well. (Watkins) has made a great
deal of difference, a big difference. He's given a lot of guys
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more personnel this year, extra bodies. Last year,
we'd get to the midseason or the end of the season and we had only,
like, six bodies who could go out and play. Now, we've got numbers.
We've got guys who can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said he came into the job not knowing what to expect. He
was uncertain of the opponents, uncertain about the talent level he
inherited and aware of a number of team deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a tour through Germany with the Aggies during the summer
didn't have Watkins entirely convinced a sizzling start to the
regular season would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really appreciated the way the kids have responded this
far,'' he said. ``Right now, we're 7-2 and could easily be
undefeated, with a bounce here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, (Saturday's) was a game we could have won and should
have won. But Arizona State, I think, as we move forward, we'll
realize that was a pretty good basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies are on Christmas break and don't return to the court
until Monday. That will be a clash with Southern University of the
Southwestern Athletic Conference in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, said Watkins, the focus will turn in earnest to Big
12 competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players, I think the conference race can be
wide-open,'' he said. ``When we get into the conference, we're
going in saying, `Hey, let's make our mark.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we've got seven wins now, (and) that ties last
year. But that's nothing to rest our hat on. We want to be a
winning program, and we want to start it now, not wait until we
rebuild it.''

LET THE SPIRIT OF GIVING LAST ALL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen them: men crouched in the cold shadow of a downtown
skyscraper, women begging for money to buy food, children abused
and neglected.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the year, they are, maybe, somebody else's problem _
faceless individuals with no name, no address and no connection
with your life. But then the holiday season arrives, and with joy
in your heart, you determine to do what you can to reduce human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   You sign on at the local soup kitchen to help feed them, you
offer clothes for them to wear, buy toys for their children, and
sometimes you even stay long enough to find them a permanent place
to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the holidays are gone, you mysteriously disappear
inside yourself, closing your eyes again to the misery that
remains.
</P>
<P>
   But let's hope next year will be different. Let's hope that when
the last gift has been torn open, when the last glass of champagne
has been raised to toast the New Year, you'll still see the need,
still want to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so blessed with people wanting to give of their time
during the holidays,'' said Priscilla Oglevie, director of
volunteers at the Community Enrichment Center. ``But many times,
the needs are forgotten once the holidays are over. I'd like to see
that same spirit last all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The enrichment center, dedicated to providing emergency food
assistance and homes and guidance for the homeless, is just one of
many nonprofits throughout Tarrant County that rely on community
assistance to do the work that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Family Pathfinders, which assists families making the move off
the state's welfare rolls, and Child Advocates of Tarrant County,
which assists abused and neglected children, join with Oglevie in
her plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A volunteer can critically change the course of history for
these children,'' said Natasha Lawry, volunteer coordinator for
Child Advocates. ``But we're able to serve only about a third of
those in protective custody, because there just aren't enough
volunteers available.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates, Lawry said, speak on behalf of children in protective
custody while the courts decide if and when they can go home.
</P>
<P>
   Because the pool of volunteers is so limited, though, many
children move through the system with little or no support.
</P>
<P>
   The same is often true for families trying to make the
transition from welfare to self-sufficiency, said Kate Hephner,
director of Tarrant County's Pathfinder program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing about poverty is it's isolating,'' Hephner
said. ``So we try to use teams of individuals from civic groups,
businesses, churches and other community organizations to sponsor
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a community that has 2,040 families struggling to get off
welfare rolls, Hephner said that her agency has been able to
recruit only 29 volunteer teams to help.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who say every year that you'd like to help,
want to make a difference, any one of these agencies is your
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Child Advocates, require that you fill out an
application and undergo a background check. For many more, all it
takes is a willing heart and a phone call to sign on to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the volunteer positions that we have here is we
try to reach beyond the physical needs,'' Oglevie said. ``We want
to be God's hands and do his work in these people's lives. It's a
wonderful opportunity to make a true difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And a commitment that lasts.

FAMILY OF MAN IN WILD CHASE IS PERPLEXED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Relatives of Andre Battle, the Georgia truck
driver who led the New Jersey State Police on a wild 67-mile chase
on the Turnpike on Wednesday, said they were at a loss to explain
how a man they know as hard-working and free-spirited could have
become involved in such an incident.
</P>
<P>
   An aunt of Battle in Hazlehurst, Ga., Ophelia Moore, said,
``He's not a fighter. I'm surprised, totally surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Police said the incident began after Battle, 28,
kicked Trooper Anthony Duckett in the head after the trooper
stopped him for speeding _ at 73 mph _ and traveling in the
turnpike's passing lane near Exit 5 in Springfield Township.
</P>
<P>
   After talking briefly with the trooper on the highway shoulder,
Battle returned to his rig's cab to get his license and
registration, the State Police said. A few minutes later, the
trooper told Battle to get out of the cab, officials said. Instead,
he opened the door, kicked the trooper and drove off, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The chase ended at the toll plaza in Carlstadt, as the police
opened fire when Battle tried to turn his 18-wheel rig around and
head back south on the highway, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Another aunt of Battle, Lorene Adams, also of Hazlehurst, Ga.,
said he is fun-loving and not easy to anger. She said she was
perplexed about the origins of the bizarre hourlong chase on the
New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he kicked that policeman, he had to provoke him, and I mean
to provoke him,'' Ms. Adams contended. ``You've got to push him out
of the ordinary to get him mad.''
</P>
<P>
   James Wentz, safety director at Salson Logistics, the Georgia
truck company that hired Battle two months ago, said: ``We've never
had any problem with this man. We just do not understand the
circumstances. I just can't imagine the chain of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Berritto, a retired official with Salson and father of the
current chief executive, Anthony Berritto, called the incident a
``fluky thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at this thing from the outside in and you say, `Why
would a driver who has no record, who is a family man, hit a police
officer if he was stopped?'''
</P>
<P>
   The State Police said they had no additional details to report,
beyond the description of the incident that the state police
superintendent, Col. Carl Williams, provided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state police, Sgt. Al Della Fave, said the
authorities had started considering charges against Battle but
would not file them until investigators better understood why he
had ignored state troopers' orders to stop, both along the route of
the chase and, later, just before it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know his motives and his mind-set,'' Della Fave
said. ``Until we nail that down, we're not going to file charges.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the sergeant said, Battle would be charged with
assaulting Duckett and with attempted murder for crashing into
seven occupied state police vehicles at the toll plaza. Any other
possible charges, Della Fave said, would await more investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how many troopers shot at Battle's truck and
how many bullets were fired. A trooper, Matthew Finnegan, was shot
twice in the foot. The state police have not explained whether he
shot himself or was wounded by other troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Battle's condition improved to fair from critical on Thursday at
the Hackensack University Medical Center. He underwent three hours
of surgery Wednesday for wounds to the neck, chest and arm,
hospital officials said.

   His parents, Willie and Rosezela, of Leesburg, Ga., and his
girlfriend _ the mother of his two children _ visited him at the
hospital Thursday, Ms. Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman, Anne Marie Campbell, said Battle's
parents and his girlfriend would not grant any interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Battle lives with his girlfriend and children, a 9-year-old girl
and 11-month old boy, in Vidalia, Ga., an uncle, Raymond Wallace,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said his nephew paid for the training courses to become
a long-haul trucker and enjoyed the work. ``He liked going from
state to state, to Washington and Florida and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his truck-driving job, Battle worked as a mechanic and in
a factory, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like working inside,'' Ms. Adams said. ``He's got a
chance to travel now. He really liked being out in the open.''

 (Attn: Ohio) AN URBAN SHAMAN BORROWS FROM THE WORLD'S RITUALS  By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Today may be dedicated officially to the Man from
Galilee, but as millions of Americans plug in their Christmas
lights and fire up their Yule logs, Donna Henes knows they will be
paying homage to a much older tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Henes, an ``urban shaman'' and rituals consultant from
Brooklyn, Christmas lights and Hanukkah candles are descended from
primordial ceremonies marking the winter solstice, the darkest day
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas tree is essentially nature worship,'' said Ms.
Henes, who had to stop herself from using the P-word _ pagan _
because ``people have a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ms. Henes (pronounced HEN-ess), 53, won't be spending
much of the day in front of a tinsel-draped fir. ``I celebrate
everything,'' she said, seated in her Brooklyn loft surrounded by
Thai and African icons, an altar to Our Lady of Guadalupe and
shelves of frankincense, patchouli root and other soul-cleansing
substances. Hola the cockatiel squawked, Bud the mutt yapped, and a
chant-and-drum soundtrack added to the other-worldly atmosphere.
Was the recording a Hopi ceremony? ``No, just some New Yorkers
marking the fall equinox,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For 24 years Ms. Henes has been putting city folk in touch with
mother earth. She teaches world religion in public schools,
lectures about planetary abuse, and orchestrates annual
egg-balancing extravaganzas at the World Trade Center to mark the
vernal equinox. She displays a citation from Mayor David N. Dinkins
honoring her skill to communicate ``cosmic consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   But her celestial awareness may have been off kilter on Monday
night, when Ms. Henes and 33 other heathens were detained at a
deserted Staten Island beach as they celebrated the winter solstice
with a bonfire. Charged with trespassing and fined $50 each, they
spent part of the evening at a police precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting,'' said Ms. Henes, who had rented a
yellow school bus and organized the $28-per-person outing
</P>
<P>
   City officials point out that the incident should not be
interpreted as an assault on religious freedom. ``The whole thing
could have been avoided if they had applied for a permit,'' said
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the agency held its own solstice rite across from the
Plaza Hotel that night while a fire marshal kept a close eye on
flames spitting from a modified barbecue. In years past, the Parks
Commissioner, Henry Stern, has attended the event dressed as a
druid.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union, which is asking for the
charges to be dismissed, says the incident reflects the Giuliani
administration's intolerance for those outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's run-in with the police wasn't the first for Ms. Henes;
she tusseled with them frequently during the civil rights and
anti-war battles of the 1960's and 70's. ``Believe me, I've seen
the cops act more obnoxious,'' said Ms. Henes, who speaks with the
flattened vowels of her native Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a scrap metal dealer, was an observant Jew, and her
mother, a real-estate executive, was ``as rational as the day is
long.'' She says she got her first whiff of alternative religion at
her ethically diverse elementary school, which inspired her to
build a private meditation shrine in her attic.
</P>
<P>
   At 18 she moved to New York, traipsed around psychedelic St.
Marks Place, and joined the freedom marches down South. Later she
taught art in the New York City school system.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to the cosmic realm began in 1975, when a friend
gave her an American Indian weaving that she placed over her face.
The resulting revelation, she said, was not unlike Albert
Einstein's discovering the theory of relativity. ``I instantly
understood how everything in the world was interconnected,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Ms. Henes became a full-time shaman, known
by admirers as Mama Donna. She began traveling to the world's more
spiritual landmarks, from Jerusalem to Palenque to Stonehenge, and
visited dozens of cities as a part of her Chants for Peace/Chance
for Peace tour. For a fee, she creates rituals for weddings, baby
namings, memorial services and corporate events. During full and
new moons, she leads drumming rituals in her living room.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, her loft was still strewn with
tambourines, drums and a bucket of sand _ accoutrements from the
previous evening's interrupted event. Ms. Henes wore an embroidered
Nepalese hat, a Mexican scarf and an armful of beaded African
bracelets. Ms. Henes said she was in no mood for vengeance or angry
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to turn what happened into a big political
statement,'' she said, as the weak afternoon light faded.
</P>
<P>
   Does she have anything to say to Mayor Giuliani? ``Merry
Christmas,'' she said. ``And one more thing. It would be lovely if
he dropped the charges.''

FOCUS IS ON UW'S WINNING-SEASON STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Befitting his status as a member of the Pac-10
All-Academic team, Nigel Burton has a certain reverence for
history.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with the little novelty of his Huskies
being part of the NCAA's first bowl doubleheader Friday. That's a
swell thing, but it's a bit like being the first guy to hop on one
leg for 24 hours _ doing something odd just because it's possible
doesn't make the list headed by da Vinci, Gutenberg and Edison
(although it does make the list that includes TV's talking
chihuahua).
</P>
<P>
   Burton's current interest in history is Washington's 21
consecutive football seasons with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   The streak may not inspire chills among the great unwashed, and
it's barely halfway to Notre Dame's record of 42 in a row. But only
10 teams in NCAA history have a longer run. Just two, Nebraska (36)
and Florida State (22), have live streaks longer than the Huskies'.
</P>
<P>
   The UW string is, however, in serious jeopardy. The Air Force
Academy (11-1) is a three-point favorite to shut it down this
afternoon in the first Oahu Bowl, thereby affixing Washington with
a Route 66, for which no kicks are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys don't understand that 6-6 is not a winning
record,'' the senior defensive back and co-captain said of his
teammates. His point is that something of purple value is at stake
in an otherwise frivolous, if colorful, afternoon of holiday
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss changes things to 22 straight non-losing seasons,''
Burton said. ``That's not the same. Over the next couple of
meetings we're going to try to make sure everyone understands that.
It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably the message was conveyed in the few days since he
made the observation. But it's hard to know whether the history
lesson will resonate among a population whose sense of the past is
often confined to phone numbers of former girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, prized as is the streak, it isn't quite as relevant as the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important thing to come from a win would be the
sense that Washington's worst record in 10 years represents the end
of a down cycle and a succession of fifth-place bowls.
</P>
<P>
   It is too much to suggest that this game is a crossroads moment
for the Huskies and coach Jim Lambright. Last year's Aloha Bowl
appearance, a 51-23 win over Michigan State, was bigger, coming as
it did after ugly beatings in two straight postseason games as well
as a string of eggs laid in national TV games. The Lambright regime
needed something good to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The game can be little more than lipstick on a pig of a season,
at least by the lofty UW standards. Playing a schedule rated the
nation's eighth-toughest, the Huskies emerged surpassingly
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Depletions via sanctions and early departures for the NFL left
quarterback Brock Huard with a mediocre line and inexperienced
running backs and wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The decay in Lambright's specialty, defense, was dreadful _ the
298 points surrendered are nearly three times the school record
(101) set in 1991 by the national co-champions and the worst total
since the 2-9 team of 1973 gave up 376.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple failures left Lambright's sometimes curious
playcalling more vulnerable than usual to second-guessing, and
helped keep alive speculation about his fitness to be head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors quietly circulated in the Tyee Club booster group that
some prominent members were sufficiently dismayed with Lambright's
tenure to plot his ouster by attempting to buy out his contract.
But the support of UW president Richard McCormick and athletic
director Barbara Hedges has been steadfast, and the threat has so
far gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   A win would be a rare sign that Lambright can coach his way out
of some trouble, and that his learning curve as a head man is
climaxing. But even a close loss isn't terribly damaging, because
Air Force's slick option offense offers the kind of bedevilment
that has flummoxed teams led by more credentialed coaches than
Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of sanctions provide enough cover that he can
be excused a 6-5 season, just as Don James was. What happens next
year, when four of the five Washington classes will be undamaged by
lost scholarships, is a cleaner test.
</P>
<P>
   With Huard graduating early to the NFL, Lambright will abandon
the ill-fated WAC-style passing attack, which lost its surprise
value after the opener. In Marques Tuiasosopo, the Huskies will
have for the first time since Mark Brunell in 1992 a mobile
quarterback who can do more with less. But even Tuiasosopo knows
greater change must happen elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need,'' he said, ``to get back to UW football _ tough up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen in one bowl game, or in one season. The
Huskies of Christmas 1998 have fallen a considerable way from their
early-decade eminence of three straight Rose Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Which made a Huard remark this week all the more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions at a conference room podium, he paused to
look out a window at a splendid scene of beach, sun and palm trees,
and indulged himself a moment of wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little bit of what Pasadena looks like,'' he said.
``So we're close.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. Not really. But the sentiment was understandable. In
the Husky mindset, a 6-5 season borders on the incomprehensible, so
a grasp at the familiar is made.
</P>
<P>
   And a non-winning season? Well, it's been almost a generation
since anybody's had to try to find the words.
</P>

HUSKIES SURPRISE NEW MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Todd MacCulloch sat blissfully by himself in a corner
of an ecstatic locker room at KeyArena. In his solitude, he was the
most comprehensive statement on what the Washington basketball team
did to 11th-ranked New Mexico Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch, the 7-foot preseason All-American and often a team
spokesman, had 21 points on 9-of-9 shooting and 14 rebounds. But it
took an infusion of big efforts by other Huskies to help bring down
the Lobos, 70-61.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' said MacCulloch, enjoying his peace.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were busy with other quarry:
</P>
<P>
   -- Greg Clark, the sophomore transfer from Long Beach State, got
his first start since high school and the assignment was New
Mexico's Lamont Long, a 24.1-points-per-game scorer who led the
nation until recently. The 6-6 Clark's considerable reach held Long
scoreless on three shots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Grant Leep, a 6-5 freshman from Mount Vernon, was inserted
with 11 minutes left as a stop-gap against New Mexico's gifted
center, Kenny Thomas. Leep shocked the 6,101 in the building by
finishing it out and limiting Thomas to his last four points on a
day when the Lobo star led all scorers with 26.
</P>
<P>
   -- Deon Luton resurrected himself from a miserable offensive day
that at one point found him 2-for-16 on field goals. When he began
taking the ball to the basket in the final seven minutes against
New Mexico's troublesome zone defense, he scored 12 UW points in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Luton _ 0-for-11 on 3-point shots _ connected on his
last basket with 2:19 left on a flying eight-footer at the
baseline, the Huskies (6-3) had a 68-59 lead on the Lobos (8-1) and
were out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier for our kids,'' said UW coach Bob
Bender, ``going on Christmas break with a win over a team like New
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies needed this one a lot more than the Lobos, who
should win plenty in the Western Athletic Conference. Washington,
on the other hand, could ill-afford to carry a fourth loss into a
Pac-10 race that figures to be cut-throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of this team for stepping up and not letting the
opportunity pass,'' said MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard they (the Lobos) hadn't really played anybody, and
this was their first game on the road,'' said Clark. ``We knew this
would be something they weren't used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Luton, the Huskies struggled much of the game on offense,
hitting 2 of 21 treys and shooting .429 overall. But they found
strength in their defense, especially Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Washington with the reputation of a finesse offensive
player, a label he doesn't deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking two years off, the game changed a little bit,'' said a
smiling Clark, brother of Detroit Tigers first baseman Tony Clark.
``I've never worked this hard before. Maybe in the past, I wasn't
willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough scorers. I want to take the role as the leading
defensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark stepped into a void created by Donald Watts' third
straight absence with an ankle sprain. Clark could be an invaluable
resource in conference play, with his ability to take on the
league's prolific off-guards and swing players.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico coach Dave Bliss said Long was rendered less
effective by Thomas rolling onto his ankle late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' Bliss said, ``Lamont didn't seem to have the
same pop and quickness he usually has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas was the whole team today,'' Clark said. ``He needed
somebody else to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies started sluggishly, but MacCulloch gave them 15
first-half points and they broke to a 39-29 halftime lead. Behind
Thomas, and four threes in a span of 5:17 _ their only treys of the
game _ the Lobos struggled back on top, 53-52, with 9:36 left.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, New Mexico seemed to forget about Thomas,
who went 14{ minutes of the second half without a basket.
MacCulloch answered the Lobos with two hoops inside, one on a sweet
feed from Leep, and with 8:06 left, Washington led, 56-53, and New
Mexico called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   But the real boost came at Washington's end. There, UW coaches
tried to hoist Luton up from his doldrums. He was 2 of 15 from the
floor, every shot was looking worse than the previous one, and
Luton was clearly discouraged as Bender and his staff encouraged
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking like, `What else can I do?''' Bender said of
the 6-3 junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely saw my facial expression,'' said Luton. ``I
was a little down on my shot. I never remember missing shots like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   They told him to attack the basket and Luton heard. He had a
layup goal-tended, and he hit two free throws. He drilled a
15-footer from the baseline. And when New Mexico nosed within
62-57, he scored on Washington's next three possessions and the
Huskies were finally secure.
</P>
<P>
   Leep's contribution was huge. He had averaged only five minutes
in the first eight games, and when he went in to guard Thomas, it
seemed a reach. Both Chris Walcott and Thalo Green had three fouls
apiece and the game was wavering from Washington's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to spend a couple of minutes,'' Leep
said, ``and give one of them a break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I come to practice, I love seeing him,'' Bender
said. ``He's always got a smile on his face. He gives you
confidence as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anybody associated with Washington was without a smile.
The Huskies can sleep well before Wednesday's game here with
Portland, assured that if they defend and everybody contributes,
some of last March's stardust is still with them.

TACO BELL SCORES BIG WITH TALKING CHIHUAHUA TOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- He's ugly, he's skinny and he's got ears that
rise straight up like two pointy antennas.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't matter to 9-year-old Shannon Bloom from Canyon
Country, who is the proud owner of the talking stuffed toy
Chihuahua, mascot of Taco Bell's ``Yo quiero Taco Bell''
commercials. She owns the one that says ``Feliz Navidad, amigos''
and is itching to collect the remaining three to complete her set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was Christmasy and I liked it,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   During this holiday season, Americans have gobbled up 13 million
stuffed toy Chihuahuas. Taco Bell has an additional 10 million of
the promotional toys arriving and expects to sell out of them
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The stuffed animals are smaller, cheaper versions of a $15
Chihuahua toy available at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The canine creation was the idea of Applause Inc., a suburban
Woodland Hills-based specialist in producing what the industry
calls ``plush'' toys. Applause designed four styles of the plush
pooch and manufactured 23 million in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   They sell for $2.99 to $3.99 and say four phrases: ``Yo quiero
Taco Bell''; ``Viva gorditas''; ``Here, lizard, lizard''; and
``Feliz Navidad, amigos.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's Aunt Joyce has the complete set, and her grandmother
owns several. Her mother, Trasia Barnes, even knows men who collect
them. She said they especially like the one that says ``Here,
lizard, lizard'' -- a line in a Taco Bell commercial in which the
Chihuahua tried to lure Godzilla with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know wants them,'' said Barnes, with no small
measure of wonder. ``As far as Chihuahuas go, I think they're
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   A fad toy doesn't have to be pleasing to the eye to be
successful. In fact, some are downright ugly, said Charles
Bearchell, emeritus professor of marketing at California State
University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the Cabbage Patch doll,'' he said. ``Even if you've got
an ugly kid, you'll have a doll that's even more ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop shoppers from fighting each other for a
doll.
</P>
<P>
   Furbies are the hot item this holiday season. Beanie Babies were
the fad several months ago, and Tickle Me Elmos were flying off the
shelves last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fads may command high prices while they're hot, but they don't
have staying power. Bearchell estimates that trends fizzle out
between six weeks and about a year or two. To make the odds worse,
for every fad that hits it big, there are hundreds that languish on
the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Take the follow-up to the Hula Hoop. While the hoop became a
sensation, Bearchell said a follow-up toy called Nutty Knotter by
the same manufacturer was a flop. It consisted of a fake head
attached to a cord. By whirling the cord, the player would tie a
knot. Not surprisingly, it didn't strike a chord with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Applause hopes to hit plush-toy gold again soon.
</P>
<P>
   The company is collaborating with Taco Bell's parent, Tricon
Global Restaurants, to make toys for the ``Star Wars'' prequel,
``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause and Taco Bell offices were closed Christmas Eve, and
officials could not be reached for comment. They may have been out
buying toy Chihuahuas.
