<HEADLINE> China's Special Economic Zones Focuses on Hi-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's five special economic zones
(SEZ) -- Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhuhai, and Hainan -- have
taken efforts to develop hi-tech industry so as to hone their
competitive edge in the international marketplaces and build up
the export-oriented local economies.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
province, for instance, has labeled 87 enterprises as in high-tech
sector. The turnover of hi-tech products last year totalled 4.12
billion US dollars, or 28.7 percent of the city's total industrial
turnover.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, a strait away from Taiwan, now has 66 high-tech
enterprises, whose turnover amounted to 12.6 percent of the total
value.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech production turnover of Zhuhai, also in Guangdong,
hit 950 million US dollars last year, accounting for 20 percent of
the city's industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, China's largest special economic zone, has made efforts
to adjust the product mix with high-tech technologies. The island
province has given priorities to the development of
bioengineering, information technology, new materials, energy
resources and environment protection. Some 40 national and
provincial key projects, which developed 98 new products, were
carried out in the province last year.
</P>
<P>
All five SEZs have increased investment in developing the
hi-tech industry. Shantou has put 10 million yuan in research and
development in 1996. Xiamen poured 189 million US dollars in the
technical renovations on the four economic pillars in the city,
including electronic, machine-building, chemical, and electrical
industries.

liberalization policy on information technology (IT) products in
accordance with a declaration adopted at the first WTO ministerial

support South Africa's transition, and was willing to help reform
its justice system, visiting Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Parliament in Cape Town, Ahtisaari said this support
would help South Africa in stepping up the fight against ramapnt
crime, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has been embarked on the road of social harmony
from the very beginning, deserved support other than sympathy from
abroad during the period of transition, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, accompanied by his wife Eeva and several cabinet
ministers, was currently in South Africa on a state visit at the
invitation of President Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Down by 0.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S. fell by
0.3 percent in April, the biggest decline in 10 months, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
212.2 billion U.S. dollars last month compared with a revised 213
billion in March, when sales had been unchanged from February.
</P>
<P>
The April decline was the biggest since a 0.5 percent drop in
last June.
</P>
<P>
The report said that durable goods, items expected to last for
more than three years, were down by 0.5 percent while sales of
nondurable goods were off 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department store sales declined by 0.9 percent in April,
the second consecutive decline. Sales had been down 0.1 percent in
March.
</P>
<P>
Sales of automobiles also dropped 0.9 percent last month
following a 0.3 percent decline in March. The April setback was
the biggest since November of last year.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of total economic
activity in the U.S. and monthly changes are closely watched by
economists for any signals they may provide about the course of
the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
Economic activity was racing ahead in the first three months of
this year, with the gross domestic product expanding at a 5.6
percent annual rate. The rapid growth pushed the unemployment rate
down to a 23-year low of 4.9 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
Fears that the economy might be overheating prompted the U.S.
Federal Reserve to increase interest rates by a quarter percentage
point in March.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Parliament Fails to Pass Law Banning Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
failed to pass a bill banning musical and singing concerts and
fashion shows in public when the bill was brought to a second
voting today.
</P>
<P>
The parliament first passed the bill on May 6 in a session
chaired by speaker Ahmad Al-Saddoun by 26 to two votes with the
cabinet members having abstained in the 50-member National
Assembly. Cabinet members also have right to vote as members of
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill can become law in Kuwait only after two passages
of a majority endorsement in the parliament and the approval by
the Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The legislation bill was opposed by 20 MPs today while 20
others voted in favor and four abstained.
</P>
<P>
On the outset of the voting, Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad stressed that the proposed
law would give Kuwait a wrong impression and untrue vision about
the Kuwaiti society, calling for the withdrawal of the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, offenders would be punished by six
months imprisonment and a fine of a maximum 500 Kuwaiti dinars
(1,650 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members backing the bill insisted that these
activities contradict the rules of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
They are of the opinion that Kuwait is a conservative
society and what "we are after is to save the youth from
the negative affects of such parties."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Benefit Most from Germany's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars took the lead for the
first time in the number of foreign scholars who made use of the
fellowships granted by Germany's Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
to undertake research in Germany in 1996, the foundation announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
Among the total of 1,122 foreign guest-scholars supported by
Humboldt fellowships for studies in Germany in 1996, 145 of them
were from China, followed by the United States with 142, Russia
with 140, India with 103 and Japan with 96, Manfred Osten, the
foundation's general secretary said at a news conference Tuesday
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
According to Osten, the studies in German universities remained
attractive for foreign scholars. Altogether 2,112 foreign
applications were made for the Humboldt fellowships in 1996, up
five percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the guest-scholars opted for a study in the Free
University Berlin and the University Munich, followed by the
universities of Heidelberg, Bonn and Tuebingen.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Berlin in 1860 in memory of the eminent scientist
and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the Humboldt foundation
grants every year up to 500 research fellowships to highly
qualified foreign scholars up to the age of 40 and holding
doctorates, enabling them to undertake long-term periods of
research in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Urges More Interest Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's central bank the Bank of
England warned Tuesday in its quarterly Inflation Report that
another interest rate rise is necessary in the next few months to
keep inflation on target.
</P>
<P>
In its first report since being granted more independence by
the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to set interest
rates, the bank said that interest rates are likely to rise again
soon despite last week's 0.25 percent increase to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that "output growth in the UK is now above trend and
rising" and inflation was "more likely than not" to overshoot the
government's two-year target of 2.5 percent if no further action
is taken.
</P>
<P>
However, it said it would hit its target during the second half
of this year as the current strength of sterling should ensure
inflation is within the government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
Some economists were surprised by what the bank said after the
interest rates were raised just a week ago, but saying that it
showed that the bank was going to do what is necessary.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Gets 150 Million Dollar U.S. Loan for Hydrocarbon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has obtained a 150 million
dollar loan from the United States for exploiting its hydrocarbon
resources, the Algerian news service APS reported today.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed in Washington on Monday between Rita
Rodriguez, the director and interim president of the U.S. bank of
guarantee for export and import, Eximbank, and Ahmed Mostefaoui,
the president of Algeria's state hydrocarbon company, Sonatrach.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which resulted from two years of negotiations between
Algeria and foreign banks, is aimed at helping Algeria increase
the production of hydrocarbon and increase the recovery rate of
hydrocarbon from exploring the gas fields.
</P>
<P>
The APS said that the loan interest rate offered by the
Americans, which is 6.64 percent, is "more interesting" than
that offered by Europeans, which is 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian Minister of Energy Amar Makhloufi said that
Algeria welcomes foreign companies to make more investments in the
country's hydrocarbon explorations through "appropriate fiscal
measures, especially in the geological basins which are attractive
but little explored" in the southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that some contracts on exploration will be
signed pretty soon between Algeria and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the process for selecting hydrocarbon fields to be
explored is underway and that the biddings by foreign companies
for joining these projects are expected to begin this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, Sonatrach has signed contracts with
the British Petroleum, the Italian Agip company, the American Arco
and Anadarko companies, the Spanish Repsol company, the South
Korean Samsung and Kyung-in companies and the Dutch Orange-Nassau
company.
</P>
<P>
Algeria produces 95 percent of its energy products from
hydrocarbon, and earned 12.6 billion U.S. dollars by exporting
these products in 1996.

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Form South Asian Free Trade Area by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KURUMBA, the Maldives, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries
decided here today to turn South Asia into a free trade area by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We've decided that the induction of SAFTA (South Asian Free
Trade Area) be accelerated with 2001 as the target year," Indian
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral told reporters after meeting
with leaders of other South Asian countries this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the South Asian leaders promised to realize the
goal preferably by the year 2000 but not later than 2005.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said the leaders also decided to set up a group of
eminent persons from the region, consisting of two persons from
each SAARC country and the SAARC secretary general, to offer the
vision of SAARC for the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, was established in December 1985 to
promote cooperation in economic and social development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the social sector, the leaders said the heads of the open
universities in SAARC countries should meet to coordinate their
programs of distance education so that their programs can be heard
or seen by more people.
</P>
<P>
They decided that more attention will be given to the question
of the girl child, Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC has declared the decade of 1991-2000 as the "SAARC Decade
of the Girl-Child."
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided to protect the rights of women in the
region and give more attention to a number of questions such as
child prostitution, drinking water and sanitation in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also decided to identify some areas where visa
exemptions can be enforced to make it possible for the people to
travel more freely and tourism and travel can be further
expanded," he added.
</P>
<P>
Steps will be taken to make South Asian leaders meet more
frequently, according to Gujral.
</P>
<P>
A declaration on these decisions is expected to be adopted
before the three-day SAARC summit concludes here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif left the
Maldives this morning for Turkmenistan for a summit of the
Economic Cooperation Organization.

<HEADLINE> UAE Hopes to Maintain OPEC's Oil Output Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
said it hopes members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) can maintain their set oil production quotas
to stabilize the oil market and protect prices.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid
bin Saif al Nasir stressed here today that as one of the OPEC
members, his country would commit itself to its quota of some
2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), the UAE's news agency (WAM)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He also praised other states of the 12-member OPEC who stick to
their quotas, saying the adherence will contribute to shoring up
of the world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after a meeting with current
OPEC president and Libyan Energy Minister Abdullah Salem al Badri
who is visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of his tour to OPEC member states in a bid
to stress the oil producers upon the need for keeping the set
output so as to stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's output quota, with the exception of that of Iraq, was
set in September 1993 at a ceiling of 25.03 million bpd. But the
actual output now is running nearly 2 million barrels a day in
excess of the ceiling because many members are known to have been
exceeding their quotas.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly damaged crude prices which currently hover
around 19 dollars a barrel, sharply dropping from 25 dollars a
barrel in late 1996.

LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labour government is
planning to bring Britain back into United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) after a 12-year
break.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is in Paris to attend a
Western European Union meeting, was quoted by the BBC television
as saying today: "Britain will carry out its long-standing
commitment to return to UNESCO," after it left the UN institution
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, two major contributors to
UNESCO, left the international organization in 1985, complaining
of wasted resources and excessive politicization of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
British diplomatic sources reportedly said that radical reforms
had since been made in the running of UNESCO, and the organization
was now carrying out important work in which Britain wanted to be
involved.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has also indicated it was considering to
rejoin UNESCO, a spokesman for UNESCO said, adding that no
concrete step had been taken partly because of budget problems.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Remains Against Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May (Xinhua) -- The Zambian tourism minister said here today
that his country remains against international ivory trade despite the
fact that some of its neighbors favor limited ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said that lifting the ban on ivory trade will
"open the floodgates to senseless elephant slaughter due to the demand
that this will create".
</P>
<P>
Aambia has no intention of downlisting the elephant from Appendix i
to Appendix ii, which will allow resumption of trade in ivory and
elephant products, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of the elephants in his country has dropped to
between 22,000 and 24,000 today from 250,000 in the early 1960s and his
country has about 220,000 square-kilometre elephant range.
</P>
<P>
The elephant population is far below that the range can sustain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Convention on Internationnal Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) will be held in Harare next month to review the ban
and consider placing the elephant and rhino under appendix two to
allow for restricted trade.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia are among the countries favoring
resuming limited international trade in ivory on the ground that they
have too many elephants and the limited ivory trade can promote the
conservation of the animal. enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Economy to Grow 6 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The new economic strategy,
focusing on a growth of 5 percent in agriculture, 7 percent in
manufacturing and 15 percent in exports, will help place
Pakistan's economy on the growth path of 6 percent next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
This was predicted by Deputy Chairman of the State Planning
Commission Hafeez Pasha at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
While presenting a grim picture of the present state of the
economy, Pasha forecast bright prospects for economic growth, a
decline in budget deficit and an improvement in the balance of
payments in the wake of recently introduced radical reforms.
</P>
<P>
Pasha said agriculture and large-scale manufacturing, the
backbone of the country's economy, have failed to deliver goods
this year with the overall economic situation remaining very
alarming.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture's growth rate may be negative with the major crops
such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat indicating declining trends in
their respective production, according to Pasha.
</P>
<P>
The overall situation on the industrial side, barring little
improvements, is not encouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the balance of payments, the trade deficit is
around 3 billion U.S. dollars with exports likely reaching 9
billion dollars and imports 12 billion dollars, according to
Pasha.
</P>
<P>
The overall current account deficit, he feared, would be around
4 billion to 4.5 billion dollars, about 7 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit has in fact aggravated during the
last two months, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pasha said that in the next fiscal year, the export sector is
expected to grow by 15 percent with imports rising by 5 percent,
bringing the balance of payments deficit down to 2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Exports are likely to reach 10.5 billion dollars against
expected imports worth 12.5 billion dollars during 1997-98,
stabilizing the balance of payments position," Pasha said.
</P>
<P>
With a decline in revenue growth during the current fiscal
year, it is not possible to realize the target of containing the
budget deficit to 4 percent of GDP, he said.

<HEADLINE> Official: EU Interested in Development of Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has an
interest in the development of the on-going U.N.-led proximity
talks between the Greek and Turkish sides in Cyprus, an EU
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, Count Jan d' Ansembourg of the EU
Dutch presidency said "we are cautious when we approach the
whole problem of Cyprus, and have an interest as far as the
Union is concerned in the development of negotiations that are
going on."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel has
been conducting separate meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, preparing the
ground for face-to-face talks, proposed by the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Ansembourg said that the EU hopes that direct negotiations
between Clerides and Denktash will start at the end of June or
the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
The EU official also confirmed that negotiations on Cyprus'
accession to the European body will begin with Cyprus six months
after the intergovernmental conference. He said that "we expect
that these negotiations will start at the beginning of 1998."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch official, accompanied by the EU presidency
representative for the Cyprus problem, Irish ambassador Kester
heaslip, has met with Feissel and U.S. ambassador to Cyprus
Kenneth Brill.
</P>
<P>
They also crossed the Green Line into the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Nicosia to have a meeting with Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The two EU officials were scheduled to meet President
Clerides today, but the appointment was canceled because the
Cypriot president was admitted to hospital for cardiac
examinations earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The EU has played an important role in seeking a solution to
the problem of Cyprus, which has remained unsolved since 1974
when the island was divided after the Turkish troops occupied
its northern part in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Plan of Action Endorsed to Deal with Violence as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at the 50th World Health
Assembly unanimously endorsed an international plan of action to
deal with violence as a public health problem on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the World Health Organization
(WHO), the WHO-developed plan envisages that within the next three
years sufficient and reliable data will be accumulated and used in
the formulation of, and in setting quantifiable targets for the
WHO program on violence prevention and health.
</P>
<P>
Internationally accepted methodology and the strengthening of
national capacities for data collection, analysis and use of
information is required to achieve the first objective mentioned
in the plan: to describe the full public health scope of violence
in different forms and circumstances. It will not be possible to
describe the determinants and consequences of violence or to
evaluate the effectiveness of specific policies and interventions
without the establishment of adequate international and national
information systems.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action was prepared at the request of the World
Health Assembly, WHO's highest governing body. In May 1996, the
governing body asked WHO's director-general "to initiate public
health activities to address the problem of violence". As a
result, a special Task Force on violence and health was
established. Since then, WHO has collaborated with the United
Nations system on a study of the effects of armed conflicts on
children, prepared jointly with the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees, a manual on the mental health of refugees, and has
established working relations with the United Nations Crime
Prevention and Criminal Justice Division in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
According to the endorsed plan of action, the final draft of
the International Classification for External Causes of Injury
will be presented at the WHO-sponsored international conference on
injury prevention in 1998. After wide evaluation, it will be
finalized as an essential tool for monitoring and surveillance.
Besides, the plan also provides for an active dialogue on violence
among public health authorities, criminal justice systems and
nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Violence claims at least 3.5 million lives a year and escalated
considerably in the early 1990s, according to WHO. Today, when
economic crises are stifling national economies in many countries,
injuries of all kinds, resulting from violence, cost the world
community almost 500 billion U.S. dollars a year in medical care
and lost productivity.

<HEADLINE> ECOSOC Expects Moderate Economic Growth in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Economy in western Europe
will show a moderate improvement this year while the growth in
eastern Europe will slow to about 3.5 percent from 4 percent in
1996, according to a report of a UN commission.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the Economic Commission for Europe of
the UN Economic and Social Council said that the gross domestic
product in western Europe is expected to grow just under 2.5
percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 1996. The growth will make
not much difference to current levels of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The commission, also covering north America, reported that the
United States GDP growth is pointing to a further slight
acceleration to 2.5 percent after seven years expansion. GDP
registered a 2.4 percent increase in the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of economic growth in eastern Europe mainly
reflects developments in south-eastern Europe where tough
stabilization programs are expected to produce falls in GDP in
Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Relatively strong growth, about 4-6 percent, are expected to be
maintained in Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia; and
the economy in Hungary should pick up after a successful
stabilization program. The recovery in the Baltic States is also
expected to continue, with a growth rates of 3.5-5 percent in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the short economic outlook for Russia remains
extremely difficult. Though the government expects a modest upturn
of 2 percent in GDP in 1997, many Russian economists think a zero
growth, bringing to an end the seven-year decline, might be the
best to hope for. Russia witnessed a 6 percent decline in 1996
while many of other CIS members show recoveries, according to the
report.

Three domestic staff were also there. The armed men stole money

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Interested in Upgrading Ties With Iran: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is interested in
upgrading its relations with Iran to political level, visiting
Iranian Economic and Financial Affairs Minister Morteza
Mohammad Khan said here today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Kuwaiti leaders today, the Iranian minister said
that he noticed during his talks with Kuwaiti Amir Kuwait's
keenness on promoting and upgrading economic and commercial
relations to the level of political relations, according to the
official Kuwait News Agency. But He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a Shiite Islamic Gulf neighbor across the strait, has
been on strained relations with the Gulf Arab countries as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Khan, who arrived here Sunday on a four-day official visit,
said his talks with Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan
today focused on an agreement to avoid dual taxation and a
similar agreement aimed at encouraging bilateral investments.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also said his country was ready to allow
the transit passage of products from Kuwait to central Asian
republics.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks also touched on facilities extended by local
banks to promote trade relations between the two countries,
adding that a bilateral technical committee was currently
discussing the different aspects of this particular issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that several sub-committees grouping commerce and
industry chambers, central banks officials and private sector
representatives were also meeting to discuss ways of promoting
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Talks covering the completion of a 70 million U.S. dollars
steel project between Iran and Kuwait are expected to be held
Wednesday, although procedures still need long time to finish,
official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran have expressed an ardent desire to strengthen
further their relations through exchanging delegations in
various fields since 1991 when their ties were improved after
Iran took a neutral stand in the 1991 U.S.-led Gulf War to free
Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Iranian relations have witnessed a remarkable
development during recent years, especially since the beginning
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two way trade volume has increased from 120 million
dollars in 1991 to 400 million dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' ambassadors abroad will
be more involved in promoting the island's economic interests
especially on tourism in their host countries, Minister of
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Kyriakos Christofi said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after a meeting with Cypriot
ambassadors abroad and Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO)
officials, during which they discussed a number of measures
aimed at strengthening the ambassadors contribution to Cyprus'
trade and tourism strategy.
</P>
<P>
Christofi said the embassies' role must be enhanced in order
to comprise issues related to trade and tourism in view of the
intensified international competition.
</P>
<P>
"We examined ways for better and closer co-operation between
our trade and tourism offices abroad, and our respective
embassies," Christofi said, adding that "we have concluded that
this co-operation is satisfactory but there are prospects for
further improvement."
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island attracts more than 2
million foreign tourists every year, earning about 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, income from tourism represented 36.8 percent of the
total revenue from the export of goods and services together.

<HEADLINE> German General Election to Be Held on September 27, 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's political parties agreed
today in principle to hold the country's next general election on
September 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Franz Muentefering, General Secretary of the main opposition
party in Bonn, the Social Democrats (SPD), said Tuesday that his
party welcomed the election date proposed by the ruling coalition
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its
Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the
junior partner the Free Democrats (FDP).
</P>
<P>
But he also made clear that the SPD would favor an even earlier
date.
</P>
<P>
Under German laws, the general election date will be officially
decided by German president.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Kohl already announced in April that he would run
for an unprecedented fifth term, defying opinion polls showing
that a majority of Germans want him to retire from politics.
</P>
<P>
The SPD meanwhile says that it will not make a decision on its
own candidate until early next year. The party leader Oskar
Lafontaine and his rival, Gerhard Schroeder, the state premier of
Lower Saxony, are widely expected as the most likely SPD
challengers to Kohl.

HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- World Conservation Union today
deplored rampant deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa which they
said will remain a problem until dependence on agriculture
controlled.
</P>
<P>
At the 15th Commonwealth forestry conference held in Victoria

Katerere said cultivatable land continued to expand into forests
and marginal areas for excessively encouraging farmers to grow
maize for the sake of creating food security.

<P>
"The critical issue is that land and forest matters are being
dealt with quite distinctly as if forests do not contribute to
food security," he said.
</P>

Katerere said forests offered multiple benefits which needed
to be balanced against other demands through integrated land

JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About 220 million African
people, or one third of inhabitants on the continent, live in
absolute poverty, according to a latest report released here
today by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Poverty in Africa has reached alarming proportions and the
situation is still worsening, said the report presented at a
regional forum on the eradication of poverty in southern Africa
held in Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the number of Africa's poor is expected to
rise to 300 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 47 countries classified as being the poorest in the
world, 32 are in Africa, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It cited conflicts and wars, economic mismanagement, debt and
the refugee burden as some of the reasons behind the
impoverishment of the Africans.
</P>
<P>
Due to deepening conflicts, economic difficulties and poverty,
Africa now shoulders a foreign debt burden of about 320 billion
U.S. Dollars.

HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean government official
has appealed for more financial resources to help the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare fight the Aids pandemic and other
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliamentarians in Harare today, Deputy Minister of
Health and Child Welfare Tsungirirayi Hungwe said the government
should show its commitment to coming to grips with illnesses which
had become common in the country.
</P>
<P>
''If we are to sustain both the quality and quantity of health
care... the government has to allocate at least 18 US dollars
per capita for health services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the government should commit a separate budget to boost
the operations of the National Aids Coordinating Program in its efforts
to combat the spread of the Hiv/Aids pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Zimbabwe claim Aids was killing an estimated 500 people
a week and more than 25 percent of the sexually active population in
Zimbabwe was said to be Hiv positive.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the epidemic, she said, tuberculosis was now a
major cause of illness and death in Zimbabwe with more than 35,000

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier: Sino-Tanzanian Cooperation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here today that further development of the Sino-Tanzanian
eocnomic and trade cooperation should not be confined to the model
of purely giving free aid.
</P>
<P>
At a brief meeting with the press held jointly with Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa here this morning, Li Peng said enterprises
of the two countries should be given full play in conducting
cooperation of mutual benefit to push the economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li said China had given some amount of economic aid to Tanzania
in the past, which mirrored the friendliness of the Chinese people
to the Tanzanian people.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Tanzanian friendship has a long history and the
two countries have enjoyed good and effective cooperation for a long
time in the past. He expressed the confidence that his visit to
Tanzania will further consolidate and develop the existing
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said new ways should be explored to expand bilateral
cooperation as great changes have taken place in international
situation and that encouraging enterprises of the two countries
to develop cooperation in multiple forms including the
establishment of joint ventures could help Tanzania develop
its economy and also benefit the Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side will provide Tanzanian partners with
technology and management skill without any reservation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with the press, Mkapa said that with the end of
the colonialist rule and apartheid, Africa is now confronted with a
challenge of speeding up economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa is now waging a war against poverty, whose initial
goal is to help the African people attain self-reliance and the
final goal is to achieve sustained development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa cannot attain the goals by relying entirely
external aid. African countries should rely mainly on their own
efforts and on consolidated regional cooperation and south-south
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his government will be devoted to the unity and
stability and sustained development of Tanzania in leading the
country to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that Tanzania will continue to develop
cooperation with the governments and communities of all friendly
countries, especially China.
</P>
<P>
Before answering questions, both Li Peng and Mkapa expressed
their satisfaction over the results of their talks held this
morning.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations office in Iran
said here today the death toll from the killer earthquake in
east Iran last Saturday stood at 1,560 and the injured at 2,180.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Information Center said in a statement that the
official figures were presented by the Disaster Task Force of
Iran's Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The center said that 148 villages were destroyed between 20
to 100 percent leaving 10,000 families or about 50,000 people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Rasoul Zargar, head of the headquarters in charge of the
Natural Disasters in Iran, criticized what he called contradictory
and unrealistic reports by local media on the number of casualties
by the quake last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run television last night reported that the death
toll rose to 4,000 in two regions of Qaen and Birjand, about 800
kilometers east of Tehran, capital of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The official said that release of unofficial figures will
entail unfavorable consequences.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. center also said the international assistance
amounted to 3.3 million U.S. dollars, including 810,000 dollars
from the U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
It said that a U.N. team is still visiting southern Khorasan
province to assess the extent of the damages caused by the massive
quake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has already appealed to the international community
for assistance to the quake victims following a request by the

<HEADLINE> Mobutu-Kabila Peace Talks to Be Held as Scheduled </HEADLINE>

<P>
(bu Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's President Mobutu Sese
Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila have both promised to attend
Wednesday's peace talks aboard the South African vessel the
Outeniqua, South Africa confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Naidoo, spokesman for South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, said Mobutu and Kabila gave the promise earlier
today when they had telephone conversation with South African
President Nelson Mandela, mediator of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, a key figure in Africa's attempts to mediate a peaceful
solution to the Zairean conflict, has already left for the
ice-breaker near Pointe Noire, a Congolese port.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting could be the last chance to find a
negotiated solution to Zaire's seven-month civil war.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu and Kabila had their first face-to-face talks aboard
the ship on May 4, but the meeting proved inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who will leave Cape Town tomorrow morning to preside
over the talks, told the press today that he was confident South
Africa's peace efforts in Zaire would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire led by Kabila, refused any pleading of ceasefire
during the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said the rebel forces had crossed the Kwango
River and rapidly marched on towards the capital Kinshasa after
fighting the biggest, and perhaps the only serious battle of the
seven-month war at Kenge, 268 km east of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war began in October 1996, the rebels have
controlled over 80 percent of the territory of Zaire, leaving
Kinshasa the last city still in the hands of Mobutu's government
troops.

PARIS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- France will send a group of experts
Friday to Kisangani, eastern Zaire, to study the situation of
Rwandan refugees stranded there and give advice to Zairian rebels
on how to repatriate them.
</P>
<P>
These experts, who are invited by Zairian rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila, will visit the refugees in the Biaro
refugee camp 40 kilometers from Kisangani, said officials.
</P>
<P>
They will make sure that the refugees arrive in Kisangani for
being repatriated back home.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 refugees have always been staying in the Biaro
refugee camp since Kisangani fell to the rebels in March.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has reportedly promised to let the French experts "have
an entire liberty in their observation and proposal-making."
</P>
<P>
Kabila invited the French to join the repatriation because he
wanted to improve relations with France, which remains hostile to
him.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's commissioner for humanitarian affairs Emma
Bonino last week accused the rebels of turning the territory under
their control into a land of barbarity and deliberately preventing
humanitarian workers from fulfilling their mission.

WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is deporting
illegal immigrants at a record pace, removing 42,426 in the first
six months of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Tuesday that
more than half of the deported immigrants, 23,290, had been
convicted of aggravated crimes such as murder, rape or armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have been stressing in recent months amid
heightened concern here and abroad that a tough new immigration
law will result in massive sweeps.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton assured his central American
counterparts during a visit to Costa Rica last week that "There
will be no mass deportations or targeting of Central Americans
under this law."
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service aims to remove
93,000 undocumented aliens from the United States this year, up
from nearly 69,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Even so, some lawmakers are complaining that too little is
being done.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrant population is estimated at five million,
a number that swells by some 275,000 each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and visiting Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov today
reached agreement on some issues, but not on the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"After a morning of talks, it's clear that Minister Rodionov
and I share common views on several important issues," Cohen told
a joint press conference at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed to a contract to build a plant in
Perm, Russia, to destroy rocket motor cases and missile canisters
from 410 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The 52.4 million U.S. dollars contract to Lockheed Martin will
employ Russian workers, and the project is being funded by the
Nunn-Lugar program that is helping former Soviet states reduce
their strategic offensive arms.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the United States and Russia should reduce
strategic nuclear forces further, " Cohen said. "We agree on the
need to reduce chemical weapons as a threat."
</P>
<P>
Rodionov said his meeting with Cohen has "very dynamic start,
and very concrete issues are under consideration."
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic about the possibility of a long-term
cooperation in the field of reforming of the armed forces and
training of military personnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides stressed that the two sides still sharply
differ on NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov reiterated that the alliance's move is "a mistake"
and "this problem may actually damage our relationship." Cohen
said, "We agreed to disagree."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on a report that malfunctions have caused
Russia's nuclear missiles into "combat mode", Rodionov said, "The
safety of our nuclear arsenal will never decrease."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say that we do experience some shortages, in

Forces have the same level of funding as they used to have for

<HEADLINE> Shortfalls in Population Aid May Have Dire Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Shortfalls in promised
population assistance to developing countries will result in at
least 120 million additional unwanted pregnancies, 49 million
abortions, 5 million deaths of infants and young children and
65,000 maternal deaths over the period 1995-2000, a UN official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nafis Sadic, Executive Director of the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA), said at a press conference here while
developing countries continue to increase allocations for
reproductive health, international assistance has stagnated in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
In releasing a report on consequences of resource shortfalls up
to the year 2000, she noted that at the International Conference
on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994 in Cairo, the
countries of the world signed on to a bold program to address
global population issues and promote human-centered development.
</P>
<P>
The Program of Action laid out a scenario for mobilizing the
resources needed to implement the population and reproductive
health package over the 1995-2015 period. At the ICPD, the
developing countries and countries in transition agreed to pay two
thirds of the spending on population and reproductive health,
while the donor countries would pay the remainder. The funds
needed for these programs will rise to 17 billion dollars in 2000
and 21.7 billion dollars in 2015, of which donor countries are
expected to contribute 5.7 billion dollars and 7.2 billion dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the latest year for which data are available,
developing countries spent around 7.5 billion dollars on such
programs and the international assistance contributed another 2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Donor spending increased by 40 percent in 1994 and by the same
percentage in 1995. But this momentum appears to have stopped and
1996 showed little or no increase. To reach the agreed target of
5.7 billion dollars in 2000, donor assistance must increase by 23
percent each year until 2000, she said.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that only the consequences of underfunding
family planning services were analyzed quantitatively. Further
reproductive health consequences cannot be quantified at this
preliminary stage. These include the extra millions of families
affected by deaths and illness due to sexually transmitted
diseases and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The ICPD goals can be reached only if all countries do their
part. We must count on donor countries to meet the commitments
they made in Cairo. If they do not, millions of women, and their
children, will suffer needlessly," she stressed.

CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait has started the building of three
private steel mills with a total designed annual production
capacity of 478,887 tonnes of steel after their completion.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Public Authority for Industry Naser
Al-Ajeil said one of the steel works will produce 50,000 tonnes
of iron out of scraps, the second with the capacity of 128,887
tonnes with materials to be imported from Saudi Arabia, while
the third will turn out 300,000 tonnes out of raw materials from
Iran and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The products of these privately-owned works are expected to
be consumed by the domestic market in the country.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation now has a steel
mill in Bahrain with a production capacity of 4 million tonnes a
year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will be subject to a range of World Trade
Organization (WTO) sanctions if it continues to fail to protect
intellectual property rights (IPR), said Egypt's largest English
business magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Business Monthly reported in its May issue that the WTO
message has been delivered recently at a conference organized by
the software industry group Business Software Alliance
International (BSA) here.
</P>
<P>
Brian McEachren, senior corporate attorney for Microsoft and a
vice-president of BSA International, joined by two other vice-
presidents, expressed discontent with the fact that piracy
consumes an estimated 80 percent of Egypt's 100 million
U.S. dollars software market a year.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply and Trade Ahmed Goweili, who is
responsible for IPR protection in the country, has agreed to
resume the raids on software pirates, which he canceled under
pressure from businesses last summer.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) said it hopes
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) can maintain their set oil production quotas to stabilize
the oil market and protect prices.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid
bin Saif al Nasir stressed here today that as one of the OPEC
members, his country would commit itself to its quota of some 2.2
million barrels per day (bpd), the UAE's news agency (WAM)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He also praised other states of the 12-member OPEC who stick
to their quotas, saying the adherence will contribute to shoring
up of the world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after a meeting here with
current OPEC president and Libyan Energy Minister Abdullah Salem
al Badri who is on a tour to OPEC member states in a bid to
stress the oil producers upon the need for keeping the set
output so as to stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's output quota, with the exception of that of Iraq, was
set in September 1993 at a ceiling of 25.03 million bpd. But the
actual output now is running nearly 2 million barrels a day in
excess of the ceiling because many members are known to have been
exceeding their quotas.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly damaged crude prices which currently hover
around 19 dollars a barrel, sharply dropping from 25 dollars a
barrel in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Middle East Economy Survey (MEES) reported that
more that 450 U.S. companies, including major oil companies, have
set up a front to stand against sanctions applied by Washington
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The firms operating in the financial and agricultural sectors
underlined their determination to rise strongly against the U.S.
unilateral sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It added that 11 major oil companies at the U.S. Petroleum
Institute joined in the move.

<P>
PARIS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU)
today decided to send a police advisors team to Albania to
implement the peace mission of the Multinational Protection Force
(MPF) and help Albania reorganize police force and restore order.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers and foreign ministers of nine WEU

They adopted a decision by the WEU's permanent council to
"deploy rapidly" the police advisors team, called Multinational
Advisory Police Element (MAPE), which will be consisted of some 20
police officers from WEU countries and headed by French colonel
Gilles Janvier.
</P>
<P>
A forerunner group of the MAPE arrived in Tirana today to make
a preliminary evaluation of the situation, said WEU's permanent
council in communique today.
</P>
<P>
"The MAPE will give the Albanian police authorities the
necessary information and advice on appropriate aspects of
policing and restoring order, as well as on their responsibilities
in the (parliament) electoral process (in late June)," said the
WEU ministers in a declaration.
</P>
<P>
According to WEU officials, the MAPE will respond to the needs
for advice, training and support presented by the Albanian
police, and will help the latter in the fields of organization,
maintaining public order, supervision of borders, logistics and
transfers.
</P>
<P>
The WEU defense and foreign ministers today again called for a
political settlement to the Albanian crisis and the holding of
"early, free and fair parliamentary elections" by the end of
June.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Tries to Defuse Domestic Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Clearly wary of the rising
political tension, Islamic Turkish Prime Minister Necemttin
Erabkan reiterated today that Turkey's secularism and democracy
brooked no change.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his ruling Welfare Party (RP) parliamentary group,
Erbakan said Turkey was a democratic country while is based on the
supremacy of the law.
</P>
<P>
"I say this openly: Turkey will neither become an Algeria nor
will it become an Iran. Everyone must know this very well," the
Islamic leader said in his speech, adding that the values of
secularism have taken root over the years.
</P>
<P>
In the cases of Algeria and Iran, Erbakan appeared to be
indicating that Turkey would not be plunged into a nationwide
political turmoil due to ideology clash and would not be ruled
by the Islamic Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
"Let no one abuse the army for the sake of their own
interests. Where the nation is, there the army is. All of
our commanders are faithful people," Erbakan said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the Islamic leader made the remarks in
an effort to defuse the current tension, particularly between
his supporters and the military.
</P>

partner, True Path Party and the military.

NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
to spend 375 million Shillings (seven million U.S. Dollars) on
electrifying 170 coffee plants throughout the country within the

The electrified factories will be more efficient and
lower-cost than those using diesel or patrol when pulping coffee
berries and thus can ensure higher quality of coffee for local
consumption and export, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Employers Offer Talks With Builders After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's federation of building
employers today offered to reopen wage talks with trade unions
after workers Monday threatened a strike to demand full sick pay
as part of a new wage accord.
</P>
<P>
Peter Huber, an employers' negotiator, told reporters here that
the industry was willing to reopen talks under mediation. The main
German construction union, IG Bau, Monday vowed to call on the
country's 1.3 million building workers to strike in objection to a
proposed wage accord reached by negotiators last week.
</P>
<P>
According to the union, building workers would vote on a strike
in early June if employers did not include full sick pay in the
new wage deal by May 21.
</P>
<P>
The threat was provoked by a government-mandated cut in sick
pay to 80 percent of regular pay during the first three weeks of
an employee's illness. Full sick pay is common in any other sector
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Urban Development Minister Klaus Toepfer has said a
strike would be "poison" for the construction industry that is in
recession. Analysts expect more companies to collapse as the
recession continues.

<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
extended their recent strong rally and ended sharply higher today
despite Wall Street's opening decline, with London and Frankfurt
both finishing at record closing highs.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market consolidated record gains
as Wall Street was dragged back by weak US Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Motivated by the Dow's 1.72 percent surge Monday, the FTSE 100
index had broken through the 4,700 barrier earlier today to set a
new intra-day high at 4,720.3 before ending at 4,691.0, still 21.4
points or 0.46 percent up on the day.
</P>
<P>
This was the 11th consecutive session in which the index ended
higher and the eighth record closing high in a row.
</P>
<P>
Traders said progress was hampered by the Bank of England's
warning today that UK interest rates will rise again in the next
few months to keep inflation down.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market also ended today's session at a record
high, with the DAX-30 index up 19.78 points at 3,595.15.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that initial losses caused by a weaker dollar and
softer bonds were wiped out by strength in individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse made great gains although it did not hit a new
record high, boosted by Wall Street's overnight rally and by new
opinion polls showing a lead for the center-right majority, with
the CAC-40 index ending 26.49 points or 0.98 percent higher at
2,719.58.

UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program is providing 861,000 dollars in technical
assistance to support the second phase of China's tax policy and
administration reform project, according the UNDP's latest
release.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the project, which was initiated by the
Chinese government and the UNDP in 1992, will help China draft new
tax legislation, including revised tax administration to help
clarify the powers of tax officials and the rights of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The success of these reforms is important for achieving the
government's macro-economic and social objectives. China's current
tax system is the result of a comprehensive overhaul of the
pre-1994 system. The 1994 reform helped simplify the tax system.

Development Program has approved a new 4.9 million dollar project
to help preserve the unique biodiversity on Socotra Island of
Yemen, according to the latest UNDP Flash.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP reported that over a third of the island's plants are
endemic; many are valuable food and fodder sources, or medicinal
species known only to the islanders.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is also helping the Yemeni government launch a poverty
alleviation program to improve the livelihood of these islanders,
who are isolated from the mainland by 400 kilometers of high seas
and long monsoon seasons, the UNDP publication noted.
</P>
<P>
The initiative focuses on improvements in health, education,
renewable energy use and water and sanitation services, according
to the UNDP.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks edged lower with
bonds today after another Federal Reserve official refreshed
worries the central bank will raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.54 points to 7,274.21.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with the volume totaling 489.72 million
shares as against 459.14 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.53 to 833.13, and
the NYSE composite index fell 1.60 to 433.97.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 at 1,333.59, but the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.13 to 579.60.
</P>
<P>
Most broad measures also retreated.
</P>
<P>
The bond market initially provided some support for stocks
after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.3
percent in April, slightly more than expected and the biggest
decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
But bonds quickly pulled back after a Fed official reiterated
concerns that consumer demand remains strong. Traders thought the
remarks indicated that the Fed will move to slow consumer
borrowing and spending with another increase in the central bank's
key lending rates.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bounced back toward 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Survey: In Germany, Even Youngsters Worry About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- An alarm bell was tolled today for the
German society when a survey found that even youngsters of 12
years old in the country were worrying about being out of work
some day when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Shell-Youth study, conducted by a team of
scholars with the involvement of 2,100 youngsters between 12 and
24 years old across Germany, showed that Germany's young
generation felt threatened first of all by unemployment and a lack
of apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the youngsters today had more
difficulties than before to accomplish themselves and to shape
their own future.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the number of young people who have a
sense of belonging to certain social groups is dropping when
compared with the 1980s in Germany.
</P>
<P>
They felt affiliation to a group not so important for their own
identities, authors of the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The distance between the youngsters and social organizations
and institutions did not result from an excess of individualism or
egoism. It reflected a tendency that the youngsters are
increasingly less willing to be dictated to by the adults, said
Arthur Fischer, a professor with the Free University Berlin who
coauthored the survey.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Temple Holds Ceremony To Greet Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Famen Temple, one of the four most
famous Buddist Temples in ancient China, held a ceremony here
today to greet the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the
unearthing of sariras (fragments of the bone ash of eminent
Buddist monks).
</P>
<P>
The sariras, together with 2,000 other relics, were found in
1987 in a 1,000-year-old underground hall, and are believed to be
the finger bones of Sakyamuni, founder of Buddhism. The important
archeological find was also an auspicious sign, according to
Buddhist belief.
</P>
<P>
Since then the Famen Temple, located in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, has become a holy place for Buddhists from
throughout the world. Some four million Buddhists and laymen have
visited the temple in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Jingyi, an eminent monk of the temple, said that the return of
Hong Kong is a great event worth celebrating. "We are praying for
the new era for Hong Kong, and we believe that it will have a
brighter and more prosperous future."
</P>
<P>
He said that Buddhists have also made great contributions to
world peace as well as the reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Expansion to Be Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A government meeting decided here
today that the expansion of the Chinese capital city should be
slowed down.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Luo Gan told a committee responsible for the
capital city planning and construction that by 2000 the land used
for constructing new projects will be restricted and tightly
managed. "The current scale is not allowed to be exceeded," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 12-million-population capital is one of the world's most
crowded cities, and it is now suffering from traffic jams and
heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
Luo suggested that more experts participate in city planning to
properly construct more green land and car parking places. The
priority strategic goal is to ease the tension in transportation
by learning from the experiences of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Departments, units and personnel engaged in illegal
construction must be investigated and punished, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, mayor of Beijing, said that importance should be
attached to planning, construction and management simultaneously
to cultivate a "beautiful image of the capital of our great
motherland".

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang, financial secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), today
expressed welcome to a decision by SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa concerning the future arrangements for the management of the
Land Fund.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the decision by the chief executive to appoint me as
the public officer to receive and hold the Land Fund," Tsang said
after a spokesman of Tung's office made an announcement to the
effect earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that initially, the Land Fund, which will be
the SAR's financial reserves, will be managed by the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the direction of the Financial
Secretary as a separate portfolio from the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The vesting of the assets of the Land Fund with the SAR
government as part of its fiscal reserves will boost the
confidence of the international investors in the financial
stability of the SAR government," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
He praised the arrangements as "simple, neat and in the
long-term interests of the SAR government."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he would set up an advisory committee on July 1,
1997, to advise him on the investment strategy and management of
the Land Fund.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary will chair the committee, with both
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, and Chung Shui-ming,
member of the Executive Council of the HKSAR, as vice-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund, which stands at about 150 billion HK dollars
(19.35 billion U.S. dollars), is now managed by trustees who are
the Chinese representatives of the Sino-British Land Commission.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Economist: Macao Plays Important Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Portuguese economist said
here tonight that he believes Macao will play an important role in
the economic expansion in the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Joao Costa Pinto, chairman of the Portuguese Bank of Industry
and Commerce, said in a speech organized by the Macao World Trade
Center here that he is optimistic about Macao's economy in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will play an important part in the stability of regional
economy although it is under the restriction of its tiny territory
and of dependency on Hong Kong economically and financially," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Macao will enter the 21st century with an economy that
will lay a good basis for its future role as Macao has a
modernized infrastructure -- the airport and the
telecommunications system -- and industrious residents.
</P>
<P>
Pinto, who served the Macao government 12 years ago and was
chairman of a leading Portuguese bank in Macao, said he takes a
particular interest in the region including Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The chairman stressed that Macao must make itself flexible to
adapt to political and social changes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Macao's role will be a bridge featuring services, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As an outside observer, I am deeply convinced that Macao will
mainly develop its service sectors, transferring investment,
technology and service," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economist urged local entrepreneurs and investors from
outside to help maintain political and social stability in the
territory and contribute to Macao's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will help create a fast-growing economy in the Pearl
River Delta," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Declines Steeply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The producer prices in the U.S.
fell by 0.6 percent in April, the largest drop in nearly four
years, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest drop since August 1993 and also the fourth
straight decrease following declines of 0.1 percent in March, 0.4
percent in February and 0.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, U.S. producer prices are dropping at a 4
percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The report said that much of the decrease in U.S. Producer
Price Index (PPI) -- a barometer of price pressures before they
reach the consumer -- resulted from a 2.6 percent drop in energy
costs. It is the third in a row and part of a continuing recovery
from a run-up in energy costs during the last half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell by 0.4 percent last month, the fourth decline
in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
The price declines in April were widespread through all levels
of production, from finished goods ready for the consumer to crude
commodities such as ore and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, so-called core prices declined by
0.1 percent after edging up 0.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The PPI, which tracks the prices of goods, offers important
clues for the future direction of the Consumer Price Index in the
country, which follows both services and goods at the retail
level.
</P>
<P>
That U.S. Consumer Price Index report is due out Thursday and
will be one of the last pieces of economic data before the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) holds its policy-making meeting on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that the large decrease in U.S. produce
prices may support the case for the U.S. Fed policy-makers to pass
up the chance to raise the interest rate next week.

<HEADLINE> World Biggest Airline Alliance Launched in Frankfurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest airline alliance
was launched today in Frankfurt with the participation of German
flag carrier Lufthansa AG, the United Airlines of the U.S., and
three other partners.
</P>
<P>
Named as the Star Alliance, the group extends current links
between Lufthansa and United Airlines to SAS Scandinavian Airlines
System, Air Canada and Thai Airways, and will also include Varig
of Brazil from October this year.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is seen by the partners as an effort to enhance
their competitiveness in the global market and a cost-saving
measure.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the alliance was signed today in Frankfurt
Airport by the chief executives of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
Leader of Lufthansa Juergen Weber said at signing ceremony that
individual airlines could no longer keep pace with the tempo of
globalization of economies and air travel nowadays.
</P>
<P>
"Our customers want to travel worldwide in comfort and without
difficulties. Star alliance will allow us to meet their needs
better than each airline can on its own," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance, the six airlines are to recognize each
other's frequent-flier credits. Passengers will also be able to
use the other airlines' business-class lounges.
</P>
<P>
Later the group plans to coordinate timetables, simplify
reservations and improve ground services to each other's
customers.
</P>
<P>
The five airlines currently in the alliance carried 174 million
passengers last years around the world with a total turnover of
about 42 billion German marks (24.7 billion U.S. dollars). Its
possible competitors would be the planned alliances between the
British Airways with the American Airlines, and Air France with
the U.S. airline Delta.

XIAMEN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese hijacker was sent back
to Taiwan today through the Red Cross Society of China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shan-chung, the Taiwanese, hijacked a plane from Taiwan to
Xiamen on the Chinese mainland on March 10.
</P>
<P>
A Red Cross representative, who served as a witness to the

relations between the two sides and safeguard the lives and
property of people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
On March 10 afternoon, a Far Eastern Boeing-757 airliner was

</P>
<P>
On the relations between China and ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations), Qian expressed his congratulations on

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Invest More in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will increase its
investment in the Philippines by forging more partnerships in
infrastructure, telecommunications, transportation and port
development projects, a leading Hong Kong businessmen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines is an attractive investment destination,"
Andrew Pyne, senior manager of the Hong Kong Trade Development

</P>
<P>
Pyne arrived here Tuesday, leading a Hong Kong delegation for a
three-day visit to explore more business opportunities.
</P>

<P>
These sectors include banking and finance, inter-island
transportation, seaport and airport operations and power supply
and telecommunications.

Pyne added the investment climate in the country is good
spurred on by a lot of opportunities such as skilled manpower,

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Steps Up Inspections at Food Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Regional Services
Department (RSD) will check thoroughly all the 499 food processing
factories in the Regional Council area within one to two weeks to
safeguard public health, the Regional Council announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The department has stepped up inspections at all licensed food
premises, in particular food factories, in Hong Kong after a total
of eight cholera cases have been reported since May 1.
</P>
<P>
RSD officers have conducted thorough checks at a licensed food
factory in Hung Shui, Yuen Long, over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
As health inspectors found the environmental hygiene of the
factory unsatisfactory, they served a summons on the factory
operator yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this prosecution, the operator had been summoned on
four occasions for the same offense since its license was issued
in 1986. And fines were imposed on the operator.
</P>
<P>
In addition to enforcement actions, health inspectors on
Tuesday also collected a number of environmental swabs as well as
water and food samples from the premises for further examination.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of the operator, RSD officers today seized
from the premises 4,300 kilograms of food, most of which were
chicken and duck legs.
</P>
<P>
Chloride lime has been applied to the seizure before it was
dumped at a government-assigned landfill site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Department of Health announced today
that it had traced the sources of some recent cholera cases to the
food factory and asked for the suspension of the factory's
operation until it proved itself suitable for operation again.
</P>
<P>
The food factory was found to have supplied fried chicken and
duck feet that had been consumed by some of the cholera patients
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The department has also ordered the factory to fill up, cleanse
or disinfect a well within its premises.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the factory has surrendered a large amount of
chicken and duck feet and ox stomach for disposal.
</P>
<P>
The two municipal services departments would step up inspection
on licensed food factories and premises and raid illegal food
factories and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health also called on restaurant operators
who use processed food supplied by food factories to reheat the
food thoroughly before serving them to customers.
</P>
<P>
Local residents were urged to pay more attention to personal,
food and environmental hygiene and not to patronize illegal cooked
food hawkers.

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Set Up Eminent Persons Group to Review Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the
seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), taking stock of 12 years of the grouping's existence,
decided today to set up a group composed of eminent persons to
review its work and look at the future.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Group of Eminent Persons (GEP) will "undertake a
comprehensive appraisal of SAARC, and identify measures including
mechanisms to further vitalize and enhance the effectiveness of
the association in achieving its objectives," said a declaration
issued at the end of a three-day summit of SAARC in Male, capital
of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The group is also charged with developing a long-range vision
and formulating a perspective plan of action including a SAARC
agenda which will spell out the target to be achieved by the year
2020, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the opening of the SAARC summit
Monday, Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said Asia
accounted for 60 percent of gross world product in 1820, but the
percentage dropped to 20 by 1950. The figure will go back up to
60 percent by 2020, Gujral added, citing projections from
"authoritative studies."
</P>
<P>
The year 2020 "has become a symbolic as well as a specific
destination, representing both perfect vision and a target year,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons, composed of two people from each
member country and the SAARC secretary-general, will report to the
leaders on its work at the next SAARC summit scheduled for
February 1998 in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Male summit also decided to extend the tenure of the SAARC
secretary-general to a "non-renewable term of three years" with a
view to "enhancing the effectiveness of the role and functioning
of the secretariat."
</P>
<P>
The SAARC secretariat was established in January 1987 and the
secretary-general is named on the principle of rotation in
alphabetical order for a period of two years upon nomination by a
member state. The present secretary-general, Naeem Hasan from
Pakistan, took up the job on January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> South Asian Leaders Pay Special Attention to Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders,
while striving to speed up regional economic cooperation, today
voiced their deep concern over the status of women and children in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued at the end of a three-day summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Male,
capital of the island nation of the Maldives, the leaders called
for enhanced cooperation to "bring women into the mainstream of
socio-economic development in the region."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven member countries urged the effective
implementation of the recommendations of the "Dhaka Resolution on
Women," which was also presented to the Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After discussing a mid-decade review of the SAARC Plan of
Action on the Girl-Child, They resolved to speed up efforts to
reduce malnutrition and mortality rates and raise education and

Girl-Child."

<P>
Expressing grave concern at the trafficking in women and

eradication of illiteracy in the region.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that adopting "one country, two systems," "the
principle of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy towards Hong Kong is China's long-term state
policy.
</P>
<P>
This will not only benefit the six million Hong Kong
compatriots, but also conform to the interests of the whole
country, said Jiang during a meeting with a delegation from the
Hong Kong-based Guangdong Societies' Committee to greet Hong
Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Henry Fok Ying-tung, chairman of the
committee and vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Fok, Jiang said the Chinese
government will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
on July 1, a major event which will wipe out some 100 years of
shame suffered by the Chinese nation and represents an important
step toward the reunification of the motherland in accordance with
the concept of "one country, two systems" put forward by Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the successful realization of this great
concept can not be separated from the concerted efforts of the
Hong Kong compatriots of all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Hong Kong compatriots will
continue their efforts to contribute to building a brighter future
for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "We firmly believe that so long as every provision
of the Basic Law is completely implemented through unremitting
efforts by the six million diligent and wise Hong Kong people who
love both the country and Hong Kong, plus the full support from
the mainland, the 'one country, two systems' is bound to be
carried out and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability
realized."
</P>
<P>
Fok said that the Hong Kong-based Guangdong societies will
continue their efforts to support the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and conduct various kinds of useful
activities.
</P>
<P>
They are determined to contribute to ensuring Hong Kong's
stable transition and smooth transfer of power as well as its
long-term stability and prosperity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
head of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Founded last September, the committee has a total membership of
more than 500, and comprises more than 140 societies.

<P>
The statement was made by an official with the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the frequent exchanges of high-level
visits between the two countries in 1996 promoted the
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
During Premier Li Peng's France visit last April, the two
countries signed many economic cooperation agreements worth 2.4
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The French government not only expressed repeatedly that China
is on the top of its trade list, but also sent many ministers to
visit China last year.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on China held in Paris May 5 this year, French
Foreign Minister Herve Charette expressed the hope that the
scheduled China visit by Chirac will push forward the bilateral
ties in various fields.
</P>
<P>
"A new starting point for French-Chinese relations is
emerging," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during his visit Chirac will also attend the
opening ceremony of a fair of French technology in which over 300
French businesses will be involved.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 France had invested in 1,128 projects in
China, with contractual and used investment worth 3.073 billion US
dollars and 1.508 billion US dollars, respectively. Its investment
in China ranks third among the countries of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, French investment has covered every sector in China,
and is extending from coastal to inland regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the MOFTEC official said that France's market share in
China doesn't match the good political ties of the two countries
and France's market share in the world.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should keep up their cooperation on major
projects, and increase contacts between small and medium-sized
businesses, he added.

<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders said
today that they remain firmly committed to combating terrorism and
drug trafficking which pose a serious threat to security and
stability in countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ending a three-day summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here, the leaders of the seven member
countries stressed the urgent need to complete legislation so that
SAARC's anti-terrorism and anti-drugs conventions can be enforced.
</P>
<P>
A declaration issued at the end of the summit urged all SAARC
member states to work towards implementation of the 1996 U.N.
Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism. It
also called for international action to halt activities which help
terrorist groups to collect funds for their activities in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to exchange information regularly on
terrorism and drug offenses.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Eradicate Polio by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica said today that her country will be polio-free
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the southern city of Zamboanga, Reodica said
that the Department of Health has already immunized over 85
percent of the targeted children below five years old and that no
wild polio virus has been isolated since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The health chief has also directed health workers to increase
surveillance of diseases that mimics poliomyelitis such as acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) and Guillain Barre syndrome to assure that
the target will be achieved in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only more than 100 AFP cases were reported, instead
of the expected 240, she said. However, no polio virus was
isolated from these cases.
</P>
<P>
An AFP case has to be tested for the presence of the wild polio
virus.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a country can
be declared polio-free if no wild polio virus has been isolated
among AFP cases for five years.
</P>
<P>
By this WHO standard, the Philippines is among the few
countries which have not eradicated polio.
</P>
<P>
"If there will be no polio virus isolated up to 1998, then we
are already a step ahead of achieving our goal," Reodica said.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Blames Poverty, Developed Nations for Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders
today blamed the developed countries' consumption patterns and
poverty in the developing nations for the worsening of the
environment in different parts of the world, including their own
region.
</P>
<P>
"Unsustainable consumption patterns in the developed countries
and widespread poverty in the developing countries are major
factors contributing to ecological degradation in different parts
of the world," said a declaration issued at the end of their
three-day summit here.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven-member South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) met on May 12-14 in the Indian Ocean
island nation of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
While "both developed and developing countries were required to
undertake specific initiatives to face environmental concerns,
stress should also be laid on the acceleration of development in
developing countries to enable them to face environmental
challenges," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also urged swift implementation of the
recommendations of SAARC's two regional studies -- one on the
greenhouse effect and its impact on the region and the other on
the causes and consequences of natural disasters and the
preservation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The leaders asked environment ministers of the member
countries, who will meet annually as decided by the summit, to
study the feasibility of drawing up a regional treaty on the
environment and stressed the urgent need for cooperation through
exchanging information, strategies and technologies for combating
pollution of air and water.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called for the urgent implementation of the
agreements reached at the U.N. Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, and decided to
adopt a common and collective position at the next month's special
session of the U.N. General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> British Engine Maker Builds Joint Venture in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Varity Perkins, a British engine
producer, announced here today the establishment of a joint
venture with the Tianjin Engine Works (TEW).
</P>
<P>
Michael Baunton, managing director of Varity Perkins, said that
the Tianjin People's Municipal Government had acted as a
middleman, and introduced Varity Perkins to the TEW.
</P>
<P>
The two signed a license agreement in 1994. With cooperation
going smoothly, they finally decided to form a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Perkins Engines (Tianjin), Ltd., has an initial investment of
nearly 30 million US dollars, with the British side accounting for
60 percent of the total. The term is 50 years.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, engines will be shipped in kit form from the
Varity Perkins factory in Peterborough, UK, and assembled in
Tianjin. Component manufacturing will begin in China in 1998,
followed by a rapid localization program.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will aim for an annual production of 50,000
Perkins-brand engines in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Demand for diesel engines in China will more than double by
the end of the decade," Baunton said. "With our partner, TEW, we
will produce engines at a cost, quality and performance level
equal to anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
Varity Perkins has already established five other joint
ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
Varity Perkins' mother company, Lucas Varity, is currently
holding its annual meeting in Beijing. The meeting, which is
attended by more than 120 of the company's top managers from
around the world, is to discuss cooperation and development
strategies with China in the future.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Stay Ahead of Competitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong today called on all Singaporeans to take it as a national
mission to stay ahead of their strongest competitors, especially
those in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Only by staying ahead will Singapore be able to sustain its
economic growth and prosperity and defend its national interests,"
the prime minister stressed while opening a new National Junior
College campus.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the young generation to get to know
Singapore's past, because "without a good background knowledge of
Singapore's past and uniqueness, young people are less equipped to
face the fresh and continuing challenges of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"We have become successful, so successful and rich that we
sometimes forget that our present stability and prosperity is
neither a natural nor permanent state of affairs," he warned,
adding that the future will be on intense, even frantic, economic
competition.
</P>
<P>
He said that whether Singapore continues to stay ahead for the
next 30 years "depends critically on whether Singapore continues
to have leaders of quality -- in politics, Singapore Armed Forces,
civil service, the community, civic and welfare organizations,
business and all other aspects of our society."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore will face many challenges at the turn of
the century, Goh said, "The most immediate task is to prevent
ourselves from being overtaken and overwhelmed by our competitors,
particularly in the region."

<P>
MAPUTO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's opposition leader
Afonso Dhlakama has said the ongoing demonstrations in central
and northerm Mozambique will expand southwards to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama made the remards here yesterday, according to
reports by the local newspaper Noticias today.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama was quoted as saying that the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) has dispersed by force the
armless demonstrations staged by the opposition in central and
northern Mozambique recently, thus "delaring a war" against the
opposition and the Mozambican people.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama said, the people planned to demonstrate in 1995 and
1996, but he stopped them by saying that they should give time to
the Frelimo to fulfil its promise that it would improve the
living standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is time for the masses to demonstrate," he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest opposition party, the Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo) led by Dhlakama, has in the past few
days staged a series of demonstrations in central and northern
Mozambique to protest against the increase of living expenses.
Some demonstrators have been detained by the police.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive's Office on Management of Land Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), will appoint
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the HKSAR, as the public
officer to receive and hold the Land Fund which will be part of
the HKSAR fiscal reserves.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tung's office said here today that initially,
the Land Fund will be managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) under the direction of the Financial Secretary as a
separate portfolio from the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing investment strategy for the Land Fund
will remain largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the financial secretary will set up
an advisory committee on July 1, 1997 to advise him on the
investment strategy and management of the Land Fund.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary will chair the committee, with both
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, and Chung Shui-ming,
member of the Executive Council of the HKSAR, as vice chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that these arrangements will enable the
HKSAR government to consider and decide on the longer-term
investment strategy for the fiscal reserves of which the Land Fund
forms a part.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, that will not cause any unnecessary disruption to
the existing arrangements for managing the Land Fund or the fiscal
reserves in the Exchange Fund, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "To ensure continuity of the management of the Land
Fund, existing staff of the Land Fund will be offered employment
with HKMA. The terms and conditions of employment would remain
largely unchanged."
</P>
<P>
"The Land Fund will continue to benefit from Chung's expertise
and advice in his new capacity as the vice chairman of the
proposed advisory committee," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chung Shui-ming, chief executive of the Land Fund
Secretariat, has indicated his intention not to join the HKMA. He
will cease his employment with the trustees after the closing
accounts of the Land Fund have been submitted to the HKSAR Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund, which stands at about 150 billion HK dollars
(19.35 billion U.S. dollars), is now managed by the trustees who
are the Chinese representatives of the Sino-British Land
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Thailand Intervene in Forex Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore and the Bank of Thailand, the central banks of the two
countries, jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market today
to stabilize the value of the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
"This concerted operation is aimed at stemming excessive
speculative activities which may lead to disorderly conditions in
the Thai and regional financial markets. Other appropriate
measures will be taken as necessary," the two central banks said
in a joint statement today.
</P>
<P>
The baht is currently pegged loosely to the U.S. dollar through
a floating basket of currencies that include the Japanese yen and
Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, it has frequently breached the permitted
fluctuation band of 2 satang in each direction, prompting reports
that the Bank of Thailand favors a wider band of 4 or even 6
satang to increase speculative risks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is another danger point which is likely to
come next month, when the financial sector is required to make a
full disclosure for the first time of non-performing loans.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Speaks About Hong Kong Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen delivered
a report on the return of Hong Kong in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The report was made at a meeting of the Propaganda Department
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, the Work
Committee of Departments under the Party Central Committee, the
Work Committee of Central Government Departments, the General
Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and
the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. Ding Guangen, a member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Qian, also foreign minister and chairman of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, reviewed the origins of the Hong Kong question and the
procedures for settling the question.
</P>
<P>
He placed stress on Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems"
concept and the Chinese government's basic principles and policies
on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one country, two systems" principle is a
basic state policy for the reunification of the motherland and an
important component of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The best way to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong is to settle the Hong Kong question by pursuing this
principle and the "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a
high degree of autonomy for the Hong Kong SAR principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
This move will be beneficial for Hong Kong, the socialist
modernization drive of inland areas, and will be in the interests
of Britain and other countries in Hong Kong, he explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking about the Chinese government preparations for
resuming sovereignty of over Hong Kong, Qian noted that the first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR has already been selected
through democratic procedures in a fair, just and open election.
</P>
<P>
The principal officials of the first HK SAR government, after
being nominated by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, were appointed
by the central people's government, he said, adding that the
Provisional Legislative Council of the HK SAR is operating
effectively, and the SAR Court of Final Appeals is being prepared.
</P>
<P>
To perform the duties of the central people's government for
the defence and foreign affairs of the HK SAR, PLA troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong and the Foreign Ministry offices in Hong
Kong are being prepared, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Preparatory Committee has done a great deal for the
formation of the HK SAR, and the situation in the region is an
inspiring one.
</P>
<P>
The people of Hong Kong and the rest of the world are showing
increasing confidence about Hong Kong's future, he added, calling
for cadres at all levels, especially leading ones, to study the
"one country, two systems" principle, and the Basic Law of the HK
SAR and to act in strict accordance with it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the point that each department, province,
autonomous region, and municipality must respect the high-degree
of autonomy of the HK SAR and that no one can interfere in the
affairs of the region. The links between the mainland and the HK
SAR must be arranged as a whole and managed by special
departments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that President Jiang Zemin recently pointed out that
the governing of Hong Kong by law is an important component of the
governing of the country by law, and that safeguarding the
authority of the Basic Law means safeguarding the authority of
state legislation. This is the responsibility of the entire
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that led by the CPC Central Committee with President
Jiang Zemin as its core, the "one country, two systems" principle
will surely be implemented to the letter in Hong Kong and Hong
Kong will have a more splendid future.

<HEADLINE> HK Money Authority Sets Rules for Smart Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) has adopted guidelines for the security features and the
issuing of smart cards, the Hong Kong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the guideline, from May 15, only banks and
deposit-taking companies will be allowed to issue the cards and
non-bank issuers will have to obtain the prior approval of the
authority.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are intended to prevent potential abuse of the
cards, which effectively function as money.
</P>
<P>
Smart cards have been defined as cards on which data may be
stored in the electronic magnetic or optical form, and for which a
person pays a sum of money to the card issuer for its services.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines required the smart cards to have the following
features:
</P>
<P>
-- Security measures, including the design of the microchip and
the encryption technology, any limit on the amount that can be
stored on the card and limits on transaction value.
</P>
<P>
-- Risk management and internal control procedures, including
those relating to the creation and transfer of value, the issuance
of cards and the detection of fraud.
</P>
<P>
-- Contingency plans to deal with disaster recovery and
problems such as fraud and an audit trail for transactions made
with the card.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Raise Water Price Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- From October 1, Jordanians will have
to bear the second water price hike in two years and pay 1.2
U.S. dollars for every cubic meter (CM) of water they use to their
water resource-thirsty country, today's Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was prompted only because of water scarcity and
our desire to reduce water consumption," Water and Irrigation
Minister Munther Haddadin was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following a moderate water price increase last year, the
Jordanian government decided to push it up again on households
that consume more than 50 CMs of water every season as well as on
groups like hospitals, hotels, shops and factories.
</P>
<P>
From October 1, households would pay 1.2 dollars for every cubic
meter of water and groups 1.4 dollars, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, the annual per capita consumption of water is only
one-fourth of the international water-poor country line of 1,000
CMs, according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision followed a meeting between King
Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last
Thursday on the water dispute.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 peace treaty between the two countries, Israel
has allocated one third of the promised 150 million cubic meters
of water to Jordan, which is demanding more in order to alleviate
a severe water shortage.
</P>
<P>
About 25 to 30 million CMs will be pumped immediately and the
rest will come after three years, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin said that the decision to raise water prices was not
linked to the water dispute with Israel.
</P>
<P>
With poor rainfall and underground water resources, Jordan
mainly depends on sharing surface water resources with its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, the neighboring countries have
gradually come to control the resources, depriving Jordan of its
fair share of water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan is working with Israeli and western bodies to
undertake large-scale projects involving canals and desalinization
plants in a bid to find more water resources.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Leaders Pledge to Accelerate Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders,
ending their summit in the Indian Ocean island nation of the
Maldives today, vowed to accelerate economic cooperation in the
region, with agreement to create a free trade zone four years
ahead of the previous deadline.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued at the end of the three-day summit of
the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), the leaders pledged to establish the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
At the last SAARC summit in India's New Delhi two years ago,
the leaders had decided to set up a free trade area in the region
preferably by 2000 but not later than 2005.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "recognized the importance of achieving a free
trade area by the year 2001," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in December 1995, marking its first step towards the
creation of such a zone. The SAARC leaders have since been making
every effort to accelerate the process of trade liberalization in
the region and move from SAPTA to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of achieving the free trade zone by
2001, Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said at a press
briefing at the end of the summit that SAARC leaders agreed that
2001 is a "realistic target year."
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that preferential tariff concessions should
cover products which are being actively traded among the SAARC
member states and that a third round of trade negotiations should
deepen tariff concessions along with the removal of non-tariff
barriers and structural impediments in efforts to move faster
towards SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
SAARC have completed two rounds of trade negotiations under
SAPTA and member countries have exchanged tariff concessions in
over 2,000 products. At the third round of negotiations which
will begin soon, decisions would be made to expand the number of
items eligible for tariff concessions in a further step towards
the free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC leaders also decided to take a number of measures to
promote and protect investment, improve communications facilities
in the member countries and encourage increased private sector
participation in trade, investment and finance.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote regional cooperation
in economic, social, cultural and other fields, embraces
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Slightly Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market closed
slightly weaker today as the bank stocks again attracted attention
following Westpac Bank's half-year profit result and ignored last
night's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed 3.9 points lower at 2530.4, but
well above an intraday low of 2519.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said most of the weakness in the market today followed
a lower close on Wall Street as well as profit-taking after the
local market's record close yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The banking index reversed the negative trend to close 5.1
points higher at 4567.2, following Westpac Bank's strong rise in
net profit for the half year.
</P>
<P>
"Westpac's result seems to have come in at the higher end of
predictions and that led to keen interest in the banks," Nevitts
broker Steve Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank shares gained 23 cents while National
Australia Bank edged 0.3 cents higher ahead of the release of its
half-year profit result tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index ended 3.6 points weaker at 1428.3 and
the All Industrials fell 4.5 points to 3963.

<HEADLINE> Debt Burden Corners Africa: Kenyan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Macro-economic reforms will not
help Africa unless the handling of the continent's external debt
is improved, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi was quoted
by today's local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
One of the hurdles in debt management among developing
countries is the fall in official flows to them, he sighed when
opening a workshop on the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording
and Management System (CS-DRMS) here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Official concessional flows have fallen in both nominal and
real terms in 1996, back to the levels of 1990's," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Even the World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative would not be effective if debtor countries cannot
manage their debts properly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi noted that the creation of capacity for
macro-economic policy analysis was another challenge facing
African countries in debt management.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for those responsible for economic policy
formulation to understand the relationship between four key
macro-accounts: the balance of payments account, monetary
accounts, fiscal accounts and the national income accounts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two-week workshop, part of a series of the Commonwealth
Secretariat's capacity-building meetings in micro-economic
management, is attended by experts from central, eastern and
southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
The CS-DRMS is a computer software system currently popularly
used in debt management in finance ministries and central banks
in 45 countries.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Management Methods in China's Rural Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cai Qingquan was the head of a
village committee in China but was faced with a difficult
problem: he couldn't make the final decision about a new village
office building with a budget of 2.56 million yuan (308,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
So, a representative conference was held in the village of
Fashi, the home of a large number of overseas Chinese in the
coastal province of Fujian in east China, which has become
prosperous in recent years, with the country's reforms and opening
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
One villager attending the conference proposed that the village
should take charge of purchasing building materials and hiring a
construction team, instead of turning the entire project over to a
construction company.
</P>
<P>
The proposal won the approval of all present at the conference,
and was put into effect. As a result, the building was completed
at a cost of only 1.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
This case is an example of the effects of a democratic movement
in managing village affairs in China's immense countryside.
</P>
<P>
"In the vast rural areas, village committees which are elected
directly by villagers can no longer impose the decisions of one
person on villagers," explained Wang Zhenyao, a senior official
with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
One direct outcome of democratic election is that village
committee officials and villagers alike emphasize the democratic
principle more than ever before, and have reached a consensus on
democratic decision making, democratic management methods, and
democratic supervision of public affairs, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, a village committee is a type of
basic autonomous decision-making organization in charge of the
village's public affairs, mediating disputes, and safeguarding
security.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, there were more than 930,000 such
committees in China.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker in response to an ill-received budget and concerns that
interest rates could still go down in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 77.84 U.S. cents, down from 78.21
late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"Initially today there was a bit of concern when the prime
minister said the budget would deliver lower rates over time,"
said National Australia Bank foreign exchange manager Derek Price.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said the federal government budget
for 1997-98 released last night would improve the economic climate
if monetary authorities want to make a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign exchange traders said a slide in the local
currency had been halted by buying of the Australian dollar
against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 92.58 from 93.32 against the yen
and at 1.3264 from 1.3313 against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Men Gymnasts Reap Juicy Harvest at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men gymnasts had a rich
harvest on Wednesday by collecting five gold medals in six apparatuses
at the Pusan second East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yufu, a 19-year-old budding star in the Chinese national squad,
finished atop with two golds and two silvers in his five outings on
the last-day gymnastics competition.
</P>
<P>
"I was very glad to win the golds and silvers today after I had
failed in both pommel horse and the horizontal bar in the individual
all-around competition yesterday," said Lu who was recruited into the
national squad in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"But I still had a long way to go for the world titles and I will
exert every effort to prepare for the coming World Championships to be
held in August in Switzerland," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
At the 1996 Asian Youth Championships in Hunan Province, Lu became
the four-time chamipion by winning the individual title before taking
the titles from the rings, the horizontal bar and parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
The men's floor exercise ushered in three champions as Lu Yufu,
Kazakhstan's Sergey Fedorchenko and South Korean Yeo Hong-chul scored
an identical point of 9.350. Norimasa Iwai of Japan injuried his right
leg and retrieved from the court.
</P>
<P>
The pommel horse title went to Lu Yufu again with a difficult
routine on 9.550 points. Both Yoshiaki Hatakeda of Japan and South
Korean top gymnast Lee Joo-hyung, 22nd individual finisher at Atlanta
Olympics, shared the silver medal on 9.300.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Fan Hongbin, member of the champions squad in the World
Championships in 1994 and 1995, showed his top-notched calibre to take
the rings title on 9.600 points, beating Japanese Yoshihiro Saito to
second by 0.050 points, while the bronze medal was shared by Zhang
Jinjing of China and Kenichi Fujita of Japan. Both Zhang and Kenichi
had the merit of 9.450 points.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Fedorchenko of Kazakhstan won his second title by taking the
vault horse with a performance of three sommersaults for a winning
score of 9.650 points, while a trio of gymnasts stood abreast on the
second place as Lu Yufu and Wang Xu, both of China, and Korean Yeo
Hong-chul were awarded 9.550 points each.
</P>
<P>
In the parallel bars, China finished one-two with Zhang Jinjing who
overcame stomach injuries, scoring the most of 9.700 and again Lu Yufu
finishing second on 9.650. Alexey Dmitriyenko took the bronze with
9.600 points.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, the veteran in the Chinese squad, won his second gold medal
in the horizontal bar wherein three gymnasts dropped to the floor
including both Lu Yufu and Sergey Fedorchenko.
</P>
<P>
Zhang scored 9.550 points to share the top honour with Japanese
Yoshihiro Saito, with Kenichi Fujita taking the bronze medal for
Japan.
</P>
<P>
As the men's competitions concluded this evening, China stood atop
with seven golds, three silvers and one bronze, South Korea ranked
second with one gold, four silvers, beating Japan to third with one
gold, two silvers and four bronzes.

<P>
villager representatives are chosen by villagers from persons
who are thought best able to uphold the law and to represent the
interests of villagers.
</P>
<P>
Cadres in Longfeng Village in central China's Hunan Province
had plans for a chemical plant, but the proposal met with heated
debate at a representative conference, with many representatives
holding the view that the village lacked both the technology and
the raw materials needed for a chemical plant, and that a cement
plant could, in contrast, be built with a lot more certainty.
</P>
<P>
And, the village committee agreed with the suggestion and the
cement plant was built, and brought a return that very same year.
</P>
<P>
In a village in Kunshan, in Jiangsu Province, a village head
wanted to buy a car for use by the village cadres, but the
proposal ran into opposition at a village representative
conference, and was defeated. After a heated discussion, the
villagers decided that the money would be better used for
irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Civil affairs officials say that most Chinese villages have
newspaper columns making public key decisions and important
village affairs. In many villages, money management teams
consisting of three to five villagers have been organized to check
on accounts at regular intervals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, villager representatives assess village cadres'
performance at least once a year, and members of the village
committee are obliged to report their work regularly.
</P>
<P>
A large number of village representative conferences have
stipulated village affairs regulations that usually cover the
duties of village representatives and cadres, public affairs, the
local economy, family planning, social security, land protection,
administrative affairs, social organizations, and accounts.
</P>
<P>
These regulations are regarded by villagers as "miniature
constitutions".

<HEADLINE> Democratic Management Methods in China's Rural Areas (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Fujian Province, which took the lead in village autonomy, 96
percent of its 150,000 villages have set up the village
representative conference system that guarantees them as the
masters of their villages.
</P>
<P>
At one 0.2 ha bamboo grove in Laicuo Village there, a large
number of bamboo had been cut down illegally because of poor
management.
</P>
<P>
So, Lai Qiding, who was elected director of the village
committee in March of this year, proposed that a meeting of
villager representatives be held to find someone who would handle
the bamboo under contract.
</P>
<P>
Two meetings were held to discuss the matter, and afterwards
more than 20 bids came in from the public, and in the end, Lai
Rensheng succeeded in making a contract for 15,000 yuan for the
wood.
</P>
<P>
The walls of the village office are covered with the
glass-covered frames of regulations on managing village affairs,
as well as income for the village and its expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"Public affairs are open to all villagers, and they have the
right to take part in the decision-making process on key matters
and supervise the implementation of decisions," Lai Qiding says.
</P>
<P>
Now, as opposed to the traditional method of appointing village
heads, they are directly elected by villagers, so they have to
deal with things in a fair way.
</P>
<P>
In Xinfeng Village, near Laicuo Village, one villager was found
cutting down several trees that belonged to the village. The
villager must be fined for the infraction according to the
village's regulations. To save himself, he went to the village
head, Wu Xinqi, and pleaded, saying "I voted for you."
</P>
<P>
"One can not be vague on matters of principle," Wu told him,
and explained that all decisions made by the village
representative conference must be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 13 years, village autonomy has shown great
vitality, and villagers have become the true masters of their own
business," said Zhang Xiaogan, an official with the Fujian
Provincial Civil Affairs Department, who has been engaged in the
establishment of grassroots political power for years.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Drops in Fiscal 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
declined for the fourth consecutive year in fiscal 1996 which
ended on March 31, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1996 surplus fell 24.3 percent from a year earlier
to 7,180.2 billion yen (60 billion US dollars), the ministry said
in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the surplus fall to strong imports of
crude oil and personal computers as well as the increasing
spending by Japanese travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
The country's surplus in the goods and services trade in fiscal
1996, marking a decline for the fourth straight year, dropped 67.0
percent from the previous year to 1,914.4 billion yen (16 billion
dollars), the smallest amount since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment income and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade dropped 23.6 percent to 8,809.7
billion yen (73 billion dollars) in fiscal 1996, also the smallest
figure since 1985 and a decrease for the fourth consecutive year,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 9.5 percent to 44,830.9 billion yen (374 billion
dollars), while imports expanded 22.4 percent to 36,021.2 billion
yen (300 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The service trade of Japan increased 21.6 percent over the
previous year, marking the largest deficit since 1985, partly due
to a continued rise in the number of Japanese travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
In March, Japan's current account surplus in goods and services
trade fell 45.5 percent from a year earlier to 459.9 billion yen
(4 billion dollars), the smallest figure for March since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Economists at private research institutions expect Japan's
current account surplus to show an increase againindustriesin
April as Japanese industries focus on exports to cope with weaker
domestic demand resulting from the April 1 consumption tax hike to
five percent from three percent.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Urged to Guide Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has been urged to guide the development of the small and medium
and micro-sized enterprises (SMME) of the country, said a source
here today.
</P>
<P>
The small businesses sector needs a minister in the
President's Office who will champion the interests of the
emerging businesses, National Industrial Chamber (NIC) Executive
Director Steve Skhosana was quoted as saying at the NIC's annual
conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Skhosana, South Africa's small firms sector
represents 40 percent of the private sector's share of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said although government policies towards the SMME, as
reflected in the 1995 White Paper, are encouraging, delivery has
been pathetic.
</P>
<P>
Skhosana said the role of the new minister will be to drive
through a "small businesses promotion act" and to safeguard the
interests of the SMME sector in areas including tender
opportunities, crime reduction, more sensible tax and labor laws
and greater access to finance.
</P>
<P>
At the NIC conference, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said the government will launch three
trusts, namely Unity Trust, Business Trust and Warehouse Trust,
as part of an empowerment program for the disadvantaged.

<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders
today reiterated their commitment to alleviating poverty in the
region by year 2002 and called for social mobilization in this
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven-member South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) also urged other countries and
international agencies to join its efforts in poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "were unequivocal in their commitment to the
eradication of poverty in South Asia at the earliest, preferably
by the year 2002," said a declaration issued at the end of a
three-day summit of SAARC in Male, capital of the Indian Ocean
island nation of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
SAARC has already established a three-tier mechanism on poverty
eradication under which two rounds of meetings have been held.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation among the member countries and poverty
eradication in the region were top on the agenda of the SAARC
summit in Male.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that effective implementation of poverty
eradication programs needs "a focus on greater participation of
target groups in the formulation and implementation of such
programs through social mobilization," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort, the leaders decided to set aside 1997 as
the "SAARC Year of Participatory Governance."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 million people in the region of one billion now live
below the poverty line, according to the figures from the
Secretariat of SAARC.
</P>
<P>
The leaders welcomed international assistance in SAARC's
poverty eradication efforts. They urged all donor countries,
international institutions and other bodies engaged in poverty
eradication to "increase their support and assistance to these
efforts."
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Parties to Meet in Abuja on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Liberian political parties will meet
tomorrow in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, to decide whether the
May 30 presidential and legislative elections is to be postponed
or not.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Tribune today quoted sources at the Nigerian
embassy in Liberia as saying on Tuesday that Nigerian ambassador
Joshua Iroha had invited the parties of the revised Abuja Peace
Accord to meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian head of state and chairman of the Economic Community
of west African states, general Sani Abacha will convene the
meeting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was by the revised Abuja Peace Accord signed in August last
year that the parties of the Liberian civil war agreed to hold
the presidential and parliamentary elections on May 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, 11 of Liberia's 16 political parties registered for
the elections recently issued a statement in Monrovia, demanding
that the elections be postponed to not earlier than October 13.
</P>
<P>
The parties quoted insecurity in rural Liberia, the lack of
voters' education and a fair ground for all parties as their
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Party and
widely regarded as one of the most competitive candidate,
however, has called for the holding of elections as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper remarked that a new date is likely to emerge
from the meeting in Abuja tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Computer Image Makes Brain Surgery Safer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A new virtual reality system which
has been used successfully on about 30 patients will make brain
surgery safer, the Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The system at the Institute of Neurosciences in Glasgow,
northern Britain, is the first of its kind in Britain, and there
are 70 in use elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Neuronavigation system, designed by BrainLab in Germany,
uses two near-infra-red cameras which track tiny ceramic balls
attached to surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
The computer images are relayed to a computer screen programmed
with three-dimensional images of the patient's brain taken from
scans.
</P>
<P>
As the surgeon operates, the screen shows where his instruments
are inside the brain and gives a clear image of the tumor,
allowing much more accurate removal.
</P>
<P>
The machine can give a scalpel a "virtual" tip, allowing the
surgeon to rehearse the operation and ensure that he does not
damage structures in the brain as he operates.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Opposition Party Proposes to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 14 (Xinhua) - Jordan's strongest opposition party
has sent a message to the largest centrist party asking for
forming a coalition government which will uphold an anti-Israel
policy.
</P>
<P>
"If the National Constitutional Party (NCP) agrees to form a
coalition government which will combat normalization (of ties
with Israel), ... we have no objection to joining such a
coalition," said Islamic Action Front (IAF) Secretary General
Ishaq Farhan in the latest issue of Arabic weekly AL Sabeel.
</P>
<P>
No response arose from the NCP, which was born from the
merger of nine centrist political parties and officially licensed
by the Ministry of Interior earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations exploring the possibility of IAF's participation
in a coalition government were underway in the early months of
this year, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabaliti.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiations repeatedly stymied for the IAF held different
views with the government on key issues like normalization of
ties with Israel and the International Monetary Fund-prescribed
economic adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
IAF, in opposition with the government since 1991, sticks to a
stand on opposing normalization of ties with Israel, preventing
"Zionist infiltration" and emphasizing issues of domestic
interests.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jordan Times, Farhan said that he
expected his party to gain more votes in the upcoming elections
than during the previous elections in 1993, when IAF won 17 seats
in the 80-member lower house.

<HEADLINE> China Uses Sunken Boxes to Build Oilfield in Bohai Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China has started to use sunken
steel boxes to construct oil drilling and storage platforms in its
offshore oil exploration at Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Gulf
of north China.
</P>
<P>
The practice is believed to be the first of its kind in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield, some 20 km away from the city of Jinzhou,
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has proven oil reserves of
30.8 million tons. The oilfield was discovered by Bohai Oil
Company in late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Sea water at Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield is seven m deep, and thus oil
development using conventional methods here would be very costly
and very difficult to recover the investment.
</P>
<P>
After eight years' repeated studies and discussions, Chinese
oil experts decided to use the method of sending down steel boxes
instead of conventional oil exploration methods to ensure high
efficiency and safety.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the oilfield will consist of eastern and
western sections, with western section being the central area
where oil drilling and storage sunken-steel-box platforms will be
installed.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section will also install an oil drilling platform
made of steel boxes without any human residence. The two sections
will be linked together with 2.7-km-long marine pipelines and a
marine cable.
</P>
<P>
The entire construction will cost 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou Oilfield, which is now also home to 27 oil production
wells, 26 water filling wells, and one natural gas well, has a
designed annual oil drilling capacity of one million tons. The
oilfield will go into production in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu, in Tianjin,
in 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets and 10,000
employees.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China-France Ties to Have Bigger Push (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac's
coming state visit to China from May 15 to 18 has been widely
acknowledged as a milestone in the Sino-French ties.
</P>
<P>
It serves as another example of the smooth progress of the
relations between the two countries, which are rich both in
culture and tradition.
</P>
<P>
After some ups and downs in Sino-French relations, the two
governments, through concerted efforts, signed a joint statement
on January 12, 1994 and overcame severe barriers that hindered the
development of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the relations between the two countries have
enjoyed an all-round restoration and advancement and substantial
outcome has been scored in the bilateral cooperation in fields of
politics, economy, trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between leaders of the two countries has
been extraordinarily high-profile in recent years. The visits to
China by former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and
President of the Senate Rene Monory, and the visits to France by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee Qiao Shi, have
served to give a strong push to the sound progress of the
bilateral friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two peoples, who have cherished a relationship of
traditional friendship, hope to give the bilateral ties an even
bigger push, as the economy of the two countries are complementary
strongly and there exist broad prospects for further cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
All this has laid a solid basis for the further progress of
friendly cooperation between the two countries, as this is not
only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also
conducive to the advancement of the China-Europe relationship and
the establishment of a new Asia-Europe partnership. It is also
conducive to world peace, stability, and development as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting with visiting French Defense Minister
Charles Millon, President Jiang Zemin made an incisive elaboration
of the Sino-French relations: At a time when the world is moving
toward a multi-polarization while maintaining diversification,
China and France should strengthen exchanges and cooperation with
an eye toward the future from a strategic height, to set up
long-term, stable and new relations of friendship and cooperation
oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
People have ample reasons to believe that, through joint
efforts, this new type of China-France relations will surely
be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that during President Chirac's visit in China,
both sides are expected to issue a joint statement, making clear
their common views on major international issues and their common
aspiration on further expanding the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This will, beyond any doubt, provide a reliable guarantee for
establishing this new type of state-to-state relations between
China and France.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac, an old friend of the Chinese people, attaches
great importance to the development of the France-China ties.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen in Paris in January this year, President Chirac said
he pays great attention to his upcoming visit to China, hoping
that this visit would serve as a milestone in the France-China
ties and in Europe-China ties, in an effort to make these two
relations enjoy a better promotion.
</P>
<P>
Observers here claim that President Chirac's coming China trip
will surely score positive outcome in the political, economic and
other sectors, and that the good trend of a smooth Sino-French
relationship will continue and be provided with increasing
energy.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission Zhang Wannian met with Chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili here today.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Great Hall of the People, General
Zhang said that China is glad to see the recent momentum of
improvement and promotion of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China is ready to work with the US to maintain
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that as the largest developing country and
the largest developed country in the world respectively, China and
the US share great responsibility to maintain peace and stability
and promote development and prosperity of the world.
</P>
<P>
To bring a healthy and stable Sino-US relationship into the

he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Shalikashvili's visit to China will actively
push forward the improvement of relations between the two
countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two sides should improve bilateral
relations in the light of the principles that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin put forward: taking into consideration their common
interests, adopting a far-sighted perspective, and properly
handling the Taiwan issue according to the principles set in the
three joint communiques signed by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
China wishes that the US would finally stop selling weapons to
Taiwan as stipulated in the three joint communiques, in order to
avoid any negative effect on the development of relations between
the two countries and their armed forces, he said.

<P>
Shalikashvili said that he has had positive and beneficial
talks with Chinese army leaders during his stay in Beijing. He

<HEADLINE> Atmosphere Should Be Improved Before Final-Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The atmosphere between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) should be first of all
improved before the sides could advance to the final-status talks,
Israeli Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio said an Israeli official, who remained anomymous,
made the remarks in a briefing on the current political situation
to Israeli reporters. He said if the climate was not improved, the
final-status talks, even held now, would be stuck because they
include more complicated and complex issues.
</P>
<P>
He said maintaining top level Israeli-Palestinian contacts was
important before discussing the proposal to accelerate the
final-status talks put forward by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The official, who is deeply involved in the peace talks,
stressed that as a move to improve the atmosphere, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) should fight seriously terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel made a good-will gesture Tuesday by
easing significantly the closure on the Palestinian territories
and is considering further steps aimed to rebuild confidence
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial building in East Jerusalem's Har Homa
which is at the center of current crisis, the official believed
that if the two sides kept talking, a bridge formula could
automatically be found.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNA is insisting that Israel halt the settlement
expansion in order to break the deadlock in the peace process that
was caused by the Har Homa construction which began in late March.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing mediation efforts by U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross and a meeting between Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and PNA President Yasser Arafat last Tuesday, no breakthrough has
yet been achieved to resume the deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that Israel does not intend to
change its "strategic decision" on advancing the peace process
not only with the Palestinian side, but also with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important to calm Syria because Israel does not
want to launch a war. He ruled out the possibility that Israel
would be the one to provoke a confrontation with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been suspended since
early last year and failed to resume so far due to the dispute on
the Syrian demand on Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied
Golan Heights. The Netanyahu government refuses to commit itself
to a full withdrawal, which the Syrians have placed as a
precondition for resuming talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Lebanon issue, the official said Israeli forces had to
continue operation in south Lebanon due to the pro-Syrian
Hezbollah guerrilla forces' threat to Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
Israel has kept the 15-kilometer-wide self-proclaimed south
Lebanon security zone since 1985 under the excuse of protecting
security of its north. The Hezbollah forces have since been
fighting a vigorous battle to liberate the zone from Israeli
occupation.

<HEADLINE> Tea Production Increases in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's tea production had
increased from 12,000 tons in 1993 to 13,000 tons in 1996,
according to a report reaching here today from port Portal,
western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's western district of Kabarole is the number one tea
producing district in the country whose production accounted for
about 80 percent of the country's total, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increased tea productgion in the country, the report said,
was a result of the rehabilitation of the industry which had
collapsed in the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Tea was Uganda's fourth foreign exchange earner after coffee,
cotton and tourism in the late 1960s and 1970s. At its peak in
1972, Uganda's tea output reached 23,000 tons from its
plantations of 20,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
However, in August that year, all ethnic Asians, who
controlled more than 70 percent of the industry in the country,
were expelled by the Amin administration. The estates were then
so badly managed that only less than 10 percent of the estates
had been under cultivation. In 1986, the tea production in the
country dropped to 1,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a year after the present Museveni government came to
power, it decided to return tea estates to the Asians and let the
experienced Asians run the tea plantations, in a bid to recover
the industry as soon as possible. In 1992, the tea estates owners
came back from Asia and started their operation in the tea
industry.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Museveni administration has introduced
western-backed economic reforms which stipulate that industries
such as tea could be liberalized. Under this policy, a state of
export monopoly on tea which had lasted for 15 years was
abolished in 1989 and tea traders are now allowed to export tea
directly.
</P>
<P>
A policy of liberalization of foreign currency dealings has
been carried out since 1990.
</P>
<P>
What's more, another step taken by the government in 1994 to
recover the tea industry is to privatize four tea factories in
the western part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Launch Anti-rinderpest Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will launch a nation-wide
animal vaccination campaign against rinderpest and contagious
bovine pleural pneumonia (CBPP) this month.
</P>
<P>
According to local daily "The New Vision" today, the planned
vaccination follows an outbreak of rinderpest in some parts of
neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, though Uganda is said to be free
from rinderpest which usually decimated cattle herds.
</P>
<P>
Philip Ociba, Ugandan Commissioner of Veterinary Services, was
quoted as saying the disease which has infected cattle herds in
Kajiado, Kenya's Rift Valley area and Ngorongoro in Tanzania near
Tanzania-Uganda border was of a mild type.
</P>
<P>
The paper said one million doses of vaccines have already been
imported into Uganda from Kenya and another three million doses
are to be needed in a bid to cover the nation-wide exercise.
</P>
<P>
The killer disease is also reported to have infested parts of
southern Sudan, northern neighbor of Uganda, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Zone Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Russia border trade zone,
the only one between the two countries, is under construction and
is expected to start full-scale operation within the year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side of the zone, located in Manzhouli City in
north China's Inner Mongolia Region on the border with Russia,
began unilateral operation in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side of the trade zone has attracted investment
from companies and businessmen from over a dozen of provinces or
municipalities and several foreign companies, said Tian Xuezhi,
head of the Administrative Commission of the Manzhouli Sino-Russia
Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese side has invested 160 million yuan
(nearly 20 million US dollars) for building a department store, a
hotel, a bank, and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, the Chinese side of the zone has received
more than 10,000 Russian businessmen and the total trade volume
has reached 21 million yuan (2.9 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commodities sold here include food, fruit, clothing, shoes, and
household electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
Manzhouli is China's largest land port. China and Russia signed
in 1992 an agreement to build a jointly-run trade zone on the
Sino-Russia border areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, each country will build a
100,000-square-meter zone next to the border line and the Chinese
and Russian businessmen will be allowed to enter the trade zone
freely.
</P>
<P>
As Russia has not open its border gate to the zone, the Russian
businessmen have to make a detour via the original port so far.
</P>
<P>
Tian said the opening of the zone is of great importance to the
promotion of bilateral trade and it is also expected to develop
the entrepot trade and processing trade of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Becomes Official Leader of Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National Party
(NP) leader F. W. de Klerk has officially been given the title of
"leader of the opposition", said a local daily "The Citizen"
today.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was accorded the title by the National Assembly
without dissent on Tuesday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The debate over the "leader of the opposition" title began a
year ago when the NP withdrew from the African National Congress
(ANC)-led government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The NP, traditionally a white-dominated party, has been the
ruling party in South Africa since 1948, and become the official
party when De Klerk announced its withdrawal from the government
in May last year.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's parliamentary discussions, ANC Chief Whip Max
Sisulu moved that "the leader of the largest party in the
assembly that is not in government must be recognized as the
leader of the opposition".

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The private sector is expected to
shoulder nearly 70 percent of the investments in Egypt in the
coming five years, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in the country would reach 400 billion
Egyptian pounds (about 117.6 billion U.S. dollars) during the 4th
five-year plan spanning 1997-2002, the paper quoted State Minister
of Planning Zafer al-Beshry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Private investors would provide 279 billion pounds (82 billion
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that the private sector has
contributed 60 percent of the total investment in the past five
years, reaching 49.1 billion pounds (14.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the plan would open the door for the private
sectors to invest in the infrastructure field, such as power
stations, roads, airports and seaports, and the construction of
water plants.
</P>
<P>
The development strategy of the plan was mainly aimed at
raising the economic growth rate to an average 6.9 percent, which
would in turn achieve regular and continuous increase in the
national capital, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Needs Savings Culture: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard said
today Australia needs a savings culture and the government's
savings rebate program would bring a very big change in the
nation's attitude to saving over time.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have highlighted that a significant proportion
of Australians have little or no savings beyond equity in their
home and their superannuation savings.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget under deliberation by the parliament, a
broadly-based savings rebate will be phased in at a rate of 7.5
percent from July 1 next year, rising to 15 percent from July 1,
1999, resulting in a maximum tax rebate of 225 Australian dollars
(175 US dollars) in the next income year and 450 Australian
dollars in 1999-2000 and subsequent income years.
</P>
<P>
The budget measure showed that the government, for the first
time since federation, was matching its rhetoric on savings with
action, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today over a local radio, Howard said "We are actually
saying for the first time that savings matter, savings count, that
we need a savings culture in Australia."
</P>
<P>
The rebate policy is very valuable for retired people, it will
help young people saving for a deposit on a home and it will
assist superannuation contributions, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also backed suggestions from some sectors of the business
community that Australia should strive for higher levels of
economic growth to help reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The federal government would have liked to abolish all taxes on
savings in the proposed budget but that move was beyond what the
country could afford, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Australia impose taxes on incomes from bank deposit or
investment, with a minimum tax rate of about 20 percent for low
income earners and a maximum of more than 40 percent for high
income earners.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Open Giant Passion Fruit Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will in June open a giant
passion fruit processing factory near the capital Kampala,
reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The factory which belongs to an Asian, can handle all the
country's passion fruits, while other fruits like mangoes will
also be processed in the factory, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lawrence Kezimbira Mjinga, state minister
for agriculture, as urging farmers to utilize the opportunity by
going in for large scale passion fruit growing.
</P>
<P>
Juice of passion fruit can be processed as a kind of soft
drink which has been favored by Europeans in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Uganda can achieve sales of up to 150,000 U.S. Dollars per
year from exportation of the fruit, which will provide cash
income to small growers in rural areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan farmers have since June last year started marketing
passion fruit on the European markets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coastal City To Phase Out Outmoded Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal city of Qingdao in
Shandong Province will be getting rid of five-billion-yuan worth
of out-of-date industrial products by the end of the year, to
improve its economic performance.
</P>
<P>
It will spend 3.6 billion yuan on more than ten technological
improvement projects, as part of the effort to replace aging
products with name-brand or new products.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to mass producing more than 200 new
products.
</P>
<P>
An irrational product mix is largely blamed for China's
stagnant state enterprises, so Qingdao began looking for solutions
to this problem. It has decided to give support to 19 products
that are doing well on the market, including beer, color TV sets,
refrigerators, air-conditioners, passenger trains, and radial
tires, and to limit production of 72 products that are only
marginally marketable.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urged to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya President Daniel arap Moi
has called for concerted efforts to fight corruption which has
permeated all sectors of the Kenyan society in cancerous
proportions, the Kenyan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party KANU and the opposition are no longer immune
from corruption, the chronic national enemy number one causing
economic upheavals in the eastern African country, he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly, there is corruption everywhere in the country.
This chronic social disease has also eaten into the KANU and
opposition parties," he said when addressing a huge crowd of
workers and residents here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our cardinal responsibility to eradicate this
malignancy in society," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said underhand dealings and irregular business practices
have become the hallmark in the industrial sector, allowing the
importation of substandard goods which result in undue suffering
by local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has taken stringent measures against the
unwarranted importation of sugar to safeguard local farmers and
industrialists from being cheated out of their legitimate
business, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Squelches Talk of Telecom Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has ruled out any move towards
privatization in telecommunications despite wild speculations that
the government would pick up the pace of its six-year-old
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Presidents' Council have been optimistic over
speeding up the liberalization of the Egyptian telecommunications
authority Telecom Egypt, saying that a law being drafted will lead
to its privatization within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
However, shortly after the privatization claims were widely
published across Cairo business press, the Egyptian government
publicly criticized the cited sources.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Enterprise and Administrative Development
Atef Ebeid also denied the claims that the Egyptian government
intends to privatize Telecom, the sole operator in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The government will have complete authority over the Telecom
till the private sector achieves the required success, he told a
two-day business conference organized by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Cairo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ready to privatize the telecommunications sector,"
Ebeid said. But he added that a mobile phone network company will be
sold to investors.
</P>
<P>
This announcement sparked further criticisms from some economic
experts and businessmen attending the meeting entitled "Egypt: an
emerging country for Investment."
</P>
<P>
They argued that there will be no real foreign investment boom
in Egypt before it sells a majority stake in at least one of the
vital sectors, such as oil and gas, telecommunications or
electricity.
</P>
<P>
But Ebeid, who is in charge of privatization, said Egypt has
assiduously worked to apply privatization programs which will be a
prop for economic revival.
</P>
<P>
He said roads, ports, airports and cellular telephone services
have been opened up to the private investors.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would need 8 billion U.S. dollars of investment a year to
create 500,000-800,000 jobs and to speed up the economic growth from
the present 5 percent to 7-8 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund, foreign investment
in Egypt is expected to reach 2.1 billion dollars in 1997 from 650
million last year, after declining in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt embarked in 1991 on privatization, a vital part of
its reform program, the revenues of the private sectors have risen
to 63 percent of the total gross national product and helped absorb
68 percent of the total workforce in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Vitamin B2 Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A pharmaceutical company in central
China's Hubei Province has a new technique to improve vitamin B2
production.
</P>
<P>
The technique, which has just passed the provincial approval,
raises the production of cloned hay bacillus, which is vital in
the production of ovoflavin, or vitamin B2.
</P>
<P>
Ovoflavin is a vitamin, widely-used in pharmaceutical, food
processing, and feed-production industries.
</P>
<P>
The total demand of the world market for ovoflavin is 6,000
tons a year. China's yearly demand is 800 tons.
</P>
<P>
The actual amount of vitamin B2, produced each year is 5,000
tons, of which China makes 380 tons.
</P>
<P>
Guangji Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, in Wuxue City in the province's
Dabie mountainous area spent one million US dollars to import the
cloned hay bacillus from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The company then invested 30 million yuan (3.6 million US
dollars) in the experiment of amplifying the production of the
bacillus to 30-ton tanks.
</P>
<P>
After many experiments, the factory successfully industrialized
the cloning of hay bacillus in 1996. The company has reduced the
cost of producing one ton of hay bacillus from 400,000 yuan
(48,000 US dollars) to 230,000 yuan (28,000 US dollars) and raised
the annual output of the bacillus from 120 tons to 300 tons.
</P>
<P>
State examination attest that the quality conforms to the 1995
Edition of the Chinese Pharmacopeia, the 1993 Edition of the
British Pharmacopeia and the 23rd Edition of the American
Pharmacopeia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources is procuring equipment to measure the
amount of emissions that may pollute the air.
</P>
<P>
With the equipment, the ministry will be able to prosecute
those discharging emissions to levels that can cause pollution to
the atmosphere, the "Zambia Business Mail" today quoted Permanent
Secretary of the ministry Peter Mwamfuli as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mwamfuli said that at present, the ministry is unable to
prosecute culprits because it does not have the equipment to
measure how much of the emissions discharged are likely to
pollute the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
When questioned whether it will be possible to prosecute
individuals in residential areas especially those who burn
polythene materials to make home-made floor polishes, Mwamfuli
answered that "for factories, yes, we can go there and examine
the situation. But for individuals on domestic level it would be
very difficult to move from one house to the other."

<HEADLINE> China Helps Manchurian Tigers Back to Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out a project of
helping 30 artificially-bred Manchurian tigers back to nature, to
increase the number of wild tigers.
</P>
<P>
The project is going on in a training base near Harbin, capital
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, where domestic animals
such as chickens and cattles are offered as prey to the tigers.
</P>
<P>
Director Liu Xinchen of the Feline Center, who is involved in
the training work, told reporters that an important part of the
training was improving the tigers' hunting abilities, which had
degenerated due to life in captivity.
</P>
<P>
All these tigers have to hunt the animals sent in by workers to
stimulate their wild nature.
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of training, the tigers have improved
their abilities to adapt to a wild environment, including being
able to survive in sub-zero weather.
</P>
<P>
"China has made creative efforts to protect the tiger, showing
Chinese people's determination to save the species," said Eugene
Lapointe, chairman of the Management Committee of the World
Wildlife Fund, after an observation tour of the base.
</P>
<P>
The wild Manchurian tiger is on the verge of extinction because
of large-scale felling of forests and hunting. the number of the
wild Manchurian tiger is less than 300 in the world, and about 20
in China.
</P>
<P>
The animal is listed by the World Wildlife Fund as one of the
ten most endangered species in the world, which are very difficult
to recover naturally.
</P>
<P>
China established the breeding center for the animals of the
cat family in Hengdaohezhi in the Heilongjiang Province in 1986,
and it has successfully bred 83 Manchurian tigers.
</P>
<P>
"The first group of these tigers is expected to go back to the
forest early in the next century," said Liu Xinchen.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Industry Booming in Five SEZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry has flourished
in China's five special economic zones (SEZs) of Hainan, Shenzhen,
Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen, making it a lucrative tertiary
business.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province, surrounded by seashore, lush foliage, and
sunshine, has turned itself into a holiday resort.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the nine-year old province received 4.86 million
tourists, up 34.6 percent year-on-year, and in the first two
months of this year, the figure was 7.12 million, up 35.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, the country's first SEZ, has built a number of theme
parks to compensate for its lack of historical attractions and
relics.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shenzhen's tertiary industry, mainly the tourism
sector, accounted for 49 percent of the added part of its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 witnessed a big leap forward of the tourism
industry in Zhuhai SEZ, thanks to three events: the '96 Zhuhai Air
Show, an international car race, and the Second Zhuhai Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.46 million tourists including 370,800 from overseas
visited Zhuhai in the year.
</P>
<P>
Shantou has focused on its strategy of attracting more of its
"overseas countrymen". This year, Shantou plans to hold its ninth
annual get-together of overseas Chinese whose ancestral home is
the Chaozhou-Shantou area, in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Xiamen SEZ is in a much more favorable status to
entertain visitors from Taiwan as it stands face-to-face with the
island province. Thee SEZ was designated last August to be one of
the ports to open experimental direct shipping to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This April, Xiamen hosted a 10-day fair specially to
accommodate businessmen and travelers from the islands across the
Taiwan Straits. In the 10 days, more than 10,000 Taiwanese visited
Xiamen.

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi to Pour More Funds into Large Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
plans to invest nearly ten billion yuan to help large state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that in the 1996-2000 period Jiangxi will
invest the money in ten enterprises with annual sales of over
three billion yuan and taxes and profits from 300 to 500 million
yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The province's industrial production has increased at
double-digit rates in recent years. In 1996 the added value of
industry was more than 45 billion yuan, an increase of 18.6
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi now has 440 large and medium-sized enterprises, with 81
of them having annual output values of over 100 million yuan
each. About 70 percent of the province's revenue comes from
industry.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by 2000 Jiangxi will manufacture 120,000
light trucks and buses, 150,000 mini cars and 360,000 motorcycle
engines.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Open Domestic Market to Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou in south China's
Guangdong Province will allow foreign products more access to its
domestic market in a bid to recruit more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
"Opening up is a two-way street, so we should allow part of our
domestic market share to overseas products. By doing so, we
invite more intense market competition which improves the
production and operation of our enterprises," said Chen Kaizhi,
executive vice-mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to make use of overseas capital,
technology, equipment, and management, and to promote our products
to world market. But this progress will not go too far if overseas
investors make no profits in China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, Guangzhou has recruited 12.25 billion US
dollars of overseas investment since China adopted the reform and
opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed enterprises produced 35.67 percent of the
city's industrial output last year, and 56.9 percent of the total
exports.
</P>
<P>
But the influx of overseas funds began to slow down. The
contractual overseas investment dropped by 58 percent during the
first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Priority in recruiting overseas investment will be given to
basic industries, high-tech projects, and highly-efficient
agriculture, Chen said.

Neoplasmic Illnesses reported on Sunday's operation.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who held meetings with three of his ministers on
Tuesday, would rest on Wednesday before returning fully to his
official activities on Thursday, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The president is set to journey to Boston, the United States,
on Thursday to attend the graduation ceremony of his eldest
daughter Keiko, who has acted as Peru's first lady since

<HEADLINE> China to Bring Desertification Under Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will work hard to bring its
2.6 million sq km of desertified land under control by greatly
improving the ecological conditions in these areas by
the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, secretary-general of China National Committee for
the Implementation of UN Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD) and vice-minister of forestry, made this remark today
during the on-going Asian Ministerial Conference on the
Implementation of UNCCD.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the desertification-prone countries in the
world, he said. A recent survey shows that desertification is
expanding and deteriorating in the country as a whole despite of
the improvement and effective control in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, desertified land across the
country is now increasing by 2,460 sq km per year, equal to
the area of a medium-sized county.
</P>
<P>
"Since China signed the UNCCD, China's National Action Program
to Combat Desertification has been formulated and now it is being
improved and revised," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Bring Desertification Under Control (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, by the year 2000, 3.177 million
hectares of desertified land caused by wind erosion will be put
under control along with the 3.5 million hectares of desertified
land on the Loess Plateau caused by water erosion and 12 million
hectares of salinized pasture in China .
</P>
<P>
In addition, 6.8 million hectares of land will be afforested
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the regional environment will be improved and the
poverty-stricken population in desertified rural areas will be
provided with food and shelter," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, by 2010, 7.45 million hectares of wind-eroded
land, 700,000 hectares of water-eroded land on the Loess
Plateau, and 22 million hectares of deteriorated pasture will be
brought under control in addition to 6.2 million hectares of
land being afforested.
</P>
<P>
"At that time regional environment and local people's living
standard will be remarkably improved," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, to achieve the above goals,
China will concentrate on public education, management and technical
progress. The country will also work out preferential policies and
raise funds from various channels to enhance the construction of
desert-control projects.

<P>
HAIKOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, capital of south China's
Hainan Province, has witnessed rapid growth in its development and
bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
The city of Haikou has invested more than 20 billion yuan (2.4

provincial status.
</P>
<P>
The city has drawn overseas capital from more than 50 countries
and regions to invest in more than 400 enterprises in the
zones. Of these enterprises, over half of them are involved in
industrial production and have generated four billion yuan in
output value so far, earning 200 million US dollars in foreign
exchange from exporting products to more than 40 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
With investment reaching 2.5 billion yuan (301 million US
dollars), the Jinpan Industrial Development Zone has introduced

production. Last year the zone generated more than one billion
yuan (120 million US dollars) in industrial output value and
handled nearly 18 million US dollars worth of exports, accounting
for 22 percent and 42.6 percent of the city's total, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nutrition Remains Priority for Athletes' Comfort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,347 athletes were taking
part in the on-going second East Asian Games, nutrition remains the
priority concern for the athletes.
</P>
<P>
As no exact figures can be accounted for, about 180 kilograms of
beef, 90 kgs of pork, 180 chickens and 160 kgs of rice are needed to
nourish the 1,000 athletes at the two main villages of the Hankuk and
Glory Condominiums, sources said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We serve about 1,500 portions per day, I don't think we need worry
about leftovers or preparing too much," said vice chef Lee Shin-bok at
the athletes' village at Hankuk.
</P>
<P>
The daily calories count is 6,000 total served in three meals, with
the menu worked out by seven consultant chefs including Chung Ji-chol,
head chef for the athletes' village of the 1986 Asian Games and the
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The athletes were accommodated at the places with easy access to
the venues, and security was tight at both villages with guards on
their posts around the clock. Volunteers were also on site from
morning to night.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the ambience was friendly, with athletes chatting away
among themselves and the Korean volunteers at the villages.
</P>
<P>
These two villages have breathtaking views of Haeundae Beach along
the northeastern curve of Pusan's coast line.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the athletes are scattered throughout various hotels in

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition MPs Asked to Prepare for New Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democrat Party, the largest
opposition party in Thailand, has told its MPs to prepare for an
early election.
</P>
<P>
The party, led by former prime minister Chuan Leekpai, says the
Chavalit administration will fail to complete a two-year term,
which it had promised at the time of the last general election,
because of its "inability" to address the country's economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the party Sanan Kachornprasart said the
"snow-balling economic malaise" is taking its toll on the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said the six-party coalition government will not survive
long and will likely disintegrate without having to go through a
censure debate.
</P>
<P>
Parliament reconvenes in July, which could be an occasion for
the opposition to lodge a motion of non-confidence if the
opposition has gathered enough evidence against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party sees that the government has left the ailing
economy in tatters since it took office in December and that no
feasible efforts have been made to avert the foreseen economic
plight.
</P>
<P>
The government has come under fire lately for failing to
translate its economic rescue measures into practice, prompting
the prime minister to intervene in the administration of economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic woes include continued poor exports,
sagging stock exchange index, pressure for currency devaluation
and shortfall in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Sanan was quoted as saying, "Looking at the way this government
is running the country, a general election is forthcoming. So we
told our MPs to get ready."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boonchu Rojanasatien, a Democrat Party executive,
also lashed out at the government's "inefficiency" in economic
matters, saying its "aimless" policies had thrown the country into
confusion.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's economic problems have had immediate
effects on all business sectors, adding that he did not know what
changes the government could initiate that would bail out the
ailing economy, but suggested that a House dissolution was a
viable solution.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union in Nepal Warns of Protest Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali trade union organization
has warned of an agitation campaign if the government fails to
meet its welfare demands including wage increase, union sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Trade Union Congress (NTUC), believed to be close to
main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) party, will start its
campaign after a few months when the government could not fulfill
the demands included in a memorandum, which had been presented to
Labor Minister Mukund Neupane Tuesday, an NTUC official said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, jointly submitted by 12 NTUC affiliated
organizations, contained various demands for laborers' welfare
like increasing the gratuity and minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, most Nepali companies still follow a
1962 Act which limits laborers' gratuity at 10,000 rupees (about
180 U.S. dollars), despite a new 1993 Labor Act stating that a
retired laborer should receive the gratuity as per the number of
years he had worked.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also demanded that the minimum wage which is
currently fixed at 1,000 rupees (about 18 dollars) be increased,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Other demands included abandoning rules against labor welfare,
giving trade unions the right to negotiate with the management,
and timely implementation of labor laws, he added.

<HEADLINE> Havel Urges NATO Not to Promise to Limit Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
urged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) not to promise
Moscow to limit its future military deployment in the new members
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Havel, who arrived here Monday on a working visit, made the
remarks at a news conference at the Capitol Hill when asked
whether NATO should limit its forces in new members after the
alliance expanded eastward.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if NATO were to declare that it will not deploy
such-and-such weapons in the future, such a declaration could be
made on the part of the alliance for the reason that the alliance
may not feel the need to deploy additional forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it should not be done because NATO binds itself to such
action in an agreement with someone else," He added.
</P>
<P>
Havel said this as NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and
Russian officials are negotiating on guaranteeing Russia's
national security after the military bloc's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
NATO is scheduled to list the first group of countries that
will be allowed to join the alliance. the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland are on the front runners.
</P>
<P>
The Czech president believes that the NATO expansion is needed
to fill in a security vacuum in Europe while Russia insists that
such a move would endanger its security and draw a new dividing
line across the continent.

<HEADLINE> Volatile Thai Baht Shows Lack of Confidence: Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Continued volatility in the trading
of the Thai baht has further shown lack of investor confidence,
dealers say.
</P>
<P>
The volatility of the US dollar/baht exchange rate is witnessed
against the backdrop of Thailand's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The baht was very volatile on Tuesday, both in the spot and
swap markets.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, almost every day, baht/dollar trading breaks
the four-satang trading bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the Thai central bank allows only two satang
higher or lower than the official exchange mid-rate fixed each day
by the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand on Tuesday set the mid-rate at 25.88 baht
to the dollar, allowing the dollar to trade at between 25.86 and
25.90 baht.
</P>
<P>
However, nervous investors bought the greenback at a range
between 25.943 and 25.945 baht in the morning, well above the
upper limit of the band.
</P>
<P>
The baht was firmer against the dollar before the close of
trading, following rumored intervention by the central bank in
offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Tuesday again issued a statement, denying
all rumors of possible changes to Thailand's exchange rate regime.
</P>
<P>
Since February the baht has come under periodic attacks from
speculators looking to make a profit from the growing divergence
between the strong US economy and Thailand's economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rumors have circulated from time to time about a
possible baht devaluation, even though the central bank is adamant
that a devaluation is not an option for reviving the sagging
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The continued depreciation of the baht merely mirrors a severe
lack of investor confidence in the (Thai) government's economic
policies," English-language daily The Nation today quotes an
unnamed dealer from a Singapore-based bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by many analysts and is also reflected in
the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which has witnessed a downward
spiral in its index nearly all week last week.

<HEADLINE> American Deputies Prepare For Trade Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputy trade
ministers from 34 countries across the Americas began a meeting
today on the eve of a major conference of trade ministers to
discuss the creation of a pan-American free trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
During a session in the afternoon, the officials reviewed the
differences among members over the forms of negotiation for
setting up a Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) by 2005, which was
agreed in 1994 at a hemispherical summit in Miami, U.S..
</P>
<P>
The signatory countries have been divided over the pace and
scale of tariff reductions, and the row is particularly furious
between the industrialized countries of the United States and
Canada and the South American Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to prepare a draft of the
declaration to be signed in the third FTAA trade ministers'
meeting on May 15-16 in Belo Horizonte, over 300 kilometers
southeast of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
The May 15 meeting will decide the timetable and nature of
formal negotiations toward hemispherical integration, and pave the
way for a second presidential meeting to be held next March in
Santiago, the capital of Chile.
</P>
<P>
Two thousand businessmen from Canada to Argentina began a forum
on Monday to put forward proposals for the ministerial meeting,
which would also be attended by observers from Europe, Asia and
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition MPs Asked to Prepare for New Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democrat Party, the largest
opposition party in Thailand, has told its MPs to prepare for an
early election.
</P>
<P>
The party, led by former prime minister Chuan Leekpai, said the
Chavalit administration will fail to complete a two-year term,
which it had promised at the time of the last general election,
because of its "inability" to address the country's economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the party Sanan Kachornprasart said the
six-party coalition government will not survive long and will
likely disintegrate without having to go through a censure debate.
</P>
<P>
Parliament reconvenes in July, which could be an occasion for
the opposition to lodge a motion of non-confidence if the
opposition has gathered enough evidence against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party sees that the government has left the ailing
economy in tatters since it took office in December and that no
feasible efforts have been made to avert the foreseen economic
plight.

<HEADLINE> Don King Sued for `Unfair' Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Boxing promoter Don King was sued
by Prizefighter Terry Norris for 64.5 million U.S. dollars because
of `unfair' contract.
</P>
<P>
Norris, the World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight champion,
asked the court nullify a "horribly one-sided and unfair" contract
that his manager allegedly misled him into signing.
</P>
<P>
The contract gives Norris "only illusory compensation" for a
championship match and binds him to King for virtually the rest of
his career, a report quoted court papers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Norris signed the contract in October 1996 "because
Mr. (Joseph) Sayatovich (his manager) and Mr. King lied to him,"
according to papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Norris thought the contract gave him a championship fight with
Felix Trinidad in June 1997 with a guarantee of 1.5 million
U.S. dollars but the agreement actually says nothing about when a
match will occur.
</P>
<P>
The suit names King, Don King Productions Inc. and Sayatovich
as defendants. It asks compensatory and punitive damages of 61.5
million U.S. dollars against King and his company, and 3 million
U.S. dollars against Sayatovich.
</P>
<P>
The suit also asks the court to declare the agreement between
King and Norris void and unenforceable.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Prop up Sagging Rubber Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided to
spend 4.7 billion baht (188 million U.S. dollars) to prop up
sagging prices of natural rubber in the local market, according to
a report today.
</P>
<P>
The market-intervention plan, which will run until July,
requires the Thai government to buy rubber directly from planters
at a minimum of 29 baht (1.1 U.S. dollars) per kilogram for
grade-three rubber and 24 baht (0.96 dollars) for grade-four
rubber.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices have fallen to between 20 (0.8 dollars) and 25
baht (1 dollar), causing serious problems for planters, especially
in southern Thailand where planters have demonstrated to dramatize
their calls for government help.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government hopes its intervention will encourage
merchants to speed up purchases of rubber from planters in the
hope of pushing prices up.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's largest natural rubber producer.

BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's natural gemstones
exports in the first two months this year were valued at 1.46
billion baht (58 million US dollars), a decline of 19.1 percent
compared with the same period last year, according to a local
report today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export of gemstones in the first two months last
year totaled 1.81 billion baht (72.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly due to a plunge in the value of polished
ruby exports by 23.8 percent to 540.08 million baht (21.6 million
dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the top-ranked Japanese market was almost
unprecedented amounting to 48.2 percent, to 170.59 million baht
(6.8 million dollars) in January and February from 219.4 million
baht (8.7 million dollars) in the first two months of 1996.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi to Generate Power From Yangtze Tributary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
is engaged in a 15-year program to generate power from the
Hanjiang River, the biggest tributary of Yangtze, to fuel its
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province is investing ten billion yuan to build seven
hydropower stations, with a combined capacity of 2.085 million
kilowatts and an annual power generation of 6.7 billion
kilowatt-hours, along the 1,567-km river.
</P>
<P>
To date, two of the project's power stations are already in
operation.
</P>
<P>
The central and Shaanxi provincial government have jointly
invested in this project. Loans from foreign banks are also being
used.
</P>
<P>
The project will also greatly enhance the Hanjiang River's
navigability, facilitating the mountainous province's contact with
the economically more developed Yangtze River Valley.

<HEADLINE> Prodi: Treaty Reforms Essential for EU Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy believes reforms to the European
Union's Maastricht Treaty are essential before the union is
enlarged to include new members, Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok. The two leaders had discussed the
intergovernmental conference, designed to review progress toward a
new treaty ready for signature at the regular summit on June 16-17
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Reform items Italy considered "irrenounceable" include a
majority voting system which weights votes so that decisions
reflect population numbers.
</P>
<P>
Italy insists that security and defence policies be
strengthened by a progressive merger of the Western European Union
and the EU. Italy is striving to be in the first group to join the
single currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Both Prodi and Kok, who visited Rome on behalf of the EU
rotating presidency, stressed that the content of the new treaty
was more important than the deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- For the past 10 years, an increasing
number of Italians have been affected by hay fever, according to a
report released today by Professor Desiderio Passali of the
University of Siena.
</P>
<P>
The rate of people subjected to the complaint has risen from 8
percent of the population, or six million, 10 years ago to the
present 12 percent that brings about a loss of 30 million work
days to the country each year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented to the International Society of
Otorhinolaryngology, noted that hay fever is directly related to
air pollution caused by automobile and industrial emissions.
</P>
<P>
It said some 750 million people in the world suffer from hay
fever. Mexico is the hardest hit with 47 percent of its population
affected while Indonesia the least hit reporting 3 percent.
</P>

In Europe, the report added, Spain has the highest rate of 23
percent as against Russia's lowest 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Conduct Investigation on Busang Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian police have begun to
establish coordination with the Minister of Mines and Energy and
the Canadian police in conducting a preliminary investigation of
the Busang case, the police said.
</P>
<P>
A small Canadian mining company, the Bre-x Minerals Ltd., is at
the center of controversy following claims over the amount of gold
in its Busang deposit in the remote rainforests of East
Kalimantan, Indonesia, were exposed as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The police had not contacted Bre-x officials in Indonesia
because the case was still in the process of a preliminary
investigation and not that of an investigation, head of the
information sub-unit at the National Police headquarters Col.
Bambang Haryoko said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If the results of the preliminary investigation gives us a
conclusion, then we will continue with the next step of the
process," local press today quoted Haryoko as saying.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, the Indonesian government froze temporarily the
operations of Bre-x minerals ltd. and its subsidiaries in the
country, pending legal certainty over the Busang hoax.
</P>
<P>
Bre-x stunned the world last month when it announced the gold
deposit at Busang reached 70.95 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
However, Bre-x discovery was then rejected by Canadian
consulting company Strathcona Mineral Service LTD, which said
after a research that only trace amounts of gold have been found
in the sample assayed, and there were no samples that gave gold
values of economic interest.
</P>
<P>
Bre-x owns 45 percent of the Busang property and the remaining
property are held by Indonesia's Nusamba group, U.S. mineral
company Freeport and the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara news agency, hundreds of employees at the
Busang gold project held members of Bre-x management Sunday
following a proposed layoff.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bre-x financial controller Bernhard Leode said only 20
key personnel will be retained from a staff of 500.

<HEADLINE> Swiss PM Hold Talks With Russian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Neither Russia nor Switzerland hopes
to see that Europe's security structure will be built on the basis
of NATO's eastward expansion, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with the visiting Swiss Foreign
Minister Flario Cottis, Primakov said that both countries agreed
that NATO should play an important role in a new European security
structure, but should not be in conflict with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
OSCE should play the key role in Europe's security structure,
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes NATO's plans to offer membership to East
European countries. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are
expected to be invited to join the alliance this summer.
</P>
<P>
Cottis, who arrived here today on a one-day visit, also held a
telephone conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The
president highly praised the neutral stance Switzerland had been
taking on security issues in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to students at Diplomatic College in Moscow, Cottis
said that without the participation of Russia, there cannot be a
sustained and lasting peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cottis also discussed economic issues with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Both vowed to enhance economic
cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has been active in expanding economic ties with
Russia in recent years. It is now the second biggest foreign
investor in the country, only after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (81-82) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will middle school graduates in Hong Kong and the
mainland be able to apply for college admission in both places?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong "students shall
enjoy freedom of choice of educational institutions and freedom to
pursue their education outside the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, middle school graduates in Hong Kong may freely
apply for admission to institutions of higher learning in the
mainland after 1997 in accordance with relevant rules.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an ever increasing number of Hong Kong middle
school graduates have applied to universities and colleges in the
mainland, with those admitted increasing proportionately.
</P>
<P>
More Hong Kong young people are expected to apply for admission
to mainland institutions of higher learning after 1997, and the
mainland will in turn provide better conditions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, when Hong Kong will have become a special
administrative region of China, mainland residents will not have
the same free access to Hong Kong as they do to other provinces
and cities in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Mainlanders must go through relevant procedures to visit Hong
Kong. Institutions of higher learning in Hong Kong will mainly
enroll students locally.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong residents be able to study abroad
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, just as they do now, Hong Kong residents
will be free to apply for undergraduate, graduate and other
studies in any country in the world in accordance with their own
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides for legal guarantees in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> 7.6 Million Child Workers in Latin America: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The child labor force in Latin
America is 7.6 million strong, owing to poverty, inequality and
low levels of education, the International Labor Organization
(ILO) said.
</P>
<P>
About 7.6 million children between the age of 10 and 14 have to
work, including at forced labor, said an ILO study recently
published here.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said many children are forced to do strenuous work
up to 18 hours a day in Latin America, earning low wages or none
at all.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said the health of many children is exposed to
serious damage, including the risk of dying at the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they are constantly victims of mistreatment and
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the main reasons for the phenomenon to
poverty, low educational levels, the belief that children are more
adept at some tasks, and social indifference and apathy.

<HEADLINE> S'pore-Based Shipping Firm in Acquisition Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore-listed shipping firm
Osprey Maritime is paying 750 million U.S. dollars to acquire
Monaco-based shipping group Gotaas-Larsen in its ambitious plan to
become Asia's largest energy transporter, industrial sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
When Gotaas-Larsen's four Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carriers
come into its fold, Osprey will leap-frog in the fast growing
business for LNG carriers, as the joint company will manage six of
the 100 such carriers in the world today, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A report in today's Business Times said that the deal, nearly
nine times Osprey's 1996 revenue of 85.7 million U.S. dollars, was
sealed Monday. It came in the wake of last month's 825 million
dollars purchase of American carrier APL Ltd. by Singapore's
Neptune Orient Lines.
</P>
<P>
Osprey chairman Tim Cottew was quoted as saying that the
acquisition was not a "knee-jerk action", but one which had been
considered for some years. "The opportunity has now arisen and
provides us with a springboard for growth in this very exciting
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
In pooling the two companies' expertise and fleets, the deal
creates a world-class energy transport group which could exploit
the growing energy demand in the Asia-Pacific region and provide
the engine for Osprey's future earnings growth, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Per Capita Income of 2,000 U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is eyeing
a per capita income of 2,000 U.S. dollars before the end of year
2004, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito
Habito as saying if this level of per capita income is achieved,
the country could join the ranks of newly industrialized countries
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippine government reported the per capita
income at 1,299 U.S. dollars, still below those of other members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, except for
Indonesia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Asian Development Bank showed that per capita
income in Singapore was the highest at 26,730 U.S. dollars in
1995, while Indonesia's 980 U.S. dollars and Vietnam's 240 U.S.
dollars were the lowest the same year.
</P>
<P>
Habito said Manila was projecting an 8 to 10 percent gross
national product (GNP) growth to fulfill its commitment to
attaining the status of a newly industrialized country.
</P>
<P>
The planned growth is expected to come from the rapid expansion
of domestic activities led by the industry and services sectors,
as well as strong investments and export revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government hoped the per capita income would
go up to 2,000 U.S. dollars between 2002 and 2004, Habito said. He
added that the present high level of per capita income just came
from the steady growth of the national economy over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the slowdown in birth rate was also a good sign of
the government's ability to achieve the 2,000-U.S. dollar target.
In 1996, the population growth decreased 0.4 percent in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Wine Production Slips Away in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's wine output failed to
reach the planned target of 500 million liters in 1996 because of
reduced grape planting, the Bulgarian Agricultural Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
There were only 94,000 hectares of grape-growing land in
Bulgaria last year, a 26 percent decrease since 1990. More than
half of the wine-producing capacity was not used in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Before 1989, wine exports accounted for 80 to 90 percent of
Bulgaria's total exports of food, and Bulgaria ranked sixth on the
list of wine-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Before that year, Bulgaria exported 250-million litres
annually. Britain and Russia were the main importers of the wine.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the areas planted in grapes has decreased year by
year. The grape yield was 510,000 tons in 1996, just a slight
increase over 1995.

LIMA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Peru expects to export 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars worth of fishery products in 2010, half as much again
as the present fishery exports.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian fishery industry should do its utmost to reach
this goal in line with the growing world demand, which would rise
by more than a quarter in 2010, said Jose Sarmiento Madueno, the
president of the National Fisheries Society.
</P>
<P>
He said Peru sold over 1 billion dollars worth of fish
exports in 1996 for the second year running, representing 5
percent of the world demand for fish products.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Runs to Court to Lift Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ben Johnson is trying to lift his
ban through a lawsuit in a bid to run on the track again, reports
from Toronto reaching here said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 35-year-old banned sprinter, has filed an application
with an Ontario court charging track's world governing body and
Athletics Canada with keeping him from making a living by imposing
a lifetime suspension.
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled for May 27 in a Brampton, Ontario,
court, a lawyer representing Johnson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The legal challenge seeks to have the court force the
International Amateur Athletic Federation and Athletics Canada to
allow Johnson to run immediately.
</P>
<P>
But Athletics Canada had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
The application is being sought at the same time Johnson is
petitioning the IAAF for reinstatement. That appeal could be heard
at the IAAF meeting May 30-31.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian was banned for life in March 1993. In a urine
sample provided Jan. 17, 1993, his level of testosterone to its
byproduct epitestosterone was 10-1. A 1-1 ratio is considered
normal.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Johnson was banned for two years after testing
positive for the steroid stanozolol after a record-breaking 9.79
in the 100 meters at the Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was quoted as saying he wants to have his ban
overturned so he can "end track and field in a good manner".

HELSINKI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada defeated Sweden 3-1 on
Tuesday to force the best-of-three gold medal finals into third
and dicisive game at the ice hockey world championship.
</P>
<P>
Canada got second period goals through Geoff Sanderson and
Anson Carter then rode the goaltending of Hartford Whalers Sean
Burke to win the second game.
</P>
<P>
Burke, who has started every game of the tournament in the
Canadian net, was at his acrobatic best in the key third period,
making back-to-back saves, including a breakaway by Swedish sniper
Michael Nylander, to preserve Canada's lead.
</P>
<P>
Canada outshot the Swedes 14-8 but were unable to beat the
all-star netminder until midway through the second when Sanderson
broke out of an eight game scoring slump to give them a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, Olympic champion, levelled the score on a powerplay by
Per Eklund.
</P>
<P>
Carter sent Canada into the second intermission up 2-1 when the
Boston Bruin center took a return pass from Chris Gratton and
slapped it into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
Montreal Canadiens Mark Recchi added an insurance goal early in
the third.
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Former coach of the Milwaukee
Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers Mike Dunleavy on Tuesday was named
new head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy, who stepped down as general manager of the Milwaukee
Bucks last month, succeeds P.J. Carlesimo, who was fired last week
after three years as Portland coach.
</P>
<P>
Portland's only NBA title came in 1977. The Trail Blazers have
made the playoffs 15 consecutive seasons -- the longest current
streak in the NBA -- but have been eliminated in the first round
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy took the Lakers to the NBA Finals in 1991 before
falling to the Chicago Bulls, but failed to make the playoffs in
four seasons as Milwaukee coach.
</P>
<P>
In four seasons as Bucks coach, the 43-year-old Dunleavy
compiled a 107-221 mark, before stepping down in April 1996 while
retaining his front office duties. He was 101-63 with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers finished 49-33 mark this season but were eliminated
in the first round of the playoffs by the Lakers, marking their
third straight first-round exit under Carlesimo.

<HEADLINE> "Land Doctors" Popular In Chinese Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Zhangwu County of
northeast China's Liaoning Province increased their per-hectare
grain output by nearly 900 kg last year, as pedologists, "land
doctors," write out "prescriptions".
</P>
<P>
Lin Guangsen, a farmer in Fuxin County, came to the soil and
fertilizer station in Fuxin city on the eve of spring sowing,
taking with him some soil samples from his own farmland for
a "medical check".
</P>
<P>
A technician told Lin that his land lacked potash, and wrote
out a recipe to apply fertilizer. The farmer followed closely what
he was told and expects a better harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Technicians like Lin are popular in China's rural areas as they
have proved helpful to farmers in improving their farmland and
earning more.
</P>
<P>
Blind and disproportionate application of chemical fertilizer
has hardened and even polluted farmland. So pedologists advocated
prescribed application of fertilizer, which is widely accepted in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Fuxin city has applied this practice on nearly 100,000 hectares
of land, and set up 31 monitoring stations to spread the use of
the method, which alone helped increase more than 66 million kg of
grain output last year, and nearly 1,500 yuan per ha for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The city sponsored 110 short training classes last year, in
which over 10,000 farmers were trained on scientific application
of fertilizer. Land doctors wrote out nearly 10,000 fertilizer
application recipes, and began to pay visits to villages and
provide services for farmers.

</P>
<P>
By now, the province has established more than 1,800
county-level and 2,960 township-level organizations to spread
scientific results in the province's rural areas, according to a
local official.
</P>

their own research associations to share farming skills among
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
These organizations also hold various activities to teach
farmers agricultural technologies and bring the latest data
on practical techniques to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Besides helping farmers solve technical problems in farming,
the organizations also sponsor training courses for farmers. They
have spread agricultural techniques and new agricultural species
to farmers for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of pilot bases and a total of 40
cultivation and breeding bases have been set up for farmers to
integrate science and technology with economics.

including incentives for an estimated six million taxpayers aimed
at encouraging private savings will be phased in from July 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Tennis Tourney to Host World Class Trio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Marlboro Tennis Championships
will come back to Hong Kong with some ground-breaking stars to vie
 for Asia's highest prize in a single event, organizers announced
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Having confirmed participation in the October 14-19 event,
Germany's former world number one Boris Becker is going to join
Spanish Albert Costa and Chilean Marcelo Rios, the two newcomers
among the world's Top Ten.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, the Marlboro Championships have
consistently attracted international stars at the very peak of
their profession. This year, however, emphasis has been put on
bringing here some new faces, who are still of world-class
caliber.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 29, will be competing for the first time in a major
tennis event in Hong Kong. He was here for a demonstration event
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Becker is expected to add one more trophy to his career
collection of 49 titles.
</P>
<P>
Beginning to compete in the ATP Tour in 1994, Costa showed
remarkable promise. He won a career-high three ATP Tour titles
last year and continued the advance in 1997 by rising from the
13th to the ninth in world rankings last month.
</P>
<P>
Rios himself generated a number of headlines in April this year
as the first Chilean to reach the Top Ten and the first South
American to do so since Anders Gomez in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rios scored a historic win over Becker in the semi-finals of
last year's Monte Carlo tournament.
</P>
<P>
With his ranking rising to 10th last month, Rios poses as a big
challenge to his more famed German opponent Becker.

<HEADLINE> Africa Confident of Bright Future: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here today that the 21st century will undoubtedly see
the bright continent of Africa take off as the dawn of
revitalization is in sight.
</P>
<P>
Toasting at the banquet given in his honor by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa tonight, Li Peng said the politically
liberated Africa has embarked on the road to economic
revitalization.
</P>
<P>
Although it is even more difficult for Africa to achieve
economic development than political liberation, "the dawn of
revitalization has shone on the African continent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Africa's revitalization will have a global impact. The 53
countries on the continent, accounting for half of the members of
the Non-Aligned Movement and occupying one third of the United
Nations seats, carry great weight in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"They are an important force in the efforts to establish a
just and equitable new international political and economic
order," said Li Peng, stressing that at the turn of the century,
Africa is expected to play a bigger role in promoting the
multipolarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said as China and Africa both belong to the third
world, they share weal and woe in the just cause of opposing
imperialism, colonialism, hegemonism and safeguarding world
peace.
</P>
<P>
In this new situation, China will, as always, support, unite
and cooperate with African countries in safeguarding national
independence and sovereignty, opposing external interference,
choosing one's own political system on the road to political
stability and economic development, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier described Tanzania as "the cradle of the
brilliant Swahili civilization and forerunner of the independence
movement in Africa."
</P>
<P>
It made outstanding contribution to Africa's national
liberation movement, especially to the political liberation in
southern Africa, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Active in the African and global arenas, Tanzania has played a
major role in strengthening solidarity among developing countries
and promoting South-South cooperation, Li Peng stated.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said Tanzania was honored to receive Li Peng.
"In your own African tour that has already taken you to six other
African countries, you did not forget your 'rafiki' in Tanzania,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The secret behind this unfailing record of friendship is that
it is founded on solid and sound principles of mutual respect,
mutual interests, and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs," said the Tanzanian president.
</P>
<P>
During the long period of friendship, China has extended
development support and technical assistance to Tanzania in many
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be thankful enough for this invaluable contribution
to our own development, not forgetting China's contribution to
the liberation of southern Africa -- the fruits of which we now
enjoy," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
And Tanzania has "a lot to learn from the Chinese experience
in the development of a market economy with internal
characteristics," Mkapa said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Holds Seminar on Hong Kong After July 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece today held a seminar on the
prospects of Hong Kong after China resumes its sovereignty over
the British colony on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, sponsored by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (HKTDC) in Athens and the Hellenic Hong Kong
Association, were attended by more than 100 prominent guests from
Hong Kong, the Greek business community and the diplomatic corps
here.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, speakers praised the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping for his theory of "one country, two systems" which
aims at resolving the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Leonidas Baltatzis, president of the Hellenic Hong Kong
Association, told the seminar in his opening speech that the "one
country, two systems" principle provided for the foundation that
Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, and that there
would be minimal change to its existing laws, systems, policies
and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"We are all confident of Hong Kong's future importance in the
region and the world and see the 1997 transition as a positive
direction for Hong Kong in the context of a larger picture of new
and greater challenge and opportunity, and it is a new exciting
era for Hong Kong, for us in Greece and Europe and the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Joseph Lee, director of the HKTDC in
Europe, also briefed the participants on Hong Kong's political and
economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of China's opening up and reform over the past
years, saying that China's opening caused a major transformation
of Hong Kong's economy as it provided abundant land and labor.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese economy was vital to Hong Kong's
continued prosperity, but Hong Kong was also very important to the
mainland because of the economic interdependence that had
developed in the last 17 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong, as China's window to the world, had "a
great deal of confidence" for its future.

<HEADLINE> Intel Sued for Infringement of Degital's Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Digital Equipment Corporation of
the U.S. has filed a lawsuit charging Intel Corporation, the
world's largest chip maker, with willful infringement of 10
Digital patents in making, using and selling microprocessor
products.
</P>
<P>
The products involved were Intel's Pentium, Pentium Pro and
Pentium II microprocessor families, according to Digital, one of
the nation's major manufacturers of computing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Digital said that Intel's patent infringement has caused
Digital economic injury and, if not stopped, would cause
irreparable harm. The company seeks both an injunction and
monetary damages, including triple damages for Intel's willful
violation of the patents. The injunction would prohibit Intel from
using Digital's patented technology in its present and future
microprocessor products, it said.
</P>
<P>
The company did not disclose how big the damages could be.
</P>
<P>
The patents cited in Digital's lawsuit protect Digital's
innovations in high-performance computing architecture and
micro-processor technology. The patents relate to technologies --
cache management, branch prediction and high-speed instruction
processing -- which are vital to state-of-the-art microprocessor
design. The patents were issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office between 1988 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firms Rack Up Record Profits in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian companies racked up record
profits in the first quarter of this year, thanks to low interest
rates, a hot U.S. economy and a docile work force.
</P>
<P>
Profits at 200 of Canada's largest firms hit a record 5 billion
U.S. dollars in the first quarter, up 44 percent from a year
earlier, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gain was spread across most of the economy, from retailers
such as Hudson's Bay Co. to oil companies such as PanCanadian
Petroleum Ltd., the paper's quarterly survey of earnings found.
</P>
<P>
The previous quarterly record in the paper's survey was 4
billion dollars, posted in the third quarters of both 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The economic recovery from the recession of the early 1990s is
no longer confined to exporters," said economist Patti Croft.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're into a new paradigm here, an era of growth with
low inflation," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Canada's manufacturing sector went
away a profit of 1 billion dollars, which was up 110 percent than
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the services sector, whose profit went up 79
percent to 2.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The natural resources sector saw its profit down 31 percent to
760 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the good performance by the energy industry, the
natural resources sector, as a whole, faired poorly as a result of
lower forest and metal prices.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Drops Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the
yen today, finishing at another four-month low on weak U.S.
economic data and worries that the Clinton administration isn't
concerned by the currency's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled today in New York at 118.50 yen, down from
119.30 yen Monday and its lowest finish since late January.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the dollar dropped through 120 yen for the first
time since late January.
</P>
<P>
In addition to weakness against the yen, the dollar softened
against other major currencies. It finished at 1.6959 marks, down
from 1.7064. The pound cost 1.6329 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6184
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Further hurting the dollar was a Commerce Department report
showing retail sales fell 0.3 percent in April, the biggest
decline in 10 months. The news was viewed as another possible sign
of economic weakening in the United States, which can diminish the
dollar's value.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday:
1.4373 Swiss francs, down from 1.4385; 5.7045 French francs, down
from 5.7530; 1.676.00 Italian lire, down from 1,691.00; 1.3868

<HEADLINE> Two Senators Call for Permanent MFN Status to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Two senators said today that
they will introduce a bill to give China permanent Most Favored
Nation (MFN) trade status.
</P>
<P>
Senators Max Baucus of the Democrats and John Chafee of the
Republicans told a press conference that MFN is a "misnomer,"
which should be corrected.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terribly important to stress that... one of the
great misnomers in the United States is calling normal trading
relationships `Most Favored Nation,'" Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
"Most Favored Nation gives the connotation that you're
extending some special benefit, some extra-special thing to a
trading partner. Not at all," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baucus said that there are 151 countries and territories who
enjoy better than MFN status in their commercial relationship with
the United States while 55 countries and territories, including
China, have MFN status.
</P>
<P>
"The main point I want to make is that so many countries,
particularly 151, have better than MFN status, the point being
that MFN is a bit of a misnomer. It is the basic foundation --
trading foundation on which the GATT and our commercial
relationship among countries was founded on," Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
Baucus said he and Chafee will table the bill because the
United States shares many common interests with China.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to "think seriously about what sort of
relationship we can have with China over the next 20 years," and
debating MFN status every year "makes long-term thinking very
difficult."
</P>
<P>
"It creates an artificial annual crisis, which is in nobody's
interest, and we ought to put a stop to it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chafee agreed to Baucus' remarks, saying, "It seems to me
important for all of us to recognize that not only is China a
great nation in size and in history, but it's a proud nation."
</P>
<P>
"The granting or not granting on MFN is not helpful to a
permanent improvement in our trading situation, and it's, of
course, opposed by those who do a great deal of trade with China,"
he said.
