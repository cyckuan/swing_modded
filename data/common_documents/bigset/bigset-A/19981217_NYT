COHEN GOES TO HOUSE TO DEFEND RAIDS ON IRAQ

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With congressional Republicans wary about
Wednesday's raids on Iraq, the White House on Wednesday night
dispatched the most prominent Republican in the Clinton
administration _ William Cohen, the secretary of defense _ to offer
personal testament to the integrity of the attack from the well of
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   For slightly more than 90 minutes, Cohen spoke to a closed
gathering of lawmakers. He offered a detailed accounting of the
decision to attack, and asked for bipartisan support of the action.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry Shelton, and the director of central intelligence, George
Tenet, at the invitation of Newt Gingrich, the departing House
speaker, who unlike some of his colleagues was notably restrained
in his reaction to the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was described as a generally civil and orderly
session during which Cohen repeated many of the details he had
offered in a televised briefing _ until Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
the combative House majority whip, startled his colleagues and
Cohen by demanding to know whether he believed that national
security would be endangered if the House were to proceed on
Thursday with a vote on the impeachment resolutions against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen at first declined to answer, according to officials who
were present, saying that such a decision should be left to the
House. DeLay pressed the question, and the Republican secretary
responded with a plea for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the tradition throughout history that when we have
people out there with the risk of dying, it's good to have good
bipartisan support,'' Cohen said, according to a witness. The
remark was greeted by applause from throughout the chamber, said
one of those present.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen continued: ``Unity and bipartisan support is important for
the morale of the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   While briefings for committees or congressional leaders are not
unusual in times of military action, the unusual politics of
impeachment accounted for the extraordinary sight of a defense
secretary testifying in the well of the House to the honesty of his
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen dominated the session, a testimony to his stature in this
part of Washington: Cohen served in the House from 1973 until 1979,
and as U.S. senator from Maine from that year until Clinton
nominated him in 1997. Cohen's decision to put his own reputation
behind the integrity of the attack clearly influenced some, though
not all, of the lawmakers who attended Wednesday night's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Cohen ``went to great lengths
to point out how he had never had politics as his consideration for
the military action,'' and that Cohen said he would not have
acquiesced to the attack if politics were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Fla., said he was inclined to believe that
the attack was not politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I find evidence that there was a calculated timing, I
have to give the president the benefit of the doubt,'' Gekas said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House National
Security Committee, said Cohen had assured the members of Congress
that ``events dictated'' the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some accepted it, who wanted to, and others didn't,'' Spence
said of his colleagues' reactions. Spence was more reserved in
offering his own perception. ``I've heard it before,'' he said,
adding that he thought the attack could just have easily been
launched in November, or next week.
</P>
<P>
   After Cohen's presentation, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., the
speaker-designate, said the House would vote on Thursday on a
resolution in support of troops involved in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's meeting came after a raucous day on Capital Hill, when
many Republicans were raising direct questions about whether
Clinton had timed the attack to undercut Republican plans to vote
on the impeachment resolutions. The debate, which was supposed to
begin Thursday morning, was put off after the attack began.

UCLA LOCKER-ROOM CHATS HIT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins have learned as much in the locker room
as on the court this season, and the knowledge has little to do
with the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin has arranged for a slew of coaches and former
athletes _ including Jerry West, Rafer Johnson, A.C. Green, Ronnie
Lott and Larry Brown _ to speak to the Bruins about managing their
lives and improving their market value.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _Johnson, the gold medal decathlete, talked about being an
African-American college student during the dawn of the civil
rights movement and his relationship with Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   _Lott described his childhood desire to play basketball for
UCLA, until he realized his future was in football at USC. ``He got
worked into a frenzy,'' Lavin said. ``I think the guys were a
little scared.''
</P>
<P>
   _Former UCLA players Kiki Vandeweghe, Mitchell Butler and
Darrick Martin talked about their personal triumphs and failures.
Martin described his sour relationship with former coach Jim
Harrick and its effect on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   _West, the Hall of Famer and Lakers executive, expressed
frustration about dealing with modern players, urged the Bruins to
select positive role models and warned: ``Don't be an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us how to be a pro on and off the court, how to be in
the spotlight,'' Bruins guard Rico Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker was well received _ Lavin, a lifelong San Francisco
49ers fan, was especially taken with Lott _ but the Bruins best
identified with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Butler, Green and Martin,'' forward Travis Reed said.
``They're pros, and that's where I want to be. I'd rather listen to
them than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Necessity: With Baron Davis on the court, the Bruins
outscored Nevada Las Vegas 49-30. Without him, they were outscored
37-23. Davis remains on a restricted-minutes program and probably
will play 20-25 minutes Saturday against Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``His medical team sees it as a marathon, not a sprint,'' said
Lavin, who hopes Davis will be cleared to play 30 minutes a game in
January.
</P>
<P>
   A look ahead: Next year's schedule is complete, and it's a good
one. The Bruins will host Pepperdine, Iona, Purdue, Gonzaga and
DePaul, and they'll visit Syracuse and North Carolina, which
replaces Duke as the major intersectional television game.
Pepperdine features former assistant Lorenzo Romar, while Purdue
coach Gene Keady is Lavin's former boss and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will not participate in a November tournament because of a
late-summer trip to Italy. The NCAA does not allow foreign tours
and preseason tournaments in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Top recruit Carlos Boozer visited campus last
weekend and watched the Nevada Las Vegas game from midcourt, six
rows up. Ex-Duke star Grant Hill was conveniently seated two rows
above Boozer, casting a massive shadow. The Bruins and Blue Devils
are slugging it out for his signature.... Forward JaRon Rush,
shooting 19.2 percent from 3-point range, is taking extra practice
each morning to find his groove.... Forward/center Jerome Moiso is
averaging 17.5 points since Lavin's threat to bench him in Puerto
Rico for not shooting.... Forward Travis Reed is shooting 90
percent from the foul line after making just 33.3 percent last
year. ``That has to be some kind of record for the greatest
turnaround in the history of college basketball,'' Lavin quipped.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS POSTPONE SHOWDOWN ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS throughout to update, add fresh quotes, drop redundant

 (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Furious and fractured, House Republicans on
Wednesday night postponed the impeachment vote against President
Clinton for perhaps a few days because of the bombing campaign
against Iraq, even as the odds against the president began to look
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Republican after Republican announced new support for
impeachment as the lame-duck 105th Congress returned to the Capitol
for evening party caucuses on the issue. But the House was soon
left reeling at the clash of crises. The first wave of bombs fell
in Iraq just minutes before the Republicans began their own
closed-door strategy session.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of raucous, angry and passionate debate, the
Republicans, despite expressing deep suspicions of Clinton's motive
for ordering the bombing, finally heeded the call from their
incoming speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, that the impeachment
debate, which had been scheduled for Thursday, be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said, ``We're going to defer action tomorrow.'' Not
even bringing himself to mention the word impeachment, he said,
``We are reserving our right to move forward with the other
action.''
</P>
<P>
   He instructed members to stay in Washington on standby, for
debate to resume ``possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but within
the near future.'' He said, ``The issue is important and will come
up in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the presidential spokesman, said the White House
would have no comment on the House decision to postpone the
impeachment vote. ``That is a matter for the Congress to decide,''
Lockhart said. Aides soliciting support for Clinton were told
Wednesday afternoon to stop lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, at least nine more Republicans declared they
would vote to impeach Clinton, many of them the moderates whom
Clinton most desperately needed to bring to his side. Their
defection left any White House strategy to protect the president in
a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that even though it was still mathematically
possible, they could no longer see how the president could avoid
impeachment _ the indictment by the House that would be followed by
trial in the Senate _ unless military action somehow shifted the
mood of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless this action has an unexpected effect, he's done,'' said
a Democrat close to the effort to spare Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton, as expected, loses only three to five Democrats in
the impeachment vote, he needs to draw 14 to 17 Republicans to his
side. Democrats had identified about 20 who they thought were the
most likely to support him. But most of the Republicans who
declared their support for impeachment Wednesday were from that
crucial group of 20 and it is unlikely that the rest would all go
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republicans said they were still struggling for a possible
compromise on impeachment. Reps. Peter King and Amo Houghton, both
of New York, said they had written a censure proposal they hoped to
submit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It will specify that Clinton lied under oath about his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, require him to pay a fine of
$500,000, deny him the opportunity to deliver the State of the
Union address in person, bar him from fund-raising and keep him
from holding future office.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said he presented the proposal to Clinton in an Oval
Office meeting and the president did not reject it, though he did
not agree with all of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston has said a censure resolution will not be
considered in the House. And several Republicans said Wednesday's
military action had only hardened the resolve in their party to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, suspicions around the timing of the action in
Iraq has solidified support against the president,'' said Rep.
Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who are almost united against impeachment,
rallied behind the president. Some even called for impeachment to
be put off into the next Congress, when the Democrats will have
five more seats and Clinton might have more of a chance of avoiding
being only the second president impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why this can't go over to the next
Congress,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said, ``There was
a unanimous feeling in our caucus that it should not come up as
long as our troops are in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, said
the fact that Republicans had doubts about the legitimacy of the
military action showed that Clinton was losing his ability to lead.
``If the president refuses to resign for the sake of the nation, I
believe he should be impeached and face Senate trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties went straight from their respective
meetings to the House floor for a briefing by the president's
entire national security team. The departing House speaker, Newt
Gingrich, worked with Cabinet officials to organize that session
while Livingston helped conduct the Republican caucus on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Lockhart dismissed any suggestion that
Clinton was using his powers as commander in chief to avoid
becoming the first president to be impeached since Andrew Johnson
130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though most polls show that most Americans oppose impeachment,
it was unclear if and how the bombing strikes would affect public
opinion.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Throughout the extraordinary day, Republicans tried to assure
the nation of the stability of foreign policy even as one after
another they announced their decisions to vote for the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comforted by the fact that the president is in contact
with the bipartisan leadership,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y.,, as he announced that he had decided to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been by far the most difficult, even tormenting
decision I have had to make in my 16 years in Congress,'' Boehlert
said speaking softly before television cameras. ``I simply have not
found the means to rationalize away the fact that our president
lied under oath, that he has tried repeatedly to game the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans spoke in similar uncompromising terms. ``I get
the impression that the president considers himself above the
law,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who had once said he would
oppose impeachment, but now said he would support it on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rep. Rick Lazio of New York on Wednesday night
contrasted the president's statements on Monica Lewinsky with the
sacrifice American soldiers make in battle, saying, ``It should not
be difficult now to tell the truth or vote according to the
dictates of conscience even if it means the end of one's career.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who came out against Clinton made up a roster of
Republicans he had hoped to sway, including Reps. Brian Bilbray of
California, Jim Leach of Iowa and Bob Ney of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, as he headed for Washington, Bilbray said he had
``very, very frank'' discussions with White House staff on Tuesday
night and ultimately concluded he had to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot as a man, husband, elected official or a father say
that the president did not commit perjury,'' Bilbray said. ``I
cannot walk away and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ney said: ``I think as a Christian country, we need to feel
toward the president some sympathy for the situation that he is
in.'' But he said that ``with no malice towards the president of
the United States'' he was going to vote for impeachment because
Clinton had ``shattered the trust of the American people by
committing perjury, obstructing justice and corroding the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the impeachment debate became interwoven with the Iraq
actions, the battle lines seemed to be forming for how the two
parties were going to fight on after the House vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who canceled a trip to New Hampshire to
stay in Washington, began sounding what is expected to be the White
House theme in the weeks ahead _ that Republicans were embarked on
a partisan, divisive course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe on Capitol Hill there is still time for Democrats
and Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan
compromise to seek a resolution that is both quick and fair and try
to turn away from the bitter partisanship that we have seen so
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Pappas, R-N.J., one of the lame-duck members of
Congress, who put his support behind impeachment on Wednesday by
contrast renewed the call for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions were the cause that brought us to this point,'' he
said. ``He can resign and keep us from having to move forward to go
to the time and expense and diversion this would cause the Congress
or the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the party divisions of the day concerned whether
impeachment should go forward along with the bombing. But Democrats
_ nearly unanimous against the impeachment _ argued for a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if we are at war it would be appropriate to
postpone the proceedings,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who is
retiring from Congress.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO much has changed since the day in 1992 when Drayton McLane Jr.
fell into our midst like a turnip off the back of one of his
grocery trucks.
</P>
<P>
   He was the wide-eyed innocent then, the benevolent grandfather
type who would deliver us from the evil clutches of John McMullen,
the Great Satan long before angry Iranians hung that label on our
entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a no-nonsense businessman so out of his element, so
unfamiliar with the warped realities of the professional sport in
which he was suddenly chin-deep, that he once sat at a budget
meeting and questioned the entry for team per diem on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I have to pay for their meals?'' he asked. ``I
already give them good salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tee-hee.
</P>
<P>
   How charming to think the owner of a major-league baseball
franchise could be so full of naivet about the dirty details of the
industry in which he had just invested millions. How long, you
wondered, would it take for him to understand the infield-fly rule
and that a closer isn't the guy who locks up the Astrodome at
night?
</P>
<P>
   Just three years later, McLane had become an expert at the
municipal blackmail game, threatening to sell the Astros to a man
with a bag of cash in Northern Virginia if Houston didn't build him
a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Give him this: He's a quick study, capable of changing colors
faster than a chameleon.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us _ and McLane down on his knees _ to Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to believe any of the poor-mouthing and the speeches
about fiscal responsibility that McLane has delivered, then he
should phone agent Randy Hendricks today and tell him to go peddle
the Rocket on another street corner. No wheedling, no
counteroffers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994 during the calamitous labor war, when the owners
canceled the World Series and left their sport hemorrhaging, McLane
was one of the hardest-line owners. With a payroll at the time of
roughly $26 million, he showed us the insides of his empty pockets
and preached the need for salary controls. He also hammered away
that his low-revenue Astros could not engage in bidding for
top-dollar free agents with the Yankees, Braves, Dodgers, Indians,
Rockies and their ilk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a payroll that will already top $50 million next
season, McLane continues to waltz with Hendricks about bringing
Clemens home to Texas, even if means renegotiating an $8
million-a-year contract to something just this side of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   By making a counteroffer to the agent's outrageous demand and
keeping the lines of communication open when the price is so high,
McLane is going against the advice of his management team, which
includes knowledgeable baseball men such as club president Tal
Smith and general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, by continuing his
teen-age-boy-sniffing-after-the-prom-queen act, McLane is
demonstrating he is no different than any other baseball owner. By
even broaching the subject of a renegotiated contract, he is
contributing to an economic system that is cannibalizing the game
and which he claims to abhor. By overruling his general manager,
McLane proves his ego outweighs his sense.
</P>
<P>
   The simple reason Hendricks slithered around Hunsicker to
negotiate with McLane is that the owner, caught up in the rah-rah
hype, is more apt to take a bite of the apple, even if it means
crippling the team in the process. You saw the way McLane stood by
his high-profile seat behind home plate at the Dome, giddy from
backslaps, basking in the glow of the Astros' 102-win season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you make me a champion?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, golly, Beav.
</P>
<P>
   It was never better for McLane than the two months when Randy
Johnson lit up Houston with his fastball and the owner swam in
congratulations. Just imagine the compliments he'd get for
delivering the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the grocery distributor is now hooked on the
adulation, which is turning him into an enabler who allows a
destructive economic system to get more rotten to the core.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McLane's baseball people didn't think it was a good idea
to offer Johnson $33 million as a free agent, believing that
spending just part of that money to boost other areas of the team
was the more prudent path.
</P>
<P>
   Those same folks surely don't want to gut what has been built in
order to add Clemens at a budget-busting and logic-smashing price.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the baseball minds who need convincing but McLane. Just
six years since falling off the grocery truck as a brand-new kind
of owner, one turnip looks like all the rest.

STOCK, BOND MARKETS REACT WITH CAUTION TO IRAQ BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 10th graf concerning Asian markets. No other
changes.)  (JT/mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The attack on Iraq Wednesday sent ripples through
world financial markets and was expected to weigh on American
stocks when markets opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, who noted that predicting market reactions is
difficult, said they did not expect a major impact as long the
attack succeeded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a quick resolution, markets should go back to trading
on the basis of the other uncertainties worrying investors _ the
impeachment vote looming over President Clinton, slowing corporate
earnings and the deepening recession in much of the rest of the
world. All of these events, analysts believe, could have a much
bigger impact on stocks, bonds, the dollar, oil and other commodity
prices than the Iraq attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets, traders and investors really hate uncertainty,'' said
David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
``But,'' he added, referring to the bombing, ``they have been
through it before and will look at what happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 21 percent after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990, it soared 18.5
percent in the two months after the war began in January and it
appeared that the United States and its allies would win easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect it to have a gargantuan impact,'' Blitzer said.
``It won't turn the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   As in 1991, the Iraqi situation could turn positive quickly,
which would prevent much reaction at all. That is why forecasting a
market response is so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said that the big negative that threatened all
markets in 1991 _ a surge in oil prices that took it quickly to $40
a barrel _ is extremely unlikely today.
</P>
<P>
   Futures contracts on both the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, an indicator of how
prices would likely behave in early trading Thursday, fell after
news reports about the attack on Iraq, which came after the
American markets had closed. During trading, when it was already
clear that an attack was a possibility, stocks were little changed.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 32.70 points to 8,790.60
while the S&AMP;P index of 500 stocks slipped 0.89 points to 1,161.94.
The Nasdaq index fell 3.24 points to 2,009.36.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets were mostly lower in midday trading Thursday, but
the moves were relatively small compared with recent trading. Major
indexes were off 1 percent or less in Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore, about 2.2 percent in Malaysia and 2.5 percent in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraq crisis was a dominant theme on Wall Street
Wednesday, stocks also were affected by profit-warnings of large
blue-chip companies. The latest was 3M, which said its
fourth-quarter results would miss expectations. Its stock dropped 2
3/8 to 71 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany
Corp., said that the impeachment of the president could be far more
damaging to stocks, especially if it ever seems that Clinton will
actually leave office. ``The stock market expects the House to vote
impeachment but that it will not get through the Senate,'' he said.
Blitzer said just a long trial in the Senate, regardless of the
outcome, could be a problem. ``I could see people getting
distracted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market prices rose and yields, which move in the opposite
direction, ended lower just as the official word of the Iraq attack
came at 5 p.m. The price of the 30-year Treasury issue advanced
18/32 to a price of 104 3/32 and its yield eased to 4.99 percent
from 5.02 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But one trader said that may just have been a knee-jerk
reaction. In early trading in the bond futures market Wednesday
night, there was very little reaction, with the price of the
30-year bond up just slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the possibility of a bombing, oil prices shot
up sharply Wednesday after it was announced that U.N. inspectors
were leaving Iraq because President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would
not cooperate with inspections of the country's weapons programs.
Since an attack on Iraq was avoided at the last minute in November,
both the United States and Britain had threatened to attack without
warning if the inspections program was undermined by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The near-month contract for oil on the New York Mercantile
Exchange jumped 7.2 percent, or 83 cents, to $12.38 a barrel, the
biggest single-day gain in three months.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Rothman, the senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch,
said ``when this ends, it is very likely oil prices could be under
renewed downward pressure.'' Even with Wednesday's rally, oil
prices are not far above the 12-year lows they hit earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said the price of oil rose on the anticipation of the
cutoff, if an attack began, of the 1.7 million to 1.8 million
barrels of oil a day that Iraq is allowed to sell under a
humanitarian exemption from the economic embargo in place since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that supply could be disrupted for up to a month.
But if sales resumed relatively quickly, he said, the temporary
absence of Iraqi oil on the market would not make a significant
dent in the glut that is depressing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said that he is not expecting the conflict to result in
a disruption of oil production from any of Iraq's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also rallied Wednesday in Europe, as it often does
when there is political or military uncertainty, rising to 1.6728
German marks from 1.6575 marks Tuesday. But it was little changed
against the Japanese yen, inching up to 116.53 yen from 116.35 yen
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that the dollar could lose these gains
quickly if it is clear that the attack on Iraq will be successful
and will not lead to wider problems. In trading early in Tokyo
Thursday, the dollar was lower against both the mark and the yen.

 WASHINGTON: he can.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying time might be the president's best hope, if only a very
slim one. Pro-impeachment sentiment has reached a peak this week,
but it could conceivably dissipate if the roll-call is
significantly postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first president since the end of World War II
to have his foreign policy motives questioned. Ronald Reagan was
accused by a few members of Congress and a few editorial writers of
staging the invasion of Grenada to mute criticism of his failure to
protect marines who were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But not since Harry Truman and the Korean War has a president
been subjected to quite the same level of questioning of motive
that Clinton was subjected to Wednesday. The fact that Lott
released his statement moments before the attack increased the
sense that he was undercutting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did, in fact, rally to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona was in the midst of a press conference
in Tucson lambasting Clinton for ``impeachable offenses'' when
handed a note about the air raids, and he changed course
immediately, voicing support for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But many others, while not willing to speak as bluntly or as
publicly as Solomon and Lott, gave voice privately to deep
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried his best to allay them, quoting U.S. military
planners as saying that waiting would give Saddam time to conceal
and protect elements of his suspected nuclear and chemical
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proved himself a
friend in need. By agreeing to join in the attacks, and by
defending his decision in an eloquent statement carried on
international television, Blair gave Clinton political cover
against his partisan critics. That was especially welcome in view
of the opposition voiced by China, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to make Wednesday night's
television appearance look like business as usual _ a calm, serious
report about a threat to the national interest, with only a quick,
glancing reference to his own troubles. But he delivered it in a
setting he has recently avoided, the Oval Office, near which many
of his fateful meetings with Monica S. Lewinsky took place.

KINGS BACK WHERE THEY STARTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For three-quarters of one game, the Los Angeles
Kings were almost whole.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake was playing after missing 15 games with a broken foot,
oft-injured center Jozef Stumpel was in the lineup, and the goalies
were healthy.
</P>
<P>
   That was Saturday, when the Kings (8-18-3) defeated Vancouver
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   This is now: Blake will miss the second game of the three-game
suspension he picked up thanks to a slashing penalty early in the
third period against the Canucks, and No.1 goalie Stephane Fiset
will be sidelined tonight when the Kings play host to the New York
Islanders. Only Stumpel remains.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset suffered what team physician Dr. Ronald Kvitne said was
``tightness'' in his right groin during practice Wednesday. On Oct.
18, Fiset suffered a right groin strain and was sidelined 10 days.
In his first game back, he suffered a left groin strain and missed
another month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fiset is listed as day to day, though his initial strain at
first was called a one-game injury and ended up lasting longer.
Jamie Storr, who missed one month with a groin strain earlier this
season, is scheduled to play tonight. Manny Legace was recalled
Wednesday from the Long Beach Ice Dogs to serve as Storr's backup.
Legace is just getting over a strained back, and another goalie in
the Kings' system, Ryan Bach, also has a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recalling Legace, the Kings promoted rookie right
wing Pavel Rosa from the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 21, has had injury problems of his own, recently missing
14 games with symptoms of post-concussion syndrome related to
concussion and inner-ear problems that sidelined him for most of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 195-pound Rosa, who has never appeared in an NHL
game, had 13 points in 16 games with the Ice Dogs. He is considered
one of the Kings' top prospects, and two years ago had 63 goals and
153 points in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa replaces winger Eric Lacroix on the Kings' roster. Lacroix,
who was placed on the injured-reserve list Wednesday, is expected
to miss about a month with a broken collarbone. Perhaps Rosa can
give the Kings' offense a lift. The Kings have scored fewer goals
than all but two of the NHL's 27 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Blake upset: Blake sounded off on the three-game suspension
handed to him by NHL vice president Colin Campbell for his slash on
Vancouver's Harry York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a joke,'' Blake said. ``You've got one guy who
thinks he can do anything he wants. They've got no decision-making
process at all.... He said it was a two-handed baseball swing. If
I'm going to two-hand a guy, I'm going to break his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative on York, who suffered a bruise on the play
and is not expected to be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was that bad, Vancouver would have sent (a videotape to
the NHL),'' said Blake, who learned of the three-game suspension
after a telephone hearing Monday. ``The hearing is useless.
(Campbell) had his mind made up before going into that hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake said that after the slash, teammate Luc Robitaille skated
over to referee Don Koharski, who had assessed Blake a five-minute
major and game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luc said to Koho, `Is he going to get suspended?''' Blake
said. ``He said, `No, but I'm going to give him a major.' I've done
worse in games and gotten two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned his remarks could lead to further
discipline from Campbell, Blake shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to fine me $1,000 probably,'' said Blake, who
already has lost $83,304.69 as a result of the slash. ``Maybe he'll
see what I said and say, `I'm going to give you a few more games.'
''

DEVILS DEFEAT RANGERS, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The opponent may have been the Rangers,
with Wayne Gretzky, Brian Leetch and Petr Nedved, but the Devils
never emphasized defense on Wednesday night at the Continental
Arena. Instead, they looked to attack from the outset, producing
more than five goals for the fifth consecutive game, this time a
6-3 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys believe in themselves and they're scoring,'' Coach
Robbie Ftorek said after New Jersey's third consecutive victory
over New York this season extended their unbeaten streak to eight
games (6-0-2). ``All the guys play aggressively when we have the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott and Jay Pandolfo led the Devils with two goals
each, with Sheldon Souray and Bobby Holik also scoring goals for
the Devils, who improved their record to 18-7-3, best in the
Eastern Conference. The victory also set a team record of at least
five goals in five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is working well for us right now,'' said Petr
Sykora, who had a Gretzky-like game with three assists. ``We have
four lines scoring goals and that's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky assisted on power-play goals by Kevin Stevens and Adam
Graves and scored the last goal for the Rangers on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lousy in our zone,'' Coach John Muckler said. ``This
is the worst I have ever seen a team play in their own zone. It's
just a guessing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, who has started 13 of the last 14 games and is
undefeated in his last eight starts, earned his 14th victory of the
season (14-7-3) with 23 saves. Chris Terreri has the other four
victories in as many starts.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with enthusiasm before only their second sellout crowd
of the season _ their first also came against the Rangers _ the
Devils displayed plenty of resiliency around Mike Richter, who
faced 27 shots in his 10th consecutive start for the Rangers
(11-12-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took the lead on Pandolfo's eighth of the season, 3
minutes 40 seconds after the opening face-off, when he stepped into
the slot and converted a rebound of a shot by Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied it on a shot by Kevin Stevens during their
first manpower advantage. His goal was his first in eight games and
the fourth power-play goal in two nights for the Rangers. Although
the Devils were aware of the Rangers' efficiency with the man
advantage, they took four penalties in the opening period, two by
Holik.
</P>
<P>
   One of Holik's penalties carried over into the second period,
allowing the Rangers to take control in the early stages of the
period. But the Devils quickly reversed the tables and scored the
next three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Souray gave the Devils the lead with his first of the season at
6:39 when he beat Richter over the glove moments after Arnott had
hit the post in the same sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott caught Richter too far away from his goal at 11:20
seconds for his eighth goal, and Holik extended the lead to three
goals with his 11th just 55 seconds later, when his shot from the
high slot found its way through a crowd in front of Richter.
</P>
<P>
   After Graves narrowed the gap for the Rangers just 30 seconds
into the last period, Arnott scored another goal before Gretzky got
his sixth of the season and Pandolfo sealed the victory with an
empty-netter with 46 seconds left.

NBA WOULD DO WELL TO HONOR PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One hundred years ago this month, the lords of
basketball, in a shocking lapse of foresight, made a big mistake.
They started paying the players.
</P>
<P>
   History doesn't tell us how long it was before a player demanded
to renegotiate, or how long it was before somebody in the league
office complained that high salaries ($100? It's an outrage!) would
ruin the sport.
</P>
<P>
   What is known, because I have the box score right here, is that
on Dec. 1, 1898, at Textile Hall in the Kensington section of
Philadelphia, a team known as the Trenton Nationals used a
second-half rally to defeat a team called the Kensington Hancocks
22-18 in front of 950 fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the debut of the sport's first ``major league,'' the
National League of Professional Basketball, a circuit of six
Pennsylvania- and New Jersey-based teams that modeled itself on the
National League of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And there's been major-league basketball ever since _ or there
was until this season.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the game then bore little resemblance to the game
today, even if you set aside the fact there is no game today.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters were Philadelphia-area sports editors and other
businessmen, and the league was formed only to legitimize
``professional'' basketball after barnstorming players were accused
of accepting money, angering the gym owners from the YMCA and
Amateur Athletic Union.
</P>
<P>
   The players' pay was maybe $15 a game _ there were no
season-long contracts _ and it would be as much as a decade before
the Michael Jordans and Shaquille O'Neals of the day broke the $50
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The players were strictly part-time _ moonlighting bank tellers,
public-works employees and postal workers (one of whom must have
been the original Mailman, no doubt inspiring the first ``Mailman
Delivers'' headline).
</P>
<P>
   They were all white, and the star player and coach of the
Trenton Nationals, brothers Al and Fred Cooper, were Englishmen who
adapted the earliest basketball tactics from soccer.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't have recognized it: Forwards, generally 5-foot-7 to
5-foot-11, were the smallest players on the floor, shifty scoring
machines all. Guards, who went 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-1, were
back-line defensive specialists, which is why the position got that
name. Centers, a few of whom were 6-foot-4 giants, were considered
Renaissance men if they could do much more than win jump balls,
which occurred after every basket.
</P>
<P>
   The constant jump balls were only one difference from the game
we know. The court was enclosed in a wire or rope cage in those
days, with no out-of-bounds, and the action got roller-derby rough,
with hip checks and bloody lips.
</P>
<P>
   When an opponent drove the lane for a layup, a defensive player
was obligated to level him, perhaps break his nose, just to teach
him a lesson. Violence against referees was not uncommon, usually
punishable by a $10 fine; and you thought Nick Van Exel got off
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The roughness of the game, not to mention the lack of a
24-second clock for another half-century, accounted for the low
score of that first game in Philadelphia. Eighteen of the 40 points
were accounted for by free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Al Cooper was the league's leading scorer with 8.8 points a game
that season and Trenton finished first with an 18-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder where all these details came from. The answer:
from a couple of sports historians who, for much of the past year,
have been trying to promote a commemoration of the pro basketball
centennial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was too important (to overlook),'' said Bill
Himmelman, a 60-year-old New Jersey native who was president of a
company that manufactured welding torches before he dived into the
sports-nostalgia business.
</P>
<P>
   Himmelman said he faxed and mailed 2,000 press releases, trying
to draw attention to the centennial, and got little response
outside the Philly-New Jersey area.
</P>
<P>
   Sadder still is the response he got more than a year ago when he
invited the NBA to join the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just weren't interested,'' Himmelman said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has been trying to refute the charge that it doesn't
care about its _ and its sport's _ history.
</P>
<P>
   The league made a festival of its 50th anniversary in 1997; that
was nice. The on-hold audio on the league office's phone system
brings you Chick Hearn's and Johnny Most's play-by-play of old NBA
Finals; that's educational. The league's rookie orientation program
includes a section on NBA history; maybe Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny
Wilkens won't be asked again, ``You used to play?''
</P>
<P>
   And NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said that although the
centennial buffs shouldn't have expected anything like the 50th
anniversary bash, under ordinary circumstances ``we would not have
let it pass without some sort of tip of the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the NBA lockout means these are not ordinary
circumstances. It's hard to hold a halftime ceremony when there's
no halftime, or when there's nothing but halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But that shouldn't have prevented the NBA doing
!ital!something!off! to show it cares.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the truth is the NBA really doesn't care much about the
various ABAs, ABLs, PBLAs, BAAs, NBLs and EBLs that helped to
create pro basketball as we know it. Or about the NLPB.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in business to promote the NBA,'' Himmelman said.
``And when you get right down to it they're not interested in
promoting leagues that opposed them (or) preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is right. They say, `We, the National and American
leagues, are the survivors, and we're the caretakers of the history
of the leagues that came before us.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the NBA, Himmelman said, the all-important bottom line is,
``History doesn't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   What should the NBA have done? It could have put out a press
release of its own. It could have designed a centennial logo, just
a tiny patch for its players to wear on their uniforms, on the off
chance its players wear uniforms this season.
</P>
<P>
   Or: It could honor pro basketball's pioneers by settling its
differences _ the illogical extension of that fateful decision a
century ago _ and guaranteeing the game a second hundred years.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to strike Iraq
Wednesday night without the customary round of consulting allies
drew sharp criticism from Russia and France, the two countries most
reluctant to use force against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked to some 16
foreign ministers of the Security Council and European and Arab
allies before the bombing began, her purpose was more to inform
them of the U.S. decision than to seek their counsel, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her most heated conversation was with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and only took place after the air strikes began,
officials said. The Russians have criticized the quick attack on
Iraq all day, but Albright rejected Ivanov's contention that the
main faults lie with U.N. inspectors and their chairman, Richard
Butler, and not Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she urged Ivanov to look beyond Iraq to more important
common interests Washington and Moscow share, including Russia's
own economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   France was also annoyed with Washington for getting Butler to
pull out his inspectors from Iraq without discussion with the
Security Council. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that his
country regretted ``the situation that has been created and which
prompted these American strikes in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States won public support from its reliable allies
Japan and Canada while China joined Russia in angrily denouncing
the U.S. strike.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department were in
close touch all day with top Saudi officials, given Saudi Arabia's
willingness to let U.S. and British planes refuel from Saudi bases.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said that from the start the
United States had planned to work closely with Britain. ``We also
had the support of many other nations,'' he said. ``I have talked
personally with a number of countries, and they were prepared to
volunteer assets. And they did in fact call and say they would be
supportive of anything that we were to undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, also said
that when the president and his aides telephoned foreign leaders
they found ``a good deal of support in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States decided to avoid the time-consuming
process of asking countries other than Britain to take part in the
military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we would act with the British, ourselves, with
the support of many other countries, but not necessarily with their
participation,'' Berger said, adding that pulling together a
multi-nation military operation would have ``taken us days, if not
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright did not speak with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
officials said. He issued a personal statement in New York on
Wednesday, calling this ``a sad day'' for the United Nations, the
world, and ``me personally,'' because of his failure to avert the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes marked the end of a nearly eight-year effort to
police and disarm Iraq through the United Nations itself, rather
than through powerful Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection process is largely dead, U.S. officials say.
Instead, Washington will use other forms of traditional
containment, including continued economic sanctions, threats,
support for opposition forces and the intermittent use of force to
try to restrain Saddam. But few officials believe that air power
alone can eliminate the threat posed by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the criticism Wednesday was America's timing and
lack of new consultation, and the fear that Clinton would be
perceived abroad, especially by Arab countries, for acting in his
own benefit to avoid rapid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials argued that the surprise factor and the
imminence of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that begins Saturday
night _ not the impeachment vote _ was forcing the schedule, but
analysts were not convinced, and did not think the world would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other confrontations with Iraq have dragged out for days
and weeks while the administration geared up for a possible
response, checked off all the diplomatic boxes and then usually did
not act, how is it possible that the bombing had to happen today?''
asked Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment. ``A reasonable person
is logically forced to view this with a degree of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had authorized similar air strikes a month ago, then
called them off when Saddam appeared to capitulate and promise full
compliance with the United Nations. And U.S. officials emphasized
at the time that they expected Saddam to renege on his promises,
because he always intended to keep a core of biological and
chemical weapons, and they would be able to use force later with
less international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said they had considerable concerns, both about how
effective the bombing campaign will be to rid Iraq of the weapons
of mass destruction Unscom inspectors were prevented from
uncovering, and about how the bombing may or may not fit into the
larger strategy of ridding the world of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Even presuming that Clinton and his foreign-policy team had no
political reasons to bomb Wednesday, said William Quandt, a former
National Security Council official under Presidents Nixon and
Carter, ``my qualms are about what happens the day after the
bombing stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's a disaster, but will this get rid of him?'' Quandt
asked. ``We know what we want but we're not prepared to pay the
price to do it. Bombing is the compromise choice that makes us feel
better, that we're somehow punishing Iraq, though not necessarily
Saddam, and we won't take any significant risks of casualties
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one senior official said, using force now is also an
important signal to the world that Clinton will act when he needs
to, despite his domestic difficulties.

<P>
   Wednesday evening, Clinton defended the joint U.S.-British
strikes, which he described as ``strong and sustained,'' and
intended to repress and degrade Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction and use them against its neighbors. And U.S.
officials said more explicitly that the attacks were also designed
``to shake the regime'' by also targeting Saddam's structure of
power, including the Revolutionary Guard, his communications
facilities, his palaces and strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced that it is ordering the departure
of dependents and some other personnel from diplomatic posts in Tel
Aviv, Jerusalem and Kuwait because of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The order is an upgrade of earlier warnings. A general travel
advisory to Americans to use caution and review their security
practices was also updated from November to mention the new
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said there was no specific threat that prompted
the warning.

BATTLE OVER ONLINE ACCESS COMING TO SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Two cable television giants are poised to offer
lightning-fast access to Web surfers in the suburban San Fernando
Valley, using a technology that could change the face of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With an online connection through cable television lines, users
will be able to download files in seconds rather than minutes, at
speeds more than 1,000 times faster than telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But woven into the technology is a growing national debate that
will begin playing out tonight in Los Angeles. The battle pits
cable companies such as Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner
against companies including America Online and Earthlink, who want
their services to be available through the new cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies want to require consumers to pay for their
high-speed Internet service, and if they want AOL or another
service, they would pay for that as well.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Board of Information Technology Commissioners tonight
will begin hearing from consumers and technology industry lobbyists
on both sides of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're looking at a civil war between cable and
Internet service providers, and what we have to look at is if this
merger will take away from competition,'' said Alan Arkatov,
president of the board. ``We have to look out for consumers on
public policy issues like choice, access and competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the California State
Office Building in suburban Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   The city could require cable companies to allow consumers a
choice of Internet service -- from AOL, for instance -- as a
condition of the renewal or transfer of their franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next year, the five-member board will recommend whether
the city should approve a transfer of the cable franchise for the
East Valley and other parts of the city from TCI to a new entity to
be formed when the cable company completes a $48.3 billion merger
with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Cable company officials said it won't be worth their money to
build the high-speed networks if they have to allow competitors to
use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are forced to open up our network, we would have little
incentive to make the $1.8 billion investment to upgrade our
network. That could have a chilling effect on us going forward and
offering the technology,'' said Andrew Johnson, a spokesman for TCI
and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed connection would come packaged with TCI's
Internet service (At)Home, Johnson said. A customer who wants to
continue using America Online or another Internet account instead
of (At)Home would have to pay for both services.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that arrangement amounts to a cable-company
monopoly over Internet access. Online service providers predict
they will lose business and jobs, setting Los Angeles further back
in the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant concern that the cable companies will
try to get a monopoly . . . and every (service provider) will lose
business,'' said Lee Thoburn, vice president of business affairs
for Earthlink.
</P>
<P>
   TCI serves about 95,000 households in the San Fernando Valley
and 26,000 in neighboring Ventura County. The company is in roughly
400,000 Southern California homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which plans to launch a high-speed access system
called Roadrunner in mid-1999, serves about 120,000 customers in
the West Valley and surrounding areas.

TIMING OF ATTACK LEAVES REPUBLICANS DIVIDED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided
Wednesday night over the timing of the air strikes against Iraq,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fiercely attacked President
Clinton's policy.
</P>
<P>
   After House Republicans met for more than three hours Wednesday
night, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the speaker-designate, called on
Republicans and Democrats ``to support our troops now that they're
deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly skeptical of the timing of the attack, Livingston said,
``we'll leave that to the best judgment of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers wrestled with competing instincts: the urge
to support American troops and an American president when bombs are
falling, and a thinly-disguised anger that the attack had come on
the eve of an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   That led to surreal scenes, like Livingston's news conference in
the Capitol rotunda, with comments about praying for the troops
mingled with a promise that the impeachment vote would be put off
for only a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict extended beyond Washington, with Republicans like
Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey also tempering her condemnation
of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq with her criticism of Clinton
and the timing of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is on the Armed Services
Committee, said of Clinton, ``Obviously, there will be those who
will question his motives and timing. He will receive significant
support because it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein is neither
complying nor cooperating'' with international arms inspectors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in an extraordinary rebuke of the president's foreign
policy, Lott, said he opposed the air assault on suspected Iraqi
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons sites, arguing that the
attacks were ineffective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time,'' Lott said in a statement, infuriating the White House.
``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lott has criticized the administration for failing
to take more aggressive steps to topple Saddam. Under pressure from
Congress, Clinton enacted the Iraq Liberation Act in October, which
earmarked $8 million to support Iraqi political opposition. But in
a letter to Clinton on Wednesday, Lott and five other Senate
Republicans said only $58,000 of that money has been spent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support serious and sustained action but will oppose
action that does not accomplish our larger strategic goal,'' Lott
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few open signs of support for Lott, the chairman
of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said
he planned to hold hearings into the decision-making behind the
aerial bombardment and the underlying policy.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lott raised objections, House Republicans were
planning to vote Thursday on a resolution of support for the troops
in the Persian Gulf.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The core of the debate among Republicans, who were suddenly
chastened by the spectacle of impeaching the commander-in-chief
while he launched one of the biggest military strikes since the
1991 Persian Gulf War, was over the timing and motivations behind
the aerial bombardment that began on Wednesday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious they're trying to do everything they can to
postpone the vote in order to get as much leverage as they can,''
said Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, a former marine who is
chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on CNN. ``For him to do
this at this unbelievable time is just outrageous.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican and
a member of the House National Security Committee, said: ``I'm very
suspicious of the timing.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans accused the president of bombing rogue nations
or terrorists when he was in political binds in the past. The last
time the United States launched air strikes, said Rep. Spencer
Bachus of Alabama, they ``destroyed a drug store in the Sudan and
two camels in Afghanistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it bluntly: ``The
trust level is low.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But several other Republicans, many of whom are vocal critics of
the White House, set aside partisan differences, and defended the
president.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He has our full support as long as he's president to take any
action he deems necessary,'' said Rep. John Mica of Florida. ``I
don't think they conflict at all.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who announced Wednesday that
he would vote for impeachment, said: ``I really do believe that in
sensitive foreign policy issues, partisanship does stop at the
water's edge.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, another moderate
Republican, echoed similar sentiments: ``The president is the
president. I respect the office and I respect the judgments that
have to be made in regards to Iraq and the situation there.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican on the Intelligence
Committee, said: ``It is not for anyone to say that there's a
linkage between the President's problems with impeachment on the
one hand and the bombing of Iraq on the other. This military
operation has been planned for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly threw their support to the president. Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota,
the House and Senate Democratic leaders, said in a joint statement:
``The president has made the correct decision to undertake military
action against Iraq at this time. Any delay would have given Saddam
Hussein time to reconstitute his arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction and undermine support for our efforts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran, said
Wednesday that no one should question the ``legitimacy'' of
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that every reasonable member of the United
States Congress and reasonable people of this country will
understand the legitimacy of this moment,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans went further: Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York
called the bombing ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   But others seemed to accept that the domestic crisis needed to
take a back seat to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make Iraq observe international law, submit to
weapons inspections and abide by U.N. resolutions,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who held a town-hall meeting this
week so his constituents could help him decide how to vote on
impeachment. ``All Americans need to support our troops abroad, and
Congress needs to delay the vote on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that the blame for the unfortunate
timing of the bombings lay with Saddam Hussein, not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no coincidence that Saddam took these actions this
week,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, referring to
Saddam's barring of U.N. inspectors from weapons sites, ``with
Ramadan approaching and with the current political situation in the
House. But he miscalculated, as he has done with the House before,
underestimating the American will to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. and Senator-elect Charles Schumer of New York echoed
Torricelli's sentiments that Saddam had forced Clinton's hand.
``Under the circumstances,'' he said, ``the United States and her
allies had no choice but to act.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with his top military advisers in the
Situation Room at the White House Wednesday, President Clinton made
a rare appearance just after 8 a.m. at the daily meeting of his top
aides, in the corner office of John Podesta, his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Only three or four of the 30 staff members in the room knew
that, within hours, American missiles would strike Iraq. But they
all knew that the House would probably vote soon to impeach the
tired-looking man in the doorway, and they stood to applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked them for their hard work, according to people
who were present, and he assured them that if they kept at it, the
American people would support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll figure it out,'' he said. ``They always get it
right.``
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 hours, from the time he left Israel until he
addressed the nation Wednesday night, Clinton worked feverishly on
two momentous matters that he insisted Wednesday night were wholly
unrelated: the pending impeachment vote in the House of
Representatives and the air assault on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The strain showed. ``He's whipped,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton,
R-N.Y., who met with Clinton in the Oval Office on Wednesday
afternoon to discuss heading off impeachment. He attributed the
president's apparent exhaustion to ``the physical and emotional
presure on him day after day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to both impeachment and Iraq, he said, ``This is life
and death stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the initial decision to strike Iraq on Tuesday
night, as he flew back from a four-day trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Before focusing on Iraq, he spent some time chatting with the
members of the congressional delegation he had taken with him. They
talked about the Middle East and about the international economy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, Clinton also spoke directly to one
member of the delegation about the impeachment vote. White House
aides said that Clinton spent about 10 minutes talking one-on-one
with Rep. John Fox, R-Penn., who has said he is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton was clearly enjoying the company of his fellow
politicians, his aides were anxious that he turn his attention to
Iraq. They also wanted to make sure that he slept on the flight,
since three days of high-stakes diplomacy had clearly exhausted
him.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing with the congressmen, the president was briefed
on the report from Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations
group overseeing the disarmament of Iraq. Clinton quickly
concluded, aides said, that Iraq was flouting the rules of the
international weapons inspection program imposed after the end of
the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger _ all aboard the plane _ conducted a
secure telephone conference call with Vice President Gore,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, CIA director George Tenet, and
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs, and other
officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendation was unanimous that the president should go
forward,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton wandered into a conference room on the plane to
watch his aides play hearts, before returning to his cabin and
sleeping for about five hours until the plane reached Andrews Air
Force base.
</P>
<P>
   On reaching the White House about midnight, he sat down with
Berger and Podesta. And from his private study in the White House
residence, he telephoned Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, to tell
them about the decision. Cohen, a former Republican senator from
Maine, called Republican leaders on Tuesday night with the same
news.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was confirmed Wednesday morning at the Situation
Room meeting, which began at about 7:15. Berger said that once
again the decision was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping by the staff meeting, Clinton was not done with
the question of impeachment. He spent about half an hour in the
Oval Office early Wednesday afternoon with Houghton.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton gave the president a biography of Isaiah Berlin, a don
at Oxford when Clinton studied there, and the president and the
congressman discussed the censure resolution that Houghton plans to
present on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then set to work on the 15-minute speech that he
delivered from the Oval Office on Wednesday night, and made several
telephone calls to foreign leaders as well. Berger and Podesta
updated him several times on the course of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was in for a couple of shocks before the assault
began. After the president told Sen. Trent Lott, R- Miss., the
majority leader, of his planned strike, White House advisers were
astonished to hear Lott criticize it publicly as a political move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules we've always had is that politics stop at the
shore,'' said one senior White House official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``Somebody changed the rules and it wasn't
us.'' But Clinton advisers said that they expected Lott's comments
to backfire.
</P>
<P>
   It was only at the very end of his remarks Wednesday night that
Clinton brought the two tracks of his day together. ``Saddam
Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the
serious debate currently before the House of Representatives would
distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down,'' he
said. But, he said, Wednesday proved that ``when we must act in
America's vital interests, we will do so.''

BOWL TRIP TO DYE FOR GIVES FRAN A SUNNY DISPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most compelling Christmas ``present'' of the year for TCU
football is bearing down upon us, and it doesn't come in a bright
red sleigh or accompanied by the tinkle of silver bells.
</P>
<P>
   It rides, instead, on a hairdresser's whim.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the Sun Bowl. That's New Year's Eve. We'll get to
that by and by.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking really big here. We're talking about putting your
'do where your mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the blond bombshell that's ready to explode
right in the middle of Frog Alley.
</P>
<P>
   A warm round of applause, please, for head coach Dennis
Franchione, soon-to-be sun-bleached blond, wannabe surfer and Jan
and Dean impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help me, Rhonda,'' Franchione sighed yesterday, or words to
that effect. ``I just don't want to look like an idiot on national
television.''
</P>
<P>
   I said we'd talk about the game later, Fran. For the moment, try
to concentrate on your hair and what color it may be by the weekend
or soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Bright yellow? Platinum blond? Shades of purple or green? Based
on what we've seen around the Frogs' football team these days,
anything's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can just put something in and then wash it out,''
Franchione said. ``My hair's so gray, I'm not sure how it's going
to take to color being put into it. ''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, about to find out.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that, or totally lose face with his Horned Frogs
footballers, who face off against Southern Cal in El Paso on Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like the safest pop-off line in the world back in
August, when a local TV station showed up to do a feature on the
fact that TCU's receivers had all dyed their hair blond.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-thinking Royce Huffman, his eyes twinkling, turned to
Franchione while the cameras were rolling, and said, ``If we win
the WAC or get in a bowl game, you'll dye your hair blond, too,
right coach?''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't take that bet? The Frogs were coming off a 1-10
campaign in '97, and Franchione was in his first year. Bowl game?
TCU had been in a total of three in the previous four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Franchione said, chuckling. Why not? What were the
chances?
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Frogs' stunning 6-5 turnaround, the even more
surprising Sun Bowl invitation and tomorrow Franchione will meet
with his hairdresser to talk about going blond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait until I see what she says I should do,''
Franchione said, squirming. ``I don't think she thinks I should do
it. Maybe a wig, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. That won't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put Coach Fran on the spot,'' Huffman said. ``It's taped.
It's in the video archives. He's not getting out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This won't be easy for a man who is fastidious about his
appearance. Franchione's shoes are always shined. His ties always
match. His trousers are always perfectly creased and pressed.
Unlike most of us, he rarely drips barbecue sauce on his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so out of character for him because he is so
meticulous,'' wife Kim Franchione, who is already blond, said.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione doesn't just get his hair cut, he gets it ``done.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he doesn't have a thing to wear with blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure,'' he said, ``that my wife will have some
suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not go there.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly when a blond Franchione and his surfboard will show up
at his office adjacent to Amon Carter Stadium _ and, more
important, on the practice field in front of his Horned Frogs _ is
anybody's guess. Sometime between Christmas and New Year's Eve
would be a good bet. Maybe even the day before the game, as a
motivational ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs may need it.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is already the easy punchline to the latest jokes
circulating in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, Leezard, Leezard, Leezard,'' was one headline when it
was announced that the Trojans would meet the Frogs in the Sun
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``A light workout for the Trojans,'' an LA columnist sniffed of
the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe USC will feel the same way. Whatever, Franchione's
challenge now is to convince the Frogs that getting into a bowl
game isn't enough. Now they need to kick some California tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll have any problem with that one,''
Franchione said. ``One thing I've noticed about our players, they
relish playing the Oklahomas, the Air Forces and the USC's. I'm not
worried about selling them on the idea that they can beat USC. They
get excited about these kinds of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are not going to be a lot of high expectations
placed upon us, except by ourselves, but we're going out there to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Cinderella. Now we have to find out if the glass slipper
really fits.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinderella? Another blond, right?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I'm picking TCU.
</P>
<P>
   By a very thin, but fashionably blond, hair.

IT'S ALL GREED, BUT RANGERS SHOULD WAIT, TRIM BAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many media precincts from here to Canada are breathlessly
reporting that Roger Clemens is consumed with greed.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I understand. But what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is hereby convicted as charged, plus he's a repeat
offender of first degree greed. But why then don't we also indict
the sky for being blue, lions for being hungry, the ocean for being
wet and Ricky Williams for being a nice kid.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is a baseball player. A premier baseball player. Follow
the dotted lines. Baseball player ... greed. Baseball owner ...
greed.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks is hailed locally as the ``owner of all owners.'' He
wants to win, baseball or hockey. He will pay whatever is
necessary, baseball or hockey. Hicks has studied the Clemens'
financial ransom. He said he's a go on it. Greed understands greed.
Greed is good in baseball. It's a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the Rangers should continue their current course of
action on Clemens _ pursue this trade like crazy. If anything, Doug
Melvin has gone too crazy. What, Doug, was Rick Helling doing in
that Clemens care package offered to Toronto? No, no, no. Not
Helling. Not even close. Eventually, this deal won't take that
much.
</P>
<P>
   If Clemens is pitching in Arlington next season, he will
instantly become the most popular and productive jock in our
domain. Bigger than any Cowboy, bigger also than the cowboy known
as Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will be a clubhouse leader, popular with teammates of
all persuasions. As a fierce competitor, none in the worldwide jock
kingdom surpass him. Clemens is the best pitcher in baseball, and
with him, the Rangers instantly improve about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants his money. He's a greedy sonuvabuck, who
cannot be truthful about his intentions. Clemens keeps trotting out
that tired line about ``wanting a ring and wanting to be close to
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens would pitch in Ethiopia if the money was stacked high
enough. That's why he's in Toronto in the first place. Clemens was
constantly talking two years ago about the importance of his Texas
roots, and then the Blue Jays came along and offered to make him
the highest paid pitcher in baseball (at the time). Clemens
followed his hip pocket and went straight to Toronto, which on my
map is somewhere north of Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   That contract of $8 million a season is now a huge market-value
bargain. But the Blue Jays were naive enough to offer escape
clauses for Clemens. The smell of free-agent money in the past few
weeks _ Randy Johnson signing for $13 million a season followed by
Kevin Brown for $15 million _ induced Clemens to say bye-bye to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Were you expecting loyalty? Then don't offer escape clauses to
any baseball player. Greed wins again. Sorry, Toronto, but that's
the way we are in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have a massive headache with Clemens. It's the
strangest case ever in the strange financial world of baseball.
Clemens has two years remaining on an existing contract, but he's
also the same as a free agent. Again, blame Toronto for the
contract structure.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way the Blue Jays can bring Clemens back for the '99
season _ the populace up north is very angry with him, and so are
assorted teammates. More than anything else, the Blue Jays also
have financial problems in ownership. They are cutting payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto wants a package of established, low-priced players in a
trade. The team that gives up that would also have to pay
free-agent money to Clemens. One or the other, yes. But both? No
way.
</P>
<P>
   One other hammer held by Clemens is the right to veto any trade
made by the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have agreed with Clemens on the new dollars, and
also hold a geographical advantage (notice that the dollars are
listed first).
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mr. Melvin, the hard-working GM, left the baseball
winter meetings in Nashville, Tenn., frustrated after trying for
four days to make the Clemens deal. But to be back in Arlington
empty-handed is actually a break for Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   He had already offered too much _ meaning Helling in a trade
package. Toronto was dumb enough to say no. The only other top
Ranger who fits what Toronto wants is Rusty Greer. But don't give
up him, either. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, all that debate two weeks ago on Pudge Rodriguez
for Clemens? Strictly media fabrication, both here and in Toronto.
The Blue Jays never asked for Pudge and the Rangers never offered.
Pudge makes too much money for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Just be cool, Doug. Wait this one out. The heat is on in
Toronto. The closer it gets to spring training, the more antsy the
Blue Jays become.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is better than Johnson, better than Brown. And he knows
he has every occupational right to be greedy. The Rangers have
every reason to be smart. If they land Clemens, great. If they
don't, then at least the big effort was made and, once again, Hicks
didn't let money stand in the way.
</P>

CELEBS, POLITICOS STAGE RALLY AGAINST CLINTON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hoping to stoke public anger over the possible
impeachment of President Clinton, a mix of Hollywood celebrities
and political figures told a rally of about 1,000 people that
Congress is defying the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about my friend, President Clinton,'' said movie
megastar Jack Nicholson, wearing his trademark sunglasses. ``It's
about the presidency . . . I don't think any of us want to cripple
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties could stop this tomorrow. I'm just here to say
Merry Christmas and I hope they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally began around noon at the Federal Building on Wilshire
Boulevard -- before Wednesday's bombing of Iraq became public, so
no speakers alluded to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities who spoke included Barbra Streisand, husband
and wife Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen and Andrew Shue of the TV
show ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Also addressing the audience were the president's brother, Roger
Clinton; former Republican Rep. Alphonso Bell; state Sen. Tom
Hayden, D-Los Angeles; Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke; county Federation of Labor chief Miguel
Contreras; and Maulana Karenga, a professor at California State
University, Long Beach, who created the Kwanzaa holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand lambasted Congress members favoring impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they know they have a sacred constitutional duty to heed
the will of the people?'' she asked. ``No matter how many times
they have been told, the Republicans still won't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steenburgen warned Republicans that in the next election, voters
won't forget how they voted on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flame you're all excited about right now will not consume
Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``You will not burn him at the stake and
use the American Constitution as kindling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political process!'' said Shue, yelling into the
microphone. ``A political process means it comes from the will of
the people. The people say no!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No! No!'' the crowd chanted in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are not what the Jerry Springers of Congress and
janitors of history are looking for,'' Karenga said. ``It's all
about the right wing's attempt to seize power to reverse hard-won
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was organized by TV producer Norman Lear's People for
the American Way and the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.

TEXAS' FORWARD TRYING TO LEARN COURT ETIQUETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Speculation was that the association of Rick
Barnes and Gabe Muoneke would spark a confrontation similar to a
blue norther coming face-to-face with a warm front sweeping in off
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the Type A personalities _ the new Texas men's
basketball coach and the Longhorns' angry young man _ has, however,
produced a coexistence not unlike the kindred relationship of
thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   What both describe as a good relationship apparently withstood
Barnes' private and public dressing-down of Muoneke after he
punched a Wisconsin player in the gut during Tuesday night's game
at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe responded like he's always responded,'' Barnes said
yesterday. ``He responds to definite direction. He knows I'm not
messing around with it, either. He needs to know who's in charge.
And he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he was disappointed by the apparently unprovoked
action because the two have repeatedly talked about redirecting
Muoneke's aggressive court nature, and he believed Muoneke was
making an effort. But Barnes reiterated that he'll suspend Muoneke
if a similar incident occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe knows what the consequences will be if it happens
again,'' Barnes said. ``But like I said, it won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes apologized to the Wisconsin players and said he'll likely
order Muoneke to write a letter expressing similar sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, perhaps, Muoneke appeared contrite in the
aftermath _ not sullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong,'' he said. ``I lose my cool, lose my head
sometimes. I have no excuses about it. It's not going to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Muoneke is one of his new coach's most enthusiastic
champions, which is a change from last spring, when he threatened
to transfer after Barnes drew his disciplinary line in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenges you, makes you challenge yourself,'' Muoneke
said. ``It's funny. He makes you feel like you're the best person
out there, but he keeps it in a team concept. It's a phenomenal
thing, and I'm glad to be in a position to be here with him. He
knows where I'm coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 junior forward is averaging a team-leading 16.7
points and six rebounds _ a noticeable improvement over the
cumulative averages of 8.2 points and 4.8 rebounds of two seasons
under former coach Tom Penders.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke said he welcomes Barnes' structured, multiple-option
offense as much as he does his line-in-the-dirt philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing coach Barnes understood was that I was
frustrated,'' Muoneke said. ``Where I come from, if you work hard,
you succeed. To this day, I believe that. Maybe the success won't
come until later on, but it will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was doing a lot of good things, and I wasn't getting
any of the benefits. I'd post up and never get the ball. That might
sound self-centered, but if someone on my team is the worst player
I've ever seen, if he's working his butt off _ I'm going to give
him the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that Muoneke is perhaps his hardest-working player.
And if he maintains that ethic and can learn to challenge his
aggressive nature, Barnes believes he has a tremendous upside.
</P>
<P>
   Others who know Muoneke say his on-court personality belies a
sensitive, caring nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gabe is one of the most misunderstood players on the
team,'' center Chris Mihm said. ``A lot of people think Gabe is out
of control, crazy out there \Ron the court\S. But his emotion is
what makes him a good player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an aggressive player. But he's totally different off the
court. He's one of my good friends. We talk about things a lot.
There is a gentle side to him, the good guy who is fun to hang out
with.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents Nik and Njideka, who are natives of Nigeria, have
steeped Muoneke in the culture of his homeland. His full name
translated from Nigerian is Nnadubem (God guide me) Gabriel Muoneke
(spirit that creates). His major is geosystems engineering and
hydrology. He hopes one day to return to Nigeria, where he spent
two months of the summer of 1997, to help better manage the
country's oil industry for the betterment of all the population and
not just the privileged.
</P>
<P>
   He also is deeply concerned about his personal relationships.
His family lived in inner-city Houston from the time he was 5 until
he reached middle-school age, when his father became professor of
mathematics at Prairie View A&AMP;M. Muoneke graduated from Cypress
Falls High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I was picked on so much _ more by blacks
than whites _ because of my name and the deep accent I had,''
Muoneke said. ``When we moved to the suburbs away from the crime, I
had the mentality of inner-city Houston. So, now, instead of being
made fun of because of what or who I was, I was made fun of because
people thought I was angry. I wasn't even close to being considered
angry in inner-city Houston, but when we moved, I was considered
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I went through what I did. Because I don't want to
make anybody else feel the way people made me feel. Off the court,
I'm very sensitive about those things. But on the court, I could
care less what the world thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the latter attitude has to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe has felt the officials were looking for him, and based on
his past, they should be looking for him,'' Barnes said. ``It took
him two years to get that reputation, and it might take him a
lifetime to change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? He's going to have to go above and beyond.
Sooner or later, he's got to stop being his own worst enemy.''

NBA LOCKOUT TALKS AS STAGNANT AS EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood is still pondering who plays the title
role _ David Stern or Billy Hunter _ but the NBA is ready to
produce its own version of ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Day games had long ago been canceled, and now the NBA
is stealing the holiday season's most cherished value:
</P>
<P>
   Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have no plans to meet before Dec. 25 and might not
renew negotiations in the 169-day labor dispute until closer to New
Year's Day, placing the league dangerously close to canceling the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke off Saturday after less than an hour, and NBA
Commissioner Stern is leaving New York on Friday to take a week's
vacation in Aspen, Colo. Though Stern will be on-call at all times,
negotiations are off for at least the next 10 days, said Hunter,
director of the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be resolved before Christmas,
no,'' Hunter said Wednesday. ``If we're going to meet, in all
probability it will be the week between Christmas and New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the league must start play by Feb. 1 to accommodate a
50-game schedule, that leaves precious little time for a
settlement. Four weeks are needed to complete a settlement, have
teams sign free agents, make trades and hold training camps.
</P>
<P>
   That means a deal needs to be struck the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we're going to find ourselves locked into the
12th-hour scenario,'' Hunter said. ``I think at this stage it's
almost like poker, and I think what they're trying to do is see who
blinks first.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter remains confident the NBA is not ready to kill the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me how critical or extreme things are, they can't
be too extreme ... (considering) Commissioner Stern is planning to
vacation next week in Aspen, Colo. If that's the case, then I would
assume that Jan. 1 is not a drop-dead date.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern has consistently refused to give a drop-dead date, saying
the season will simply expire on its own at some point.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials are downplaying the commissioner's vacation as a
factor, saying he can be back in New York in four hours if needed
for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect that to happen. Hunter and Stern not only
aren't talking, they're posturing over who will call whom to resume
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he has been the one to call Stern on several
occasions and wants the commissioner to make the first move. Stern
insists it was he who called to set up the most recent talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to Mr. Hunter's assertions, last week's meetings were
convened at my initiative alone,'' Stern said. ``The meetings that
followed on Thursday and Saturday were thus the result of my
initiative and were without precondition.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred and eight games have been lost during the lockout
as NBA players and owners bicker about how to divide $2 billion in
revenue. There are signs they are inching toward settlement,
though.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's session, the players offered for the first
time to cap some high-end salaries. Under the proposal, players who
have been in the league for six years or less would be capped at
$10 million per year. Players with seven years experience or more
could still make any amount, but teams would be subjected to luxury
taxes as follows: 75 percent tax on salaries over $15 million, 100
percent tax on salaries between $15-$18 million, 150 percent tax on
salaries between $18-21 million and 200 percent tax on salaries
over $21 million.

THE image is still there: the floodlit stadium, fullback Alan
Ameche smashing through from the one-yard line, the clock that
stopped forever at 8:15 of the first overtime period in pro
football history as the Baltimore Colts beat the New York Giants
23-17.
</P>
<P>
   Four Hall of Famers who played 40 years ago in what has been
called ``The Greatest Game Ever Played'' agree on one thing: It
wasn't the greatest game of any of their careers or even of that
month.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Unitas and Artie Donovan of the Colts went two-on-two
with Frank Gifford and Sam Huff of the Giants this week in a
conference call arranged by the National Football League. They
talked across the decades, but what they said was hardly
predictable.

   ``I've always felt that it wasn't a real good football game
until the last two minutes,'' offered Unitas, ``and then the
overtime. We played pretty well, but we should have blown New York
out of the stadium, and we didn't. Then we had to come from behind
in order to tie and then go on to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always forget that a couple weeks before, in the game
that clinched the division and put us in the playoff, San Francisco
had us down 20-7 at the half, and we came back to beat 'em (35-27).
That was a much better game. Our defense shut out Y.A. Tittle in
the second half, and that was quite an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other sideline, Gifford expressed the same sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone with Wellington Mara (the former owner of
the Giants), and he was like me, wondering what all the fuss was
about,'' Gifford said. ``We played a better game a week earlier
when we shut down Jim Brown and Cleveland 10-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Huff and Donovan made the vote unanimous. So, OK, what is the
big deal, then, about the game they shared three days after
Christmas in 1958?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first sudden-death game,'' said Unitas, ``and it
came in a championship game, and that was enough to make people
feel they had seen something fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened on national television,'' said Huff, the ferocious
middle linebacker, ``and up to then there hadn't been much pro
football on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question,'' said Gifford, ``that the game had a
huge impact. We played the championship game in New York in 1956,
and it wasn't even a sellout. You look at all the players from this
one who went into the Hall of Fame, and I think there had never
been that much talent on the field at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also noteworthy is the fact the game was played virtually on the
doorstep of Madison Avenue. And even though the Giants lost, it all
came together for the greater glory of pro football.
</P>
<P>
   And while these legends may downplay the heroics, they seem to
remember every play, every close call, every misstep. Forty years
later, Gifford opened the conversation by apologizing for fumbling
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I cost us the game,'' said the halfback who was
one of the sport's first golden boys. ``I gave it up once as we
were going in for a score, and the other set up a Baltimore
touchdown. Is that how you remember it, John?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth,'' said Unitas, his voice deep and dry,
``about all I remember is that we scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford also figured in the game's most controversial play. The
Giants were leading 17-14 with less than two minutes left in
regulation when he carried on third-and-four from his own 40. The
Giants insisted he made the first down, but Baltimore's Gino
Marchetti suffered a broken leg on the play, and in the confusion,
the referee gave New York a dreadful spot, short of the first down
by a yard. If the placement had been different, the outcome might
not have been one for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have run out the clock,'' said Gifford, ``and the
game would not have gone into overtime, and we wouldn't be having
this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marchetti and I made the tackle on that play,'' chimed in
Donovan, the beefy tackle, ``and Gino broke his leg when our guy,
Big Daddy Lipscomb, fell on him. Lipscomb used to hurt four or five
of his own teammates every game by piling on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Gifford was on the ground, screaming, `I made the
first down! I made the first down!' I said, `Aw, shut up and go
back in the huddle. What are you hollering about? You didn't make
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the most tortured memory for Gifford came after Don
Chandler's punt gave the Colts the ball at their 14-yard line. Now,
Unitas went to work, hitting three passes to Raymond Berry for 62
yards. With time running out, in came Steve Myrha to kick a short
field goal and tie the score at 17.
</P>
<P>
   The players milled around at midfield, many of them unaware that
the league had agreed to go to overtime if the game ended in a
deadlock. The weary captains trudged out for the coin toss. The
Giants won the flip, went three plays and out and had to punt,
putting the ball back in the hands of a quarterback who was on the
brink of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants went to school that day at Johnny U.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to the game was anger,'' said Huff. ``I was a
competitive player, and I needed the cash. The difference between
winning and losing was about two grand. I was angry at the way John
was able to throw the ball to Raymond Berry. He knew where to
attack the defense, he found our weakness, and he knew how to
exploit it. You look at the play-by-play, and it was Unitas to
Berry, Unitas to Berry. After 40 years, that still rings in my ear.
We couldn't stop it, and that was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' last drive covered 80 yards in 13 plays. Unitas hit
Berry for 21 yards and sent Ameche up the middle for 23 more, then
lofted a sideline pass to Jim Mutscheller to the New York one.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Colts had first-and-goal at the three,
leading 14-3 with a chance to bury the Giants. But Ameche, known as
The Horse since his college days at Wisconsin, was stopped on a
sweep from a yard away. This time he made it, ending the first
fifth quarter ever played 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sam,'' asked Donovan, ``I gotta ask you a question. Did
you think your defense was better than ours?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yes,'' snapped Huff. ``If you had to play against
Unitas, you'd have gotten beat, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against him in practice,'' retorted Donovan, ``and
beat him all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gifford makes that first down,'' Huff said, getting in the
last word, ``no one would have ever heard of the '58 Colts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the standing-room crowd of more than 64,000 was as
spent as the players. Marchetti ordered the stretcher bearers to
put him down in the end zone so he could watch the Colts race the
clock to the tying points. He was alone in the locker room when
Ameche scored, but the silence of the New York fans told him his
team was moving.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas knew he had arrived when he returned to New York two
weeks later and went out to dinner with his wife to one of the
city's posh nightspots, the Harwyn Club. The headwaiter recognized
him _ the hot new celebrity in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right this way, Mr. Unitas,'' he sang out, leading the couple
to a corner table, the most prominent in the place. It was at that
very table, the headwaiter confided proudly, that Eddie Fisher and
Liz Taylor had their rendezvous the night before Eddie flew home to
tell Debbie Reynolds he wanted a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Hall of Famers from that 1958 championship game will be
honored by the NFL during the pre-game coin toss at Super Bowl
XXXIII. They include Berry, Donovan, Marchetti, Jim Parker and
Lenny Moore for the Colts and Gifford, Huff, Roosevelt Brown, Don
Maynard and Tom Landry for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not have been the game of Gifford's life, but a
question still haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landry was our defensive coach, a genius even then,'' Gifford
said. ``I keep wondering why he didn't make an adjustment when
Unitas was hitting all those passes late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   They were young in 1958, but the game still makes them crazy
after all these years.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. is still continuing his pursuit of
Roger Clemens. Only he doesn't intend to break the bank in the
process.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McLane said the Astros have no interest in
exceeding for Clemens the three-year, $33 million offer they made
to keep free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson. Johnson, who spent the
final two months of the 1998 season in Houston, signed a more
lucrative contract (four years, $52.4 million) with the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ought to be a pretty close level right there,'' McLane
said. ``That was a far reach for us at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Astros and Clemens' agents, Alan and
Randy Hendricks, aren't even in the same ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Hendricks brothers sent to McLane a
proposal for a restructured contract worth $43.5 million over three
years, with a $15 million option year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if he stays in Toronto,'' said McLane,
who re-entered the sweepstakes to land baseball's only five-time Cy
Young Award winner just hours after Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker called a news conference Sunday to announce the club was
dropping out of the race. But if McLane won't top what he offered
Johnson, his undisclosed counteroffer would have to be considerably
less than the Hendrickses' first proposal.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, who put the odds of Clemens' wearing an Astros uniform
next season at ``30 to 40 percent'' at best, had a phone
conversation with Randy Hendricks on Wednesday, with both sides
agreeing any further talks would likely not be held until the
beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten so complicated,'' McLane said. ``Most deals happen
fairly quickly and decisively. This hasn't been quick or decisive.
It's just wandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Toronto general manager Gord Ash shot down rumors
regarding an addendum to Clemens' contract that would make him a
free agent if he is not dealt within 90 days of a trade request.
Clemens demanded a trade from the Blue Jays on Dec. 2, which would
give the Blue Jays until March 2 _ coincidentally the beginning of
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the contract speaks of free agency,'' Ash said.
``We have an agreement. Roger Clemens is under contract with us for
1999 and 2000. The last two years of the contract will be honored
unless he walks away into retirement, which isn't going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of his signing with Toronto in 1996, Clemens and
former Blue Jays president Paul Beeston, now president of Major
League Baseball, reached a handshake agreement that gave Clemens
the option to demand a trade if he felt the club wasn't committed
to building a contender. And because Clemens would be dealt in the
midst of a multiyear contract _ he is to receive $16.1 million over
the final two years of his existing agreement _ he would, under
baseball's Basic Agreement, have the right to demand another trade
following the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the addendum report circulating in Canada, McLane
said neither he nor any of his baseball people had any knowledge of
Clemens' so-called ability to become a free agent if not traded by
March. If the side agreement is not filed with Major League
Baseball, it could be a violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly haven't read the contract, but I doubt seriously
any contract is that way,'' McLane said. ``To my knowledge, it's an
airtight, four-year contract with two years to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who had not spoken publicly since demanding a trade,
broke his silence Wednesday while playing in a golf tournament in
California, saying he was bothered by the Astros' brief withdrawal
from negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset about some of the comments they made
toward my agents, because I thought that was uncalled for,''
Clemens told Fox Sports News. ``I think they might be back in
there; I'm not really sure. It's hard to say at this point, and I'm
so distant from it right now. I basically know what handful or so
teams are involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money part of it will work itself out. Even more so, I'm
looking to obviously try and get closer to home. If not, to a
contender where I know I can chase 300 wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets said Wednesday they were pulling out of the
Clemens derby, leaving the Astros, Yankees, Rangers and Indians as
the chief suitors. And if a suitable deal can't be worked out, what
are the chances of Clemens' returning to the Blue Jays next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gord (Ash) the other day there is a remote possibility
Roger could return to Toronto,'' Randy Hendricks told the Toronto
Sun. ``Roger's question to me is, Why consider going back when some
people are trying to tar and feather him? They should decide what
they want. All he did when he was there was win two straight Cy
Young Awards.''

NOW THAT THEY'RE IN, FLORIDA ST. WILL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There might be something slightly out of whack
with the ease No. 2-ranked Florida State slid into the role of
favorite against undefeated and top-ranked Tennessee in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, the oddsmakers usually know something we don't.
Actually, in this case, they know something we know too.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are so strong on defense, they could go to Tempe,
Ariz., with Bobby Bowden at quarterback and manhandle the
Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   It's got the makings of a mismatch, and clearly shows what a
shame it would have been if Florida State had not gained admission
to the first BCS national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is a fine team, worthy of many accolades. But the Vols
haven't seen anything approaching what will hit them Jan. 4. Their
offensive line is going to find out what an NFL defense feels like,
and won't feel afterward like they've grown from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' defense has allowed two touchdowns just once all
season, and that was when quarterback Chris Weinke threw six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's defense, which plays at a different speed than
everyone else, ends all debates about this game. But there are
other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols had their hands full with Mississippi State, and had to
squeak past quality teams like Syracuse and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did we mention that Florida State's Peter Warrick is the
best wide receiver in the country?
</P>
<P>
   The X-factor is Bowden, who makes his third appearance in a
championship game in six years.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Bowden a special coach? Just look at how he's
developed the quarterbacks. After Dan Kendra was injured for the
umpteenth time, he simply moved Weinke into the starting spot.
After a rough start, Weinke completed more than 200 passes without
an interception until suffering a season-ending neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the coming Outzen party, the debut of previously
buried quarterback Marcus Outzen, nicknamed The Rooster because of
his red hair.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen, the third-string quarterback, has been effective if
unspectacular to close out the season. He threw no interceptions
against Florida, passed for 167 yards and ran for 61 more.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't hurt Florida State with mistakes, and plays just well
enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Notre Dame, which looked like a high school
offense once Jarious Jackson got injured, and backups Arnaz Battle
and Eric Chappell looked as if they had never thrown a forward
pass.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another reason Tennessee will lose, a reason everyone
else is too scared to mention. With offensive coordinator David
Cutliffe gone for Mississippi, it looked like Punky Brewster
replaced him calling plays in the SEC championship game every time
ABC's cameras showed the pressbox.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting news: Expect Hart High wide receiver Jerry Owens to
end up at UCLA, although Oregon and USC are still among schools
under consideration. UCLA should also land offensive lineman Lenny
Vandermade of Mater Dei....
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Brad Pyatt of Arvada, Colo., is leaning toward USC
although he will visit Colorado this weekend. The Trojans are also
ahead in the battle to get Esperanza offensive lineman Nate
Steinbacher, who visited Nebraska last week. Corona offensive
lineman Shane Lehmann will choose between UCLA and USC.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trojans picked up a gem in wide receiver Kareem
Kelly of Long Beach Poly, he still has to achieve the necessary
score on his Scholastic Assessment Test....
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will have its usual stellar recruiting year, but the
Vols may have hurt themselves for next year's recruiting class.
Tennessee rescinded a scholarship offer to lineman Leo Bell of
Moeller High in Cincinnati the day after Bell orally committed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's teammate is Anthony Munoz, Jr., the son of former USC
lineman Anthony Munoz. Junior figures to be one of the most heavily
recruited lineman in the nation next season, and is considering the
Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get back to you: One reason established coaches are
reluctant to join John Robinson at Nevada Las Vegas is his
three-year contract. Many assistant coaches reason that Robinson
will pull his three-year hitch, collect about $1 million, then bail
out. That won't leave much of a future for the staff, which will
have to look for jobs once a new coach succeeds Robinson.

   CHIAT-OFFICES (Los Angeles) _ The advertising agency that urged
Apple Computer buyers to ``Think different'' has managed to be on
the cusp once again of an evolution in workplace design. Four years
ago, Chiat/Day led the charge into the brave new world of ``virtual
officing'' when their headquarters in Venice, Calif., proved too
small for a fast-expanding staff. Jay Chiat, the company's founder,
equipped everyone with a mobile phone, a laptop and a personal
locker, and turned a problem into a vaunted workplace experiment.
Now, just months shy of the third millennium, TBWA/Chiat/Day, as
the company is known, has traded virtual communication for the real
thing. It has just moved into a new space in the Playa del Rey
section of Los Angeles, where everyone has his own desk, and human

NORTHRIDGE SEEKS HIGH-QUALITY TRANSFER HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until Cal State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano can
build depth in the football program with a few recruiting classes,
the Matadors will continue to dive into the transfer market for
talent.
</P>
<P>
   To address the need for offensive and defensive linemen, the
Matadors are ready to bring in two Division I-A transfers who would
have immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   University of Nevada offensive lineman Ernie Fiero, a 6-foot-3,
290-pounder from Commerce, Calif., and San Jose State offensive
tackle Brent Morris, a 6-foot-6, 300-pounder, were granted their
releases and are expected to enroll at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Neither played this past season and both have two years of
eligibility remaining. Each would add depth and could find
themselves in starting positions after spring ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young men got their releases so we're in the process of
seeing if they can get in here academically,'' Ponciano said.
``Then you have to look at degree progress. We will get our share
of (Division I) transfers. To have a great year next year we have
to do it this way because we're so young. We have to get some
experience in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said CSUN is also expecting commitments from two Mount
San Jacinto College players _ linebacker Charles Dwinell and tight
end Jay Marcus. Both took official visits to CSUN last weekend and
expressed delight over their visits. However, both said they would
wait until after the holidays to commit.
</P>
<P>
   San Jacinto coach Bob Stangel said the 6-foot-4, 240-pound
Marcus is a skilled blocker with good hands, though he was used
sparingly in the passing game. Dwinell, who roomed with current
Matador Quinton Reed last year at San Jacinto, is a strong tackler
with good anticipation, Stangel said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN also received releases on Washington State running back
DeJuan Gilmore and cornerback Jermaine Hunsaker. Both played for
the Cougars this season but want more playing time. They contacted
the Matadors staff and are expected to enroll next semester.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore will be a senior and challenge Jaumal Bradley for the
starting running back spot. Hunsaker, who will be a junior, placed
third in the Pacific-10 championships in the 400 hurdles and is
expected to join CSUN's track team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilmore's a guy who could make a substantial impact,''
Ponciano said. ``I've already talked to (Washington State coach)
Mike Price about him, and he likes him and Jermaine a bunch. Any
time you get a kid that's played in the Pac-10 and has experience
in the Pac-10, he'll obviously go to any Big Sky school and start
competing for the starting job.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching raises: Ponciano said he took the advise of San Jose
State associate athletic director Ed Swartz, albeit a year after
the fact, and will use five full-time assistants next year instead
of the six he used this past season.
</P>
<P>
   It allows Ponciano to take the money from assistant head coach
Jeff Kearin's departure, and the expected exit of linebackers coach
Kevin Singleton, and give his full-time assistants raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said you don't need all the assistants, but you need, like
the Marines say, `A Few Good Men,' '' Ponciano said. ``I really
think I've got them. I want to keep (offensive coordinator) Rob
Phenicie here. I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure I don't
lose him to a I-AA school or a lower echelon I-A. Beyond that, I
understand.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Match a masterpiece against a work in progress and
what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Red Wings 5, Bruins 3.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't forget to check the scoring summary for the math.
What happened Wednesday night at Joe Louis Arena argued the case
against statistics sometimes not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take (Steve) Yzerman off one line and switch (Sergei)
Fedorov in his spot,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns, succinctly
summarizing the depth of the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champions. ``That's it, one little switch like that, and there's no
drop-off in how they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Depth and speed, the ferocious 1-2 punch of the mighty Winged
Wheels, eventually sent the Bruins careening out the doors of The
House That Ilitch built. The Bruins remained alive with their bold,
unyielding checking game for about 30 minutes, but a pair of late
second-period strikes by the Wings, by Larry Murphy (power play)
and Martin Lapointe (shorthanded), built a 4-2 lead by the
40-minute mark that the Bruins couldn't negate.
</P>
<P>
   No team in the NHL can skate, shoot, and score with the Wings.
Only Dallas and Phoenix can come close, and it could be only the
latter that has a reasonable shot at upending the champs. They are
fast. They are balanced. And if they ever think about easing into
cruise control, they've got the laser eyes of coach Scott Bowman
aimed like crosshairs at the backs of their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One line with Fedorov,'' said Burns, ``and then another line
with Yzerman. All you can do is roll your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, losers of two in a row for the first time in six
weeks, never could get the lead. With 8:49 gone in the first,
Nicklas Lidstrom cheated in 10 feet from the blue line on the power
play and blasted a slapper past Byron Dafoe, giving Detroit the
advantage. With 4:25 to go in the period, Jason Allison connected
for his eighth goal of the year to tie it. The only assist went to
_ guess who _ Sergei Samsonov, who helped create the scoring play
with his pass out front from behind the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings pulled away in the second, scoring three times _ at
even strength (Mathieu Dandenault), on the power play, and
shorthanded. The latter two strikes crushed the Bruins. They
countered Dandenault's goal with Dmitri Khristich's team-high 13th
of the year but then watched Murphy and Lapointe score within 67
seconds to lock up the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Stanley Cup champs, twice, and you do that by
having a whole team,'' said Bruins forward Steve Heinze. ``The only
other way you do it is by having Mario Lemieux when he was playing.
Teams with four lines like that, they fill gaps and holes. Even
what you'd call their fourth line with (Kris) Draper, that line's a
threat. It's a heck of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the trademark Boston checking effort kept it
manageable, even winnable, until the Murphy and Lapointe daggers.
Murphy was left alone at the inner edge of the right circle to lift
a high forehander over a fallen Dafoe. Lapointe blitzed to the left
post in a man-short situation (Yzerman in the box) and one-touched
a bullet feed off the right wing boards by Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating part,'' said Heinze, ``is that you do it for
30 minutes but not for 60. That just shows it's a mental lapse on
our part. We're in good enough shape to do it for 60, but we let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings stopped attacking in the third period and nearly got
burned. Shawn Bates made it a one-goal game with 1:31 to play,
scoring on a rush with a Khristich relay. The Bruins pulled Dafoe
with 40 seconds to go, got some pressure with the extra skater, but
watched Darren McCarty send in a long backhander for the 5-3 final.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the champions because they have a lot of depth,'' said
Allison. ``That's why, when you're up against them, every line has
to do the job every shift. No one can take a shift off. You look
up, they've got a 4-2 lead, and there's Yzerman in our corner,
fighting off two guys for the puck, and almost coming up with it.
Tells you what kind of team they are. But still, we can compete
with 'em. No excuses. We can beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day, when the work shows more progress.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There have been two constants since the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks joined the NHL in 1993. Guy Hebert has
provided the team with consistently solid goaltending, and the
power play has been constantly bad.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed in net. Hebert is playing better than ever.
Wednesday night he extended his shutout streak to 191 minutes, 47
seconds in a overwhelming 6-1 victory over Nashville before 14,222
at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is finally some power in the Anaheim power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Ducks tied a club record with four power play
goals _ two by Travis Green and one each by Teemu Selanne and Steve
Rucchin _ as they continued to surge up the league's power-play
rankings and the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (12-11-6) have won three consecutive games, are 4-0-1
in their last five and moved ahead of Edmonton and Colorado into
fourth place in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said as recently as Tuesday that
his team's power play ``still hasn't hit its stride.'' But compared
to seasons gone by the Anaheim power play unit is flying high.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Ducks ranked 24th, converting only 11.7 percent of
their opportunities. Coming into Wednesday's game, Anaheim ranked
ninth in the league (17.9 percent) and had scored at least one
power play in 17 of its 19 previous games.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jamie Pushor got the Ducks started quickly when he
scored an even-strength goal on the Ducks' first shot of the night
at 3:15 of the first period. Then the power play took over, taking
advantage of the Predators, who rank 23rd in penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin and Teemu Selanne combined to make it 18 games in the
last 20 with a least one power-play goal at 6:11 of the first.
Selanne had a full head of steam going down the right wing, took
Rucchin's lead pass, cut to the middle and easily chipped a
backhander over rookie goalie Tomas Vokoun for his 10th goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks added a club-record three power-play goals in the
second period and Selanne added an even-strength goal in the final
minute. Paul Kariya assisted on all four goals, setting a team
record in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored only four power-play goals in the first nine
games this season before Hartsburg moved Kariya to the point
position. Anaheim has since scored 25 power-play goals in its last
20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started to turn when we put Paul at the point,'' said
Hartsburg. ``It's so important to have a quarterback at the point
and get shots through.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the second-period goals were the direct result of Kariya
shots that Vokoun couldn't handle. Green scored once after Rucchin
batted the rebound his way and Rucchin scored on a rebound himself.
Green scored the other power-play goal when his shot banked in off
the skate of Nashville's J.J. Daigneault.
</P>
<P>
   Pushor opened the scoring when he took advantage of some poor
coverage in the Nashville zone to record his first goal in 38
games. Green won the draw cleanly to Pushor, who easily skated to
the right faceoff dot and beat Vokoun with a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in Anaheim's powerful display was another brilliant
performance by Hebert. The Anaheim goalie stopped 36 Nashville
shots before Denny Lambert scored with 4:06 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the Ducks' Marty McInnis and Johann Davidsson
both were forced to leave the game and did not return. McInnis was
hit in the face by a puck and Davidsson became ill.

STEPHENVILLE QUARTERBACK TAKES AIM AT RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ The Texas high school passing records are
replete with familiar names such as Detmer, Kubiak, Watson, Morenz,
Clements and a kid named Hutka from the small town of Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville quarterback Kelan Luker is among them now. By
Saturday night, they could be in his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leading the Yellow Jackets to the Class 4A
Division II championship, Luker can set state single-season and
career passing records when Stephenville (14-1) meets La Marque
(13-0) at 4 p.m. on Saturday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Luker has 4,411 yards this season and needs 106 to break the
mark of 4,516 by Rogers' Patrick Hutka in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With 8,008 in his high school career, Luker needs 214 yards to
surpass Huntsville's Steve Clements (8,204 from 1986-89) and
Mission's Koy Detmer (8,221 from 1989-91) on Texas' all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accomplishment to be up there with those guys,'' Luker
said. ``But I don't think it'll mean that much unless I get a ring
on my finger. Your stats don't matter unless you're a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gary Kubiak (Houston St. Pius X), Jeff Watson (A&AMP;M
Consolidated) and Shea Morenz (San Angelo Central) before him,
Luker's future beyond high school is beckoning. Baylor, SMU,
Colorado, Texas Tech or Kansas could sign the 6-foot-2, 210-pound
Luker, known for his release and deep-route strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has Kelan arrived,'' Stephenville coach Art Briles
said, ``but I think we've arrived as a team. We've expanded and
developed and are still trying to improve daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all equates into the astronomical numbers we've put up on
that side of the ball. To do that, your defense has to give you
that chance, which I think has been overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, Luker was almost a ``Six-man football''
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Stephenville Middle School coach Alan Luker, led
Panther Creek to Six-man state championships in 1992 and '93. Kelan
was in the eighth grade, while older brother Seth, a 255-pound
junior lineman, had grown too large for the Six-man game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a good move on our part,'' Alan Luker said.
``It gave both boys an opportunity to play big-time football.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to 11-man football seemed logical, Alan said, given
Seth's size and Kelan's arm, which at 13 was stronger than most
Six-man high school quarterbacks Alan had ever coached.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukers considered moving to Brownwood, but were later sold
on Stephenville's wide-open offense. Just how wide open it would
become under Kelan, no one really knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelan's just been at a place that passes a whole lot, and he
fits right into this program,'' Alan said. ``From the time he was
7, Kelan could throw baseballs, footballs and basketballs. It
didn't surprise me he could throw a football better than the other
two. He's just blessed with a good arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville already has two state records this season. Luker's
top target, Cody Cardwell, has set marks for receiving yards for a
season (2,336) and career (4,257).
</P>
<P>
   Also, Stephenville's offense needs 169 yards to break the 1953
Sugar Land team's all-time national record of 8,375 total yards in
a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first game, it seemed so easy to get over 500
yards,'' Luker said of an offense that has averaged 547.1 yards in
15 games. ``We figured we could do it every game if we put our
minds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in Luker's case, his arm.

COWBOYS PUT FIVE IN PRO BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When Leon Lett learned he was] one of the five
Cowboys players selected] to this season's NFC Pro Bowl team
yesterday, he was wrapped up in a bearhug by tackle Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And Nate Newton, arguably the most surprising pick, expressed
appreciation about being recognized for a sixth time _ one year
after having what he called the worst season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the honorees, which also included Deion Sanders, who was
named as a starter at cornerback and kick returner, starting tackle
Larry Allen and reserve safety Darren Woodson, were more solemn
than celebratory. Pro Bowl play hasn't been exactly omnipresent
during the team's current three-game losing streak that has made
Sunday's matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual goals are not as good when the team is not
winning,'' Newton said. ``Late in my career, I want to win as many
games as I can and get back to the Super Bowl. Now things look dim.
We've got to win one to get in the playoffs and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' five selections tied Atlanta and Green Bay for
second-most in the NFC behind Minnesota's nine. Additionally,
Allen, who made the Pro Bowl as a guard the past three seasons, is
just the third offensive lineman in NFL history to be selected at
two different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is the first Cowboys player ]to be selected as a kick
returner. And Newton, who made five consecutive Pro Bowls from
1992-1996, ties Rayfield Wright (1971-76) and John Niland
(1968-1973) for most Pro Bowl selections by a Cowboys offensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be recognized by your peers,'' said Newton,
who battled weight and injury problems last season and wasn't
guaranteed a job this season until he made a commitment to
off-season conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was my worst in the NFL. I never thought I could see
myself play to that level. When I saw that, I said if they would
have me back, I would give a better effort all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton dropped more than 70 pounds in the off-season and credits
Cowboys trainer Joe Juraszek for helping him. ]However, Newton said
none of ]it means anything unless the Cowboys ]make a run for ]the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who was selected for the seventh time in his career
(his third with the Cowboys), has been honored as a kick returner
for the second time. He made the Pro Bowl as a cornerback and kick
returner while with Atlanta in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the award still is special because ``it's a way of
knowing that you did your job and you did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked if he would actually play in the Pro Bowl
this year _ Sanders did not participate after being selected in
1996 and 1997 _ he was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that he has missed the past three games with a
sprained big toe and is questionable for the Eagles game, Sanders
said he has other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play here first,'' he said. ``It's getting to the
point where it's really frustrating. And we are playing terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need Sanders to return to the Pro Bowl level he was
playing at before injuring his toe against the Cardinals on Nov.
15. He has ]five interceptions, including one he returned ]71 yards
for a touchdown. He leads the NFL in punt returns with an average
of 15.6 yards per return and has returned two punts for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of my best seasons when I've been out there,''
Sanders said. ``And it's not over. I think the Lord has a few more
things for me to do on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett made the Pro Bowl in 1994 and was considered to be having a
Pro Bowl season in 1996 before being suspended for a year for
violating the league's substance abuse policy. In his first full
season back, Lett has recorded modest numbers. He has 44 tackles,
including four sacks, and leads the team in tackles for losses with
seven and quarterback pressures with 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised \Rto make it\S,'' Lett said. ``It feels good.
I feel like I'm playing OK. But the defense has had a setback the
past few games, and we've got to get better. That's the most
important thing.''

DUCKS ROLL TO 6-1 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There have been two constants since the Mighty
Ducks joined the NHL in 1993. Guy Hebert has provided the team with
consistantly solid goaltending, while the power play has been
consistantly bad.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed in net. Hebert is playing better than ever.
Wednesday he extended his shutout streak to 191 minutes, 47 seconds
before giving up a meaningless goal late in the third period of the
Ducks' 6-1 victory over Nashville before 14,222 at the Pond on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is finally some power in the Anaheim power
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks tied a club record with four power play goals against
the Predators _ two by Travis Green and one each by Teemu Selanne
and Steve Rucchin _ as they continue to surge up the league's power
play rankings and the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (12-11-6) have won three consecutive games, are 4-0-1
in their last five and moved ahead of Edmonton and Colorado into
fourth place in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was as good as it (the power play) has been all year,
but it can get better, said demanding Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to seasons gone by the Anaheim power play unit is
flying high.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Ducks ranked 24th, converting only 11.7 percent of
their opportunities. Anaheim came into the game ranked ninth in the
league (17.9 percent) and they have now scored at least one power
play in 18 of its 20 previous games.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jamie Pushor got the Ducks started fast when he
scored an even strength goal _ his first in 38 games _ on the
Ducks' first shot of the night at 3:15 of the first period. Then
the power play took over, taking advantage of the Predators, who
rank 23rd in penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin and Selanne combined at 6:11 of the first. Selanne had a
full head of steam going down the right wing, took Rucchin's lead
pass, cut to the middle and easily chipped a backhander over rookie
goalie Tomas Vokoun for his 10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks added a club-record three power play goals in the
second period and Selanne added an even strength goal in final
minute. Paul Kariya assisted on all four goals, setting a team
record in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second period we knew we had them down and didn't let
up, said Hartsburg of the Ducks were 1-of-8 on the power play in a
3-1 loss in Nashville on Nov. 27. ``Our power play probably lost
that game for us, tonight it won the game for us.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored only four power play goals in the first nine
games this season before Hartsburg moved Kariya to the point
position. Anaheim has since scored 25 power play goals in its last
20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started to turn when we put Paul at the point, said
Hartsburg. ``It's so important to have a quarterback at the point
and get shots through.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the second period goals were the direct result of Kariya
shots that Vokoun couldn't handle. Green scored once after Rucchin
batted the rebound his way and Rucchin scored on a rebound himself.
</P>
<P>
   Green scored the other power play goal when his shot banked in
off the skate of Nashville's J.J. Daigneault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell Paul don't be afraid to shot, said Selanne. ``The key
is making the right decision when to shot. He doesn't shot when
somebody is in front of him. And if guys overplay him we have more
room down low and now we have guys like (Marty) McInnis and Green
who can take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in Anaheim's powerful display was another brilliant
performance by Hebert. The Anaheim goalie stopped 36 Nashville
shots before Denny Lambert scored with 4:06 left in the game and
ended his bid for a third consecutive shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exciting for the whole team, the fans to see how
long we could keep it going, said Hebert. ``But the most important
thing was that we got a big win out of it.

   1. IRAQ : THE ROLLBACK FANTASY Using the Iraqi opposition to
overthrow Saddam Hussein is one of the hottest foreign policy ideas
in Washington today. The basic idea is simple : The U.S. should
refuse to accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and help
install the Iraqi opposition in his place. As Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott put it, ``The doctrine here has to be rollback,
not containment.'' By Daniel Byman, Kenneth Pollack and Gideon
Rose. (Byman is a policy analyst with the RND Corporation. Pollack
is senior research professor at the National Defence University.
Rose is deputy director of national security studies and Olin
Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.) From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 6,000 words.

THE MYTH AND REALITY OF GEORGE SOROS Ten years ago, when they
started pulling down the statues of dead Communists, George Soros
set about creating a new identity for himself. That identitiy is
now as complete as the most highly polished sculpture, and now
stands in the middle of the capitalist equivalent of Red Square.
Soros transformed himself from the most narrowly self-interested
financial speculator into the most broadly disinterested
commentator on global finance. He has created a new role: the
Player-Commentator. His opinions carry more weight in the markets
than his money ever did. Commentary by Michael Lewis. Bloomberg
News. 1,000 words. (Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker,''
``The Money Culture'' and ``Trail Fever'' is a columnist for
Bloomsberg News. The opinions expressed are his own and do not
represent the judgment of Bloomberg LP or Bloomberg News.) 3. IT'S
A RELIEF NOTHING BAD HAPPENED YET Clinton's trip to Israel and
Palestine came at a dramatic crossroads moment for both him and his
hosts. It is a sign of how far things are from the triumphant
celebration originally planned for the occasion that the most
reassuring thing that happened was nothing. There was real physical
danger from fanatics and political danger of another visible
breakdown blowing up the Wye accords. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

STREP THROAT MICROBE MAY ESCAPE ANTIBIOTICS BY
</P>
<P>
   HIDING IN CELLS Strep throat is the most common bacterial
infection in children. Untreated, it can lead to serious
complications. Antibiotic treatment often fails to completely
eradicate the infection, allowing patients to become carriers who
can spread the bacterium, and putting them at risk for a recurrence
of strep throat. Researchers from Israel report that some strains
of the bacterium that causes this infection carry a gene that may
allow them to escape antibiotic treatment by enabling them to slip
into the cells, where antibiotic levels are much lower. This
finding may lead to new treatments that may make it possible to
eradicate this disease. By M. McCarthy. Lancet News Service. 1,000
words.

BIOLOGISTS CLOSE IN ON THE TICK-TOCK GENES In one of the
weirdest-sounding experiments in recent times, scientists reported
that they had been able to reset human biological clocks by shining
intense light on the backs of people's knees. This was, however,
only one in a burst of stunning experiments that are revealing new
insights into the ways that biological organisms keep and tell
time. By Sandra Blakeslee. From New York Times Science Times. 1,400
words. 6. TRAGEDY LIVES ON IN THE CHILDREN OF THE DISAPPEARED
During the Argentine military's ``dirty war'' of 1976 to 1983, it
is estimated that more than 30,000 people were killed or just
disappeared. The 'Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo' - a group of
women who lost their sons, daughters, nieces, nephews or
grandchildren during the junta - have registered more than 200
children, kidnapped and given away, often to military and police
couples. Javier Vildoza, 20, believes he may be a son of the
'desaparecidos' - the people who disappeared. The past is still
alive in the womb of the country and, in spite of the punishment
for some of the major culprits, Argentines haven't been able to
grasp its immense evil. By Tomas Eloy Martinez. 1,500 words. 7.
BLUEPRINT : THE SHOCK OF THE FAMILIAR In a frenzy to move products,
design is exploding, mutating, multiplying. The rules of
composition, colour and balance are breaking down ... from grocery
store to furniture showroom to couture salon, 1999 means design
anarchy. By Herbert Muschamp. From The New York Times Magazine.

 &HT;    Dad's dilemma: `Jerk' may be just stretched thin _ sound
familiar?
 &HT;    By Scott Benarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Are you one of those dads who tells the
boss you're going to a late-afternoon meeting when you're really
picking up your kids from school or day care?
</P>
<P>
   Do you spend little time with your children because you worry
the company will think you're too involved as a parent and not
committed to the team?
</P>
<P>
   Many fathers have been caught in this trap for years, trying to
play the good corporate soldier and the available, understanding
Daddy _ without shortchanging either role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows working mothers have conflicts, but `working
father' is a redundancy. Guys work; that's what they do,'' says
James Levine, director of The Fatherhood Project at the Families
and Work Institute in New York. Levine is author of the recently
published ``Working Fathers: New Strategies for Balancing Work and
Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found guys were feeling the same as women were,'' Levine
says. ``Women don't have a monopoly on guilt; men also feel guilty
being away from home so much.''
</P>
<P>
   A hefty majority of men, 70 percent, feel at least some conflict
in balancing work and family life, Levine found in a 1997 national
study of the workforce. That's a 10 percent increase over a similar
survey he did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between working moms and dads, Levine says, is
that men ``didn't feel they had company sanction to talk about it.
As companies developed family-friendly polices, the issue was
framed in terms of mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it wasn't macho to discuss such things.
</P>
<P>
   But Levine _ who has studied and spoken to corporations around
the country _ says men should not be afraid to raise the issue of
family time with supervisors. More companies and institutions are
realizing, albeit slowly, that rejiggering schedules so men can
attend to their children improves their security and emotional
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally at a point,'' Levine says, ``where we're seeing
widespread attention and concern about the role of dads, their
absence from families and what can be done by businesses and
community organizations to get dads more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine says that women he's met generally seem delighted about
the shift in attitudes toward working fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get concerns that to pay attention to dads is to
deflect attention from women's issues,'' he says. ``It's not
either-or. In the end, we can't support mothers unless we support
fathers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But dads don't have to wait for their employers to adopt
policies to improve their family life. Levine gives this advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ SPEND TIME WITH YOUR SPOUSE: ``I see lots of guys so guilty
over not being with their kids they forget about the marital
relationship. Don't forget. One-on-one time with your partner, away
from your children, is important.'' A shaky marriage makes it more
difficult to support and raise the kids. Levine suggests ``dating''
at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel guilty about not spending that time with your child.
And don't worry about whether you can afford it; the goal is to
spend time, not money, together.
</P>
<P>
   _ SPEND ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH EACH CHILD: Each child needs
one-on-one time with dad, even if it's just going for a walk or to
the corner store for a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   When you arrive home from work, join the activity your child is
already involved in. Ask kids specific questions about their day.
General ``How was your day?'' questions usually get a brief ``OK''
response.
</P>
<P>
   Take your kids to work during off hours so they can see what you
do while away.
</P>
<P>
   And remember: Children need your affection, so don't be afraid
to give hugs. Both parents can and should be sources of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   _ STEP INTO YOUR CHILDREN'S WORLD: Visit their day care centers,
schools, doctors. Get to know their friends. Walk your child to the
bus stop before work.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of your children's daily life is heavily influenced
by the time they spend with teachers, coaches, physicians. Getting
to know them improves how they deal with your child when you're not
around.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let Mom be the designated reader at home or chauffeur to
school or the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be with your child. Be a part of his universe,'' Levine says.

 &HT;    Meltdown a possibility, but this frosty gig ain't bad
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Matt Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jeez, it's stuffy in here. Is that sweat
rolling down my shins?
</P>
<P>
   It's 11 a.m. at the public clubhouse in Boynton Beach, Fla. I'm
lumbering to the door, psyching myself up to face a raucous mob of
preschoolers. I'm wearing a big, fuzzy Frosty the Snowman suit.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm hoping to discover something new about people and
Christmas. (At least that's what I'm telling myself. I'm really
here because someone gave me little choice. More about that later.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is, there he is, there he is!'' a little girl shrieks
as I enter a room crammed with excited tots. I'm stumped at first
because I can hear the kids but can't see them through the eyeholes
of the oversized spherical head. Then I look down through the
mouthhole below my chin and _ bingo _ there they are, around my
knees, grinning, squealing, saying ``hi.''
</P>
<P>
   Instinctively, I start bouncing up and down, waving my hands
like a fruitcake. In a silly, high-pitched voice, I ask the kids
their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Brian. I saved a chip for you,'' a little boy says,
thrusting a Tostito up my mouthhole.
</P>
<P>
   My wife roped me into this. She helped arrange the outing for
the Boynton Beach West Mom's Club, a group of women who gave up
jobs and salaries to raise their kids. Each mom chipped in a
precious $2-$6 for the Frosty suit rental and souvenirs. For that,
they expect more than an appearance by Frosty. They want a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   So, I pat the children on the heads. Do my best Barney laugh.
Kneel down for bear hugs and frenzied picture-taking.
</P>
<P>
   But I suddenly realize I have zipped myself into a thermal
deathtrap. Besides the hot, heavy suit, I'm wearing snowboots and
insulated leather gloves. Plus, I'm a skinny guy, so my T-shirt is
stuffed with sofa pillows to fill out the suit. My own hot breath
lolls over my eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit down, Frosty, time for some pictures,'' someone says,
tugging at my elbow. I sit and start hoisting kids onto my lap,
including my own son, 3, who doesn't catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Through the mouthhole, I see the tops of their heads _ little
bowl cuts and pigtails brushed to perfection. Through the eyeholes,
I see moms stooped with their point-and-shoots, frantically shaking
their cameras when the flashes don't fire.
</P>
<P>
   They call to their kids: Smile, Rachel. Smile, Blake. No, Jack
don't say smile, just do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your name, little boy?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been a good boy this year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. Guess what? I know that's just a costume.''
</P>
<P>
   Next.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting hotter in here. A tiny girl I can't see, who thinks
she's talking into Frosty's left ear, offers me some of her drink.
Slowly and graciously, she pours the water onto my wrist. I savor
its coolness.
</P>
<P>
   I recognize many of these kids from picnics and drop-off time at
preschool. And their personalities are as varied as snowflakes:
Some are sweethearts, some are crybabies, others have great futures
as nuns, tobacco attorneys or professional wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all have the same reaction to Frosty. They giggle
with delight. They come back for more hugs or high-fives. I'm
thinking, Hey _ they really believe I'm Frosty!
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I see the truth in the old saying that Christmas
is for children. For us grownups, it's always about maxing-out our
credit cards, waiting in line at the post office, hustling the
just-snapped holiday photos to the one-hour developer.
</P>
<P>
   At least someone still gets it, I think.
</P>
<P>
   As I rise and list toward the exit, the squeals of ``Bye,
Frosty!'' keep coming. And inside this puffy, steamy Frosty head, I
am beaming.

 &HT;    Putting your best plate forward
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, INFO BOX at end of file
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``It's too pretty to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear that time and again at restaurants and dinner parties,
but figure you have to be a chef to create edible works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Not true. It takes only a bit of creativity and a few helpful
tools to produce a plate worthy of an art title.
</P>
<P>
   You want your foods to stand out on holiday tables, when many of
us break out the good china and silver. The foods can look as good
as the rest of the house with only a few chef's tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled in thinking that beautiful plates require
gourmet foods, either. A baked chicken with rosemary potatoes can
be alluring, if plated correctly. ``Plating'' is the term chefs use
for what we amateurs call presentation.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than an artful twist, however _ there's psychology
behind placing and choosing foods to go together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have lots of contrasts, textures, busy things
going on for the eye to enjoy,'' said Gerard Reuther, chef at
Janeiro's in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He cherishes the maroon and gold-detailed Versace china used at
the restaurant to cradle his ``tresse de sole et lasange a'ma
facon'' _ a braided fish and pasta dish. The two colors of fish and
three colors of pasta make this a colorful, striking presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Texture and color contrasts are important. ``You want different
textures on the plate. You don't want all the foods to be smooth or
all rough _ and white potatoes with the white fish _ no.''
</P>
<P>
   An elaborately rich place setting _ flowers, glassware, fine
silver _ gives the diner the feel that this a special dinner, he
said. ``This creates the impression that this is fine dining _ it's
what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mattioli, executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton in
Manalapan, keeps the plate design simple if the food is dramatic.
``Simplicity _ you must know when to say `when' if you are
decorating a plate. Too many cooks try to put too much on the
plate, then your eye cannot focus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you are plating a piece of chicken, the vegetables or starch
should be kept in smaller proportion, maybe even tucked under it,
so the chicken stands out. Only a bit of sauce _ of a contrasting
color _ should dot the plate. Small vegetables or a creative piping
of potatoes could complement the dish.
</P>
<P>
   The Alsacian chef used a wintry-looking glass plate, with etched
glass stripes for his appetizer or salad of cooked tomato stuffed
with fruits and nuts. ``The winter season means heavy foods; so you
want a lighter plate, so everything doesn't look so heavy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The softness of the tomato is played against the crisp nuts and
chunks of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Around the outside of the plate, he loosely scattered pieces of
the fruits, nuts and spices that are used in the stuffing, giving
the guests a ``taste'' for their eyes of what they will soon taste
with their mouths. Cinnamon sticks add texture and a hint of other
flavors in the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Suit the foods to the season and region, he said. For instance,
``in Florida, the tomatoes are ripe now, so while we have them, we
should feature them,'' he said. You could use apples instead of
tomatoes, but apples aren't Florida foods.
</P>
<P>
   For artist and chef Colin O'Daly of Roly's Bistro in Palm Beach
Gardens, designing a plate is like meditation. ``You see it in your
mind's eye first, and you can tell whether it's right or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake most amateur cooks make is crowding the
foods on the plate, or using plates that are too small, O'Daly
said. Foods must have space, ``just as a painting makes use of
blank canvas to create a focal point.''
</P>
<P>
   The finer restaurants use oversized plates to give food plenty
of space.
</P>
<P>
   He says to think about small portions _ and then keep them
small. Avoid the urge to ``over-decorate.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized contrasts. ``For instance, I'd probably use a
cool-colored plate or one that gives a cool feeling for a spicy
dish, and maybe a brighter plate for something not so spicy. Use a
fancy plate for a simple-looking food, or a plain white or
solid-color plate for an elaborate stacked food.''
</P>
<P>
   Arranging foods of different heights makes the plate visually
more appealing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't work so hard that your guests notice. It should look
effortless. The baked apple in a pastry crust he makes for dessert
is a dish that can be constructed in advance, leaving plenty of
time for the host to enjoy the dinner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plates can be decorated and waiting in the refrigerator for
the warm apples to be set atop the piped chocolate design. Baking
the crust at the last minute is all that's left to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baked apple is a dish you'd see at boy's school,'' O'Daly
said. ``Yet on a beautiful plate like this, with just ice cream
below it, and just a little sauce and a bit of a drizzle of
chocolate, look at what you've got. It's the ordinary elevated to
the elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   BEAUTIFUL FOODS: IT'S IN THE PLATING
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes from our chefs and instructions on plating the
foods.
</P>
<P>
   BRAIDED SOLE, SALMON AND PASTA
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds lemon sole fillets
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound salmon fillets
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces dried red lasagna noodles, cooked al dente _ see note
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces dried black lasagne noodles, cooked al dente _ see note
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces spinach lasagna noodles, cooked al dente _ see note
</P>
<P>
   2 whole shallots (for sauce)
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, chopped, for confit
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fish stock _ divided use
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 whole beefsteak tomatoes, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, cut julienne style
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Note: The vegetable and squid (black) noodles are available from
gourmet markets and fresh pasta markets. If squid pasta is not
available, plain pasta noodles can be substituted, though colors
will be red, green and off-white in finished dish.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare vegetable confit: Saute chopped shallots, leek and
diced tomato in 2 tablespoons butter; cook for 10 minutes. Add
cream, salt and pepper to taste; stir well. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare sauce: Saute whole shallots in 2 tablespoons butter.
Deglaze pan with white wine, scraping bottom of pan. Cook till
mixture is slightly reduced in volume. Add 1/2 cup fish stock and
reduce further. Add heavy cream and cook for 5 minutes. Add
remaining butter in small pieces; cook to incorporate about 1
minute. Add lemon juice, and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Set
aside; reheat when ready to plate food.
</P>
<P>
   Cut fish fillets and lasagna noodles into 6-inch by 3/4-inch
slices. For each plate, make 4 slices of sole, 2 of salmon and 2 of
each noodle; stack on a tray.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the design by placing fish and noodles on baking pan as
shown in photo on cover _ interweave the pasta with fish strips in
alternating colors of each.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 cup fish stock over all, and broil for 4 to 5 minutes,
or until fillet strips are done, but not dried out. Remove from
broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Place some of confit in center of each plate, spreading just
slightly. Carefully lift fish from pan using wide spatula; set on
top of confit.
</P>
<P>
   Add a small drizzle of heated sauce at table over each plate.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BAKED TOMATO STUFFED WITH NUTS AND DRIED FRUITS
</P>
<P>
   8 beefsteak tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons honey (thyme or acacia is preferred)
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces butter
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce pistachios
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce sliced almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce hazelnuts
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce walnuts
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce pecans
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar _ optional
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce dried apricot pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce dried prunes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon _ optional
</P>
<P>
   12 black peppercorns _ optional
</P>
<P>
   Mint leaves, cinnamon sticks for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Wash tomatoes. Cut 3/4-inch slice off top of each tomato;
reserve. Scoop out inside of tomato _ reserve for other use as
desired. Chop nuts and fruits coarsely, reserving 1 tablespoon each
for garnishing.
</P>
<P>
   Heat saucepan over medium heat; add honey and caramelize until
golden brown. Add butter until melted, then add chopped nuts and
fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Add lemon juice, vinegar, mint, cinnamon and black peppercorns
if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Stir well over medium heat to toast nuts slightly; remove from
heat. Stuff tomatoes carefully, taking care not to tear skin of
tomato. Replace top of each tomato and place tomatoes in a buttered
baking dish. Bake at 300 degrees for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes will be soft; take care when lifting them to plate.
</P>
<P>
   On a large clear glass plate or solid white plate, place tomato
slightly off center. Skew top of tomato slightly to reveal
stuffing. Scatter bits of reserved fruits and nuts as garnish
around plate. Top each tomato with mint leaf; add cinnamon stick if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This could be served warm or cold. Apples could be
substituted for tomatoes if desired, though more baking time would
be required (20 minutes more or until apple is soft.)
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe from chef Joseph Mattioli, The Ritz-Carlton, Manalapan.)
</P>
<P>
   BAKED APPLE IN CAVADOS BUTTER SAUCE WITH PASTRY CRUST
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup golden raisins (or sultanas, if available)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Calvados (apple brandy)
</P>
<P>
   4 apples, cored (Reinette preferred, but any cooking apple will
work well)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces frozen puff pastry dough, thawed
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons superfine sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces (about 2 1/4 tablespoons) butter
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons semi-sweet chocolate pieces melted with 1/2
teaspoon vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   Soak raisins in Calvados for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Drain, reserving Calvados. Remove core from each apple, and peel
top about 1/2 inch around center. Take slice off bottom of each
apple so it stands firmly upright.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle raisins with cinnamon; toss to coat. Stuff a few
raisins in center of each apple; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch
thickness. Cut four ovals to wrap around apples; brush edges of
each with egg yolk.
</P>
<P>
   Enclose an apple in each oval of pastry. Seal the edges well,
and crimp with small knife. Brush each top with egg yolk; make a
small cut in the top of each as a vent.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and
dust generously with superfine sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Place under a hot broiler briefly to cook sugar and give a nice
shiny glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cook brown sugar, water and honey in heavy-based
saucepan to a pale amber color. Stir in butter and cream, reserving
about 2 tablespoons, then add reserved Cavados.
</P>
<P>
   Strain sauce; keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Before plating, chill plates slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Melt chocolates and shortening; pour into tiny parchment cone.
Draw fine lines in a random pattern on each plate to edge of plate
(or use a ruler).
</P>
<P>
   Position each apple slightly off center on plate. Drizzle sauce
over apple, or spoon between lines of chocolate for abstract
design. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
   CHEFS SHARE THEIR TIPS ON PRESENTING FOODS
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips on plate designing from well-known chefs:
</P>
<P>
   _ The first rule is flavor _ make sure the foods deliver what
they promise. If they're not cooked properly, no amount or plating
will save them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take inspiration from foods you see in fine restaurants. Note
how chefs place the foods on the plate, and the kinds of plates
used. Look at food magazines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think through the foods that will go on a plate together
before cooking. Are there contrasts in texture, color and flavor?
</P>
<P>
   _ Practice first, especially with an elaborate dish or design,
to make sure you can pull off the plating in a dinner or party
setting for several guests at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't try to design every course of a meal. While it's good to
separate courses for plated foods, you can still serve a plain
tossed salad, or a bowl of soup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every plate should have a focal point _ one food should draw
the eye first. It doesn't have to be on the center of the plate; it
can be off-center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put the main food on the plate, set it on the table, step
back, and look at it. Add only one other food at a time. Use a
larger plate, a different color or a textured one to create the
mood you want.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use one stunning design technique per plate. If you've
``painted'' a sauce on the plate, don't dust the rim with sugar or
cocoa. If you've created a pastry garnish, don't add six other
garnishes. Let only one stand out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use one attractive raw ingredient from the dish to get the
diner ready for what they're about to taste.
</P>
<P>
   _ All garnishes on the plate should be edible.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   PUT YOUR BEST PLATE FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   It's more than just a little creativity _ sometimes, it's the
right tool to help you jazz up your food. Here are things to have
on hand:
</P>
<P>
   A SQUEEZE BOTTLE: As trite as it seems, painting a plate with
sauce-squiggles still impresses, especially with desserts.
</P>
<P>
   A BAMBOO SKEWER OR CAKE-TESTING WIRE: Draws the lines through
those sauce squiggles to create the feather-like designs.
</P>
<P>
   A PASTRY BAG WITH LARGE STAR TIP: Don't just plop potatoes and
purees onto plates _ pipe them out in an attractive pattern.
Another tip, especially for mashed potatoes _ brown them slightly
after piping or dust with finely chopped herbs. (You also can use
it as intended: to create fanciful pastry doughs or pipe cream onto
a dessert.)
</P>
<P>
   A SIEVE: To shake cocoa or powdered sugar or even fine salt onto
a stencil for a pattern on a dish.
</P>
<P>
   A PARING KNIFE, GARNISHING KNIFE AND ZESTING TOOL: These peel
and cut hard veggies and fruit peels into fanciful shapes, and in a
pinch, turn chocolate or pastry pieces into interesting designs.
</P>
<P>
   A FEW OVERSIZE PLATES: Chefs serve foods with plenty of space
around the plate; it's a design trick made possible by oversized
plates. The magic behind this trick _ don't overload the plate.
</P>
<P>
   A PASTRY BRUSH: Gets rid of loose crumbs from cakes, or other
distractions. Can be used with a light sugar-water glaze or a light
oil to give foods ``shine'' just before serving.

 &HT;    We can't resign highways to becoming scrap zones
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It would appear, as one drives the nation's
highways, that mankind made a deal with the devil just after Henry
Ford came along to change our lives forever.
</P>
<P>
   We could travel faster than horses, said the devil, but as our
visual fare we would have to line up the corpses of the dead _ dead
cars, that is _ for eternity along our highways.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that driving cross-country one commonly finds one's
self whistling past graveyards, like the one at Elm Mott on I-35.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it's not one auto graveyard but several, about as
picturesque as the Iraqi retreat out of Kuwait _ automotive hulls
as far as the optic nerve can stretch. Recently with the blessing
of the McLennan County commissioners its numbers were allowed to
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Maybe, learn to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitican communities spend lots of money trying to improve
images and foster economic development. Despite all this, too
commonly just before a visitor hits the ``welcome to'' sign, he or
she is repulsed by roadside signs like this.
</P>
<P>
   Real highway turn-off
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether or not to have auto salvage yards. They
are a necessity, as are other means of disposing of and recycling
our refuse. But seemingly it would be public policy to limit their
blight, particularly in our transportation corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the 3-1 majority that approved a permit for Stephen
Harvey's wrecking yard at Elm Mott, McLennan County Commissioner
Joe Mashek said he would support the application because he wants
to ``go by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that commissioners had little choice.
</P>
<P>
   The further implication was that because interstate-hugging Elm
Mott was already an auto-salvage mecca, one more yard couldn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Were commissioners powerless to say no? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents insisted that the commissioners could have chosen one
of several reasons to say no, including the presence of residences
within 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in nearby Waco wish the commissioners would have
said no based on Article 8, Section 3.06 of the county junkyard
ordinance, under which a permit can de denied if the junkyard is
found ``detrimental to the economic welfare of McLennan County,''
which all highway corridor blight is.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered junkyards
</P>
<P>
   County officials point out that the new salvage yard will be
required to erect screens to spare motorists' eyes, so it will be
the least of our concerns, blight-wise. The real problem is
junkyards which were in place before passage of the 1970s-vintage
Highway Beautification Act, which requires such screening. Many of
those ``grandfathered'' junkyards do little or nothing to spare us
from their pitiful palor.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird Johnson, your country needs you.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you pointed out how billboards were stealing scenes from
our countryside, you need to point out how rows of dead autos
diminish things even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The country needs your radiance along a roadside as you point
out the bleeding of our vistas. It needs you to say that which
everyone says but nobody seems to do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers, at the state and local level, should know that
they are not powerless to curb this blight. They can say ``no'' to
junkyards in highway corridors, even if others have come before. At
the state and national level they can change laws so that
grandfathered salvage yards have to comport themselves as do those
that abide by the Highway Beautification Act.
</P>
<P>
   The devil in Henry Ford's wondrous idea was pollution of many
sorts. We've been far more vigilant about the pollution that comes
from our tailpipes than that which will rust away our days, and our
great-grandchildren's days, along our highways.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Getting at the truth on Desert Fox
 &HT;    (For release, Dec. 20, 1998.)
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``General Faversham is a director of Her Majesty's Royal Chelsea
Flower Show and senior fanfare officer for Desert Fox who will now
report to you on the effectiveness of our strikes. General.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you. Beginning on 16 December, combined forces of the
United States and United Kingdom began precision missile attacks on
military targets inside Iraq. As you can see by these videotapes,
each and every missile dropped right down the smokestack of the
intended target, inflicting heavy damage to materials but not to
the civilian population. We are assessing incoming reports and
shall further update you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. My name is Ahmed Kassem Arif, deputy
communications officer for the Baghdad district, and one of its
most prominent fig salesman. We have brought you here to downtown
Baghdad to show you that American missiles have killed wantonly. As
you can see, this was a pita factory with absolutely no military
significance. (Psst, Hasan, shut that door!) This once again proves
the brutality of the American satans and their British
subordinates. As a result of this hit, every child in eastern
Baghdad carries with him many shrapnel wounds, while those who
don't nevertheless are suffering from illnesses brought about
earlier by the economic restrictions placed on the peaceful people
of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN here, as we walk among Iraqi citizens to get their opinion
of the early attacks. You, sir, how do you feel about being bombed
in the middle of the night?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible. These people are satans. I was at home
watching a late soccer game on TV when the missiles flew overhead.
I hear they missed all their targets and hit only women and
children. Allah will exact a revenge for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``General Faversham. Ridley here from CNN. I've just come back
from downtown Baghdad, where I was taken to one of the ground zero
points by Iraqi officials. What I saw was a broken water pipe,
missile fragments and a lot of water in the street. What was the
purpose of hitting this target?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The water pipe, my man, the water pipe. We had reason to
believe that pipe carried through it what is called `heavy water,'
which as you know is one of the components for creating nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, with all due respect, the water pipe was coming directly
out of a toilet behind a coffee shop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely. These people are treacherous. They will use any
venue to achieve their goals. Toilets are natural venues for
beginning work on weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would someone convey to the American government, especially
their presidents, that we, the people of Iraq, do not appreciate
our leader being referred to only by his first name. First, Bush
would say only `Saddam.' Now Clinton the Fornicator does the same.
`Saddam,' he says, only `Saddam.' Would your President Roosevelt
have called Adolf Hitler simply `Adolf'? Of course not. Do not be
so informal with our great leader. And stop with those bombs and
missiles. You can't hit the side of a barn with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faversham here again. Despite Iraqi claims to the contrary,
our data show heavy damage to their ability to wage war. We have
destroyed all their fixed facilities between Beijing and
Saskatchewan, and have inflicted equally heavy damage on their
mobile targets, including every automobile that has left Baghdad in
the last six days, as they are likely vehicles to transport heavy
water from Baghdad toilets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean `data shows,' General, not `data show.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Yank, you speak your English, I'll speak mine. Do I
complain when you pronounce `miss-ill' when it should be
`miss-ile'? Next!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, the Iraqis claim one of the missiles struck the house of
the daughter of Saddam Hussein. Is that considered a military
target? Did you think Saddam, himself, was there at the time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The house definitely was a military target. If it had a
bathroom and pipes leading from it, it represented a danger. We
used our `wildcard' strategy on that, something we developed to
bomb Moammar Gadhafi's tent several years ago. You never can tell
when those guys are going to be at home, so it's worth a shot. We
only hit the toilet, however.''
</P>
<P>
   And now this from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we all get along?''
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The atrocities of attack politics
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombing in Iraq not only degraded Saddam Hussein's ability
to wage chemical, biological and nuclear war. It also further
degraded American politics _ however much that might have seemed
impossible beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The competition in such matters has been stiff, but surely one
of the season's most unseemly sights was that of many Republicans
rushing to declare President Clinton had gone after Iraq just to
distract them from the pleasures of his imminent impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A more callow act of partisanship would be hard to imagine. But
there was Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, no less, disavowing
the president's decision even in the heat of battle. Rep. Gerald
Solomon (R-N.Y.) called the timing the ``lowest thing'' he had ever
seen. Republican former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
said it ``stinks to high heaven.'' Georgia Rep. Bob Barr of course
frothed, this time with a goofy theory that Clinton launched the
attack so he could then say the example of the U.S. military had
taught him at long last how much honor counts and thus weasel out
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ordinarily quite sane Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
one of the GOP's wiser foreign policy heads, lamented that the
president so lacked authority any longer that he would be unable to
rally support for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   If so, might that just maybe have anything to do with six years
of unremitting Republican demonizing of him? But even as Lugar
spoke, one poll showed 80-plus percent of Americans do support the
attack, and in another poll only 30 percent _ the base-line number
in any matter involving Clinton _ thought the president was up to
no good. And notable foreign opposition came just from the usual
suspects _- France, China and Russia, each with major big-money
reasons for its open-ended indulgence of Saddam's games.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who had been paying attention, the attack could have
come as no surprise. When Clinton called back our B-52s in November
after Saddam made a literally last-minute promise to restart arms
inspections, the president made it plain that another Iraqi lapse
would bring prompt military action. No more talking. No more
warnings. After chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler blew the
whistle on Saddam's continuing noncompliance and pulled his team
out of Iraq Tuesday and with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
impending, it was virtually certain the United States and Britain
would shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had nothing to gain politically by attacking except the
further enmity of Republicans already steeped in it. GOP leadership
had made it clear the party was hellbent on the president's
impeachment, come what may and contrary public opinion be damned.
Putting the vote off a day or two was all that was ever in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Are so many Republicans by now in such a deep and permanent
anti-Clinton fit they really suppose he would order U.S. troops
into battle just for that? Apparently. Most were more circumspect,
but the number who leaped to attack the president instead of Saddam
Hussein was appalling. This is what years of attack politics has
brought us to.

   CLINTON-DEFENSE (San Francisco) _ The chance to defend President
Clinton against charges of impeachment in a Senate trial would be
the ultimate dream case to some local defense lawyers, but others
said their skills would be useless in what will amount to a
political event, not a legal one. With impeachment by the House
looming, it appears President Clinton will need a good criminal
defense lawyer. By ULYSSES TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-OUTAGE (San Francisco) _ The PG&AMP;E crew whose bungling
caused the Dec. 8 blackout _ leaving a million San Francisco-area
residents without electricity _ ignored three required safety
procedures that could have averted it, a top utility executive
said. By ERIN McCORMICK and ERIC BRAZIL.

   MITCH-MARINES (Chinandega, Nicaragua _ Six hundred bulldozers,
graders, jeeps and trucks, painted camouflage green and driven by
U.S. Marines with crew cuts, rolled out this week from the Pacific
Coast port of Corinto in 30 small caravans, bound for the hard-hit
northern provinces of Esteli, Matagalpa, Jinotega and Nueva
Segovia, where Hurricane Mitch's rains washed out roads and bridges
and demolished homes, crops and livestock. By TYCHE HENDRICKS.

   TECH-GIFTS (San Francisco) _ This is it. Seven days until
Christmas. Trying to find that right piece of gear for your
resident tech head can give you the vapors. Here are seven
suggested gifts. Some are pricey, but some are refreshingly cheap.
And all can make you look like you spent your year reading computer
magazine reviews of the hottest (trust me, it's a fate worse than
death). By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-BOOKS (Undated) _ Books about opera are hot this holiday
season (when are they not?), but serious folks will find
nourishment in a spate of critical biographies of important
composers. Here's a rundown of what's new in print for the
musically insatiable. By ALLAN ULRICH.
</P>

   FBN-QUARTERBACKS (San Francisco) _ Kordell Stewart cried on
Sunday afternoon, on an NFL sideline. He threw three interceptions
and was benched. Then everything boiled over for the young
Pittsburgh Steeler, and he lost control. Quarterbacks keep melting
down. A year ago, it was Washington's exasperated Gus Frerotte
banging his head against a wall and giving himself a concussion.
Once the toast of D.C., now he's just toast. By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-COLF-COMPUTER (Clifton Park, N.Y.) _ John Pritchard wanted
to play exotic golf games with complicated scoring methods such as
Nassau, Scramble, Vegas and others that are fun for those who like
to bet a few dollars on the side. But he couldn't keep up with the
scoring. So he invented a computer program that fits on certain
types of hand-held computers that allows individuals and golf
foursomes to keep score of one or even multiple golf games. By ALAN

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Madness. Complete madness. It was
schizophrenic, split-brain, manic-depressive cognitive dissonance

Wednesday the town's insanity was just a locked-ward version of the
national nervous breakdown. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ My interpretation of this mess in
Washington is that Bill Clinton is unfit for office. I believe,

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   During the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were the
centerpiece of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear arms hovered in the background of every major issue in
East-West competition and alliance relations.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priorities of U.S. policy could almost all be linked
in some way to the danger of World War III and the fear of millions
of casualties in the American homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few Americans still lose sleep over weapons of mass
destruction (WMD). After all, what do normal people feel is the
main relief provided by the end of the Cold War? It is that the
danger of nuclear war is off their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, WMD present more and different things to worry about
than during the Cold War. For one, nuclear arms are no longer the
only concern, as chemical and biological weapons have come to the
fore. For another, there is less danger of complete annihilation,
but more danger of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of WMD will be used is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   In the new world of mass destruction, such weapons are no longer
on the technological frontier of warfare. Increasingly, they will
be weapons of the weak states or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   As to importance, biological weapons should now be the most
serious concern, with nuclear weapons second and chemicals a
distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no globally threatening superpower or
transnational ideology to be contained _ only an array of serious
but entirely local disruptions. As the only nation acting to police
areas outside its own region, the United States makes itself a
target for states or groups whose aspirations are frustrated by
U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   If it is infeasible for hostile states to counter the United
States in conventional combat, it is even more daunting for smaller
groups such as terrorists. If the United States is lucky, the
various violent groups with grievances against the American
government and society will continue to think up schemes using
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Few terrorist groups have shown an interest in inflicting true
mass destruction. Bombings or hostage seizures have generally
threatened no more than a few hundred lives. Let us hope that this
limitation has been for a powerful underlying reason, rather than a
simple lack of capability, and that the few exceptions do not
become more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure reason to bet on such restraint. Indeed, some
have tried to use WMD, only to see them fizzle. The Japanese Aum
Shinrikyo cult released sarin nerve gas in Tokyo in 1995 but killed
only a few people. Some analysts believe that those who attacked
the World Trade Center in 1993 laced their bomb with cyanide, which
burned up in the explosion. (This was not confirmed, but a large
amount of cyanide was found in the perpetrators' possession.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually such a group will prove more competent. If terrorists
decide that they want to stun American policymakers by inflicting
enormous damage, WMD become more attractive at the same time that
they are becoming more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the bedrock of
American war capabilities. They were the linchpin of defense
debate, procurement programs and arms control because the United
States faced another superpower _ one that conventional wisdom
feared could best it in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one cares about the MX missile or B-1 bomber, and even
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is in the background. In a
manner that could only have seemed ludicrous during the Cold War,
proponents now rationalize the $2 billion B-2 as a weapon for
conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using WMD as an ``asymmetric'' means to counter
U.S. conventional power, and how to protect U.S. ground and naval
forces abroad from WMD attacks. This concern is all well and good,
but it abets a drift of attention away from the main danger.
</P>
<P>
   The primary risk is not that enemies might lob some nuclear or
chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships, awful as that
would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to punish the
United States by triggering catastrophes in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Until the past decade, the issue was nuclear arms, period.
Chemical weapons received some attention from specialists, but
never made the priority list of presidents and cabinets. Biological
weapons were almost forgotten after they were banned by the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical and biological arms have received more attention in the
1990s. But the issues posed by the trio lumped under the rubric of
mass destruction differ. Most significantly, biological weapons
have received less attention than the others but probably represent
the greatest danger.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical weapons have been noticed more in the past decade,
especially since they were used by Iraq against Iranian troops in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and against Kurdish civilians in 1988.
Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical weapons are not really in the same class as other
weapons of mass destruction, in the sense of ability to inflict a
huge number of civilian casualties in a single strike. For the tens
of thousands of fatalities as in, say, the biggest strategic
bombing raids of World War II, it would be very difficult
logistically and operationally to deliver chemical weapons in
necessary quantities over wide areas.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: Unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Like chemical weapons but unlike nuclear weapons, biologicals
are relatively easy to make. Innovations in biotechnology have
obviated many of the old problems in handling and preserving
biological agents, and many have been freely available for
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Pentagon, concern about biological weapons has picked
up tremendously in the past couple of years, but there is little
serious attention to the problem elsewhere. This could be a good
thing if nothing much can be done, since publicity might only give
enemies ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a bad thing if it impedes efforts to take steps that
could blunt nuclear, chemical or biological attacks.

</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using WMD as an ``asymmetric'' means to counter
U.S. conventional power, and how to protect U.S. ground and naval
forces abroad from WMD attacks. This concern is all well and good,
but it abets a drift of attention away from the main danger.
</P>
<P>
   The primary risk is not that enemies might lob some nuclear or
chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships, awful as that
would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to punish the
United States by triggering catastrophes in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Until the past decade, the issue was nuclear arms, period.
Chemical weapons received some attention from specialists, but
never made the priority list of presidents and cabinets. Biological
weapons were almost forgotten after they were banned by the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical and biological arms have received more attention in the
1990s. But the issues posed by the trio lumped under the rubric of
mass destruction differ. Most significantly, biological weapons
have received less attention than the others but probably represent
the greatest danger.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical weapons have been noticed more in the past decade,
especially since they were used by Iraq against Iranian troops in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and against Kurdish civilians in 1988.
Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical weapons are not really in the same class as other
weapons of mass destruction, in the sense of ability to inflict a
huge number of civilian casualties in a single strike. For the tens
of thousands of fatalities as in, say, the biggest strategic
bombing raids of World War II, it would be very difficult
logistically and operationally to deliver chemical weapons in
necessary quantities over wide areas.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: Unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Like chemical weapons but unlike nuclear weapons, biologicals
are relatively easy to make. Innovations in biotechnology have
obviated many of the old problems in handling and preserving
biological agents, and many have been freely available for
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Pentagon, concern about biological weapons has picked
up tremendously in the past couple of years, but there is little
serious attention to the problem elsewhere. This could be a good
thing if nothing much can be done, since publicity might only give
enemies ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a bad thing if it impedes efforts to take steps that
could blunt nuclear, chemical or biological attacks.

<P>
   The shock of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in 1995 overshadowed, in some measure, Israel's celebration of its
50th anniversary three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was not merely the country's leader but one of the pillars
of its survival: a hero in the 1948 War of Independence, the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in the 1967 Six Day War
and the man who as defense minister masterminded the withdrawal
from most of Lebanon after the debacles of 1982-83 and is said to
have ordered his troops to break the bones of the youthful
stone-throwers of the intifada. He was also the Nobel Peace
Prize-winner who presided over the opening to the Palestinians. His
life spanned the full half-century of his country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, was no marginal man, no
fantasist like John Wilkes Booth, no lonely oddball like Lee Harvey
Oswald. He was, rather, the product of some of Israel's finest
institutions: the elite Golani infantry brigade, a prestigious
religious nationalist yeshiva, and arguably the best law school in
the country. He was religious but not a member of the
ultra-Orthodox extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin assassination inflicted a wound on the Israeli polity
that will take decades to heal. It revealed, as in one horrible
flash of lightning, the gap between religious and secular, between
zealots for the land and those willing to sacrifice it, between
those willing to take large risks for peace and those who view such
gambles as trifling with survival.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the murder of Rabin struck a blow at yet another myth
_ that no matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade Israeli
politics, in the end these are merely words, and the nation will
stand together.
</P>
<P>
   That myth, like most myths, rested on a very considerable
element of truth. When a series of suicide bombings this decade in
the hearts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv caused horrible carnage,
secular Israelis glued to their televisions saw squads of bearded
ultra-Orthodox men magically appear to collect, with reverent care,
every dismembered limb, every scrap of human flesh, every drop of
clotting blood for decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   These unpaid volunteers, responding within minutes to pagers
summoning them, were of the same ilk as those who throw rocks at
cars driving on the Sabbath. Indeed, in some cases they were the
same people. For a few moments, these grisly acts of mercy
suspended the ferocity of disagreements about state subventions to
seminaries, draft exemptions and Saturday road closures.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's success in thwarting the very real threat to its
existence in its first decades requires little retelling. In a
series of wars _ some short, some long, some marked by desperate
clashes of tens of thousands of soldiers, some by ambushes and
raids by mere squads _ Israel managed to convince its enemies that
it could not be defeated by conventional means, that prolonged
insurgency or guerrilla struggle would not bring it down and that
even unconventional threats would only elicit cunning and violent
preemption or the most terrible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal assumption of Israeli statecraft _ universal and
implacable hostility on the part of its immediate neighbors _ was
never entirely accurate (Jordan, in particular, often found itself
in clandestine alliance with the Jewish state). But by the 1990s,
it had become completely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   An Israel at formal peace with Jordan and Egypt, in negotiations
with Palestinians who a few years before would never have
considered sitting down with representatives of the Zionist entity,
and with a foreign service stretched to maintain legations in all
the countries eager for ties is not the embattled Israel of old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israel's existence in a state of perpetual siege had
its terrors, but to a large extent it had simplifying comforts as
well. It relieved Israel of the need for a complex statecraft
toward the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The siege helped ensure solidarity within a diverse population,
sympathy from without, and support from Diaspora Jewry. Above all,
it relieved Israel of the need to wrestle with the original and
most durable conflict of all: the contest with the Arabs of
Palestine for a small plot of land to which both peoples had a
powerful claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel may not be at peace,'' remarks Reuven Gal, a sturdy
former paratrooper and onetime chief psychologist of the IDF, ``but
Israelis have decided that they are at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   When they voted in 1996 for the Likud's Netanyahu, they did not,
as some outsiders feared, vote to end the peace process but merely
to slow it down and get a better deal than they expected from
Shimon Peres' dreams of a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself has, without fanfare, given up his party's
ideology, which once stood foursquare against relinquishing
territory to the Palestinians. The prior quarrels within Israel and
between Netanyahu and the Clinton administration have really been
over percentages, pace and details.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud government will probably witness the birth of a
Palestinian state _ and will accept it because most Israelis will
wish it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to forge a new and more subtle statecraft. If
it fights more wars (and it well may, for it still has real
enemies), it must fight them in a political world that has known
formal peace and to which peace may return.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can Israel's internal problems be subordinated to what
Israelis still call ``ha'matzav'' _ ``The Situation'' _ the daily
and enduring security threat. It endures in the form of Hezbollah
ambushes, Hamas bus bombs, Palestinian Authority guerrilla warfare,
or Iranian or Iraqi missiles armed with weapons of mass
destruction. But serious as each of these are, they no longer loom
over Israel in quite the same way security threats did for the last
70 years of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By now, that Israel is the most pro-American country in the
Middle East goes without saying; it has, after all, benefited from
American friendship and largesse and fought its battles using
American weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americanization of Israel goes far deeper. English is so
much Israel's second language that one can live quite comfortably
without knowing a word of Hebrew. American fashions fill the stores
and American academic fads sweep university departments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful arguments for direct election of the
prime minister (an innovation introduced in 1996) was that it would
give rise to American-style political decorum and stability (which,
of course, it did not). But when Netanyahu gave a gracious victory
speech after ousting Peres in 1996, commentators noted proudly that
he had spoken just the way a successful American pol would have.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Israel's fascination with America mirrors the
general extension of American culture throughout the world. But it
also reflects the natural intertwining of two very different
societies _ one tiny, one vast _ in which Jews can without mental
tricks or self-deception feel comfortably at home.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree unthinkable for Israel's founding generation, their
country has already become dependent on the United States for
matters as diverse and vital as defense and finance. And it
 &UR; has done so, by and large, cheerfully and wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever material successes they have had, Israelis can
never achieve what so many of them crave _ the benign normalcy that
now characterizes Western societies and the United States above
all. Small wonder that hundreds of thousands have emigrated over
the years, most to the United States, which remains a mythic land
of opportunity and forgetfulness to those who find the cramped
confines of Israel and the tormented destiny of the Jews an
intolerable burden.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Israel _ and the catastrophe of the Holocaust, in
a quite different way _ has understandably overshadowed the miracle
of Jewish survival and creativity over the centuries of the Jews'
dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have dismissed or even despised that experience.
Ironically, however, they find themselves increasingly forced to
wrestle with the questions that agitated the Jews in their
wanderings: Who are we, and what is our mission?
</P>
<P>
   More than for any other state, a spiritual question lies at the
heart of Israel's self-definition and, indeed, its very existence.
Few prosperous peoples, in this age of superficial entertainments
and instant gratification, confront such ultimate questions. As one
that does, the Israelis have every reason to be proud.

 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington. Yet few protests
are receiving much media attention.
 &HT;    For example, on Sept. 24 in Washington, the leaders of major
women's groups such as the National Organization for Women and the
National Council of Negro Women _ plus social justice groups like
the United Farm Workers and the Asian-Pacific Legal Consortium _
came together in a historic coalition to oppose President Clinton's
resignation or impeachment.
 &HT;    As they explained, ``(Clinton's) misdeeds are not of the nature
of high crimes and misdemeanors. ... As feminist leaders, we will
not stand idly by while a Congress made up of nearly 90 percent men
attempts to remove the first president elected by women voters.''
They also noted that a 90 percent white Congress would be
impeaching a president supported by more than 90 percent of
African-American voters.
 &HT;    If you don't know about that press conference, I'm not
surprised. The press mostly ignored it. Instead, media pundits
repeated the right-wing line that feminists didn't support Paula
Jones _ though we always supported her access to the courts (and
she had plenty), despite the borderline nature of her case of
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    If you're on the Internet, however, perhaps you do know of such
continuing efforts as ``Censure and Move On,'' a group that has
generated more than 94,000 messages against impeachment. Still more
calls are being made possible by Working Assets and People for the
American Way. People are lined up to reach their Congress members.
 &HT;    Yet I recently listened to Chris Matthews on ``Hardball,''
saying that the anti-impeachment majority must not really care
about Clinton's plight _ because there were no protests.
 &HT;    The truth is that protest isn't visible unless the media makes
it visible.
 &HT;    What the media does report is every hypocritical word in the
unrepresentative House Judiciary Committee, plus opinions from
talking heads neatly divided into those FOR and AGAINST
impeachment. This is supposed to serve objectivity. In fact, it
only gives the false impression that public opinion is equally
divided.
 &HT;    We know it is not. The huge majority opposes Clinton's
impeachment. The press attributes even that irrefutable result of
public opinion polls to some notion of economic comfort, as if
Clinton were being supported only out of the selfishness created by
a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from this economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold by
many of the same right-wing groups ever since the Clintons entered
the White House.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the American Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of NOW
and other women's groups for staging a hunger strike outside the
White House in the vain hope of dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not constitute
a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal status may be
an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as lawyers say.
We are not the sex police. Any idea that this law allows such
policing will only defeat a good and much-needed code.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    If he is impeached, any partisan majority will be able to
impeach any president. Is that what we want?

 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington. Yet few protests
are receiving much media attention.
 &HT;    For example, on Sept. 24 in Washington, the leaders of major
women's groups such as the National Organization for Women and the
National Council of Negro Women _ plus social justice groups like
the United Farm Workers and the Asian-Pacific Legal Consortium _
came together in a historic coalition to oppose President Clinton's
resignation or impeachment.
 &HT;    As they explained, ``(Clinton's) misdeeds are not of the nature
of high crimes and misdemeanors. ... As feminist leaders, we will
not stand idly by while a Congress made up of nearly 90 percent men
attempts to remove the first president elected by women voters.''
They also noted that a 90 percent white Congress would be
impeaching a president supported by more than 90 percent of
African-American voters.
 &HT;    If you don't know about that press conference, I'm not
surprised. The press mostly ignored it. Instead, media pundits
repeated the right-wing line that feminists didn't support Paula
Jones _ though we always supported her access to the courts (and
she had plenty), despite the borderline nature of her case of
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    If you're on the Internet, however, perhaps you do know of such
continuing efforts as ``Censure and Move On,'' a group that has
generated more than 94,000 messages against impeachment. Still more
calls are being made possible by Working Assets and People for the
American Way. People are lined up to reach their Congress members.
 &HT;    Yet I recently listened to Chris Matthews on ``Hardball,''
saying that the anti-impeachment majority must not really care
about Clinton's plight _ because there were no protests.
 &HT;    The truth is that protest isn't visible unless the media makes
it visible.
 &HT;    What the media does report is every hypocritical word in the
unrepresentative House Judiciary Committee, plus opinions from
talking heads neatly divided into those FOR and AGAINST
impeachment. This is supposed to serve objectivity. In fact, it
only gives the false impression that public opinion is equally
divided.
 &HT;    We know it is not. The huge majority opposes Clinton's
impeachment. The press attributes even that irrefutable result of
public opinion polls to some notion of economic comfort, as if
Clinton were being supported only out of the selfishness created by
a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from this economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold by
many of the same right-wing groups ever since the Clintons entered
the White House.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the American Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of NOW
and other women's groups for staging a hunger strike outside the
White House in the vain hope of dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)

   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

ANOTHER POWERFUL ROLE FOR EMILY WATSON 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Emily Watson in ``Hilary
and Jackie.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    While Emily Watson is hardly a household name in Hollywood, when
the Oscar nominations are announced in early l999, the British
actress is likely to show up again--for the second time in three
years.
 &HT;    This time it will be for her role as the late British cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' a true tale of sibling
rivalry run amok.
 &HT;    Watson made her remarkable screen debut in ``Breaking the
Waves'' (1996), Lars von Trier's powerful film in which she played
the disturbed wife of a paralyzed oil worker. The impression she
made has never quite faded. Now she's done it again in an equally
disturbing story.
 &HT;    Watson never goes the easy route as she portrays the brilliant
but troubled du Pre who died in l987 from the degenerative nerve
disease multiple sclerosis.
 &HT;    The story is based on the book by du Pre's sister and her
brother Piers. Hilary is played by Australian actress Rachel
Griffiths, last seen in this country as the best friend in
``Muriel's Wedding'' (1994).
 &HT;    Hilary du Pre, also a musician, never climbed to her sister's
heights and the memoir she penned could be seen vengeful. Certainly
it paints an unflattering picture of the cellist who one critic
said used the instrument to create ``music that wept.''
 &HT;    What will undoubtedly be one its most shocking revelation is
Hilary's acquiescence when her sister, married to the famous
pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, asks to sleep with Hilary's
husband Kiffer Finzi, played by David Morrissey.
 &HT;    The very tall, slim Watson owns it's the sex swap in ``Hilary
and Jackie'' that has caused the most attention. Says Watson:
``Jackie couldn't sit down and say 'My life's a mess.' She lacked
the emotional vocabulary to deal with things. So her way of saying
'I need somebody to love me just for me, not for my cello,' is to
say 'I want to sleep with your husband.'''
 &HT;    To be convincing as du Pre in the wheelchair, dying slowly and
losing the ability to make music, ``was a lot easier than most of
things I've done,'' says Watson, ``because there's such a lot
available on Jacqueline and such a lot written about her. There
were all the videos--and of course all her recordings. The hard
part was to learn to play the cello--or at least I had to look as
though I was playing.''
 &HT;    Watson says at 14 she actually studied the instrument for six
months. ``But for me that was all. But Jacqueline often was quoted
as saying the cello was incredibly sensual and that as a woman
you're forced to embrace it with your body. So it became like a
lover. It fulfilled her life in many ways and it left her lonely.
Isn't that what lovers do to us?''
 &HT;    Much time also was spent learning to play a victim of the muscle
disease. ``The great tragedy was that she was a 'primary
progressive'--it's the worst kind of sclerosis because it moves
quickly and affects the entire body,'' says Watson. ``At the end
her body was constantly trembling and flailing.''
 &HT;    Watson, a brilliant talent in her own art, says playing du Pre
taught her a lot. ``I think it's a valuable lesson for every artist
because it's such a cautionary tale. You can have talent and
celebrity and those things can take you to a very dark place
because we really don't understand what it's all about. You need a
sane voice to keep pulling you back to reality... Whenever I'm
feeling too grandiose I go home and do the ironing.''
 &HT;    Watson, married to actor-writer Jack Waters whom she met while
both were with the Royal Shakespeare Company, says her skyrocketing
career has not affected their marriage. ``We spend as much time as
we can together--and make those moments count.''
 &HT;    Since the du Pre role Watson has completed ``The Cradle Will
Rock,'' under Tim Robbins' direction, playing a street urchin in
the film which Robbins also wrote. She is deeply into yet another
book-to-screen memoir--''Angela's Ashes,'' based on Frank McCourt's
best seller about a family growing up poor in Ireland.
 &HT;    ``Since 'Breaking the Waves' I'm in that enviable position of
turning down a lot of scripts and being offered the best there are
for women of my age,'' says Watson, 32. ``But I'm really aware that
this business is more about luck than talent. I was just lucky that
Helena Bonham Carter backed out of 'Breaking the Waves' at the last
moment.''

CLINTON MUST GO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I recognize the voices.
</P>
<P>
   These people have called before and left messages on my voice
mail. Invariably, they've been angry, hostile tirades assailing me
as a left-winger, as a Republican-hater, as a charter member of the
lying media cabal.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Now, they're my buddies. Now these same people are
calling to laud me for my judgment that President Clinton should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful. They're the mirror images of the Democratic
left-wingers who call to castigate me as a reactionary when I
oppose hate-crimes legislation and argue for parole reform to keep
violent criminals in jail longer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in journalism, not in partisan politics. I don't think that
either party has all the answers, and I don't think journalists
should be enrolled in political parties _ not even journalists in
special circumstances, like me, whose job is to express opinions
along with reporting news.
</P>
<P>
   That used to be the tradition in the military, too. Career
soldiers, in deference to the constitutional imperative that
military people remain subservient to civilian leadership, used to
stay completely out of partisan politics. Unless I'm mistaken, the
very first ballot that Dwight D. Eisenhower cast was a vote for
himself, after he retired from the army and ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   So no judgment I make on political issues is motivated by party
membership or loyalty. It's motivated by an examination of the
facts and my personal interpretation of their meaning. And my
interpretation of this mess in Washington is that Bill Clinton is
unfit for office. I believe, from my understanding of history and
constitutional scholarship, that the framers would have bounced him
for lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The lies, distortions and irrelevant distractions that have
surrounded this whole disaster are too numerous to examine here.
The only pertinent issue is whether Bill Clinton's perjury before
the grand jury is sufficient cause to throw him out.
</P>
<P>
   His more thoughtful backers say it isn't _ that presidential
impeachment is meant only to cleanse government after offenses
against the state and only when a majority of the public is willing
to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the framers were worried about a chief executive so
determined to have his own way that he ignored the law. They were
worried about a despot in the White House who, once elected, would
view himself as answerable to no one.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury is a felony, a serious crime _ a high crime by
definition. Given the nature of the president's oath _ to defend
the Constitution and to honor the democratically enacted law _
Clinton's decision to perjure himself at least once, and probably
twice, qualifies as a betrayal of the court system and a crime
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, too, that the framers created the Constitution as
a heavy anchor on raw democracy. It can't be altered by a
passionate but temporary majority. Instead, amending the
Constitution requires an overwhelming display of public sentiment
over an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   They fretted over the majority's momentary madness. And with
good reason, too.
</P>
<P>
   So is an election being overturned here? Not unless, somehow,
Bob Dole ends up as president. Al Gore will. We voted for him,
remember?
</P>
<P>
   Was Clinton set up? You bet. Are many of his enemies scary,
sanctimonious creeps? Yep. But once he perjured himself, did any of
that matter? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Clinton's crime weighs less than Richard Nixon's. But the
framers didn't intend Nixon's misconduct to become the minimal
standard for removal. And they didn't intend that perjury over
money would count, but not perjury over sex.
</P>
<P>
   It's inconceivable to me that James Madison, et al, could
countenance the continued service of a president whose sworn oath
on a Bible can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm with them.
</P>

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The year is 1977, when mood rings and
platform shoes are hot, and a soft-spoken president named Jimmy
Carter signs two very controversial treaties with his
pistol-packing friend from Panama, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties are a milestone in U.S.-Latin American relations,
requiring the United States to relinquish control of the Panama
Canal -- long a symbol of American domination and Yankee ingenuity
-- to Panama by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The historic signing sparks massive celebrations in this small,
but proud country, and so moves Torrijos -- the nationalist
strongman -- that he weeps like a baby on his wife's shoulder in
Carter's presence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the turn of the century seemed eons away.
</P>
<P>
   But now the sun is finally setting on this strategic outpost, a
presence the United States has enjoyed for 95 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Carter said emphatically that signing the
treaties was simply ``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honoring of our obligation to treat each other in
the hemisphere fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline fast approaching, the Pentagon has already
moved the U.S. Southern Command to Miami, and reduced the number of
U.S. troops here to about 4,300 -- down from roughly 10,000 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   By August, just 300 U.S. troops will remain, and then, only in
caretaker roles.
</P>
<P>
   But like a husband and wife headed for an amicable divorce, both
sides are suffering a rush of last-minute doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there are misgivings over whether Panama,
a small country with no military and only 2.8 million people, can
successfully oversee one of the world's most valuable waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must Panama maintain the canal's smooth operation, but
it must convert seven U.S. military bases -- housing everything
from schools to airports -- to private use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they have the capability to run it, but they'll
never be able to protect it from sabotage, which is my concern,''
said John Sweeney, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the Panamanians, for example, would never stand
up against leftist rebels in Colombia, a violence-plagued country
bordering Panama to the South.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics caution of rampant nepotism, fearing that the
canal could become a cash cow for financially strapped governments
and a jobs provider for whatever leader's in office.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Panama, where the transfer means long-sought
sovereignty, newspaper polls consistently reveal that a whopping 70
percent of the population supports a continued U.S. military
presence beyond the year 2000, particularly when the question is
framed in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has poured more than $300 million a year into
the local economy, and has provided more than 16,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Panama is a teenager whose daddy has been taking
care of everything,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, founding editor and
publisher of La Prensa, Panama's main daily newspaper. ``It's kind
of scary to go out on your own, but you eventually will get over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Panamanian who dreads the U.S. departure is Luis Pineda.
</P>
<P>
   A shoe-shine man, Pineda has worked in a shady spot on the army
base at Fort Clayton, which borders the canal, since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He earns $500 a month, or twice the salary of most Panamanian
professionals, shining boots for U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job has brought me a good life by buying me a new house
and putting my four children through school,'' said Pineda, 48.
``Without it, I'd be on the streets selling newspapers, washing
cars, or doing whatever I could find to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Panamanians work as maids, secretaries, and
groundskeepers. Still others own businesses, such as restaurants,
that count U.S. troops and their families among their best -- and
sometimes only -- customers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. flag has flown in Panama since 1903, when President
Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's separation from Colombia so
that the ``big ditch'' could be constructed. Over the next decade,
the United States completed the canal, one of the world's greatest
engineering marvels, at a cost of $400 million and thousands of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the United States stationed as many as
100,000 troops in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-mile-long canal is likened to a water ladder that permits
ships to be lifted, step by step, through three sets of locks to a
height of 85 feet, allowing them to pass from the Atlantic to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,100 ships traversed the canal last year, hauling an
estimated 4 percent of the world's goods.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the traffic, which generates $600 million in tolls
each year, moves toward, or from, the United States. The Panamanian
government derives $100 million in profits, while the remainder is
used for operation and maintenance of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a source of friction for decades, with Latin
American countries accusing the United States of heavy-handedness
when originally negotiating for control of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Torrijos dubbed the U.S. presence a
``colonialist tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carter acknowledges that signing the treaties was one of
the most unpopular moves he has ever had to make.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, countless critics -- former President Ronald Reagan
among them -- called it the giveaway of an important U.S. asset.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the treaties by just one vote, and only
after Torrijos threatened to blow up the canal locks if the United
States failed to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get letters every month, 20 years later, condemning me
for giving away the canal,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Carter chastises the U.S. government for not living
up to the spirit of the treaties.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that the United States has been slow in
relinquishing property.
</P>
<P>
   With just a year to go, the United States has yet to turn over
4,000 structures out of a total of 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse, Carter said, is that the United States has failed to
adequately clean up thousands of acres of mostly rainforest
surrounding the canal. The United States has used much of the area
as a testing ground for weapons, meaning it is contaminated with
unexploded grenades and other munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military says it will clean up 10,000 acres, but that
it can't clean up another nearly 8,000 acres of mostly mountainous
property -- covered with thick, dense jungle -- without seriously
impacting the character of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas, we'd have to bulldoze the trees, and the
(resulting) erosion would be horrendous,'' said U.S. Army Col.
David Hunt, the chief treaty implementation officer.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there are 56 species of animals living in the
forests that are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta who
helped negotiate the treaties, agrees that the United States hasn't
fulfilled its duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is suggesting we clean up everything, but can we do
better? The answer is yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Pastor and Carter say they have great confidence
in Panama's ability to run the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians themselves point out that, even with the United
States in charge, 94 of every 100 canal employees -- out of a work
force of 9,500 -- have been Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   And in preparation for the next century, the Panamanians already
have launched a $1 billion modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the canal's Gaillard Cut will be widened by the
year 2002 to accommodate two-way, unrestricted traffic 24 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ships must transit the narrow stretch one at a time,
and only in daylight hours, which causes time-costly traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   It takes eight hours for the average ship to transit the entire
canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our top priorities will be to develop the canal's
infrastructure so that it can be used to lure tourists here,'' said
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, director of the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, which is charged with overseeing the transfer of
properties. ``Each year, 300 cruise ships pass through the canal
but they don't stop because we don't have the facilities for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Panama plans to operate the canal more like a
private corporation than a government agency, and as such it has
already privatized ports and dry docks.
</P>
<P>
   But even this has drawn consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison Whampoa Group, a huge conglomerate based in Hong Kong,
now a part of China, won contracts to operate Panama's two biggest
ports, Balboa and Cristobal, which sit at each end of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that communist China will now be in a position
to delay U.S. warships from passing through.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Panamanian officials say these fears are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are laws that say the canal must be neutral,'' Hunt
said. ``There can't be any blockage of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian authorities insist the canal will be financially
independent and well-insulated from party politics.
</P>
<P>
   It will be run by the Panama Canal Authority, a board made up of
11 members appointed for staggered, nine-year terms so that it is
hard for any one president to pack with cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appointees have to be approved by the legislature in
Panama,'' said Mercedes Morris Garcia, the authority's spokeswoman.
``Panama has matured a tremendous amount socially and
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is so confident over the canal's future.
</P>
<P>
   One example often cited is the Panama Canal Railroad, which runs
the length of the canal between Panama City and Colon on the
Atlantic coast. Transferred to Panama in 1979, the railroad's
workforce quickly mushroomed from 117 to more than 500. Losing
money and lacking maintenance, the railroad was abandoned in
disrepair in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Kansas City Southern Railway Co. agreed to invest
$60 million to rebuild the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panamanians wanted to allow passengers to use the railroad
and it just didn't work for them,'' Hunt said. ``But Panamanians
are already managing the canal, and the technical expertise is
definitely there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the United States, including President Bill Clinton, had
hoped until recently to maintain a presence here beyond the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States negotiated for more than two years with Panama
to establish a multinational anti-narcotics center in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations broke down in September after the Americans
insisted on being able to mount military operations from Panama
unrelated to the anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The center would have been located at the Howard Air Force Base,
which has been the United States' principal airfield in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Now that base, which supports the bulk of the aircraft involved
in U.S. anti-drug efforts in South America, will shut down May 1.
</P>
<P>
   So, at least for now, it appears that Panama's confidence and
ability will be tested, whether critics like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer is a matter of national pride in Panama,'' Garcia
said. ``Panama will finally be the master of its own destiny.''

<P>
   BALBOA, Panama _ Sgt. Reginald Thomas will sorely miss this
place, with its barbecues, banyan trees, and balmy weather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, he has rarely ventured beyond the
comfortable confines of the U.S. Army base at Fort Clayton, just
north of this Pacific coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   And why should he?
</P>
<P>
   The all-American enclave boasts nightlife, tennis courts, a
movie theater, a bowling alley, appealing housing -- even
dirt-cheap boat rentals.
</P>
<P>
   But the base's days are numbered and Thomas must steel himself,
like thousands of other Americans, for relocation to another U.S.
base next year outside of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first overseas experience and it's been good,''
said Thomas, 27, of Atlanta. ``I would say everyone is pretty upset
about leaving here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, the United
States promised a gradual pullout from Panama, slowly relinquishing
pieces of the Canal Zone -- and eventually the canal itself -- by
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone was created in the early 1900s, when the United States
constructed the canal and wrangled permanent control of the
waterway, as well as a lush 10-mile parcel of land on either side
-- the Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Zone was inaccessible to Panamanians without
authorization. People born in the Zone were considered U.S.
citizens. Some lived their entire lives within the Zone, as did
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone's lone employer, besides the military, was the powerful
Panama Canal Company. It subsidized housing for Americans working
in Panama. It also boasted its own highly respected police force
and school system.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government controlled the Zone -- cordoned off by a
fence from the rest of Panama -- until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Zone no longer paid taxes to the United States
but it did bear the stamp of Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of backyard barbecues here every weekend,''
Thomas said. ``We also play a lot of basketball and do a lot of
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning, the Zone has been the jungle's very own
Mayberry, a place with virtually no crime or poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, red-roofed duplexes with air-conditioning -- a
rarity here -- stand alongside winding streets, with sidewalks,
that bear names such as Robinson Place and McIntosh Lane. American
flags adorn many of the roomy dwellings that sit on neat,
landscaped lawns filled with palm trees and iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three cars sit in each driveway. Spacious, well-groomed
parks -- and even Popeye's and McDonald's -- are close by.
</P>
<P>
   Residents employ Panamanian maids, play bingo at night, and
listen to American music at a pub-like bar called The Loop.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. pullout closes the curtain on this little slice of
Small Town, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Before the treaties, some 3,700 Zonians, as they're called here,
worked on the canal. But less than 500 American employees are left,
or 6 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more than 4,300 U.S. troops also remain here,
but that number will be reduced to about 300 by August, and will
dwindle to zero by next December.
</P>
<P>
   As goes the U.S. presence, so goes the Christmas tree sales by
the Boy Scouts and the hearty Thanksgiving dinners in the mess
halls. The military's ``Tropic Times'' newspaper will stop
publication, and the Southern Command Network will cease its daily
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Elks Club, the Little League, and the Knights of Columbus
are already long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wonderful place to bring up children,'' said
Maritza Pearce, who raised a son and a daughter on the base at Fort
Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my children grew up and left home, I had to warn them
about what it would be like on the outside,'' she said. ``They'd
been sheltered here and so I wanted them to know that the rest of
the world would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, some Panamanians have resented the American
bubble, which has contrasted so sharply with nearby neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the Panama Canal treaties
with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, was famous for having once
said: ``I don't want to enter the history books. I want to enter
the Canal Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, with Panamanians already in control of most of the
Zone, the area's manicured properties are a far cry from the
littered squalor that characterizes El Chorrillo, an unsafe,
pastel-colored tenement only a short drive away.
</P>
<P>
   In this crowded, impoverished neighborhood, children in torn
clothing play in streets that are strewn with broken glass and old
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, some 40 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on there won't be these little enclaves here that are
totally cut off from the rest of Panama, and I think people are
happy about that,'' said Mercedes Morris Garcia, spokeswoman for
the Panama Canal Authority, which will run the canal after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. pullout, Panama will inherit seven military bases
and 7,000 buildings -- everything from schools to churches -- in
the Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has grand plans for converting these properties to
civilian use in a way that reaps enormous economic benefits for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Panama hopes to become a banking, tourism, education, and
transportation hub, a destination for everyone from cruise ship
passengers to American graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Panama plans to convert Fort Clayton into a ``City
of Knowledge,'' a sort of American university on the canal that
uses the facilities of the military bases. The barracks, for
example, will become dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the first thing we want to do is build cruise ship
facilities on the Pacific and the Atlantic (coasts) with the hope
that 300,000 to 400,000 passengers on cruise ships will be coming
here within five years,'' said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, head of the
Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, which is responsible for the
assimilation of the Zone into Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some U.S. citizens plan to stay on in Panama beyond
1999, lured by amenities that have nothing to do with U.S.-style
perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be retiring here because I love it,'' said Col. David
Hunt, the chief treaty implementation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nights are cool, and in 45 minutes I can be at the
beach,'' he said. ``They really have it all here, from old ruins to
scuba diving.''

   Following is a chronology of events related to Panama and the
Panama Canal:
</P>
<P>
   1878 -- Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez
Canal, wins a concession to build another canal in what is now
Panama. But disease and jungles take their toll -- including nearly
20,000 lives -- and his company goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   1903 -- President Theodore Roosevelt engineers the separation of
Panama from Colombia so that a canal can be built. The Senate
approves a treaty that allows the United States to build the canal
and grants it ``all the rights'' within a new Panama Canal Zone
that it would possess ``if it were sovereign'' in that territory.
</P>
<P>
   1914 -- The canal opens after 10 years of work, during which
$400 million is spent.
</P>
<P>
   1964 -- Anti-American riots break out in Panama, killing three
Americans and 21 Panamanians. The negotiation of a new treaty
begins.
</P>
<P>
   1968 -- Gen. Omar Torrijos takes power in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   1977 -- Torrijos and U.S. President Jimmy Carter sign two
treaties: one dealing with the operation and transfer of the canal,
the other establishing the canal's ``permanent neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   1979 -- The treaties take effect.
</P>
<P>
   1981 -- Torrijos dies in a plane crash. Gen. Manuel Noriega
begins his ascent to power.
</P>
<P>
   1989 -- The United States invades Panama to overthrow Noriega.
He's taken to the United States and convicted on charges of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   1999 -- The U.S. transfer of all Panama Canal properties is to
be completed.

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The year is 1977, when mood rings and
platform shoes are hot, and a soft-spoken president named Jimmy
Carter signs two very controversial treaties with his
pistol-packing friend from Panama, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties are a milestone in U.S.-Latin American relations,
requiring the United States to relinquish control of the Panama
Canal -- long a symbol of American domination and Yankee ingenuity
-- to Panama by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The historic signing sparks massive celebrations in this small,
but proud country, and so moves Torrijos -- the nationalist
strongman -- that he weeps like a baby on his wife's shoulder in
Carter's presence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the turn of the century seemed eons away.
</P>
<P>
   But now the sun is finally setting on this strategic outpost, a
presence the United States has enjoyed for 95 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Carter said emphatically that signing the
treaties was simply ``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honoring of our obligation to treat each other in
the hemisphere fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline fast approaching, the Pentagon has already
moved the U.S. Southern Command to Miami, and reduced the number of
U.S. troops here to about 4,300 -- down from roughly 10,000 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   By August, just 300 U.S. troops will remain, and then, only in
caretaker roles.
</P>
<P>
   But like a husband and wife headed for an amicable divorce, both
sides are suffering a rush of last-minute doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there are misgivings over whether Panama,
a small country with no military and only 2.8 million people, can
successfully oversee one of the world's most valuable waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must Panama maintain the canal's smooth operation, but
it must convert seven U.S. military bases -- housing everything
from schools to airports -- to private use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they have the capability to run it, but they'll
never be able to protect it from sabotage, which is my concern,''
said John Sweeney, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the Panamanians, for example, would never stand
up against leftist rebels in Colombia, a violence-plagued country
bordering Panama to the South.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics caution of rampant nepotism, fearing that the
canal could become a cash cow for financially strapped governments
and a jobs provider for whatever leader's in office.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Panama, where the transfer means long-sought
sovereignty, newspaper polls consistently reveal that a whopping 70
percent of the population supports a continued U.S. military
presence beyond the year 2000, particularly when the question is
framed in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has poured more than $300 million a year into
the local economy, and has provided more than 16,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Panama is a teenager whose daddy has been taking
care of everything,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, founding editor and
publisher of La Prensa, Panama's main daily newspaper. ``It's kind
of scary to go out on your own, but you eventually will get over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Panamanian who dreads the U.S. departure is Luis Pineda.
</P>
<P>
   A shoe-shine man, Pineda has worked in a shady spot on the army
base at Fort Clayton, which borders the canal, since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He earns $500 a month, or twice the salary of most Panamanian
professionals, shining boots for U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job has brought me a good life by buying me a new house
and putting my four children through school,'' said Pineda, 48.
``Without it, I'd be on the streets selling newspapers, washing
cars, or doing whatever I could find to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Panamanians work as maids, secretaries, and
groundskeepers. Still others own businesses, such as restaurants,
that count U.S. troops and their families among their best -- and
sometimes only -- customers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. flag has flown in Panama since 1903, when President
Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's separation from Colombia so
that the ``big ditch'' could be constructed. Over the next decade,
the United States completed the canal, one of the world's greatest
engineering marvels, at a cost of $400 million and thousands of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the United States stationed as many as
100,000 troops in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-mile-long canal is likened to a water ladder that permits
ships to be lifted, step by step, through three sets of locks to a
height of 85 feet, allowing them to pass from the Atlantic to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,100 ships traversed the canal last year, hauling an
estimated 4 percent of the world's goods.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the traffic, which generates $600 million in tolls
each year, moves toward, or from, the United States. The Panamanian
government derives $100 million in profits, while the remainder is
used for operation and maintenance of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a source of friction for decades, with Latin
American countries accusing the United States of heavy-handedness
when originally negotiating for control of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Torrijos dubbed the U.S. presence a
``colonialist tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carter acknowledges that signing the treaties was one of
the most unpopular moves he has ever had to make.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, countless critics -- former President Ronald Reagan
among them -- called it the giveaway of an important U.S. asset.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the treaties by just one vote, and only
after Torrijos threatened to blow up the canal locks if the United
States failed to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get letters every month, 20 years later, condemning me
for giving away the canal,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Carter chastises the U.S. government for not living
up to the spirit of the treaties.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that the United States has been slow in
relinquishing property.
</P>
<P>
   With just a year to go, the United States has yet to turn over
4,000 structures out of a total of 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse, Carter said, is that the United States has failed to
adequately clean up thousands of acres of mostly rainforest
surrounding the canal. The United States has used much of the area
as a testing ground for weapons, meaning it is contaminated with
unexploded grenades and other munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military says it will clean up 10,000 acres, but that
it can't clean up another nearly 8,000 acres of mostly mountainous
property -- covered with thick, dense jungle -- without seriously
impacting the character of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas, we'd have to bulldoze the trees, and the
(resulting) erosion would be horrendous,'' said U.S. Army Col.
David Hunt, the chief treaty implementation officer.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there are 56 species of animals living in the
forests that are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta who
helped negotiate the treaties, agrees that the United States hasn't
fulfilled its duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is suggesting we clean up everything, but can we do
better? The answer is yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Pastor and Carter say they have great confidence
in Panama's ability to run the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians themselves point out that, even with the United
States in charge, 94 of every 100 canal employees -- out of a work
force of 9,500 -- have been Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   And in preparation for the next century, the Panamanians already
have launched a $1 billion modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the canal's Gaillard Cut will be widened by the
year 2002 to accommodate two-way, unrestricted traffic 24 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ships must transit the narrow stretch one at a time,
and only in daylight hours, which causes time-costly traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   It takes eight hours for the average ship to transit the entire
canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our top priorities will be to develop the canal's
infrastructure so that it can be used to lure tourists here,'' said
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, director of the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, which is charged with overseeing the transfer of
properties. ``Each year, 300 cruise ships pass through the canal
but they don't stop because we don't have the facilities for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Panama plans to operate the canal more like a
private corporation than a government agency, and as such it has
already privatized ports and dry docks.
</P>
<P>
   But even this has drawn consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison Whampoa Group, a huge conglomerate based in Hong Kong,
now a part of China, won contracts to operate Panama's two biggest
ports, Balboa and Cristobal, which sit at each end of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that communist China will now be in a position
to delay U.S. warships from passing through.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Panamanian officials say these fears are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are laws that say the canal must be neutral,'' Hunt
said. ``There can't be any blockage of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian authorities insist the canal will be financially
independent and well-insulated from party politics.
</P>
<P>
   It will be run by the Panama Canal Authority, a board made up of
11 members appointed for staggered, nine-year terms so that it is
hard for any one president to pack with cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appointees have to be approved by the legislature in
Panama,'' said Mercedes Morris Garcia, the authority's spokeswoman.
``Panama has matured a tremendous amount socially and
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is so confident over the canal's future.
</P>
<P>
   One example often cited is the Panama Canal Railroad, which runs
the length of the canal between Panama City and Colon on the
Atlantic coast. Transferred to Panama in 1979, the railroad's
workforce quickly mushroomed from 117 to more than 500. Losing
money and lacking maintenance, the railroad was abandoned in
disrepair in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Kansas City Southern Railway Co. agreed to invest
$60 million to rebuild the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panamanians wanted to allow passengers to use the railroad
and it just didn't work for them,'' Hunt said. ``But Panamanians
are already managing the canal, and the technical expertise is
definitely there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the United States, including President Bill Clinton, had
hoped until recently to maintain a presence here beyond the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States negotiated for more than two years with Panama
to establish a multinational anti-narcotics center in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations broke down in September after the Americans
insisted on being able to mount military operations from Panama
unrelated to the anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The center would have been located at the Howard Air Force Base,
which has been the United States' principal airfield in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Now that base, which supports the bulk of the aircraft involved
in U.S. anti-drug efforts in South America, will shut down May 1.
</P>
<P>
   So, at least for now, it appears that Panama's confidence and
ability will be tested, whether critics like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer is a matter of national pride in Panama,'' Garcia
said. ``Panama will finally be the master of its own destiny.''

   BALBOA, Panama _ Sgt. Reginald Thomas will sorely miss this
place, with its barbecues, banyan trees, and balmy weather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, he has rarely ventured beyond the
comfortable confines of the U.S. Army base at Fort Clayton, just
north of this Pacific coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   And why should he?
</P>
<P>
   The all-American enclave boasts nightlife, tennis courts, a
movie theater, a bowling alley, appealing housing -- even
dirt-cheap boat rentals.
</P>
<P>
   But the base's days are numbered and Thomas must steel himself,
like thousands of other Americans, for relocation to another U.S.
base next year outside of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first overseas experience and it's been good,''
said Thomas, 27, of Atlanta. ``I would say everyone is pretty upset
about leaving here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, the United
States promised a gradual pullout from Panama, slowly relinquishing
pieces of the Canal Zone -- and eventually the canal itself -- by
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone was created in the early 1900s, when the United States
constructed the canal and wrangled permanent control of the
waterway, as well as a lush 10-mile parcel of land on either side
-- the Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Zone was inaccessible to Panamanians without
authorization. People born in the Zone were considered U.S.
citizens. Some lived their entire lives within the Zone, as did
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone's lone employer, besides the military, was the powerful
Panama Canal Company. It subsidized housing for Americans working
in Panama. It also boasted its own highly respected police force
and school system.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government controlled the Zone -- cordoned off by a
fence from the rest of Panama -- until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Zone no longer paid taxes to the United States
but it did bear the stamp of Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of backyard barbecues here every weekend,''
Thomas said. ``We also play a lot of basketball and do a lot of
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning, the Zone has been the jungle's very own
Mayberry, a place with virtually no crime or poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, red-roofed duplexes with air-conditioning -- a
rarity here -- stand alongside winding streets, with sidewalks,
that bear names such as Robinson Place and McIntosh Lane. American
flags adorn many of the roomy dwellings that sit on neat,
landscaped lawns filled with palm trees and iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three cars sit in each driveway. Spacious, well-groomed
parks -- and even Popeye's and McDonald's -- are close by.
</P>
<P>
   Residents employ Panamanian maids, play bingo at night, and
listen to American music at a pub-like bar called The Loop.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. pullout closes the curtain on this little slice of
Small Town, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Before the treaties, some 3,700 Zonians, as they're called here,
worked on the canal. But less than 500 American employees are left,
or 6 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more than 4,300 U.S. troops also remain here,
but that number will be reduced to about 300 by August, and will
dwindle to zero by next December.
</P>
<P>
   As goes the U.S. presence, so goes the Christmas tree sales by
the Boy Scouts and the hearty Thanksgiving dinners in the mess
halls. The military's ``Tropic Times'' newspaper will stop
publication, and the Southern Command Network will cease its daily
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Elks Club, the Little League, and the Knights of Columbus
are already long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wonderful place to bring up children,'' said
Maritza Pearce, who raised a son and a daughter on the base at Fort
Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my children grew up and left home, I had to warn them
about what it would be like on the outside,'' she said. ``They'd
been sheltered here and so I wanted them to know that the rest of
the world would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, some Panamanians have resented the American
bubble, which has contrasted so sharply with nearby neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the Panama Canal treaties
with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, was famous for having once
said: ``I don't want to enter the history books. I want to enter
the Canal Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, with Panamanians already in control of most of the
Zone, the area's manicured properties are a far cry from the
littered squalor that characterizes El Chorrillo, an unsafe,
pastel-colored tenement only a short drive away.
</P>
<P>
   In this crowded, impoverished neighborhood, children in torn
clothing play in streets that are strewn with broken glass and old
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, some 40 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on there won't be these little enclaves here that are
totally cut off from the rest of Panama, and I think people are
happy about that,'' said Mercedes Morris Garcia, spokeswoman for
the Panama Canal Authority, which will run the canal after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. pullout, Panama will inherit seven military bases
and 7,000 buildings -- everything from schools to churches -- in
the Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has grand plans for converting these properties to
civilian use in a way that reaps enormous economic benefits for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Panama hopes to become a banking, tourism, education, and
transportation hub, a destination for everyone from cruise ship
passengers to American graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Panama plans to convert Fort Clayton into a ``City
of Knowledge,'' a sort of American university on the canal that
uses the facilities of the military bases. The barracks, for
example, will become dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the first thing we want to do is build cruise ship
facilities on the Pacific and the Atlantic (coasts) with the hope
that 300,000 to 400,000 passengers on cruise ships will be coming
here within five years,'' said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, head of the
Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, which is responsible for the
assimilation of the Zone into Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some U.S. citizens plan to stay on in Panama beyond
1999, lured by amenities that have nothing to do with U.S.-style
perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be retiring here because I love it,'' said Col. David
Hunt, the chief treaty implementation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nights are cool, and in 45 minutes I can be at the
beach,'' he said. ``They really have it all here, from old ruins to
scuba diving.''

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ With its money-making ditch, Panama has
long been the envy of its neighbors, particularly Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century after French engineer Philippe Bunau-Varilla
frantically persuaded the United States to take over a failed
French attempt to build a canal in Panama, Nicaragua's dreams for a
canal of its own still haven't died.
</P>
<P>
   And other countries, too, are offering fresh proposals to
challenge the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   But whether any of them fly remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could amass the kind of money that would
be needed to build a rival to the Panama Canal,'' said U.S. Army
Col. David Hunt, who is in charge of implementing the 1977 Panama
Canal treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Under these treaties, the United States must relinquish control
of the Panama Canal to Panama by Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But still fresh challenges abound, especially in Nicaragua which
has nearly twice the population of Panama but only a fourth of the
gross domestic product. They are galvanized by the continued growth
in canal traffic and by predictions that the Panama Canal could
reach capacity some time between 2010 and 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic through the Panama Canal is expected to increase by 2 to
3 percent a year over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One group, Canal Interoceanic de Nicaragua, or CINN, has been
hatching a plan for a so-called ``dry'' canal since 1995, and it
recently submitted viability studies for the proposal to the
Nicaraguan government.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to rule on the idea by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, CINN would head a private consortium, led by U.S.
financier Don Bosco, that would have to pay the staggering cost of
more than $2.3 billion to build two new ports and a railway across
the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind dry canals is this: ports are constructed so
that containers can be shifted to train or road and then
transported across land to a waiting ship on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   All the plans seek to divert traffic from the Panama Canal,
which reaped $600 million in tolls over the past year from more
than 13,100 ships.
</P>
<P>
   To remain competitive against future rivals, the Panamanians
have launched a $1 billion modernization program that's designed to
widen the narrow Gaillard Cut -- where the canal was carved through
the Continental Divide -- which should increase the canal's
capacity by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The widening, which will permit two-way, unrestricted traffic,
will be completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we possibly can to increase capacity
so that we do not reach the saturation point,'' said Mercedes
Morris Garcia, spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Authority, which
will run the canal after next year. ``We are committed to running
the canal efficiently and to making the canal competitive in the
next century.''

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ With its money-making ditch, Panama has
long been the envy of its neighbors, particularly Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century after French engineer Philippe Bunau-Varilla
frantically persuaded the United States to take over a failed
French attempt to build a canal in Panama, Nicaragua's dreams for a
canal of its own still haven't died.
</P>
<P>
   And other countries, too, are offering fresh proposals to
challenge the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   But whether any of them fly remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could amass the kind of money that would
be needed to build a rival to the Panama Canal,'' said U.S. Army
Col. David Hunt, who is in charge of implementing the 1977 Panama
Canal treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Under these treaties, the United States must relinquish control
of the Panama Canal to Panama by Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But still fresh challenges abound, especially in Nicaragua which
has nearly twice the population of Panama but only a fourth of the
gross domestic product. They are galvanized by the continued growth
in canal traffic and by predictions that the Panama Canal could
reach capacity some time between 2010 and 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic through the Panama Canal is expected to increase by 2 to
3 percent a year over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One group, Canal Interoceanic de Nicaragua, or CINN, has been
hatching a plan for a so-called ``dry'' canal since 1995, and it
recently submitted viability studies for the proposal to the
Nicaraguan government.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to rule on the idea by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, CINN would head a private consortium, led by U.S.
financier Don Bosco, that would have to pay the staggering cost of
more than $2.3 billion to build two new ports and a railway across
the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind dry canals is this: ports are constructed so
that containers can be shifted to train or road and then
transported across land to a waiting ship on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   All the plans seek to divert traffic from the Panama Canal,
which reaped $600 million in tolls over the past year from more
than 13,100 ships.
</P>
<P>
   To remain competitive against future rivals, the Panamanians
have launched a $1 billion modernization program that's designed to
widen the narrow Gaillard Cut -- where the canal was carved through
the Continental Divide -- which should increase the canal's
capacity by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The widening, which will permit two-way, unrestricted traffic,
will be completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we possibly can to increase capacity
so that we do not reach the saturation point,'' said Mercedes
Morris Garcia, spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Authority, which
will run the canal after next year. ``We are committed to running
the canal efficiently and to making the canal competitive in the
next century.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHO IS THE REAL DESERT FOX?
 &HT;    Eds: Due to rapid news developments, Andrew Glass's Sunday
column is moving this week for immediate release.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to Iraq and impeachment, the
wag-the-Buddy theories aired on Capitol Hill and abroad miss the
point. It's that Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton enable each other.
The rocks in Saddam's head fit the holes in Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's actions solicited a deadly rain of American missiles.
His aim was to dissolve the coalition that has been aligned against
him since before the Persian Gulf war, and thus change the stalled
calculus that has rendered oil-rich Iraq the poor pariah of the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   By gaming his moves beyond the next CNN live report, Saddam has
shown himself to be a true Desert Fox, as the air campaign against
him has been dubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's plan seems to be working. Russia, China and France
remain furious over what the United States and Britain have done,
particularly the autonomous way in which Washington and London
acted.
</P>
<P>
   From a tactical point of view, there's merit in disabusing
Saddam of his long-term hope of leading Arab armies into Israel.
But Americans still need to pay heed to their long-term interests
around the world, which are not necessarily served by dropping
smart bombs and passing resolutions of praise for the brave fliers
whom Clinton has put in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam stayed Clinton's trigger finger by letting United
Nations inspectors return in mid-November, he knew the Americans
would revoke his parole if he stepped out of line. But Saddam, by
his actions, still issued an invitation for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knew that Saddam knew. That's why planning for Desert
Fox began weeks ago. The U.N. report that Saddam had again strayed
from his box may have caught the impeachment-bound Congress
unawares. But the president had put that card into his own game
long before the press and most other folks realized it was in his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   In bombing Iraq, Clinton hasn't lifted the threatened shame of a
scarlet ``I'' stamped into his record. His critics believe that if
he lied about Monica and Paula, he could be lying as well about the
Beast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton has shown himself to be bit of a fox too,
although not in the same league as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the
original Desert Fox, who led the German Afrika Corps in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Clinton is engaged in a delicate game: how to
portray himself as a victim of a partisan witch hunt while finding
the few Republican votes he needs in the Senate in January (along
with those of nearly all the Democrats) to abort the risk and
further shame of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   When the Desert Fox became implicated in the failed plot to kill
Adolf Hitler and end the war, his first thought was the need to
protect his wife and family. To do so, Rommel swallowed a poison
pill on Oct. 13, 1944. He was buried with the highest military
honors that the crumbling Nazi state could muster.
</P>
<P>
   It's an outcome that probably didn't occur to the military
planners who were so self-consciously unmindful of the president's
predicament before Congress when they chose to call their action
``Operation Desert Fox.''

UTILITY BLAMES SAN FRANCISCO OUTAGE ON WORK CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK and ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pacific Gas and Electric workers who caused
a massive blackout in the San Francisco area on Dec. 8 ignored
three required safety procedures that could have averted the
outage, a senior utility executive said.
</P>
<P>
   E. James Macias, a senior vice president of PG&AMP;E, said Wednesday
the utility was investigating to find out ``how we can have that
many controls in place and still have everything go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackout was caused when the crew working at the PG&AMP;E
substation in San Mateo failed to remove a ground line before
reconnecting the power.
</P>
<P>
   Macias said company rules require a ``supervisory review''
before undertaking the process, a checklist of exactly what the
crew is supposed to do before turning the power back on, and the
presence of an observer while the work is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Macias said, the review did not take place, the
checklist was not followed and there was no observer on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 18 ground lines were left connected when the power was
switched on. The power surged through the lines into the ground,
creating an electrical fault that shut down power to about a
million people for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Macias said PG&AMP;E has installed a second protective system
designed to avoid a similar problem if the situation were to
reoccur at the San Mateo transmission station. It has also added
workers, both in San Mateo and at other stations.
</P>
<P>
   A system designed to keep the power loss from spreading and
knocking out other substations did not function.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protective system did not work, and we don't know why _
whether it was human error and it was not turned on, or something
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a study of the incident showed that about one-fourth of
a second after the power was turned on, the closest substations
were already starting to shut down. Half a second later, Macias
said, there was a small explosion that caused oscillation of
electricity through the system ``like a rubber band,'' and caused
the shutdown, which spread to two San Francisco generation plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tripped off to protect themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Macias said the utility was investigating to determine whether
there was a mechanical or electrical failure in the system,
although no such failure has been detected.
</P>
<P>
   The incident cut power to hospitals, commuter trains and dozens
of buildings in the Financial District. Traffic lights stopped
working, and a 75-year-old woman died when she was hit by a
tractor-trailer rig while trying to cross a street. Dozens of
people were caught in elevators. And hordes of displaced downtown
workers crowded street corners as business came to a standstill.

FOUND IN OHIO: THAT `YOU'VE GOT MAIL!' GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a deep and resonant voice, pleasant enough but ever so
slightly affected. It's not exactly James Earl Jones, but more
along the lines of Ted Baxter in the old ``Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
And it's vaguely familiar, the kind of distinctive sound that makes
you think, ``Have I met this guy before?''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you haven't met Elwood Edwards, whose Dickensian
name is as memorable as his voice. Unless, perhaps, you've wandered
through the booming metropolis of Orrville, Ohio, where he lives
with his wife, Karen. But you may be one of the 14 million
subscribers who hear his voice all the time on America Online. He's
the ``Welcome. You've got mail!'' man, the guy behind the
relentlessly perky greeting the on-line service has used since
1989. He's also the voice of ``File's done'' and the inevitable
log-off, ``Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are icons and there are icons. Elvis and Einstein are
big icons; Elwood Edwards is a ``Jeopardy'' question icon, a nice
man who unwittingly became the voice of the biggest on-line service
provider in the business. He never applied for the job of the
mailman; he never asked to extend the welcome mat. It just worked
out that way. Back in September 1986, he was a broadcast announcer
in the Washington area; out of curiosity, he bought his first
computer, a Commodore 64, which is now a museum relic. The computer
came with software called Q-Link, which was the on-line service of
Quantum Computer Services (which later became AOL). He decided to
check it out and ended up in a chat room for Christians. ``I
received an on-line message from KarenJ2, and it simply said,
`We're almost neighbors.' '' He lived in Gaithersburg, Md.; she
lived in Fairfax, Va. ``It was just friendly conversation, and we
chatted on line every once in a while over the next few months,''
says Edwards, 49.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberbuddies eventually met for dinner. ``It was July 6th of
1987,'' the man with the voice recalls. They got married the next
year. At the time, Karen was working in Quantum's customer services
department, and one day, she overheard AOL founder Steve Case and a
few programmers discussing adding a voice to the service. ``She
said, `Why don't you try El? He's a broadcaster.' '' Try him they
did. Edwards recorded the four phrases on a cassette recorder, and
they've been using those simple recordings ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm the mailman, always bringing good news,''
he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He's not employed by AOL, never has been. He allows that he has
received compensation for his voice, which the company says is
heard 27 million times a day. ``I'll go so far as to say that my
relationship with AOL is very satisfactory,'' he admits, ``but I
don't elaborate any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most AOL members tend to think the voice is computer-generated,
but that's likely to change soon. The ``Welcome'' man is heard
repeatedly in the upcoming film, ``You've Got Mail,'' a sort of
cyber love story starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Edwards hopes to
generate interest for the voice-over business he runs out of his
home after the film is released. (You can see his photograph and
hear ``the voice'' at his Web site, members.aol.com/voicepro.)
</P>
<P>
   A silver-haired, bespectacled man who stands at 6-foot-6,
Edwards has been in the broadcast business since he was a teenager
in North Carolina. ``I made a pest of myself at the local radio
station,'' he recalls. ``I had fallen in love with the idea of
being a DJ, and the people at the radio station figured, `If we
don't do something with this kid, he'll never stop hounding us.' I
became a DJ back then.''
</P>
<P>
   He's worked steadily in both television and radio announcing,
selling products, that sort of thing. He's not exactly recognized
every day for his quirky contribution to on-line lore: ``I don't
walk around saying, `You've got mail,' '' he notes. His wife,
however, will tell anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will be talking about the mailman in the chat
rooms on AOL, and women will say they've had a crush on `that
little man' for years,'' says Karen, whose own voice comes out an
octave higher than her husband's, with a distinct drawl. ``I pop up
and say, `That little man is 6-foot-6.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Edwardses are certainly one of the first _ if not the first
_ married couples to have met in an on-line chat room, which is a
small claim to fame. Were they a tad nervous about meeting in
person? ``I was a lot nervous,'' Karen says. ``I almost didn't show
up. My friends thought I was crazy and said he could have been an
ax murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just the mailman, though, even though he hasn't written a
postal letter in quite a few years. ``I like to think I have a
friendly voice and it doesn't grow old,'' he says, before
delivering that oh, so familiar sign-off. You know how it goes,
deep with a slightly lower tone on the second syllable:
``Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 20, Sage Weil is another aspiring DJ, but not on the radio;
he just likes spinning at parties and raves in his spare time. Like
Edwards, he's a bit of an icon in the on-line world, a community
where a simple idea can reach millions. Weil invented the Webring,
an alternative to search engines or hubs that enables users to
navigate the Web through rings of themed sites hooked together in a
virtual circle.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, Weil was a high school junior in Ashland, Ore. A
computer user since the fourth grade, he started his own Web site _
``mostly ranting and raving'' _ and linked it manually to sites
launched by his friends. In August of that summer, he was visiting
his father in Northern California; ``I was bored, so I wrote a CGI
(common gateway interface) script'' that enables webmasters to hook
their sites together in a ring. By clicking on hypertext links at
the bottom of the page, users can jump to the next site in the ring
or choose a random site or obtain a list of the next five sites.
Weil then started a site called Webring.org and offered to share
the technology with anyone who asked. Soon after, a ring of
English-as-a-second-language sites was launched.
</P>
<P>
   This young man's idea, born of boredom, has enjoyed meteoric
growth.  &UR; Today &LR; , there are 70,000 rings linking 981,000 Web sites;
the rings specialize in everything from mermaids to museums, from
Winnie the Pooh to Scooby Doo. Last year, Webring was sold to
Starseed, Inc., and last week, Starseed merged with Geocities, the
burgeoning on-line community. Weil, now a junior majoring in
computer science at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., made
a sizable chunk of change on the deal. But he doesn't like to dwell
on that: ``It's not something I really like to attach to myself,''
he says. ``The Geocities merger was a big distraction, and now
we're focusing on developing the system to give the user what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil remains committed to his original notion of sharing the
Webring software and allowing everyone to start their own rings on
their own terms, free of censorship and advertisements. The pop-up
windows that are a constant annoyance on Geo- &QC; 
cities will not automatically appear on rings listed on Webring.
``That's an annoying issue because everyone keeps asking about
that,'' Weil says. ``We let the ringmasters have complete control.
They can let in whoever they want.'' Webring doesn't censor its
sites and enables anyone to participate for free. It also has a
search engine of its own that provides links to thousands of rings
organized by myriad topics.
</P>
<P>
   Weil didn't have to go to college to land a job, but he seems
utterly unimpressed with the glittery trappings that come with
unexpected success. ``It depends on what you're after,'' he says.
``If all you want is a salary, that's fine. But I'm actually
interested in learning something.'' What's next for the lord of the
rings? ``I have no idea. Right now I'm bogged down in finals, but
after that I'll do whatever inspires me, I guess.''

CHILLS STILL GIVE A THRILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   I take it as a matter of personal pride that, as my aging
friends talk more and more wistfully of retiring to Florida and
Arizona, their southbound train leaves me at the station.
</P>
<P>
   I am the guy in the black-and-white Ray Milland movie . . .
train station in the snow, topcoat collar pulled up and fedora
pulled down against the ferociously swirling snow . . . the big
steam engine begins chuff-chuffing away, perhaps to Florida,
leaving me, after goodbyes, wading back into my snow world.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe early season snow is some kind of blessing,
but after the holiday season a pain. This is the extreme of the
mental aging process that clocks itself backwards over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Snow at Easter may seem a little unreasonable to a child ready
to get on with bicycles and baseball down in the flatlands. But
right up to Easter is fine, a whole season of the stuff refreshing
itself storm after storm.
</P>
<P>
   Adults don't often feel that way, though skiing families are
always happy to have a late-season blizzard up in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But as people grow away from childhood, snowstorms can cease
right after February vacation, thanks, and real hidebound grownups
want it gone after Christmas. Snow, that white silent blessing,
becomes for them mere window dressing for a short and increasingly
tacky commercial season.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm with those who believe that the migration to the Sun
Belt raises the average level of intelligence on both ends. When
you stop to realize that the best use of time for such people is
playing golf, well, you know . . . no need to say any more than
that about the snow-haters.
</P>
<P>
   These folks should figure out at some point that as their wish
to retire to the sunny south increases with age, the state of
Florida itself has become a manifestation of some geriatic
disorder. For confirmation of this, head straight over to the
pavilion at the public beach in Naples and eavesdrop on the
octogenarians arguing over their bets at the dog track. The scene
is straight out of ``Seinfeld''.
</P>
<P>
   My brother-in-law who lives in Florida, an inveterate
six-hours-per-day watcher of the Weather Channel, likes to call
when things get bad. To him bad begins here around late September
when the mean temperature drops below 60 degrees. And
frost-on-the-pumpkin season gets him shaking his head wondering why
anyone at all is left back in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he calls us in the height of a blizzard, or just
afterwards. He'll talk about everything but the weather _ kids,
cars, the effect of NAFTA on foreign goods. Then will come that
silence. All you snow-country folks with southern relatives know
the one I mean. And into the silence then will come that tentative
_ cute, maybe _ insinuatingly mousy question: ``So, how's the
weather up there?''
</P>
<P>
   With a robust roar I tell him: ``The weather is absolutely
gorgeous. New snow's piled 2 feet against the garage. The sun came
out after the storm and the snow just glitters. I just got back
from a nice cross-country ski in the woods. It's beautiful up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And he'll say: ``You can have it. I'll give you about five more
years and you'll be asking me to send the real estate section from
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not argue any more. I do not want to sound like a guy who
buys a dog of a car and spends the next three years talking about
what a beauty she is. Starts every morning. Good heater. Radio.
Rides like a magic carpet.
</P>
<P>
   No, let the snow-haters think what they want. I don't have any
New England real estate to sell them, and I certainly have the
decency not to call down there to ask how the drought's going.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the snow, and the world of winter that we in the
north country deal with, each in our own way. I honestly do not
know if I would love winter as much were I not a skier, or even _
heaven help us _ a golfer awaiting the opening of the links in
spring.
</P>
<P>
   My sailing friends who do not ski cuss snow for four months,
then go down for a Caribbean vacation to bridge them through. All
of which is wonderful stuff, but after a couple of weeks of a
warm-country vacation, get me back to the land of the long blue
shadows and nights of ringing cold that polishes the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Get me to the Vermont woods on a pair of snowshoes during a
storm when the wind makes the hardwoods rub together and groan
overhead, new snow coming so thick it seems to froth up out of the
earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the predictions of medical science are anywhere near
accurate, and the human life span elongates enough, I just may well
get old enough to want to lie on a Florida beach in January. When
I'm about 173 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, snow . . . bring it on.

SHAHEEN HOLDS KEY TO PRESIDENTIAL BIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ They are wooing Jeanne Shaheen, not with
chocolates or with roses, but with cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, gave
the Democratic governor $50,000 for her reelection this year.
Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey sent $30,000. Senator John F. Kerry
took her out to lunch and threw her an elegant fund-raising bash at
his Louisburg Square home.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Vice President Al Gore has steered $91.7
million of federal grants to New Hampshire over 1998, frequently
delivering the good news in person. And he was planning another
visit this week, until the impeachment crisis crested in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for Shaheen, the popular leader of the
first-in-the-nation primary state. Every Democratic politician who
is even remotely thinking about running for president is courting
her, and with reason.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire governors have a long history of choosing a
favorite presidential candidate and lending support, organization,
contacts and guidance with winning results. Republican Governor
Sherman Adams almost single-handedly won the New Hampshire primary
for General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, mounting a successful
write-in campaign even though Eisenhower never set foot in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Adams went on to become White House chief of staff. So, too, did
John H. Sununu, the Republican governor who orchestrated Vice
President George Bush's primary victory in 1998, providing the
momentum to grab the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen already boasts a prescient track record. Though she
backed Kerrey's unsuccessful bid in 1992, she was instrumental in
helping a little-known Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the
primary in 1976. And she ran another dark horse candidate's primary
bid in 1984. His name was Gary Hart, and he won New Hampshire,
upsetting the heavy favorite, Vice President Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has power, she's enormously popular, Democrats across the
board respect her and like her,'' said Jeff Woodburn, the outgoing
chairman of the state Democratic Party. ``If she decides to get
behind somebody, he'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, praise for Shaheen and acknowledgement of her skill and
power run along bipartisan lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a state that only has five full-time political
officeholders _ and four of them live in Washington _ she's the
biggest and only game in town,'' said Thomas Rath, a Republican
adviser to Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee who is
busy competing for the support of GOP Senator Judd Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting down for an recent interview before she rushed through a
light snow to catch a flight to Washington, Shaheen insisted she
has made no decisions about the 2000 presidential campaign. Right
now, she said, she is focused on resolving the thorny
education-finance issue that plagues the state, putting together
the biennial state budget, and getting inaugurated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom, however, puts Shaheen with Gore, and has
Gore stamping out the competition in the Democratic primary.
Evidence that she leans toward Gore could be gleaned from her
choice of political consultants and the decisions of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants Mandy Grunwald and Marla Romash work for
both Shaheen and the vice president. Three friends sponsoring
Shaheen's inaugural are with Gore, one of her two finance co-chairs
is with Gore, and key political allies in the House and Senate have
already committed to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen's past choices indicate a willingness to sign up
with lesser known candidates. And her 1992 choice for president,
Kerrey, may be running again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things my involvement in presidential
politics in the primary here has taught me is that there is no
conventional wisdom about what will happen,'' she said, brushing
off the notion that she has already made up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, predictions about what New Hampshire voters will do are
often wrong. Shaheen said she remembers reading Time magazine in
January of 1984 when she was running Hart's campaign. Mondale's
name was on the cover, and the piece said the Mondale train was
leaving the station and that people should hurry up and get on
board, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than a month later, Hart won the New Hampshire primary,''
Shaheen said. ``It turned the race upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, more than a year before a single person casts a vote in
the primary, Shaheen is benefiting from all of the attention.
National Democrats flocked to the state to help Shaheen get
reelected and to help the Democratic Party take control of the
state Senate for the first time since 1912.
</P>
<P>
   From Gephardt to Kerrey to Gore, Democrats contributed to
Shaheen's campaign coffers, held fund-raisers, and spoke up on her
behalf. And she admits that the money will influence her decision
when she picks a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I think it's a factor,'' she said. ``You always want
to help the people who have helped you. It's a little different
problem when you have a bunch of people help you.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people want to be in her good graces that when Shaheen
needs something from the federal government for her state, she has
many well-placed friends to turn to. There are the ``friends'' in
Congress, such as Gephardt, Kerrey, Kerry, and Paul Wellstone, the
Minnesota senator. There is the all-Republican New Hampshire
delegation. And, of course, there is the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a whole apparatus set up to help the state,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a governor's endorsement does not always work.
Stephen Merrill, the former Republican governor, spent months
soaking up the flattery from Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Steve Forbes,
Patrick Buchanan and Alexander back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Merrill pinned himself to Dole, criss-crossing the
state on behalf of the crusty Kansan. But he said he watched in
dismay as voters stubbornly insisted on going their own way,
spurning Merrill's choice in favor of Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched people interviewed on television saying, `I
appreciate where Governor Merrill is in this race, and I'm going to
make up my own mind like Governor Merrill would want me to,' '' he
said, laughing at the memory.

 &HT;    ANTI-IMPEACHMENT FORCES CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED
 &HT;    EDS: This story, which originally moved late Wednesday, is being
updated for Friday publication for all needing.
 &HT;    630 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a postponed but still-looming vote in the
House of Representatives, stunned Democrats are puzzling over the
revival of an impeachment effort they thought they'd snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the outnumbered pro-impeachment forces had steadily
gained momentum. But where were the labor unions and the rest of
President Clinton's political base? Where were the Wall Street
financiers and business leaders to warn against the uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute flurry of activity from Democratic allies,
many of Clinton's champions were barely visible for the past five
weeks, as momentum gained for impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was almost disbelief that this was actually going to get
to this level,'' said Naomi Walker, spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO.
The labor organization had suspended its stop-impeachment efforts
after the Nov. 3 elections in which Republicans unexpectedly lost
seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought (Republicans) had heard what they said in
November'' and would give up on impeaching Clinton, Walker said.
The unions have hurriedly reassembled a lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street and in corporate America, the silence has been
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a former Wall Street investment
banker, has made no apparent attempt to whip up concerns about the
economic effects of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the underlying economy, which is in the long run
what drives markets ... I think the most likely scenario is still
to look forward to solid growth and low inflation,'' he said
Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have business leaders expressed a general concern about
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a business issue,'' said Frank Coleman,
spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said his members,
instead of viewing it as an economic question, are asking, ``Do we
really want to do this?'' and ``Don't we want to draw the line
somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's admitted misconduct also has been a factor. It
has sapped some of the enthusiasm from defenders, according to
longtime Clinton ally, Will Marshall, president of the Progressive
Policy Institute. The research group is an off-shoot of the
moderate Democratic Leadership Council that Clinton helped found
and has been a strong policy partner of this White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of people have rallied behind the president and
defended him over the course of the last year,'' Marshall said.
``And many of them felt burned when he, in the end, was forced to
admit what had happened'' in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said ``most people think he acted deplorably,'' and he
added many Democrats have therefore shifted their focus from
Clinton himself to defending ``the results of a democratic
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had the steady backing of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson led a prayer vigil-turned-rally that drew
an estimated 2,000 to the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, the day the
impeachment date originally was scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defenders, many of whom sported labor union jackets,
carried anti-impeachment signs at the rally, and when a speaker
asked the crowd if the president should be impeached, the group
shouted, ``Never!''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson has not been highly visible in the Clinton defense
in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, our presence will have made a statement,'' Jackson
said in calling for the 11th-hour vigil. ``If we lose the vote, at
least we were witnesses to this action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Hollywood supporters also waited until the last
minute, when the battle appeared to be lost. Barbra Streisand and
Jack Nicholson were headliners at a star-studded rally Wednesday in
Los Angeles. But by then, the undecided lawmakers were already
lining up in Washington to announce they would vote for
impeachment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my little girls wants a microscope for Christmas. She's
liable to end up with two, thanks to my stupid approach to on-line
shopping. Look upon my folly, and beware.
</P>
<P>
   Locating an Internet shopping site that sells microscopes isn't
a problem. Plenty of on-line retailers carry them. I quickly found
one at eToys (http://www.etoys.com), a clean, well-designed site
with lots of Christmas booty. But after filling up an electronic
shopping cart with the microscope and several other items, I held
off on buying, in order to do a bit more research.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I'd decided to close the deal, eToys was fresh out
of microscopes. Frustrating, yes, but also convenient. The eToys
site is linked directly to its inventory system, so when it runs
out of something, shoppers find out immediately, and can start
looking elsewhere. Many other on-line stores keep on selling
product long after they've run out. It may be a day or two before
you're told the goodies are not on their way.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, for instance, ordered some educational software from
the ebWorld site (http://www.ebworld.com), which is run by the
well-known Electronics Boutique retail chain. A day later, it
e-mailed him to say that the software was sold out, and would he
mind waiting for them to backorder it? At another time, perhaps,
but not 10 days before Christmas. The boss is now waiting to see
how long it takes ebWorld to cancel his order.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I placed my truncated order with eToys, then began a
search for the missing microscope. Any of the major Internet search
engines will serve; indeed, most of them have separate listings of
on-line retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping area of the Yahoo search service listed a retailer
in Ohio who sold an appealing microscope for children. I'd never
heard of the retailer before--just some small Midwestern company
that had hustled itself onto the Internet. But what of it? When
you're rushing to make newspaper deadlines and play Santa, there's
a temptation to buy from the first shopkeeper you see.
</P>
<P>
   I placed the order, but my Microsoft Web browser crashed right
at the end of the transaction--go ahead, laugh. This small disaster
left behind a residue of uncertainty. Did the deal go down, or not?
A call was made to the merchant's toll-free number and was shunted
to a voice mail system, which announced that it was accepting no
messages, because the mailbox was full. A day later, it's still
full. So we have a merchant who can't be bothered to answer its
phones. Or its e-mail, for that matter--I tried that too, with no
results.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go back to Yahoo and demand satisfaction from one of
their listed merchants? Because Yahoo explicitly warns customers
that they take no responsibility for the stores they list. Other
Web sites, such as Excite, offer a listing of certified retailers.
Buy from them, and Excite pledges you'll be satisfied. But Yahoo
leaves its customers twisting in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo makes no secret of its retail policies, and it was my
fault for ignoring them. And the retailer may be an honest outfit
swamped by Christmas orders. My order could be on the way right
now. Trouble is, I have no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd done my homework before ordering, I'd have noticed that
the merchant doesn't seem to belong to any of the various
consumer-protection groups now watchdogging the on-line shopping
business. There's the Better Business Bureau's BBBOnline
certification, for instance, or the consumer privacy seal of
approval offered by TrustE. These are signs of a trustworthy
outfit. Or I could have shopped on a Web site or on-line service
that guarantees satisfaction. The America Online shopping network
offers ironclad guarantees; if one of its merchants don't come
through, AOL promises to back you up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I got careless, and with Christmas eight days away, my
blunders won't come cheap. I must hunt up another microscope,
either on line or in person at some crowded mall. There's a chance
that my little darling will wind up with two microscopes. Maybe she
and her sister will open a pathology lab, to help pay for college.
That'd be some comfort to their old man, an Internet veteran who
misplaced all his hard-won savvy just in time for Christmas.

SINGING THE RIO BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weighing just 4.4 ounces with its stereo earphones and AA
battery, the Rio PMP300 is nevertheless a force to be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough to fit comfortably in your hand, the Rio looks like
a Walkman. But instead of using cassette tape, the Rio has a
computer chip. It plays digital music that you can record yourself
or download over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio is the first piece of consumer electronics equipment to
play music compressed with the MP3 system. Over the last six months
MP3 has become a recording industry phenomenon. There are literally
thousands of computers on the Internet that are filled with pirate
copies of MP3-encoded songs --- most of them in college dorm rooms.
Yet at the same time there are a growing number of legitimate Web
sites that are selling licensed MP3 songs --- goodnoise.com sells
singles for 99 cents a track --- with royalties going to the
artists. Meanwhile, a growing number of bands have realized that
giving music way on the Internet is a good way to promote their
live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 players terrify the recording industry. That's because once
you download an MP3 file, there's nothing that prevents you from
e-mailing the song to a friend. Unlike cassette tapes, computers
make perfect digital copies of MP3 files. And each MP3 file is
untraceable: there is no way to tell who was responsible for the
original copyright violation (if there was one in the first place).
</P>
<P>
   What the Rio lets you do is to take these MP3 songs, put them in
your pocket, and listen to them wherever you go. The Rio connects
to your computer through the parallel port and comes with a cable,
earphones, and even a AA battery, which reportedly lasts 14 hours.
The unit comes with 32 megabytes of memory, enough to hold 6 or 12
songs, depending on whether the MP3s are compressed to allegedly CD
quality or near-CD quality. There's also a slot on the bottom of
the device that let's you expand the Rio's memory using standard
compact flash cards, the kind that are getting popular on digital
cameras. Diamond sells a 16 megabyte 3.3 Volt memory card for
$49.95; you can find 48 megabyte cards on the Internet for about
$200, and they should work with the device. Given trends, these
prices will only go down.
</P>
<P>
   What I find the most disappointing about the Rio is not what it
does, but what it doesn't do. It would have been really neat if the
unit displayed the name of the song being played, rather than just
the track number and the number of seconds into the song. I wish
the fast-forward and rewind features let you hear the music as it
drifted by. I wish it had a built-in stop-watch, so that the Rio
could be used as a sports Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   As far as portable music machines go, in fact, the Rio has is
pretty average. Since it's solid-state, it can't skip. The Rio has
buttons that let you skip forward or backwards in the playlist or
play the songs in random order. It has a special intro mode that
plays the first 10 seconds of each song. It has volume buttons and
four equalizer settings: Jazz, Rock, Classical, and Normal. The
only way to record is by using your desktop or laptop computer and
then downloading the music into the device.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this doesn't compare favorably with my new my Sony
MiniDisc Walkman. It weighs 7 ounces, it doesn't skip either, and
holds 74 minutes of music. Perhaps more important, I can record
with it. While the MiniDisc it costs about $100 more than the Rio,
you can buy MiniDiscs for $5 a piece --- much cheaper than a memory
card. And you can still download MP3s from the Internet, you just
have to take the extra step of recording them yourself onto disc.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with two programs that that run on Windows 95
(sorry Macintosh fans). The first is the Rio control program, which
lets you download MP3 files into the system. The second is Music
Match, a program that lets you take tracks off your own CDs and
turn them into MP3 files --- a process that's called ripping. The
etymology of this word isn't from ripping off, but from the Raster
Image Processors that are used in the computer graphics industry. A
RIP is a program that converts images in one form, usually in
PostScript, to another form that can be printed on a high-quality
printer. MusicMatch is a completely legitimate program that lets
American citizens exercise their rights under the 1992 Audio Home
Recording Act to make home recordings of their own music.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way that the Recording Industry Association
of America sees it. The RIAA, a trade group that represents record
labels, sees Rio and MusicMatch as one of the biggest threats to
profits since, well, the cassette tape. Back in October the
association filed suit and was granted a restraining order in
federal court to halt the sale and distribution of the Rio PMP300.
That injunction was quickly overturned. The court ruled that since
the Rio was incapable of recording, and since there was no way to
get the music out of the device, it didn't violate the recording
act. MusicMatch, meanwhile, doesn't fall under the recording act's
purview because the law specifically exempts computers and computer
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawsuit against the Rio is continuing, the case may
be moot. On Tuesday, Diamond Multimedia announced that it would be
joining an RIAA coalition that will develop a standard for bringing
security to digitally recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   What the industry fundamentally wants is the best of both
worlds, to be able to keep itself as a middleman between the bands
and the fans. Doing this means having a system that lets fans
download music over the Internet but prevents them from sharing the
music with their friends, or even make a second copy for
themselves. Systems like this already exist in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   What the recording industry is sure to discover, however, is
that copy protection is ultimately a lost cause. At the very least,
people will always be able to hook up their MiniDisc recorders to
their computers and record the music that comes out of the
speakers. That's why the recording industry would do better stop
dreaming up ways to kill devices like Rio, and start trying to
figure out ways to embrace this new technology. Time is running
out.

EVER RETURNING TO SCENE OF CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martha Swetzoff's life was forever transformed in the early
morning of May 21, 1968, the day her father's life came to a brutal
end.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman Swetzoff, 47, one of Boston's pioneer dealers of
contemporary art and the owner of a Newbury Street gallery, had
been badly beaten in his Bay Village home. Neighbors on Winchester
Street that Monday morning ignored his pleas for help as he ran
down the street bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Swetzoff's violent death marked the beginning of a long quest
for peace for his family, especially his two children, David and
Martha. Martha was just 9 when her father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Swetzoff is now a 40-year-old filmmaker whose moving
documentary on her father's still-unsolved murder, ``Theme:
Murder,'' was shown last month at the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The film is more than a labor of love or an attempt to preserve
and define her father's legacy. It is also an attempt to come to
terms with the grief, guilt, and alienation that afflict so many
who survive the tragedy of the murder of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the filmmaker's search for truth, as the documentary
attests, has been stymied by the very agency charged with
determining the truth: the Boston Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the killing, ``Theme: Murder'' concludes,
detectives did not interview the most obvious suspect. And a new
generation of detectives _ with Swetzoff's camera running _ denied
her access to her father's murder file, justifying their refusal by
saying they had reopened the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Swetzoff, a slight, engaging woman with an easy laugh, said her
long journey to the heart of her father's slaying was unplanned.
She attempted her first documentary on the murder 20 years ago, as
a Harvard sophomore. She learned then, she said this week, how
little she had known of her father and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that there was something like objective truth that
you could find by investigating something like this, and I thought
that I would feel better from engaging the process,'' she said of
that first effort. ``Instead, I felt worse.''
</P>
<P>
   After that project, she dropped out of Harvard for four years,
playing electric guitar in an all-female punk band, Bound and
Gagged. She returned to Harvard and, after graduating, began
working on other documentary projects.
</P>
<P>
   But her most important story remained unfinished and untold.
</P>
<P>
   The Swetzoff Gallery was one of many galleries that opened on
Newbury Street after World War II, introducing abstract
expressionist art to a startled, sometimes indignant, audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though Swetzoff married in the 1950s, it was an open secret in
Boston art circles that he was a habitue of the subterranean gay
bars typical of the time. After a divorce in the early 1960s, his
life became even more mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to his family, he had bought a house in Greece, where he
often traveled, and apparently began a relationship with a Greek
boxer, who moved in with him in Bay Village.
</P>
<P>
   Though the roommate alerted police to the crime, he was never
interviewed by detectives, and moved away days later, as Martha
discovered in 1989. Eventually the boxer settled in New York City,
where he got married and raised two children. He died five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Swetzoff, in the documentary, interviewed Lieutenant Steve
Murphy and Captain Tim Murray of the department's ``cold case''
squad to ask why the man was never interviewed and whether
homophobia played any role in the investigation. She also asked for
access to the file on her father's murder.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy and Murray opened the interview by informing her, on
camera, that the case had been reopened, meaning that they would
answer no specific questions about the case. Neither man returned
telephone calls from the Globe, but their documented rebuff to
Swetzoff suggests that they might be as interested in shielding the
facts from public view as they are in solving the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Swetzoff is reluctant to ascribe ill will to the department, but
she is left, once again, with no answers to the great mystery of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is not sure how much relief an indictment in the
case, however unlikely, would bring. She scoffs at the
pop-psychology notion of closure, as if her father's death were
something to move beyond, to get over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this culture want to assume you can live without
pain,'' she said. ``Well you can't.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   YARMOUTHPORT, Mass. _ Pray come join us, gentle reader, as we
celebrate this cozy season of sugar-plum fantasies and Martha
Stewart confections, of chestnuts roasting and cherubs pressing
their noses to the toy store window, with a visit to the home of
author and illustrator Edward Gorey, the misanthrope of mistletoe
himself.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas finds the darkly brilliant, notoriously reclusive
Gorey _ the high priest of humbug, the anti-Martha _ having a
dickens of a time turning traditional holiday sentiment inside out.
</P>
<P>
   You will espy Gorey's house perched at the edge of a quaint
village green, unfestooned with twinkling lights or plastic
reindeer. The lot is overgrown with bittersweet and honeysuckle. A
barn and shed sit out back, buckling under the weight of the
proprietor's excess book collection. The front porch creaks
underfoot. The doorbell rings _ or does it? No movement inside. Not
a creature is stirring, not even a cockroach.
</P>
<P>
   A rap on the glass, and a bearded figure appears. Gorey, you
surmise. He does not introduce himself. Perhaps he assumes you
know. Perhaps he is indifferent if you do not. In either case, the
door opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you like cats,'' he says solemnly. ``If you're
allergic, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the 200-year-old Cape-style house are books _ piles of
books, boxes of books, minitowers of books _ stacked upon every
conceivable surface. What appears to be the rusting contents of a
1932 barn sale take up what little space is left. No wreaths or
garlands lay scattered about, spreading their Yule perfume.
Instead, in the kitchen where the 73-year-old Gorey insists upon
sitting, dressed in faded denim and tattered tennis shoes, the
pungent smell of cat urine fills the air. As if on cue, a feline
form hops onto the kitchen table, sniffing you indelicately.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's harmless,'' Gorey assures you, and indeed that may be
true. In the archetypal Gorey story, however, wherein babies get
eaten by bears and small children are crushed by cars, comfortable
assumptions simply do not exist. You therefore pet the cat warily.
Gorey smiles. A good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The pretext for this visit is publication by Harcourt Brace of
Gorey's hundredth-or-so book, ``The Haunted Tea-Cosy: A Dispirited
and Distasteful Diversion for Christmas.'' Commissioned by The New
York Times Magazine, the text and illustrations are a gleefully
gothic reimagining of Dickens's ``A Christmas Carol.'' The plot
shall not be rehashed here, since summarizing any Gorey plot is
beside the point. Let's leave it that the story has to do with
fruitcake, large insects, and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the pretext vanishes soon enough. Though his publisher
has been lining up interviews and book signings in hopes that
Gorey, creator of such underground classics as ``The Gashlycrumb
Tinies'' and the ``Amphigorey'' series, will make the leap from
cult favorite to bestseller, he could care less, it seems. He makes
it plain that he would rather leap into the Cape Cod Canal than
prattle on with journalists whose flattering attention might
service book sales.
</P>
<P>
   O tannenbaum!
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is important to me, I assure you,'' he says with a
manic giggle, ``least of all `finding a new audience,' as you put
it. I could care less about that. Personally, I got trapped into
doing this book by the Times. I thought they wanted me to
illustrate a rewrite of Dickens, but when I asked them to send me
the manuscript, they never did. When I insisted, they sent a copy
of `Christmas Carol.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey scowls. ``Oh,'' he cries, in rising pitch, ``I thought,
for Pete's sake! You expect me to do this in four pages? `Oh no,'
they said. Well, anyway, I did it. It took me two days. Once the
book was ready, I wanted to publish it on Valentine's Day or
Easter. But naked greed intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gorey explains that for nearly 20 years he has lived alone in
this house, kept company by five cats and a well-used satellite TV
dish. To say he doesn't get out much _ much less pine to be the
next Stephen King _ would be an understatement. He imagines death
coming for him while he idles beside the ``Cape Cod 5 Miles'' sign
on Route 3, trying to get home from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself getting more reclusive, not less,'' Gorey says.
``I hate to travel. Hate it! And this time of year I'm at my
blackest. I try to avoid the holidays as much as possible. I was
never all that enamored of Christmas anyway. People associate me
with Christmas or Halloween _ why, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, says Gorey, twisting the rings on six of his bony
fingers, ``they're pushing this book of mine. Why? So I'll make a
little more money. Oh wow.'' He chortles. ``I don't have anything
to spend it on. More books? More CDs? I mean, why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation, warming now, begins to wander as if blown by
the jet stream. And that's OK. You are in no hurry, and neither is
he. Periodically Gorey's mind touches down on interesting runways,
like the untimely death of his longtime publisher, Peter Weed, who
drowned in Lake Winnipesaukee a few years ago. Or on the fact that
Gorey has not left the United States since 1975, when he undertook
a perfectly enjoyable trip to Scotland, which, he says, ``I've been
meaning to repeat but for some reason never have. Perhaps I shall
go to Kyoto.'' Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Gorey's attention drifts willy-nilly to obscure
authors (Irish novelist George Birmingham) and famous ones (Tom
Wolfe, whom Gorey detests); to pop culture (Gorey's TV addictions
include ``The X-Files'' and ``Buffy The Vampire Slayer'') and
current events (``The day before Clinton was going to tell all
about Monica Lewinsky,'' says Gorey, ``I said, I cannot stand
hearing another word about this. So I haven't watched one second of
news since. Or read a newspaper. The whole world could be going up
in flames, and I wouldn't know it. It's so soothing.''); to Wes
Craven movies, Chinese mathematics, the Sci-Fi Channel, and any
number of other subjects that strike his eclectic fancy.
</P>
<P>
   When more or less forced to circle back to his own work, Gorey
says that this summer, while setting aside two more book projects
long overdue, he experienced ``this big, blinding flash of
revelation. My books aren't really about anything. That's why it
felt very easy to do them. I don't know what inspires me. I just do
them. Or not do them! Basically, I'm incredibly lazy. I got so
bored last summer, I went back to doing puppet shows. I can drone
on endlessly in mindless conversation that nobody really knows what
I'm talking about. Aren't you glad you asked?``
</P>
<P>
   You nod. The cat purrs.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays from Edward's house to yours!

THINGS TO DO BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have already dragged home the tree, dug out the ornaments
and checked the lights, and put everything on the tree, baked all
the goodies, ordered the turkey, and filled all the wish lists of
family and friends and wrapped them, then there is nothing to do
until the Big Day.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have not, then consider this potpourri of Christmas
things and chores to make the few days a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Finding last-minute gifts is a good start.
</P>
<P>
   If there are handypersons in your circle of family and friends,
chances are they have a pretty full tool kit. But there are still
things you might be able to get, as a major gift or stocking
stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   But don't surprise them; they know what they want, and it's best
to get a hint or two.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Home Depot thinks are in a handyperson's kit, in
addition to hammers (more than one, perhaps), saws, and power
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of saws, give serious consideration to a Japanese-style
saw; it cuts on the pull rather than the push, creates a very
narrow kerf, and is easily guided to follow the penciled sawing
line. Chances are pretty fair that the handyperson doesn't have
one.
</P>
<P>
   And the list, please:
</P>
<P>
   Eight-inch adjustable wrench (a crescent wrench is a good
example, and a good design).
</P>
<P>
   Four-in-one screwdriver. Well, maybe; it would be better to have
a set of several different sizes, one set with regualr slot head,
the other a Phillips head, the head with the cross-shaped slot.
</P>
<P>
   See, you already have some possibilities for gifts, even without
consulting the handyperson.
</P>
<P>
   Channel lock pliers.
</P>
<P>
   Vise-Grip pliers.
</P>
<P>
   14-inch pipe wrench.
</P>
<P>
   Small nut driver.
</P>
<P>
   13-piece Allen wrench set.
</P>
<P>
   Tape rule. Again, maybe. The handyperson might already have more
than enough.
</P>
<P>
   Utility knife. And plenty of blades.
</P>
<P>
   Try square. Why it's called that can confuse any handyperson.
</P>
<P>
   Socket wrench set.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Electric tape.
</P>
<P>
   19-inch tool box with three drawers and a removable tray.
</P>
<P>
   Power tools are another item to consider, including the cordless
tools, which have been around a while but are better than ever. But
if in doubt, forget everything and give a gift certificate so the
choice is out of your hands, and there is little need for
schlepping to the store for an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The stains of Christmas
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the stains of Christmas, usually occurring on the
eve of the big day, the day itself, and afterward. Stains are a
nightmare for the homeowner before, during, and after the holidays.
They can be a nuisance throughout the year, but particularly
annoying during festive occasions, because there can be so many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Other than preventing them, the best way to handle stains is to
be prepared to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   These five simple strategies are from the MAIDS International:
</P>
<P>
   1. Be fast. A spill becomes a stain when it's allowed to set,
and time is a good stain-setter. Whenever possible, blot spills
immediately with a clean cloth. Scoop up solids with spoon or
knife.
</P>
<P>
   2. Be gentle. Blot _ don't rub, fold, squeeze, or wring. Rough
handling can force dirt deeper into whatever is being stained.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be cautious. Test any cleaning solution before using. Let the
solution set for a few minutes before blotting.
</P>
<P>
   4. Use cold water. Heat makes some stains permanent.
</P>
<P>
   5. Be prepared: Before guests arrive, fill a spray bottle with
the MAIDS International Solution to Holiday Stains:
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon mild laundry detergeent.
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon white vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   One quart cool water.
</P>
<P>
   This solution is safe for washable fabrics and most carpets. If
a spill occurs on a non-washable fabric, use dry-cleaning fluid
instead.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be ready for anything, make up a stain-killer kit, a
tote box that you can carry to the various spills.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the box with sponges, cloths, paper towels, detergent,
baking soda, dry-cleaning fluid, salt, white vinegar, ammonia, and
rubbing alcohol. Keep bleach on the shelf, and do not combine any
of these cleaners. Some combinations such as bleach and ammonia
produce a deadly gas.
</P>
<P>
   Next, know your stain. You can't treat it properly unless you
know what it is. There are greasy stains, non-greasy stains, and
combination stains.
</P>
<P>
   Treat non-greasy stains with detergent and water or water alone.
Treat greasy stains with dry-cleaning fluid, followed by water.
Combination stains may need treating with both.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, make a list of stains and tape it to your
stain-killer kit.
</P>
<P>
   Non-greasy stains include alcohol, beer, wine, blood, candy,
catsup, ketchup, chocolate milk, chocolate, clay, coffee, cola,
cologne, fruit juices, graphite, gravy, ice cream, jelly, milk,
soft drinks, syrup, soil, tea, urine, and water colors.
</P>
<P>
   Greasy stains include butter, oleo, calamine lotion, any oils,
cosmetics, crayons, felt tip markers, many glues, black grease,
gum, hand cream, ink, lipstick, mascara, mayonnaise, nail polish,
ointment, oil paint, rouge, salad dressing, and wax.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, have a joyful holiday.

<P>
   Four decades ago a Third World dictator threatened American
interests in a crucial region. Unwilling to pay the costs of an
invasion or settle for containment, U.S. policymakers convinced
themselves that a cheap and easy third option existed: support for
some of the dictator's domestic opponents, whose efforts would
supposedly spark a popular uprising and topple the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting invasion attempt by Cuban exiles at the Bay of
Pigs turned into one of the worst fiascoes in the history of
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently _ perhaps incredibly _ one of the hottest
foreign-policy ideas in Washington has been to use the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From congressional leaders to former government officials, this
option _ to ``roll back'' the power of Saddam Hussein by supporting
opposition groups within Iraq, has been touted as the way to go.
From the pages of The Weekly Standard, National Review and
Commentary to The New Republic and columnists at The New York
Times, The Washington Post and The Nation, support for the Iraqi
opposition has become the leading alternative to the Clinton
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   One recent letter urging the president to back Saddam's foes
more strongly was signed by three former Republican national
security advisers, three former Republican secretaries of defense,
and seven former Republican subcabinet officials. Yet another
prominent supporter of the idea has been Clinton's first CIA
director, R. James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in October Congress even rushed to embrace an Iraq
Liberation Act, authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid
to democratic Iraqi resistance groups. The president's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the option is simple: The United States
should refuse to accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and
help install the Iraqi opposition in his place.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) put it, ``The
doctrine here has to be rollback, not containment.''
</P>
<P>
   In The New Republic, former Under-Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz wrote, ``Toppling Saddam is the only outcome that can
satisfy the vital U.S. interest in a stable and secure Gulf region,
because, to a degree unique among contemporary tyrannies, the Iraqi
regime is Saddam Hussein. ... The vast majority of Iraqis want him
out, though only those with a death wish say so openly. We must
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that Saddam could supposedly be replaced at
relatively low cost _ even, many advocates argue, without ever
committing American ground troops. The world could be free of
Saddam, Wolfowitz argued in recent testimony before Congress, if
the Clinton administration would only ``muster the necessary
strength of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly in the ointment is that this is simply not true. Even if
mere ``rollback'' were desirable, any policy to bolster a
successful attack by the Iraqi opposition would have to be
militarily feasible, amenable to American allies whose cooperation
would be required for implementation, and acceptable to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tout this prescription as superior to existing U.S.
policy are either engaging in wishful thinking or cynically playing
politics. For the United States to undertake a policy of rollback
in Iraq _ using any of already stated plans, at least _ would be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression sometimes given by backers of the
Iraqi opposition, there is no single, simple rollback plan.
Instead, three competing variants of the idea have been put
forward: using airpower to oust Saddam, helping the opposition
seize large chunks of Iraq or sponsoring a guerrilla war by his
foes.
</P>
<P>
   In the airpower approach, the United States would team up with
the Iraqi opposition for a decisive military campaign against the
regime. The problem here is that almost all the heavy lifting would
be done by the United States, which would incur huge costs without
being assured of success in return.
</P>
<P>
   It would be undertaken after the United States had helped the
Iraqi opposition recruit, train and equip tens of thousands of
soldiers for limited conventional warfare. Ultimately, when this
opposition army was ready to take the field, the United States
would launch an air offensive against Saddam's forces to devastate
Iraqi combat formations, logistics, command and control, and
rear-echelon positions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require the opposition to capture Iraq's cities
from the regime's armed forces. Opposition troops would have to
fight these battles largely on their own, because it would be
difficult for U.S. planes and missiles to destroy Iraqi ground
units hiding in the concrete jungles of modern cities and because,
in order to limit civilian casualties, U.S. rules of engagement
would prohibit bombing urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even battered Republican Guard divisions would be too much
for the weak opposition forces to handle in urban combat. Saddam's
foes would probably lose on the ground even if the United States
were to devote a massive air campaign to aiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the approach might lead Saddam to unleash his chemical
and biological weapons _ his jealously guarded ace in the hole _
against the United States and its Middle Eastern allies. Saddam was
never close enough to being toppled during the Gulf War to use
these weapons of last resort. Slowly pushing him to the wall would
give him every reason to lash out with his arsenal, while removing
all incentives for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, in short, would involve fighting a preventive war
against Iraq from a standing start but using opposition troops
instead of U.S. ground forces. Its costs and risks would make it an
extremely grave and unpopular endeavor, even if it were sold as a
way to settle the problem of Saddam once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the opposition might well lose, leaving the
administration with the agonizing choice of either leaving Saddam
to crow over his escape, continuing the air campaign or sending
U.S. troops to occupy Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   To have attempted a rollback of Iraq's regime by relying on an
opposition ground attack, along with U.S. airpower, then, would
have been incredibly risky and more likely to box in Washington
than liberate Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the generous assumptions that only 12 of Iraq's 23
divisions would actually fight (six army and six Republican Guard)
and that each division could be effectively destroyed with 500 air
sorties, it would take 6,000 sorties to deal with these units
alone. About the same number would be required to attack Iraqi
military installations, logistical support and tactical
command-and-control assets _ a combined total of 12,000 sorties, or
just over half of the 22,000 flown against similar targets by
coalition aircraft during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   An air campaign supporting an Iraqi opposition ground offensive
would also require significant attention to targets that were not
high priorities in Desert Storm. The United States would have to
move to stop periodic counterattacks by Iraqi heavy divisions
against the lightly armed opposition formations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air forces would have to pummel a handful of Iraqi units
for weeks until they cracked, wait for the opposition forces to
move in and brace themselves for counterattack, then start pounding
the next set of Iraqi ground formations, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's pace would also be dictated by the weakness and
inexperience of opposition units. Because Iraqi targets and combat
formations would have to be kept suppressed and dispersed for
months, the air campaign in question would probably require 80,000
to 100,000 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is best unproven and at worst foolish to argue that
U.S. airpower could eliminate Iraqi ground forces and enable an
opposition army to march on Baghdad virtually unopposed.

   Four decades ago a Third World dictator threatened American
interests in a crucial region. Unwilling to pay the costs of an
invasion or settle for containment, U.S. policymakers convinced
themselves that a cheap and easy third option existed: support for
some of the dictator's domestic opponents, whose efforts would
supposedly spark a popular uprising and topple the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting invasion attempt by Cuban exiles at the Bay of
Pigs turned into one of the worst fiascoes in the history of
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently _ perhaps incredibly _ one of the hottest
foreign-policy ideas in Washington has been to use the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From congressional leaders to former government officials, this
option _ to ``roll back'' the power of Saddam Hussein by supporting
opposition groups within Iraq, has been touted as the way to go.
From the pages of The Weekly Standard, National Review and
Commentary to The New Republic and columnists at The New York

THE CASE AGAINST CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats didn't always think censuring Bill Clinton was such a
good idea. When the suggestion was first made last spring that
Congress avoid the turmoil of impeachment by passing a resolution
of censure instead, it was pooh-poohed by some of the president's
staunchest defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Drinan, the former congressman and veteran of the
Nixon-era House Judiciary Committee, warned Republicans last week
not to impeach Clinton lest they be seen as acting out of
``vengeance.'' But in March, Drinan vigorously declared that the
choice for Republicans was impeachment _ or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The framers deliberately said impeachment is the one thing you
can do to the president and the only thing,'' Drinan insisted. The
prospect of a censure was ``invented by Trent Lott'' _ the Senate
majority leader who briefly lofted the censure balloon before the
independent counsel's report was sent to Congress _ ``because they
don't have the votes for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinan's successor from the 4th Congressional District of
Massachusetts agreed. In his waspish way, Barney Frank mocked the
Republicans. ``Faced with a choice, they go for symbolism over
substance. That is what censure is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Democrats to be candid about the hollowness of
censure nine months ago, when they thought Republicans had neither
the votes nor the fortitude to impeach the president. Nobody doubts
their fortitude anymore, and the numbers are adding up. Which is
why the Clintonistas who scorned censure in March plead for it in
December. When the House takes up the resolution of impeachment,
the Democrats are planning a longshot parliamentary maneuver to
substitute a vote on censure instead.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Frank no longer dismisses censure as empty symbolism. His
remarks in the Judiciary Committee on Dec. 10 are worth quoting at
length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am struck by those who have argued that censure is somehow
an irrelevancy, a triviality, something of no weight. History
doesn't say that. There are two members of this House right now who
continue to play a role who were reprimanded for lying: myself and
outgoing Speaker Gingrich. We both were found to have lied . . . in
official proceedings, and were reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you that having been reprimanded by this House of
Representatives, where I'm so proud to serve, was no triviality. It
is something that, when people write about me, they still write
about. It is not something that's a matter of pride. I wish I could
go back and undo it. . . . I am, indeed, surprised that members
(can) be dismissive of the fact that the US House of
Representatives or Senate might vote a condemnation as if that
doesn't mean anything. Members know better.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Frank does rue the day _ July 26, 1990 _ that he had to
stand in the well of the House and be reprimanded by his
colleagues. But who else, Massachusetts political junkies aside,
even remembers it?
</P>
<P>
   The day after Frank's comments in committee, I listened to a
puzzled Rush Limbaugh ask callers to his radio show if they had any
idea what the congressman had been talking about. Frank will
doubtless be glad to learn that the nation's most popular radio
talk host, an ardent conservative and a savvy political
commentator, had completely forgotten about his relationship with a
prostitute and the scandal it led to.
</P>
<P>
   (A brief recap: Frank met the prostitute, Stephen Gobie, through
a sex ad. He ended up giving Gobie the keys to his house and car,
and wrote misleading letters to Virginia authorities in an effort
to end Gobie's probation on a felony conviction. He also used his
congressional privileges to fix 33 of Gobie's parking tickets.
Gobie ran a sex-for-hire ring out of Frank's home, but the Ethics
Committee rejected his claim that Frank knew about the
prostitution.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Frank's disgrace may have felt like a ticket to
oblivion. But his political career has skyrocketed. He is is one of
his party's leading figures. He shows no shyness in asserting
himself in the House, in committee, or in the media. He has never
faced a credible reelection challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Frank does not rejoice at having been reprimanded by
his colleagues. But it didn't put even a dent in his political
fortunes. It turned out to be, to quote his own words, ``symbolism
over substance.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton deserves and what the country needs is not a
symbolic rebuke from which he will bounce back unscratched. There
is only a momentary sting in being censured; impeachment will sting
through history. Clinton has lied and deceived throughout his
political climb. It is fitting that his lies and deceit be the
cause, finally, of his fall.
</P>
<P>
   Why impeach? Let a Democratic source provide the answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicit in (the presidential) oath is the obligation that the
president set an example of high moral standards and conduct
himself in a manner that fosters respect for the truth. William
Jefferson Clinton has egregiously failed in this obligation, and .
. . has violated the trust of the American people, lessened their
esteem for the office of president, and dishonored the office which
they have entrusted to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A president who violates the people's trust and dishonors his
office commits high crimes and misdemeanors and forfeits his right
to the White House. The words are those of the Democrats' proposed
resolution of censure. But they sum up perfectly the case for
impeachment.

NEXT STEP: RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iraq will not save him. The US House of Representatives will
impeach President William Clinton. The vote will break down more or
less on party lines. As time passes, Clinton's support in the US
Senate will evaporate, leading inexorably to his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, it has been an article of faith among the
political cognoscenti that Clinton ``could not'' be convicted in
the Senate. I wrote something along these very lines just three
weeks ago. The mathematics were correct (55-45 GOP
majority/two-thirds majority needed to convict), but the
conclusions drawn were not.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is chemistry, not mathematics. And the chemical
reaction of the House Judiciary Committee's vote last Friday,
combined with the president's erratic behavior in response to it,
has created a new political dynamic. When the full House votes to
impeach, as surely it will, the case against Clinton will no longer
be viewed as ``lying about sex.'' The truth of the matter will out.
And the truth of the matter is that Clinton broke laws he was sworn
to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his political career, Bill Clinton has defined
himself by his enemies and argued his way out of trouble by blaming
them for all the fuss. When the Lewinsky scandal broke, Clinton did
what he always does in crises. He lied. He politicized the process,
demonizing his adversaries. And he argued his case in the context
of a diversionary issue, which in this case was sexual privacy.
Clinton knew that the media would wallow in sex to excite their
circulation figures and Nielsen ratings. He knew that the
electorate would recoil at the ``invasion'' of his privacy. His
team conducted polls just to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for much longer than anyone could have predicted. It
isn't working anymore. According to an ABC News ``Nightline'' poll,
more than 80 percent of the nation now believes that Clinton lied
under oath. Newt Gingrich has stepped aside, taking himself out of
the mix. Ken Starr's performance before the House Judiciary
Committee belied the White House caricature. And the whole issue of
Bill Clinton's misconduct has suddenly become deadly serious. It
isn't about sex anymore. It's about perjury, witness tampering and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   On these three counts, there is no doubt that the House
Judiciary Committee's majority counsel, David Schippers, laid out a
compelling and convincing case that the president is guilty as
charged and should be impeached as a result. The case can now be
weighed on its merits. It is no longer laden down with Clinton vs.
Starr, or Clinton vs. The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy or Clinton vs.
The Media. Its Clinton vs. the Constitution of The United States of
America. And most everyone is beginning to understand that
circumventing the Constitution for the benefit of Bill Clinton is a
fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   At any moment, reaching back all the way to last January,
Clinton could have averted this outcome had he simply told the
truth. After the midterm elections, Republicans practically begged
him to give them the political cover they needed to accept a
censure resolution. It is a measure of Clinton's arrogance and
selfishness that he instead gave them the back of his hand with his
haughty and dishonest answers to House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde's 81 interrogatories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will lie until the last dog dies,'' wrote Michael Kelly in
The Washington Post a few months back and was that ever true.
Clinton's dishonesty has now brought him to the brink of ruin. It
will cost him everything he worked for and everything he dreamed of
since he shook President Kennedy's hand on the White House lawn all
those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was first elected president, he brought with him a
cadre of aides, assistants, and associates known as FOBs. The
acronym stood for Friends of Bill. There were hundreds of these
people and they wore their FOB buttons like badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   There are no FOBs anymore. Bill Clinton has no friends in the
House of Representatives. He has no friends in the Senate. The
Washington establishment despises him. Republicans loathe him. The
media believe he is incapable of telling the truth. And Democrats,
if you asked them in the strictest confidence, would not disagree
with the assessment of columnist Kelly. ``He's an unusually good
liar'' are the chilling words of Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   When the roll is finally counted in the House, the votes won't
be there for Bill Clinton. He has, through his ceaseless mendacity
and shameless conduct, exhausted whatever reservoirs of good will
remained. The endgame has commenced. Bill Clinton is alone. Soon,
he will be impeached. Sooner rather than later, he will be gone.

`DOGPATCH' DONNYBROOK BITES HERALD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about talk radio that doesn't exactly elicit
the best from a guest. On Monday, Boston Herald columnist Don Feder
_ whose Nov. 30 column derided the idea of statehood for Puerto
Rico, which he labeled a ``Caribbean Dogpatch'' _ appeared on
WRKO's morning show. Perhaps inspired by the sophomoric ethnic
insults of host Jeff Katz, Feder had this to say about the crowd of
Latinos who gathered outside the Herald Dec. 7 to protest the tone
of his column:
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out there on a weekday, which to me indicates that
either they don't have jobs or their jobs aren't all that important
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there is no meeting of the minds between the
Herald and Latinos who were deeply insulted by Feder's column.
Herald City Hall reporter Jose Martinez, who helped cover the
Puerto Rican statehood issue, said that anger at Feder's column
``was the unifying element in every interview'' he conducted.
``Personally I thought the guy overstated his case and went on to
attack Puerto Ricans as Puerto Ricans,'' said Martinez. ``Which is
racist in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, a group of Latino activists presented Herald
publisher Pat Purcell with a list of demands. On several issues _
such as a Herald commitment to foster more Latino hiring, to
provide internships for Latino students, and to meet regularly with
community representatives _ progress was made. But one participant,
David Cortiella, says that on ``the two fundamental issues of
principle, we were not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit: The Herald will not issue a fuller apology over the
``content'' of Feder's piece. (Purcell published a Dec. 8 apology
to those offended, but defended Feder's right to his opinion.) Not
surprisingly, the call for the Herald to cease publishing Feder's
column will also go unmet.
</P>
<P>
   In a Globe interview, Feder said ``no one has contested the
facts'' of his column. ``The only thing I sort of regret is the use
of the term `Dogpatch,' '' he added. While he took the term from
the hillbilly home of the Li'l Abner comic strip, Feder said some
protesters ``think I was calling Puerto Ricans dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   With neither side backing down, Monday marked the kickoff of a
two-week boycott of the Herald as organizers try to persuade Latino
merchants not to carry the paper in their stores. One other
outgrowth of this confrontation might have more staying power.
According to Cortiella, the community is organizing a media watch
group to monitor Latino press coverage in Boston.

   The University of Maryland is a college basketball powerhouse
this year. But the cheering at the campus paper, The Diamondback,
has to do with another kind of basketball record.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld a circuit court
decision by ruling that the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) _ which protects the confidentiality of ``educational
records'' _ did not preclude The Diamondback from getting access to
the student athlete parking records. (The paper's suit, filed in
1996, centered on a Maryland basketball star who amassed around
$8,000 in parking fines.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is far more at stake here than just some hyperactive
meter maids. For years, a battle has raged between colleges and
student journalists over FERPA, which is also used to shield campus
judicial proceedings from public scrutiny. Educators say it is
critical to safeguarding student privacy rights. But critics,
including some groups of concerned parents, claim FERPA serves to
effectively hide the incidence of drinking, drugs, and sexual
assault on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense I have from speaking to college editors is that many
of them do believe there are serious crimes being dealt with in
these proceedings that no one even knows about,'' said Mark
Goodman, executive director of the Student Press Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, student newspapers, including those at the
University of Georgia and Miami of Ohio, have been using the law to
crack open campus records. With FERPA under siege in court, Goodman
predicts a move to amend it in the next Congress.

   Tuesday, amid serious self-flagellation, the American Society of
Newspaper Editors (ASNE) released a study on public perceptions
about journalistic credibility. (ASNE president Edward Seaton
introduced the results by alluding to the profession's ``spring and
summer from hell.'')
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ based on 3,000 phone interviews and 16 focus groups
and directed by the Massachusetts-based Urban &AMP; Associates _
contained heaps of doleful news about how the real world sees
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is particularly new. But the most dire warnings may
be in the section about the growing chasm between the media and the
masses. More than half the respondents believe the press is ``out
of touch with mainstream Americans'' and two-thirds think editors
and reporters are more cynical than normal people.
</P>
<P>
   The truly eye-opening comments came during the focus groups. One
participant declared that journalists ``like to see adverse things
happen to people.'' Another put it even more starkly: ``You
wouldn't be a good reporter if you were a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about on-line porn, steamy chat rooms and
seductive cyber romances, could the Internet actually be killing
carnality? When a survey by Ogilvy Public Relations asked people
what they'd be doing if they weren't surfing the Net, 14 percent
claimed to be passing up ``intimate relations.''

TREATING INCONTINENCE THE BIOFEEDBACK WAY  
 HIV FOUND IN SEMEN AFTER ANTIVIRAL COURSE  
 RISE IN TB RISK SEEN IN CERTAIN ITINERARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Treating incontinence the biofeedback way
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Urinary incontinence is a very common problem among women,
especially ones over 60. It's also very easy to treat, a new study
has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked at how women can control their bladder by
learning how to contract and relax their pelvic muscles while
keeping their abdominal muscles relaxed. They then use that
knowledge to make their pelvic muscles relax and contract when they
feel an urge to urinate, giving them more control and more time to
reach a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   That biofeedback approach was compared with the more common drug
treatments used today, and biofeedback proved more effective: It
generated an 80.7 percent reduction of incontinence episodes,
compared to 68.5 percent for drugs and 39.4 percent for placebos.
And only 14 percent of those using the behavioral therapy wanted to
try a different treatment, compared to 75.5 percent of those on the
drugs or placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were run by researchers at the University of Alabama,
along with ones at several medical centers in Pennsylvania, and
they involved a total of 197 women aged 55 to 92 with
bladder-control troubles. Nationwide, more than 15 million people
suffer incontinence, with the problem more pronounced among but not
limited to the elderly, and considerably more common among women
than men.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association, ``has clearly established that biofeedback is an
effective and completely proven treatment for incontinence,'' said
Dr. Neil M. Resnick, chief of gerontology at Brigham and Women's
Hospital and author of an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think it should be an either-or with drugs and
biofeedback,'' added Resnick, who runs the nation's oldest center
to treat incontinence. ``The great news is that biofeedback is one
more proven effective therapy that we can add to our
armamentaria.''

   &UR; HIV found in semen after antiviral course
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three-drug cocktail used to battle AIDS is so effective that
it lowers levels of HIV to the point where the virus isn't
detectable, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one set of researchers found that the infection
persists at low levels in blood cells, and now another set of
scientists is reporting that HIV also can persist in semen, which
means it can be transmitted sexually. The researchers, from Thomas
Jefferson University, reached their conclusion after studying semen
and blood samples from seven men infected with HIV virus who were
on effective antiviral therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that anyone who is HIV infected should always
practice safe sex,'' said Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz, director of the
Center for Human Virology at Thomas Jefferson and an author of the
article in the current New England Journal of Medicine. ``Are they
as contagious or as transmissable as someone who's not getting the
therapy? No. It's going to be difficult to spread, but the virus is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know where these infected cells are, we can think
about novel approaches to ablate them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rise in TB risk seen in certain itineraries
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contagion also is a worry with tuberculosis, especially for
people who have traveled to or had visitors from a country where
the disease is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of a study published by the American Lung
Association involving 953 children in California. It found that
those who'd traveled to countries like Mexico, India, China, and
Haiti, where there is a lot of TB, were 3.9 times more likely to
have a positive skin test than children who hadn't traveled. And
children who had a household visitor from a country with a high
prevalence of TB were 2.4 times more likely to test positive.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that it's relatively easy to test for TB and to
cure it, if it is detected early.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has actually shown there's an
increased risk,'' said Dr. Mark N. Lobato, lead author of the study
and a medical officer at the Division of Tuberculosis Prevention at
the Centers for Disease Control. While the study zeroed in on
children, it applies to adults, too, he said, and it is especially
relevent these days, when ecotourists and others are visiting
exotic parts of the world and staying with local residents.

</P>
<P>
   _ Gran Turismo, $39.95. After a long commute home, there's
nothing like cranking up the Aston Martin and flooring it around a
winding race track. Gran Turismo, from Sony PlayStation, lets you
pick from 150 cars ranging from a shiny new Aston to a dowdy used
Nissan to race around a variety of winding tracks. What makes this
a stand-out console game is the realistic performance
characteristics, especially the burning rubber donuts you can
perform while waiting for the rest of the field to catch up. From
Sony.

STATE SEEN LOW-BALLING CAR INSPECTION FEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cellucci administration is so eager to prevent a
driver revolt against tough vehicle inspections planned for next
year that it may not be charging motorists nearly enough to cover
the estimated $215 million cost of the emissions testing contract,
service station owners warn.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have pledged that drivers would face no
more than a $5 increase in the current $15 vehicle inspection fee
when the new testing program starts. That would make Massachusetts
inspections cheaper than in states with similar programs, such as
Connecticut, where safety and emissions testing costs $45 or
Pennsylvania, which averages $43 per test.
</P>
<P>
   And service station owners, who will have to install costly
machines called dynamometers to check tailpipe exhaust under the
new program, fear that they will be hard pressed to recover their
investment unless inspection fees are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is advocating for an outrageously high fee. I'm not.
We're advocating for a fair fee,'' said Jack W. Pierce, Jr.,
executive director of the New England Service Station and
Automotive Repair Association. ``I don't see how the Commonwealth
is $10 to $15 under everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emissions tests, intended to reduce summertime smog,
have been debated for years as first Gov. Weld and now Gov.
Cellucci sought to design a testing system that would not outrage
the state's 4.1 million vehicle owners. In 1995, under federal
pressure, Massachusetts almost set up 50 stand-alone testing
centers statewide, but the program was shelved after driver
complaints about such a system in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the administration wants to offer the pollution checks
through 600 to 1,200 existing inspection stations. But the state
has taken so long to devise the program that the EPA plans to
impose sanctions on the state that would delay major construction
projects, such as new power plants.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials are taking the concerns of the EPA
and station owners in stride, arguing that their cautious,
driver-sensitive approach has the best chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention here is to create a program that frankly places
the motorist first,'' said Assistant Environmental Affairs
Secretary John Rodman. ``We want to be fair to the repair industry,
but we think that what we're proposing is a dramatic improvement
over the original EPA proposal that put them all out of business''
in favor of the testing centers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pierce said, the state's drive to avoid significant
inspection fee increases under the new program contrasts with other
states that have upgraded emissions testing. In Connecticut, where
the state has 26 testing centers statewide, customers pay $20 for
the emissions test alone, and another $25 for safety checks.
</P>
<P>
   New York has held the inspection fee to $25 by using government
funds to reduce costs, he said, while in Pennsylvania, where
service stations set their own rates, vehicle inspections now cost
an average of $43.
</P>
<P>
   If combined safety and emissions tests here cost $20, Pierce
noted, the state and service stations would need at least a decade
before the new inspection fee money covered the original cost of
the testing contract now being negotiated with Keating Technologies
of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they can do it,'' Pierce said, admitting he didn't know
all the details of the state's inspection financing scheme.
``Reasonable people can differ.''

PATRIOTS STADIUM SITE OVERSHADOWED BY BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ That was one giant step forward Tuesday for
Connecticut officials in their efforts to bring the New England
Patriots here, but the journey is not done.
</P>
<P>
   And the next step is likely to be more troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the General Assembly's approval of a $375 million
deal for the National Football League franchise, Connecticut
officials must now assemble the land on which the stadium will
stand. The targeted parcels are mostly a mix of largely
underdeveloped land and parking lots along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also two large and important buildings on the
land, and how to go about removing them and paying for the
relocation is still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings are owned by CTG Resources Inc., an energy
holding company. One, the Connecticut Natural Gas Co.'s steam
energy plant that heats and cools downtown Hartford, is just about
where one end zone of the proposed stadium would be. The other
building, the gas company's headquarters, extends out from that end
zone to the prospective site for 50-yard-line seats.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings loom over both the site and Connecticut's plans
for the new home of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial package approved overwhelmingly by the
General Assembly provides money for the stadium, it provides no
money for the purchase of the land or the development rights. In
fact, it makes no mention of the specific site at all.
</P>
<P>
   All it says is that, ``The state must acquire by condemnation,
purchase, lease, lease-purchase or otherwise the real property for
the stadium facility site and the infrastructure improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My current understanding is that the companies are going to
donate the land for the site,'' said Dean Pagani, Governor John
Rowland's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that might be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fiondella, the president, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., has been
leading the corporate charge to redevelop the site as Adriaen's
Landing, a $1 billion development of mixed uses, including a
stadium, a convention center, retail space, residential space, a
hotel and activities centers. Phoenix owns about 30 percent of the
land, only a sliver of which is designated for use for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years _ long before Patriots' vice president
Jonathan Kraft saw the plans for the site and figured the stadium
ought to be for the Patriots and UConn football, instead of just
the Huskies _ Fiondella has been trying to rally other businesses
and the state and city governments to the cause of redeveloping
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It has been Fiondella's idea that Phoenix, CTG and the other
major landowners _ The Travelers Group and the City of Hartford _
would form a land-management company, to be called the Adriaen's
Landing Management Company. The companies would donate the land to
the land management company, and then the management company would
sell the development rights.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the parcels on which the stadium would stand _
mostly on CTG Resources land _ would be yielded as part of the
development deal for Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original plans for Adriaen's Landing, which have been
proceeding publicly since May, well before the Patriots expressed
an interest, the state set up the Capitol City Economic Development
Administration to preside over the redevelopment. Earlier this
year, the state appropriated $350 million to get Adriaen's Landing
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, an agreement on the companies donating the land in
return for the development rights has not emerged from the
negotiation among the companies and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some discussions to be held on how all of that
will work out,'' said Keith Anderson, a spokesman for The
Travelers. ``There has been no agreement, yet, and what will come
out of this I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the negotiations are successful, it is unclear how
much the companies will seek for the development rights they would
sell in return for donating the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a revenue projection that says what the return
will be for the shareholders of the companies or the residents of
the city,'' said Deputy City Manager Patricia Williams. ``Frankly,
there has been no room for an appraisal. The project has great
support, but it has not progressed to a detailed study.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Fiondella insists that the ultimate price tag on
the development rights is not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really about how much money we are going to make,''
said Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Phoenix. ``These companies are
acting out of a sense of enlightened self-interest. It is important
for them and for the city that Hartford is redeveloped, that it is
viewed as a destination and that we begin to retain some of the
young people, the working force of the future, that is leaving
Hartford, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is not struck, the state may have to resort to
costly and potentially lengthy condemnation proceedings. That has
the potential of delaying the start of construction of the stadium.
If there is a major delay, according to officials familiar with the
details of the bill passed by the General Assembly Tuesday, the
Krafts would still have the right to back out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The major stumbling block appears to be CTG Resources Inc. While
Phoenix and Travelers have some parking lots on the land, which
will have to be replaced if employees are going to have some place
to park their vehicles after Adriaen's Landing and the stadium
rise, CTG Resource's subsidiary, Connecticut Natural Gas, would
have to move both its headquarters and the steam plant somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective bill is $100 million, some portion of which
could come from the development costs of Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   But what officials at CTG Resources have in mind is unclear.
They were not commenting beyond a statement by a company
spokeswoman that discussions about the land are ``ongoing and
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press release issued in May, CTG Resources president and
chief executive officer Arthur C. Marquardt said that the company
was pleased about the prospect of joining in the Adriaen's Landing
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, moving all of our operations would be a huge
undertaking,'' Marquardt said. ``But if all the other pieces can
come together to make this happen, we think it would be well
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other pieces, according to business and government
sources close to the negotiations, is the possibility that CTG
Resources, through its subsidiary, Connecticut Natural Gas, might
become the energy provider to all of the facilities encompassed
within Adriaen's Landing, including the stadium. CTG Resources has
said publicly that would represent a 25 percent increase in its
downtown heating and cooling business.
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources, which announced in July of 1997 that it was
seeking to diversify and expand its business, has said it would
invest nearly $30 million of its own money as part of the steam
plant relocation if it becomes the energy supplier to Adriaen's
Landing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has publicly discussed a possible joint
venture with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority to
produce steam at the recovery authority's trash-to-energy plant in
the South Meadows section of the city, replacing the steam plant on
the stadium site.

LEE, BACON CAPITAL SET SIGHTS ON A ROCKY REIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of Boston's deeper pockets are stepping into a $1 billion
investment venture in one of the market's most dicey vehicles: a
rocky real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas H. Lee Co. and Alan Leventhal's Beacon Capital
Partners Inc. are among a group of four investors that have
proposed sinking the money into Patriot American Hospitality Inc.,
a cash-strapped trust that owns and operates hotels. Leon Black's
Apollo Management and a California firm are the other investors in
the proposal that would give them about 30 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much each partner would kick into the deal.
But the minimum investment is said to be $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is similar to some of Lee's other investments in
one aspect: It helps pump cash into an operating business
struggling with big debts run up in acquisition sprees. That was
the plan behind Lee's hugely successful investment in the
Cambridge-based software marketer Learning Co., which agreed to be
sold to Mattel Inc. this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot proposal is a greater departure for the year-old
Beacon Capital, created by Leventhal and partner Lionel Fortin a
year ago after they closed on the $4.4 billion sale of Beacon
Properties Corp. to Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Capital raised $470 million and set out to buy midsize
office properties, particularly buildings it could renovate or
somehow remarket to add more value.
</P>
<P>
   It started with local purchases that gave the company 2 million
square feet in East Cambridge, then ventured farther from home but
bought cautiously. The company bought property in Dallas and struck
two development deals on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Capital was widely seen as angling for an initial public
stock offering by the end of this year, though Leventhal would
never say so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the devastating market for real estate stocks that
put Beacon Capital's IPO plans on ice has a great deal to do with
its new investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot American is one of four paired-share real estate
investment trusts that can both own and operate property with
special tax advantages. Though much of that advantage has since
been eliminated, Patriot had already organized and grown itself
into a substantial owner/operator of hotel properties.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot American, based in Dallas, bought seven hotel companies
in the last year and ran into big trouble doing so. It ran up debts
of $1.7 billion that come due within the next 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market had been the answer for real estate investment
trusts that needed to fund acquisitions. But prices sank this year
and new stock sales were no longer a money-raising option.
</P>
<P>
   The market was a double-whammy for companies like Patriot
American. Their stocks were already slumping and then the ensuing
cash crunch made them even less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot stock, which traded above 28 at the start of 1998, sunk
to 6 3/8 last month. News of the investor group moved the stock
ahead by 3/4 to 7 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriot is obviously troubled and its most immediate issue is
liquidity,'' said Barry Vinocur, editor of Realty Stock Review.
``You've got a company in trouble in part due to its own making and
in part due to what's happened in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The new investment deal is not a sure thing. Though Patriot
American managers agreed to the investment in principal, details
have to be worked out and some investors are hoping a better offer
comes along.
</P>
<P>
   For Beacon Capital, the prospect of buying a real estate stock
for about a third of its 52-week high may beat the risk-reward
proposition of any real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Capital is loaded with money but has been tight with it
so far. By Sept. 30, it still had $192 million in cash and
extremely low leverage. Beacon has told investors it might borrow
to leverage up to 60 percent of its investments, but that figure
was just 16 percent at the end of the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Vinocur said Beacon Capital looked hard at 10 office buildings
that were put on the market by the Equitable Cos., but walked away.
Equitable announced a deal last week to sell the buildings for $470
million in cash and debt to TrizecHahn Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said Beacon Capital wasn't changing directions away
from direct office property investments with its pitch to Patriot
Ameirican. But he didn't sound like he was in a hurry to strike a
rash of new deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained very high return objectives and we have to
be very selective,'' said Leventhal. ``We're getting in at a good
value but also where fundamentals for growth are there. There are a
handful of those opportunities out there. We don't see a lot of
them.''

SKIING THE WEST'S CHOICE SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Susan and Ken McCain and their three kids began planning
their ski vacation out west this year, the choice came down to two
Colorado resorts: Aspen or Vail.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of ski areas in the West, these became finalists
largely because Susan once vacationed with friends at Vail while
Ken took a year off in his five-year college plan to ski bum at
Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only ski town I can think of with a real
old-fashioned hardware store, and I worked there,'' says Ken, a
financial planner who has been back a half-dozen times since the
early '70s, when he first saw the Rockies. ``I just want the kids
to see some real ski history, and Aspen is history. It still has an
original lift tower preserved from 50 years ago in the middle of
town. It's a kind of museum piece.''
</P>
<P>
   For Susan, Vail was site of her first Western ski experience in
1981, and she still hasn't gotten over the impact of first seeing
the back bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen anything bigger than Bosquet (in
Pittsfield),'' she says. ``We got there at night, and the next
morning, when I took that first lift ride at Lionshead, I nearly
fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   As the snow goose flies, Aspen and Vail are just miles apart.
And despite the presence of the many resort towns that have grown
up in the Rockies since the McCains first went west _ many of them
within an easy drive from Denver _ these two remain the icons of
Western skiing.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they are great ski areas, among the best in the
world by any measure. Which offers the better skiing is a
subjective matter. But both are steeped in ski history, even though
a skiing establishment had already taken shape, much of it in the
East, long before these two post-war areas appeared.
</P>
<P>
   As the presiding royalty of the Colorado Rockies, Aspen and Vail
are rivals with distinct personalities, and sniping between the two
is far from uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aspen used to be a great town,'' says Richard Lorne, a Beaver
Creek (Vail) regular, ``but now it's just a glitzy Hollywood East
theme park. I mean, it's OK if you want to go hang out looking for
movie stars.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the owner of a high-fashion boutique on Spring
Street, Aspen, echoed Gertrude Stein's famous line: ``Of course the
skiing's wonderful at Vail. But at Vail there's no there there.
It's just a great big generic ski area with an interstate highway
running through the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though it might be hard for either critic to overstate
the merits of his own ski area, they are overly dismissive of the
other. Both Vail and Aspen have strong cases to make.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Aspen is more historic. Through most of Aspen's
century as a gold and silver mining town, Vail was a sheep pasture
just on the west slope of the Great Divide of the Rockies. In the
late 19th century, the town had nearly 20,000 residents, but it
quickly became a forgotten backwater after the silver market
collapsed and the gold standard was adopted in 1893.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, Aspen languished as a tiny ranching community of a
few dozen people. Then, after World War II ended, Friedl Pfeifer,
one of the 10th Mountain Division veterans who built modern
American skiing, strung the first chairlift up the face of Ajax
(the tower of which is still on display, as McCain remembers) and
the second great Western resort _ after Sun Valley, Idaho _ was
born.
</P>
<P>
   In Aspen's first two decades, the town was a funky, rawboned ski
town where ski bums from the East wore cowboy hats for the first
time since they were 8-year-olds. The simplehearted love of skiing,
plus an odd job or two, could hold body and soul together for a
season of about 160 days on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen is still charming in its way, and the old Victorian
burnish still glows through an oft-lamented modern, huge-money
glitz that has always threatened the simple community spirit at
Aspen's center.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the modern day ski bum has a hard time making
ends meet at either Aspen or Vail, and that most live well outside
of town and usually work two jobs to support a dwindling number of
skiing days.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Aspen is getting almost offensively star-studded,
though the town is fighting growth almost as hard as it did in the
days when Hunter S. Thompson ran for sheriff on a platform of
closing Highway 82 to keep the tourists out.
</P>
<P>
   But what has only improved at Aspen is its skiing, largely
because of increased terrain. Each of four ski areas has its
distinct flavor, and at least one _ Buttermilk _ is perennially
underrated so that you often can have the place to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmass, largest of the four areas, has a somewhat
undistinguished village area (compared to downtown Aspen) but some
of the finest skiing anywhere, ranging from the ultimate of all
cruising areas, Big Burn, to the no-kidding experts-only area, The
Cirque. Were Snowmass the only mountain offering at Aspen, it would
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen Highlands, while once a rawboned steep 'n' deep area used
mainly by local powder hounds, is Aspen's latest acquisition and
provides the greatest challenge, with a number of precipitous
3-mile runs down the length of its nearly 4,000-foot vertical. With
only about 400 acres, the Highlands still has the greatest drop of
the Aspens.
</P>
<P>
   Ajax _ or Aspen Mountain itself _ has the character that once
drew the great skiers of the world to it. With lots of steep,
powdery, natural bump runs that give you 3 miles of skiing without
stopping, Ajax is noted for its expert terrain, without much for
lower-level skiers. Greatest drawback is that those lower-level
skiers add to the horrific crowds that build on this 600-acre
mountain (compared with the 2,100 of Snowmass).
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Aspen may not have much of that funky mining-camp feel
of the old days, as swishy high couture chains have ousted the
local shops, but it is still untouchable in ski country for its
dining and other apres-ski life. And for the celebrity-struck,
there's nothing close.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vail is _ as Aspen's diehard touters have it _ ``new'' to
the game (only 36 years old) and has a feel of neo-Tyrolean about
it, it is also true that many Europeans who ski at Vail _ including
ski racers who have seen everything _ call it their favorite
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Pete Seibert (another 10th Mountain veteran) as a
massive interconnect of intermediate slopes and vast back bowls,
Vail was built not as a reshod mining town but as a modern,
skier-friendly village for _ as Seibert envisioned _ the masses of
new skiers coming in the '60s and '70s. That was its purpose and
that is why Vail often tops the national polls as the No. 1
American ski area.
</P>
<P>
   While Vail is well-known and impressive in its own right, the
new action has been out at Beaver Creek, where the luxury resort
town (about 20 minutes west of Vail) has finally been completed.
Beaver Creek _ now home of one of the world's great downhill runs _
is a blend of fabulous skiing, most of it blue-cruisy, but with
some truly challenging in the Birds of Prey runs.
</P>
<P>
   Also new in the Vail lineup is Arrowhead, a longtime local area
that stretches the real estate further west and offers largely
low-end cruising terrain and an out-of-the-mainstream feel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Alpine World Championships, the off-year skiing
Olympics, were held in Vail, and this winter, a decade later,
they're back. Starting with Hermann ``The Harmannator'' Maier,
Olympic gold medalist from Nagano, to Italy's gold-winning Deborah
Compagnoni, to an entire lineup of young US skiers determined to
become known at these hometown games, the Vail worlds are a
precursor to the 2002 Olympic Games to be held at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   With 400 athletes of the World Cup in town and the thousands of
attendant race coaches, officials, and fans, the first two weeks in
February may not be the best vacation planning for Vail. But for
true ski racing fans, it will be a spectacle as it was a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the United States team is missing Tommy Moe, AJ Kitt, and
Kyle Rassmussen, all of whom retired, and Picabo Street, who
injured her knee. And Alberto Tomba has also hung them up. But
there's plenty to watch for race fans, who will find the access to
the aciton extremely easy. Like everything else done at Vail since
its conception in 1967, the racing is staged with skiers in mind _
by skiers, for skiers.

DIVERSIFIED ROSTER PUTS MAINE BACK NEAR THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORONO, Maine _ Jason Vitorino sat in the stands in Alfond Arena
Monday afternoon, wearing a cap that identified his affiliation
with Cafe Brazil in the Allston section of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Valter, an emigre from Minas Gerais, Brazil, started
out in this country as a dishwasher in a restaurant in Chestnut
Hill, Mass., and has owned Cafe Brazil for a dozen years. Jason
also has come a long way, rising to the top with the University of
Maine hockey team, which is ranked No. 4 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Vitorino may be the only player in college hockey to hold a
Brizalian passport, but he was born in the United States and lives
in Brookline, Mass. He played soccer with considerable success at
St. Sebastian, but his mother, Theresa, introduced him and older
brother Glenn, now a Brookline firefighter, to the ice at an early
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize I'm Brazilian because I don't have the
characteristics,'' said Vitorino. ``The guys kid me that if Brazil
had a team in the Olympics, I'd be there. Everyone jokes about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not all the tales are as exotic as Vitorino's, but the
Black Bears (10-1-2) are a true melting pot, with players from
Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Canada, as well as several from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And they're resilient. Their chemistry in the wake of penalties
imposed by the NCAA that forced a cutback in scholarships has been
a tribute to positive thinking.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the NCAA championship in 1993, they encountered
adversity in the form of NCAA sanctions for a variety of
infractions. As a result, coach Shawn Walsh served a one-year
suspension beginning in December 1996 and the Black Bears were
banned from the NCAA tournament in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Now Walsh is content that the house is in order, and there may
be a return to the NCAAs in his future. He kept in touch with the
game in his absence and has revitalized the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long process that really got dragged out,'' he said.
``We were in limbo for a long time. It was humbling. It's a
difficult thing to go through, and I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
But we persevered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players continued to play hard, and I think we stayed
positive. It showed in our Hockey East championship game appearance
in 1996 and 1998. Every year we've been eligible, we've reached the
Hockey East championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I think we did is we didn't get caught up in
whether it was fair or not. We tried to say, `OK, what can we do?
What's the most productive thing? How can we make a positive out of
this?' I'm thrilled we've been able to recover as quickly and
efficiently as we have with less scholarships than anybody else.
It's a credit to our kids. You look at pro sports, and the teams
with the best resources don't always win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused a little on Europe. We changed our recruiting areas
slightly. Hockey is one sport where you can recover. It's a buyer's
market. There are more players out there who are available for
scholarships than there are scholarships to go around. If you don't
panic and give away money too easy and be patient, you're going to
be able to find some quality players.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Walsh's current crop is dynamic Steve Kariya, who could
very well join brother Paul as a Hobey Baker Award winner and lead
the team to the NCAA Final Four in Anaheim, where Paul stars for
the Mighty Ducks. But more than the Kariya lineage illustrates that
Walsh is trying to keep things business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I've tried to do,'' he said, ``is to be
consistent and run the coaching end of the program the same way I
did it when I got here 15 years ago. That's to make the players
accountable. That's the key. I'm a believer in making the players
accountable to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun team. We've got the potential ingredients to be
a successful club. You start with five seniors who are all quality
guys who will graduate, and they haven't been to the NCAA
tournament. You add to it a freshman class that is deep. When
you've got those two ingredients, it's a good recipe for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who worked for an energy company in his year away from
coaching, has ridden the tide of change and come out on top. ``I
think more than anything,'' he said, ``I want to see these guys
enjoy the fun of an NCAA tournament run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to stay healthy. The most difficult part
of getting to Anaheim might be getting out of this league. I think
you can make a case that three of the best teams in the country
might be in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has emerged from exile with a sense of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people thought I was going to get fired by the NCAA,''
he said. ``They were going to come down and eliminate me. When you
go through an 18-month investigation, you have to have a sense if
you're going to come out on top. I'll never forget the 11 hours I
spent in the hearing in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear they understood the lack of institutional
control. I made mistakes. I should have been more detailed. I
assumed I understood the rules. I was asked to throw out the first
pitch at Fenway Park in July of 1993. The athletic department
invited all the players who were in New England at the time to join
me on the pitcher's mound and got 15 tickets for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA told me it was a violation because not every student
at Maine got a free ticket to a Red Sox game. I felt our players
deserved the opportunity. The thing that helped my situation was
each player had an individual interview and I told our guys to tell
them everything, to volunteer information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bare our souls. I didn't want anything hidden, and
that really helped us. The fact we had to sit out the 1997 playoffs
was disappointing. We persevered. It's behind us, and we're a lot
better for it. What has happened to this group of seniors has made
them a lot stronger and helped them grow as people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Cullen, whose uncle John is the career scoring leader at
Boston University, is one of the seniors who survived the troubles.
``I think not knowing what was going on with the program was the
hardest thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vitorino is blunter: ``I think the hardest part was they took
two years away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be their season, the best time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think personalitywise, we've got a good mix,'' said Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five seniors who are all leaders in their own distinct
ways,'' said Vitorino, ``and we have a lot of middle men who add a
lot of chemistry. We have a lot of recruits, and everyone's adding
their piece to the puzzle.''

NO FOOLING: UMASS NOW ALL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ There was plenty of reason to celebrate.
The University of Massachusetts had beaten Northwestern (La.) State
in Saturday's NCAA Division 1-AA semifinal, ensuring the second
trip to the national championship game in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the euphoria was put on hold. Instead, the mood in the
locker room was quite subdued. Businesslike. Coach Mark Whipple
surveyed the room and could not have been more pleased: The
Minutemen, who rebounded from last season's 2-9 campaign to earn a
postseason berth for the first time since 1990, showed once again
they were quick learners.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is new to the current Minutemen, who have staged
arguably the most successful season in the program's history. No
one could have held it against any of them for losing their
emotions a few times. Instead, they responded as if they had been
there before, knowing that the big prize still lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like, `All right, let's get drug-tested, get on the
bus and charter home, and get rested because we have a big game
next week,' '' said Whipple. He and the 11th-seeded Minutemen
(11-3) arrived in Chattanooga Wednesday night in preparation for
Saturday's 2 p.m. game against top-ranked, top-seeded Georgia
Southern (14-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``After (last Saturday's) game, they were not that euphoric,
like they were after the McNeese win,'' said Whipple, referring to
the Minutemen's first-round win at sixth-seeded McNeese State, the
school's first playoff victory in 10 years. ``I'm happy about that.
They want to save the celebration for another week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week marked the second time Whipple had taken a program to
a national semifinal. His 1992 University of New Haven team went
unbeaten through the Division 2 semifinals, where it lost at
Jacksonville (Ala.) State, 46-35.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said one reason that team did not advance to the final
was that it faced an intangiable this season's team had already
overcome once it reached the semifinal round: winning a playoff
game in a hostile road environment _ particularly one in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest the 1992 New Haven team had traveled all year was
Shepherdstown, W.Va., to play Shepherd College in its
regular-season finale. Against Jacksonville State, the Chargers
played before a partisan crowd of 5,084 and trailed, 21-14, then
rallied to take a 35-34 lead with 5:34 left in the game. But
Jacksonville State came up with two touchdown runs in the final
4:35 for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is better prepared to win a national
championship than that New Haven team that went to Alabama,'' said
Whipple. ``That was the significance of the McNeese State win. We
learned a lot, and that helped last week, when we beat Northwestern
State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen are the only squad in the 16-team playoff field to
win twice on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling to Alabama was new and different (for New Haven),''
said Whipple. ``It was the first time we had traveled that far.
Jacksonville State was a wishbone team that ended up winning the
game because it played great defense. Georgia Southern is a similar
team. The only saving grace is that the game is in Chattanooga and
not at Georgia Southern.''
</P>
<P>
   With his team's attitude intact, Whipple said he will spend the
week talking about the importance of playing a solid game from
start to finish. That will be key against Georgia Southern, which
has scored 170 first-quarter points and 150 fourth-quarter points
this season (611 total). GSU's opponents have scored a total of 308
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we will have a great week of practice,'' said
Whipple. ``We are still searching for that one great game. Not so
much a perfect game, but an excellent game. We played a great
second half last week, but we haven't done so from the start.''

LUMPS OF COAL FROM THE DUKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't you just love those ``personal'' mimeographed Christmas
letters that arrive in the mail at this time of year? It's usually
some boring cousin or former friend too lazy to send a fruitcake
and delusional enough to think you care what happened to them in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda is off at college, studying liberal arts (translation:
she's costing us $30 grand a year and can't pick a major). Chad is
traveling abroad (can't get a job). Jan is getting into needlepoint
(we're sleeping in separate bedrooms), and the cats are busy
tearing up the carpet in our new screened-in porch (I'd like to
drown 'em).
</P>
<P>
   Well, brace yourselves, Red Sox season ticket-holders, because
Dan Duquette's annual Christmas letter is in the mail, and this
year's edition is a real knee-slapper. A friend picked it up early
on the Sox web site (remember that the Duke says the Sox web site
and his radio show are the two best ways to keep abreast of ball
club news).
</P>
<P>
   The missive gets off to a rollicking start . . .
</P>
<P>
   Our purpose in this letter is to communicate directly with you,
our loyal and valued customers.
</P>
<P>
   (Pass the shovels, it's gonna get deep in here.)
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, who demonstrated his sincere appreciation for
all Red Sox fans' loyalty and support during a memorable moment
after our final game, had another outstanding year to secure his
name among baseball's consistent elite.
</P>
<P>
   (I drafted Nomie and signed him. He's my guy and he's a team
player, unlike that fat slob Mo Vaughn.)
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox appreciate Mo's contribution during his years with
the organization and recognize the significance of his loss.
However, our fans continue to indicate to us that they have a clear
understanding of the strong effort we made to sign Mo.
</P>
<P>
   (I hire only people who agree with me and my mail is screened
and I have no contact with real Sox fans, so I don't know what they
are thinking. But the people here in my office tell me you all
understand why we let Mo go.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we remind our fans not to lose sight of the fact
that virtually our entire club is returning next year.
</P>
<P>
   (Sure, we lost half of our offense, but we've still got Reggie
Jefferson and Troy O'Leary.)
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams has remarked many times since the end of last
season about how pleasantly surprised he was with the successful
combination of young catchers Jason Varitek and Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   (Hey, we know these guys are Triple A, but we figure we can fool
you suckers with minor league catching for another year.)
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis . . . will rejoin the successful core of Red Sox
outfielders including Troy O'Leary, Damon Buford, Darren Bragg and
Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   (Reminds you of Rice, Lynn, Evans, and Yaz, doesn't it?)
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has risen through the Red Sox minor league system and has
given Red Sox fans a glimpse of his undeniable ability . . .
</P>
<P>
   (I couldn't think of anything to say about Trot, so why not try
and fool the fans by citing his ``undeniable ability''?)
</P>
<P>
   Newly-acquired infielder Jose Offerman wil be a welcome addition
with his speed, defense at first or second base, and his bat.
</P>
<P>
   (I overpaid this guy by $6 million, and his defense reminds me
of Dick Stuart, but Stat Man likes him.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, because of the strength and depth of our minor
league system, we were able to acquire Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   (I know that's a whopper, but these lemming fans will probably
buy it.)
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of John Harrington and the entire Boston Red Sox
organization, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to you
for your loyalty, a loyalty that we do not take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   (Suckers!)
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate reality of our ticket price increase this year
is a product of our shared desire to be competitive in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (We don't have to pay Mo this year, we didn't sign any big free
agents, we gouged you with a 15 percent hike, we kicked the peanut
vendors off the streets, but we ``desire'' to be competitive.
Hahahaha.)
</P>
<P>
   All of us here at Fenway Park wish you and your family a happy
and safe holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   (Here's a lump of coal for your red stocking . . . from the Red
Sox.)
</P>
<P>
   (Dan Shaughnessy is a Globe columnist.)

 YARMOUTHPORT, Mass.: ... to yours!  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bits of assimilated Gorey-iana:
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Chicago, where his father worked as a reporter for
the Hearst newspapers, covering what Gorey recalls as the crime
beat. An only child, he rarely saw his father in the years before
his parents divorced, when Gorey was 11. The couple remarried 16
years later. In between, Gorey's father took up with a nightclub
singer named Corrina Mura, best remembered as the singer in
``Casablanca'' who rouses Rick's patrons to sing ``La
Marseillaise.''
</P>
<P>
   A bookish child, Gorey read all of Victor Hugo by age 8
(something he would not do today ``on threat of torture,'' Gorey
snickers) and began to draw semiseriously when he was still in
diapers. Children's literature and illustrating were and are
consuming passions of his. Later these obsessions were augmented by
Gorey's great love for the ballet, for movies, and most notably for
the theater, the medium in which he most often collaborates these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Richards, a Cape-based actor and community theater veteran,
has worked closely with Gorey in 10 local productions since 1987.
Written and directed by Gorey himself, the plays and puppet shows
are, like the rest of the artist's oeuvre, quirky, surrealistic,
hilarious, and often maddeningly inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Gorey is ``not like any theater I've ever done,''
says Richards. ``The writing is so precise and complex, you need to
know what you're doing. But they're all works in progress, too.
What we end up doing is not necessarily what Edward has drawn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey's career took comparable swerves. After a stint in the
army, he matriculated at Harvard in 1946, where he fell in with a
group of artists, writers, and poets that included Adrienne Rich,
Donald Hall, Robert Bly, and Frank O'Hara, with whom Gorey roomed.
The group's center of intellectual energy was the Poet's Theater in
Cambridge, to which Gorey also gravitated. Other than publishing
some drawings in the Harvard Lampoon, however, Gorey gave few
indications that he would make himself a career as a professional
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have my own bookstore, until I worked in one,'' he
recalls. ``Then I thought I'd be a librarian, until I met some
crazy ones. I hoped to get into publishing, but at 28 my parents
were still helping me out. Which wasn't good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey moved to New York in the early '50s, his home _ aside from
extended stays on the Cape _ for the next two decades. Staff jobs
at Doubleday and Bobbs Merrill supplemented income from his book
jackets and illustrations. Gorey's first book, ``The Unstrung
Harp,'' appeared in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one had seen anything quite like it, certainly not from a
contemporary artist. Gorey's perverse, Edwardian-inspired
penmanship and absurdist wit captured the fancy of admirers like
The New Yorker's Edmund Wilson. In later years, as Gorey withdrew
from the Manhattan demimonde, his work achieved more mainstream
recognition. He won a 1978 Tony award for costume design on
``Dracula,'' the long-running Broadway hit. Posters he designed for
the New York City Ballet and New York City Opera, along with the
opening sequence for PBS's ``Mystery!'' series, made Gorey's work
instantly familiar to millions of new fans.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all and even to this day, Gorey self-published small
batches of exquisite books like ``The Doubtful Guest'' and ``The
Curious Sofa,'' a pornographic romp (``Still later Gerald did a
terrible thing to Elsie with a saucepan'') that has become a
collectors' item. Early Gorey books that sold new for 50 cents now
trade for $750 or more. A major Gorey drawing fetches $5,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Brown, owner of the Gotham Book Mart in Manhattan, has
played a pivotal role in furthering Gorey's career, both
commercially and aesthetically. Brown has mounted exhibitions of
Gorey's drawings, arranged for Gorey's earliest work to be reissued
in anthology form and even persuaded Samuel Beckett, who became a
huge fan of the artist's, to publish two texts accompanied by Gorey
illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Says Brown, ``Edward is as uncommercial as any creative person
I've ever known. You have to nudge him, but you must not nudge him
too aggressively. He'd come to his own openings, but only
reluctantly. He never made a fuss, he just tolerated us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey is also hard to categorize, Brown points out. His books
are neither kids' books nor adult books nor books of cartoons, at
least in the conventional sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose his aesthetic soulmate is someone like Edward
Lear,'' says Brown. ``But there are no classic 19th-century
illustrators or contemporary graphic artists quite like Edward. He
truly is a unique and peculiar genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were ever accused of being too macabre _ too
downbeat _ for the mainstream, Gorey shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replies, ``nobody ever quite said that. From the
beginning, though, everyone thought I'd be much more popular than I
am. Publishers expected to do much better with my books than they
did. I can't explain it. I've never even tried to do anything but
what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for cult worship, lately manifested by multiple Gorey Web
sites and such, Gorey (who doesn't even own a computer) expresses
both bafflement and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little more of it than I care to have,'' he says
with a deep sigh. ``When I think of other things that attain cult
status, they strike me as somewhat feebleminded. I mean, I suppose
it's better being a cult object than nothing at all. But I don't
see how anyone has time to be really famous. I might get people
dropping by who are slightly'' _ he raises one eyebrow _
``unhinged.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposes continuing the conversation over lunch. Climbing
into Gorey's black VW, the one parked outside with the OGDRED
vanity plate (part of one of Gorey's anagram pen names), you make
your way to Jack's Outback, a local bistro where Gorey takes
sustenance _ nutritional and social _ virtually every day.
</P>
<P>
   On the counter rests a large bowl filled with bills and coins.
Above it a sign reads, ``Pray Forget Not the Widows and Orphans.''
The illustration is by Gorey. You peruse the day's menu, scrawled
upon the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fruitcake?'' you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruitcake?'' says Gorey in mock disbelief. ``My mother used to
spend entire summers making fruitcake. She wrapped them in brandied
cloth. I always gave them away. I could never bear to say, `Mother,
I hate fruitcake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He scribbles down his lunch order. ``Actrally, someone gave me
one a few years ago,'' he says, eyes twinkling. ``I ate it. It
wasn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyeux Noel!

a Web page of my very own. For two months now, I've been leading a
parallel existence in cyberspace, meeting every week with about 200
visitors, corresponding with them through e-mail, entering into
what at times feels like a ghostly shadow life.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondence with my Web site guests bears little
resemblance to letters from readers that I can hold in my hand,
each of them with a unique style of writing and choice of paper,
each clearly marked with a return address. My brain is used to
visualizing the writer of a real letter. I picture a person. I
position her on my map of the world. I take her thoughts into my
mind. When I've finished with a pile of snail mail, it feels like
having eaten a satisfying meal.
</P>
<P>
   It may be gone, but it's made a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, it was strange to watch all traces of my first 25
e-mails disappear with the press of a button. The words on the
screen, at least in this early stage, felt totally disembodied. The
lack of ordinary signifiers left me feeling disoriented. Are Pat,
Chris, and Terry male or female? Where in the world is
blank.net(at)gobbledygook? And though I'm able to face a stack of
regular mail calmly, I still feel an enormous pressure to answer my
e-mails at one sitting. I have to get through them before another
batch of messages arrive and overwhelm me.
</P>
<P>
   So I did not savor. I did not reflect. I did not carefully
compose my replies. I skimmed. I dashed something off. I deleted.
And when I was done, there was nothing, not even a memory
differentiating one message from the other. When I finished with my
task, it felt like having eaten a meal while watching a video. The
only reason I knew I'd done it was because everything on my plate
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   I've since discovered there are mailboxes in cyberspace for
saving messages. I've printed out a few I wanted to save. I've come
to appreciate that I have readers in Louisiana and Alaska and
California, some of whom read me in their local papers, others who
receive weekly copies of my column from their moms. People send
e-mails who would never write because once you arrive at my site,
it's so sinfully easy to click on my address.
</P>
<P>
   I'm blessed. The folks who visit my site are mostly trying to be
helpful _ sending me their favorite soy recipes, sharing the
information that delphi.com offers free forum space so that family
members all over the country can keep in touch via the Internet,
passing along inspirational stories, expressing their concern that
it may not be safe to make myself so accessible. The dearest insist
that I need not reply. Others ask me questions about how I got rid
of my pantry moths or where my husband and I stayed during our
visit to the Cinque Terre. Our exchange is a quick Q &AMP; A, a truly
interactive process.
</P>
<P>
   With a difference, though. Nobody beats around the bush on
e-mail. They skip the niceties. They give it to you straight.
</P>
<P>
   Take this comment on how I look in my Web site photos. ``There's
something out of proportion about your eyeglasses,'' writes someone
who calls herself krog. ``They're a little too Sally Jesse
Raphael.'' Doesn't SJR's signature look involve red glasses? Mine
are tortoiseshell and they look fine. Well, I used to think they
did. Now I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Here's more e-talk. ``By the way, you look much better than one
would think from reading your column.'' Now that's a statement with
the power to stop me cold. Do I write like a homely person? Do I
sound like someone whose soul has been seared by the pain of not
being pretty enough? If I were to construe that comment as a
compliment (no easy task), I could conclude that I can't be
mistaken in print for a dumb beauty pageant contestant, but why
insult beautiful women?
</P>
<P>
   Now that we're so interactive, I can ask you to help.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world did she mean?
</P>

LOST AT SEA 
An American Tragedy 
By Patrick Dillon 
Dial Press, 264 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1983, two crabbing vessels capsized and sank, with
the loss of all hands, off the Aleutian Islands _ within hours of
leaving port and almost certainly within a few miles of each other.
The winds were light and the seas calm, for those waters, but there
had been no distress calls, no maydays.
</P>
<P>
   That the Americus and the Altair were sister ships from the same
port, Anacortes, Wash., and many of the 14 men in the two crews
were friends from boyhood, would have marked it as a devastating
tragedy for that close-knit community.
</P>
<P>
   But two other Alaskan crabbers had already been lost that
season; another was to go down just two weeks later; and by the
time the winter crabbing season closed, eight vessels had capsized
and sunk, with the loss of 21 crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   As West Coast journalist Patrick Dillon explored the story of
the Americus and the Altair, it became clear to him that the fatal
combination of perilous Arctic waters, a short and frenzied
crabbing season, and the absence of safety regulations had created
the conditions for disaster and death.
</P>
<P>
   For New England readers, ``Lost at Sea'' will prompt comparison
with Sebastian Junger's best-selling ``The Perfect Storm.''
Junger's yarn had the advantage of a memorable storm, the Halloween
``No-Name'' northeaster of October 1991, whose brunt had also been
felt along the New England coast, and of the descriptions of the
sea's fury in radio transmissions from the lost swordfisher Andrea
Gail and ships that survived the storm.
</P>
<P>
   There are wrenching moments in ``Lost at Sea,'' as when the
crewmen on two other Anacortes crabbers, standing by the capsized
hull of the Americus, watch it sink with the knowledge that the
bodies of their friends are entombed within it.
</P>
<P>
   But Dillon is not trying to compete with Junger, for his story
focuses on the investigation to determine why the two vessels had
been lost _ and the ensuing effort to pass safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The very way that the crab fisheries operated created the
conditions for disaster. The 80- to 100-foot vessels would gather
at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians, carrying extra fuel from their
home ports (where it was cheaper). After offloading the extra fuel,
they would load some 200 700-pound crab pots and head for the
fishing grounds off the Pribilof Islands, set the pots, return for
a second load _ and then head off to drop these and pull the first
drop when the season officially opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a season these vessels were participating in.''
writes Dillon, ``it was a short-term frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Americus and the Altair were state-of-the-art vessels
with experienced crews; they were apparently capable of operating
safely even in extreme conditions. Their designer was so confident
of their seaworthiness that he speculated that the Americus and
Altair must have collided.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-year investigation by the Coast Guard and National
Transportation Safety Board determined that because of the placing
of additional fishing gear on the decks, and the practice of
offloading fuel and then filling crab tanks with seawater, the
vessels were inherently unstable. The result, concluded the
principal investigator, a professor of mechanical engineering, was
``synchronous rolling,'' a series of short, sharp heels from which
the vessel does not recover. ``Even in small seas,'' he said, it
would have taken ``only a few rolls'' for the overloaded crabbers
to capsize.
</P>
<P>
   And worse, the skippers were unaware of the consequences of the
routine loading and tanking practices they followed. ``The captains
and crews,'' writes Dillon, ``sailed out into the Bering Sea that
last time, as they had always done, in the comfort of complete
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it took a grass-roots lobbying campaign by a
Washington insider _ a diplomat's wife whose son had been lost in
the sinking of another crabber _ and the efforts of Massachusetts
Congressman Gerry Studds to secure passage of safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an understated book, long on the findings of
investigators and short on the emotions of survivors. But in a
vividly written epilogue, Dillon recounts his experiences as a
crewman on a crabber for four weeks during the 1995 winter season.
</P>
<P>
   As they reached open water, Dillon writes, ``the seas got
bigger, and I noticed that an overtone of violence and anger began
to pervade my crewmates as they worked. . . . Coils of line and
links of chain were slammed about, curses came more readily, and
taunts became harsher. The crew, it seemed, was working itself into
a state of violent equilibrium with the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was, Dillon writes, ``the one more experience'' he felt
it necessary to have in order to understand the tragedy of the
Americus and the Altair.

NEWSPAPERS, LOCAL TV FIND AUDIENCE SHRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a 1993 article in Wired magazine, ``Jurassic Park''
author Michael Crichton declared himself an expert on dinosaurs and
predicted another extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it is likely that what we now understand as the
mass media will be gone within 10 years,'' proclaimed Crichton.
``Vanished without a trace.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most prophecies, Crichton's pronouncement contained a
heaping dose of exaggeration, but it also contained a grain of
truth, especially for two pillars of the mass media: newspapers and
local television newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither medium is likely to disappear, but many of their readers
and viewers have, suggesting that newspapers and TV newscasts are
confronting one of the starkest challenges in their history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local TV news viewership is declining nationally, and the same
thing is true of network news and newspapers,'' said Tom
Rosenstiel, vice chairman of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism. ``People are less interested in the news as journalists
define it because they have more power to define the news for
themselves. They can troll Web sites, look for information on their
hobbies, or check out the ballgame scores on line as soon as they
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout in the Boston area is suggested by some telling
numbers. Since the 1990s began, The Boston Globe's weekday
circulation has decreased by about 50,000, roughly 10 percent,
while the Boston Herald's daily circulation has dropped by about
87,000 copies, almost 25 percent. The Patriot Ledger in Quincy has
lost more than 15 percent. According to a 1998 survey of the top 50
markets by Scarborough Research, the Boston area ranked second with
69 percent of adults regularly reading a daily paper. That sounds
impressive, but as recently as 1994, the number was 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is no rosier on the TV side. Last month, viewership
of the three leading Boston newscasts dropped 50,000 households
from the levels of the previous year. But that was nothing compared
with the losses local stations have sustained over the long term.
When measured against 20 years ago, the combined audiences for the
11 p.m. newscasts of the three top news stations _ WCVB-Ch. 5,
WHDH-Ch. 7, and WBZ-Ch. 4 _ are down 190,000 viewers, about 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So where have all the faithful readers of newspapers and
watchers of the TV newscasts gone? To sleep, to cyberspace, to
cable TV, or perhaps they're just stuck in Boston traffic.
Lifestyle changes and the ``time famine'' afflicting dual-earner
households are key factors, as is the inescapable fact that the
public stage holds fewer colorful newsmakers and less-compelling
issues nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from the local political scene are larger-than-life
figures, from Kevin White to William M. Bulger, who brought eyes to
the TV screen and the front page. Vanished with them are the kind
of momentous battles _ over busing, taxes, and social spending _
that galvanize public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Waning interest in news ``has to do with the economic and
political community having smoothed out the bumpy ride that used to
bring politics into sharp relief,'' said political consultant Lou
DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Chervinsky, who polls for the Globe and Channel 4, said
his surveys show a steady decline of public interest in subjects
like politics. ``People spend less time with the newspaper and TV
news because, ultimately, people are less concerned with issues
that do not directly affect them,'' said Chervinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to cherry-pick topics of personal interest is one
reason analysts say the news-on-demand nature of the Internet and
such cable channels as CNN and New England Cable News has made them
increasingly strong rivals to newspapers and TV newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of Internet traffic doubles every 100 days, with an
estimated 5 million to 7 million more households going on line each
year. While there is conflicting data as to whether that cuts down
on reading of newspapers and viewing of newscasts, media executives
in Boston _ a city that Newsweek magazine has dubbed one of the
world's 10 most cyber-savvy cities _ are already drawing
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two years, there's been a sea change in how
people get their information,'' said WCVB-Ch. 5 news director Candy
Altman. ``Now, if you're at work and you want to know something,
you log on to any one of a number of sites. News is now a
24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week available resource for people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the day, people are exposed to so much more information
than they used to be: on line at home and at work, radio news,
cable news,'' said media consultant Marty Sender. ``By 11 o'clock,
what is there left to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers of the 11 p.m. newscasts have also migrated to the
two 10 p.m. newscasts in Boston, on WLVI-Ch. 56 and WFXT-Ch. 25,
though analysts believe many have also tuned out newscasts in favor
of syndicated reruns of shows like ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' or
original entertainment programs on cable. In addition, network
prime-time audiences _ on which local affiliates rely for lead-in
audiences for newscasts _ are off 9 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. has concluded that ``consumers'
dependence on TV, newspapers, and radio wanes as time on line
increases.'' As an example, one survey found that after spending
several years on line, consumers tend to choose the Internet over
newspapers as a source for stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, traditional news organizations are adapting to
these realities. Altman notes that many Internet ``hits'' during
major news events come from readers visiting TV-run Web sites such
as Channel 5's, and says newscast audience measurements must take
that added audience into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers are very aggressive in having a very strong
position on line,'' for both ``offensive and defensive'' reasons,
said Kevin Lavalla, managing director of newspaper publishing at
the Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates investment banking firm. Given the
rapid proliferation of newspaper Web sites, he added, the newspaper
company of the future may produce a product that is part electronic
and part newsprint.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe's Web site, for example, was launched about
three years ago. It has attracted 60 on-line partners and averages
between 20 and 25 million page views per month, and almost 2
million people say they visit the site at least once a month.
Signficantly, the majority of that cyber-traffic comes during
business hours on Monday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One factor working in favor of the on-demand media, which can be
accessed at work, is the time crunch. A major study released by the
Newspaper Association of America _ called ``So Many Choices, So
Little Time'' _ found that nearly half of those who didn't read a
daily paper complained of a shortage of free time.
</P>
<P>
   When UMass journalism professor Ralph Whitehead started
commuting from Western Massachusetts to Boston a quarter-century
ago, he didn't hit serious traffic until Concord. Now the
bottlenecks start near Gardner. ``A.M. commuting times are a big
competition to the morning newspaper,'' said Whitehead. One
possible indicator: During this decade in which Boston's dailies
have lost circulation, the morning-drive audience of WBUR-FM (90.9)
has increased by about 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of specialized news, another threat to the old media
order is viewer fragmentation caused by the niche programming
available on cable (an option that seems more attractive this year,
with a network prime-time lineup widely viewed as dismal). Among
the top 10 TV markets in the country, Boston has the highest
percentage of cable subscribers (79 percent).
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Jim Thistle, the director of broadcast journalism
at Boston University and a news director at channels 5 and 7 in the
1970s and early 1980s. ``On the day Kenneth Starr was in the
Capitol testifying, the networks carried his opening statement, but
when the congressmen started to ask their questions, the networks
fled,'' said Thistle. ``So I went right over to MSNBC,'' an
all-news cable network.
</P>
<P>
   So many viewers are choosing the cable option, and the audience
for local news has shrunk so drastically, that Boston news stations
can now win the ratings race with far fewer viewers. ``It's a whole
different ballgame,'' said Thistle. ``You're in a bloody
competition for an eroding audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The erosion in Boston's newspaper audience is in line with
long-term trends afflicting much of the industry. According to
statistics compiled by Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates, total national
weekday circulation plunged from 63.1 million in 1984 to 56.7
million in 1997. According to the newspaper association, 67 percent
of Americans regularly read a daily newspaper in 1977. Twenty years
later, that figure had fallen to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trends are sobering,'' declared the association's survey.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of those 65 or older are regular newspaper
readers, as opposed to 36 percent of those between 18 and 34. While
58 percent of those with incomes over $50,000 are regular readers,
that number drops to 41 percent of those earning less than $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalla, the investment banker, said the devoted newspaper
reader fits a familiar lifestyle pattern: When you marry, buy a
home, and send your children to the local schools, ``suddenly,
you're very interested in your community. You need to read the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But changes in population patterns mean that increasing numbers
of Boston-area residents do not have the local newspaper habit. A
new economic report by MassINC and the Teresa and H. John Heinz III
Foundation shows that between 1990 and 1997, 220,000 more
Massachusetts residents left the state than came here. At the same
time, the state has seen an influx of roughly 112,000 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is changing. Massachusetts really is becoming a
very different state,'' said Tripp Jones, executive director of
MassInc. ``The repercussions of this change are certainly
far-reaching.'' And they may well extend to news habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even among longtime residents, those habits are changing. John
Gorman, who runs the Opinion Dynamics polling firm, once read four
daily papers and made sure his office was filled with 10 to 15
copies of the Globe. Today, he consumes far less newsprint and
keeps only 2 copies of the Globe at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here has a Web browser,'' he said.

SHOVELING FRESH MANURE NOW MAY SAVE A LOAD OF WORK LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now is the time to shovel out the barn, load up the manure pile,
and head for the garden!
</P>
<P>
   Don't have a barn? Or a manure pile? Well, excepting my
well-dogged back yard, neither do I, but I do have a list of
sources of free manure.
</P>
<P>
   There's a turkey farm with a bodacious pile (and some truly
noisy and nervous feathered neighbors), a miniature horse farm (and
all that that would seem to entail), and a couple in Carver with
some horses and assorted other farm animals that like to stand
around and watch, wide-eyed, as I heave shovelsful of barn
sweepings into the back of my pickup.
</P>
<P>
   So I have plenty of fresh manure, and you can, too, simply by
keeping your eyes open when you travel, perhaps placing a notice in
the local paper's classified ads or on a well-placed bulletin
board. You'll need a truck or a car you really don't care about, a
shovel, maybe plastic containers (if you are lucky enough to find
some cows).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, this is all ``hot'' manure, meaning it has
not broken down, or composted, and cannot be placed on top of or
next to living plants. It can be composted in a bin or pile for a
month or more, but I prefer to spread it directly on barren plots
in so-called sheet composting. That's what I'll be doing this
month. I'll mix it with wood ashes and some not fully composted
plant material and layer it on several inches thick, mostly in the
veggie garden and some in the front rose garden (though not right
up against the plants). After two months, it is safe to plant seeds
and seedlings, and for dormant perennials to re-emerge because the
manure has rotted enough.
</P>
<P>
   Along with composted plant material, nothing is better than
manure for improving the soil, and hence the garden, and although I
get to shovel the manure three times (into and out of the truck and
then onto the beds), the real work doesn't start until Steve's
Special Manure Mix (yum) is down.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a host of bacteria and fungi and earthworms have at
it. The bacteria, in breaking down the material, can consume some
of the nitrogen that plants need. That's not a problem during cold
weather, when plants are dormant or not present at all. Because
horse manure is more wood chips than manure, and the larger chips
take longer to break down, nitrogen may remain in short supply, and
I will add chemical fertilizer high in nitrogen early next growing
season.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the manure-compost mix will be adding, not tying up,
nitrogen. While some of that nitrogen comes from the manure and
compost, conditions also become ripe for azotobacter bacteria,
which ``fixes'' nitrogen from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen is one of the three primary nutrients. Phosphorus and
potassium are the others. Chemical fertilizers are marked with
N-P-K numbers, the letters being the chemical symbols for those
elements. A 10-10-10 fertilizer has 10 parts of nitrogen and enough
phosphorus and potassium to make 10 parts each of phosphate and
potash, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Plants need another 13 elements, probably more, to grow,
including calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are called
secondary elements; carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and the
micronutrients iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc,
and chlorine. Building the soil with manures and composts and other
materials is the way to ensure a good mix of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Plant biochemistry is complex (and boring, my wife says), but a
few of the uses of these chemicals are: nitrogen helps to form
amino acids, which are used in forming cell protoplasm; nitrogen
and manganese are part of the chlorophyll molecule, necessary for
photosynthesis; phosphorus stimulates early root formation and
growth; potassium is important in plant metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   As my manure and compost decomposes, carbohydrates and proteins
break down and release nutrients such as nitrogen, sulfur, and
phosphorus. Fats, waxes, and resins, more resistant to breaking
down, provide sulfur and phosphorus. And lignin, very resistant to
rotting, helps form humus, the colloidal remains of organic matter.
This crumbly stuff, stuck together, helps texture the soil, leaven
the battering effect of rain, buffer soil pH, and retain moisture
and nutrients in solution.
</P>
<P>
   Another crumbly, stuck-together material is worm castings. Worms
eat organic matter, transforming the nutrients into forms that are
more available to plants. The castings also perform some of the
physical functions of humus. Worms also produce enzymes that enable
bacteria to work more efficiently. Worms are good, and I am blessed
with a billion or so.
</P>
<P>
   Other processes undertaken by soil organisms include
ammonification, in which ammonium is released, providing nitrogen
in a form useful to plants, and nitrification, which converts some
ammonium to nitrates, also useful. Organisms also convert sulfur in
complex organic forms into sulfates, which can be used by plants.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be busy in a week or so, shoveling manure, working up a
sweat in the cold of December so that in spring I won't have to
sweat the tilth and fertility of my soil.

   ``I saw the real Santa,'' 5-year-old Nader says solemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did?!'' asks Shirley Gallerani, with appropriate
astonishment. ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the furniture store. I knew he was the real Santa by his
beard.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Nader's preschool classmates at the Rockwell Center at
Lasell College in Newton, Mass. dispute his analysis. The beard,
they agree, is a dead giveaway, a sure-fire strategy for spotting
fake Santas. Gallerani, director of Lasell's laboratory schools,
delights in imagining each of these youngsters sitting on Santa's
lap, scrutinizing his beard for telltale signs that this is yet
another man playing dress-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imagination is so rich at this age, Santa is magic for
them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That he's magical is what allows children to accept that there
is only one Santa and many impersonators. After all, how else could
the real Santa get to all the stores and listen to all the
children's requests? ``He has to have so many helper Santas,'' one
child tells Gallerani, ``because he has so many toys to make and he
has to teach the reindeer to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, however, the magic wears thin. The 4-year-old may
accept on faith that chubby old St. Nick can make it down a skinny
chimney just because he can. The 7- or 8-year-old may not be able
to tolerate such a discrepancy of logic.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what our children's ages, the trick for parents is to
see Santa through their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know parents who are uncomfortable with Santa because it's a
lie,'' says developmental psychologist Melanie Killen, an associate
professor at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a lie, it's one that's OK to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a deception with bad intent,'' says Killen. Gallerani
says, ``To think of it as a lie is unfortunate because it deprives
children of a wonderful fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   From imaginary friends to the Tooth Fairy, toddlers and
preschoolers buy into magical characters for two reasons, says
child psychologist Richard Weinberg, director of the Institute of
Child Development at the University of Minnesota: Children are
cognitively unable to separate fantasy from reality, and they gain
autonomy by being able to exercise control over them. If a
4-year-old thinks Santa took two bites from the cookie on the
mantle, who's to say he didn't?
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a 3- to 5-year-old to buy into Santa so
much that he's frightened. ``The idea of some big, bearded man
coming to the house at night can be scary,'' says early childhood
educator Ellen Galinsky. Rather than chide him for his fear _
``Don't be silly, Santa's a good guy'' _ validate it: ``I know some
kids do worry about having Santa come to our house.'' That may be
enough to calm him.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some preschoolers may like the idea of sitting on
Santa's lap but change their mind once they get there. No matter
how long you've been standing in line, no matter how much you want
that photo, honor a change of heart matter-of-factly: ``It's OK to
leave. We can try it another time/year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning to question
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 5, many children begin to question Santa but won't
necessarily tell you so. Killen says they continue to pretend
because they enjoy it, just as we do. Some may even think that by
voicing their doubts, they jinx Santa or themselves. Indeed, some
children may keep their questions to themselves for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your child is developmentally at the stage where he
probably is questioning Santa, this is not one of the subjects
where you need to initiate a conversation just to make the topic
speakable. ``They have enough bubbles burst in their lives as it
is,'' says Weinberg. ``If they want to hold on a little longer, I
wouldn't question why.'' Killen says leaving it to a child to
decide when to let go of the fantasy is a way to grant autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child does start to ask questions _ How does he make
the reindeer fly? How does he get to every house? Does he really
eat our cookies? _ take your cues from her. If she's easily
satisfied with a mysterious smile, a twinkle in your eye, and an
``I-always-thought-he-was-real'' answer, she's likely testing the
waters but wanting to hold on a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Galinsky's son and daughter fell into that category beginning at
about age 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would leave Santa a note and he would leave them a poem.
It became a game, to figure out the handwriting or match the ink to
our pen,'' she says. Even at 9, Lara still was ambivalent. One
summer on a family vacation in Italy, she lost a tooth. As always,
she left the Tooth Fairy a note. Galinsky stayed up half the night
with a dictionary, writing back in Italian. ``She was confused for
quite a while after that,'' she says. Galinsky is president of the
Families and Work Institute in Manhattan and co-author of ``The
Preschool Years'' (Ballantine).

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying the ritual
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some children, being strung along isn't appropriate. If a
child says in a clear way, ``I want to know,'' then it is not only
deceitful but disrespectful not to be truthful, says Killen. Even
as you acknowledge Santa isn't real, however, there are ways to
enable a child to continue to enjoy the ritual:
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about how even as an adult, you still enjoy the fun and
fantasy of Santa: ``It's a wonderful story; it makes me feel good
to think about Santa, even though I know he isn't real.''
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about how Santa symbolizes the spirit of giving: ``I know
Santa isn't real, but what I love about him so much is the way he
makes people feel good about giving.''
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about not spoiling it for younger children: ``This is our
secret; your sisters still believe.'' Killen says a child can feel
grown-up to help you maintain the fantasy for others.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a year, Gallerani says she'll overhear one
preschooler challenge another's belief in Santa: ``My mom/my
brother says Santa isn't real.'' She tells teachers to respond in a
way that satisfies both children's needs _ ``In Jimmy's family,
they believe in Santa; in Todd's family, they don't'' _ without
getting into the validity of either point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same strategy Killen recommends for families who
don't celebrate Christmas. ``Santa needs to be talked about because
it's everywhere,'' she says. ``Luckily,'' she adds, ``since kids
are exposed to diversity at an early age these days, they can
handle the concept that in our family we don't celebrate Christmas
or believe in Santa Claus, but other families do, and we want to be
respectful of their traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The parental adjustment
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many families, it's often harder for us to let go of our
children's belief in Santa that it is for them.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago at bedtime, 8-year-old Kate Nolan of Mansfield
said to her mother, ``It's hard to believe Santa makes all those
toys and delivers them in just one night, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do that. He's magical,'' said her mother, Joanne.
</P>
<P>
   When Kate responded, ``It would make more sense to me that you
and Daddy buy all the stuff,'' Joanne's heart sank. ``Don't you
like the idea of Santa?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, but it just doesn't make sense to me. He's too big for a
chimney. We don't even have a chimney.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne was quiet, contemplating this milestone of her first-born
and the loss it meant for her as a parent. When Kate said, ``Mom, I
really want to know,'' she bit the bullet and admitted Santa wasn't
real. Now Kate was quiet. Joanne tried to see in the dark if she
was crying. ``Are you OK with that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really nice you and Daddy buy all that stuff for
us,'' Kate said. Kate wasn't crying, but Joanne was. Her daughter
was even more grown-up than she had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --To avoid the greediness that can come when children think
everything comes from Santa, set some rules when your children are
young. For instance, Santa only brings stocking gifts, or only one
present per person. That way, you can have conversations about
value and price of gifts, when appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't take a preschooler to see Santa unless she asks to go.
</P>
<P>
   --Children of all ages love rituals. You don't have to believe
in Santa or observe Christmas to create some.
</P>
<P>
   --Take turns to open gifts. That helps focus children on another
person's pleasure in receiving, which you can translate into the
joy of giving: ``Did you see how much Grandpa liked your gift?
Didn't that make you feel good inside?''
</P>
<P>
   --In families where Christmas isn't observed, it's not unusual
for children to wish for Santa. Avoid becoming defensive or angry.
Instead, validate her feeling or grant her her wish in fantasy:
``Our house would look pretty decorated, wouldn't it?'' ``If we did
celebrate Christmas, what would you ask Santa for?''
</P>
<P>
   --The predictability of Santa and the Tooth Fairy can be a
source of comfort and security.
</P>
<P>
   --Many children who don't believe or outgrow believing in Santa
nonetheless believe in the Tooth Fairy. It's a good example of how
children use magical thinking; it doesn't trouble them to know one
is not real and to think the other is and shouldn't bother us,
either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT: If you receive a hand-me-down car seat, find out
if it's more than six years old or been in a crash. Parts may be
worn or damaged, jeopardizing safety, according to Century, a
manufacturer of car seats.

ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This column was supposed to be in the paper on Monday. But on
Sunday I felt unwell, so I called in sick.
</P>
<P>
   Before I called in sick, I agonized over it. Should I call in
sick? Do I really feel bad enough not to show up at work? I felt
pretty awful. But how awful? How awful do you need to feel to call
in sick? Don't I owe it to my employer to drag myself in and write
something? On the other hand, I felt dreadful. Which is worse, a
bad column or no column at all?
</P>
<P>
   I went back and forth, and forth and back and pretty soon I felt
even worse. So I called in sick. And then I felt really terrible. I
shouldn't have given in. I should have crawled to my desk and
produced something, anything. On the other hand, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I saw a new doctor and was given a long personal
history to complete before my appointment. I was zipping right
through it, before I came to a question that stopped me cold: What
are your hobbies and interests?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have any hobbies and interests? I thought of friends who
are passionately involved in horses, cooking, golf, tennis, yoga.
All sorts of things. I'm not interested in anything, particularly.
What's wrong with me? Is it a character flaw, not having a hobby?
Why don't I have a hobby? I should have a hobby. On the other hand,
why do I need a hobby? Is it absolutely necessary? I've gotten to
this point in life without one. And what, exactly, does a hobby
have to do with my allergies? I suppose that if I did have a hobby
I might be allergic to it. Is this a good reason not to have one?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting there, churning all this over, it occurred to me that
maybe my hobby is second-guessing myself. But is second-guessing a
hobby? Or a neurosis? Or a bad habit? Whatever it is, it's
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing is probably why I was a failure as an editorial
writer. If I hadn't second-guessed every issue I still might have a
job writing editorials about campaign finance reform and Globe
Santa. As a dyed-in-the-wool second-guesser I felt compelled to
consider every point of view on every issue. On the one hand this.
On the other hand that. On the third hand something else. I was
seldom sure what to think of anything. (You might not think there
could be more than one point of view on Globe Santa but I thought:
Maybe he should give needy children more than toys, maybe he should
branch out into clothing and food and other stuff. Or maybe not. I
knew this line of thinking was madness, but I couldn't help it.)
</P>
<P>
   There are people who never seem to have any doubts, who
apparently glide through life secure in the knowledge that they're
thinking and doing all the right things. I envy their lack of inner
turmoil. I assume they lack inner turmoil. Maybe they don't lack
it. Maybe they're eaten up by it. Maybe they struggle not to let it
show. On the other hand, maybe they're self-confident. Or possibly
stupid. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, watching the impeachment fiasco unfold, I found myself
thinking that it would be convenient if, like so many of our
elected representatives, we could simply vote the party line in all
of life's decisions, large and small, from what flavor ice cream to
order to where to live, whom to live with. Maybe that's what makes
cult membership appealing to so many people. They're relieved of
the miserable business of making decisions and then wondering if
they've done the right thing. On the other hand, cult membership
does have its drawbacks, as we've seen.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I writing this column? It's a mistake. I could be writing
about Hillary Rodham Clinton's amazing regenesis as a modern media
goddess. But who wants to read any more about Hillary Clinton? And
what could I say that hasn't already been said, and said better? On
the other hand . . .

HIS KITCHEN FLOOR IS OOZING GLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The linoleum (sheet vinyl) in the kitchen of my new house
goes to about 1/4 inch from the baseboard, and glue is oozing out
of it, looking pretty ugly. What can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   JIM FOGARTY, Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The gap was left there to allow the linoleum to expand and
contract, which is good. The fact that it was not covered is bad. A
shoe mold or quarter-round molding is designed to cover that gap
and anything oozing out. You can have the contractor put in a shoe
mold, a strip of oak 3/8-inch wide and 3/4-inch high, or do it
yourself. A shoe mold will look good, can be varnished (it will
help set off the baseboard), and will cover the gap.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My double-hung wood windows are about 15 years old, with
plastic jambs that hold a spring. Now some of the top sashes won't
stay up. I noticed there are holes in the bottom of the top sash,
one on each side. Can I adjust the springs so the window will stay
up where it belongs?
</P>
<P>
   EARL MARTIN, Centerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The springs have lost some of their tension, which is a
common occurrence with windows of this type and age, although
springs can lose their tension anytime. The springs are in those
holes that you noticed. With luck, you can pull the spring down and
turn it clockwise to tighten its tension. If that doesn't work, you
might be able to get a replacement spring called Spyrex
(distributed by Brockway-Smith), but they are only for single-thick
glass windows. Or you can buy replacement jambs that tilt in for
easy washing. They are also distributed by Brockway-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The general experience with loose spiral springs is that they
are a real pain in the neck to tighten and/ or replace, according
to questions the Handyman has received over the years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my finished basement room, I get an awful smell when the
heat is turned on. The system is hot air fired by oil, and the
heating company said there is nothing wrong with the system. The
odor is not an oil smell or a burned oil smell, and, as far as I
can determine, it is not a chemical smell. The ducts that serve
this room are not far from the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   DENISE RABINOWITZ, Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Check out the ducts (the pipes that take the air from the
furnace to the room) for mildew. Take the ducts apart if necessary
and clean them _ or have them cleaned professionally. This may help
remove the cause of the odor, whether it is mildew or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the best paint I can use on the bathroom ceiling? I
have no exhaust fan in that room, and the ceiling drips water.
</P>
<P>
   JUDY MULLAINEY, South Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint will not stop the dripping, which is condensation of
moisture from when the shower is used. Ventilating the bathroom
will reduce or eliminate the problem. An exhaust fan, venting to
the outsde, will do the job even better without the hassle of
opening and closing windows and storms for ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the paint, a latex ceiling paint is as good as any. It
will resist the ravages of water as well as a shiny oil paint, and
may stick to the ceiling better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the best finish for a floor? In response to that
question, the Handyman suggested prefinished floors that come
varnished with four coats of polyurethane. Short of prefinished,
unfinished oak can be treated with two or more coats of an
oil-based, high-gloss polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Al McMann, who heads up T &AMP; H Hardwood Floors of Waltham, Mass.,
called to say there is a finish that will stand up better against
all kinds of punishment, including ``my dog.'' It is moisture-cured
polyurethane; three coats are required, and it is nonyellowing, but
must be professionally installed, McMann said.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Al McMann. It's too bad that such a good finish must
be done by pros (proper masks are required because the stuff is
potent; one of the reasons for professional installation).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I was in my house with a hot-air system for 16 years, I
got a lot of dust. Now, in my house with hot-water heat, I am
getting even more dust. How come? Is there anything I can do about
it?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE MARKS, Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The kind of heating system has little to do with the
production of dust. The hot-air system moves air faster than a
hot-water system, and you might get more of a distribution of the
dust with the hot-air system, but I don't think there is any
greater amount of dust. Your proposal to vacuum the heating fins in
the baseboards is a good one, to try to reduce the amount of dust
being blown up by the rising warm air in the hot-water system. You
can take off the sheet-metal baseboard covers and carefully vacuum
the fins; I say carefully because the fins can be bent easily. Try
a brush attachement; if that doesn't do a thorough job you can use
a wand attachment.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can determine, there is little else you can do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

MUSIC TOMES HIT THE RIGHT NOTES FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books about opera are hot this holiday season, but serious folks
will find nourishment in a spate of critical biographies of
important composers. Here's a rundown of what's new in print for
the musically insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella and Company: Backstage at the Opera with Cecilia
Bartoli.'' By Manuela Hoelterhoff. Knopf. $25. 262 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the most entertaining music book of the year, and one
of the most illuminating. Hoelterhoff, the former Pulitzer
Prize-winning opera critic of the Wall Street Journal set out to
write a blow-by-blow biography of meteoric Roman mezzo-soprano
Bartoli. She turns out to be highly gifted, terribly whimsical and
somewhat phobic.
</P>
<P>
   But the contemporary opera business in which Bartoli moves is
what engages Hoelterhoff more than her subject. Ego, stupidity,
fear and greed run rampant in this shark tank, and nothing seems to
escape the writer's jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains its share of rascals (Luciano Pavarotti, and
the overhyped ``love couple,'' Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu)
and its heroes (Renee Fleming, Patricia Racette). The highlight is
Hoelterhoff's wittily discursive account of the planning for the
epic James Levine Met gala a few years ago; the reader doesn't know
whether to cry or laugh at the ineptitude, but it's much easier to
settle for the latter. Hoelterhoff dares you not to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Opera.'' By Richard Somerset-Ward. Abrams.
$49.50. 304 pages.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to impress a neophyte with the grandeur of opera,
this is the book. Somerset-Ward provides an uncontroversial history
of the form, from its beginnings to the present day, with a
side-trip to popular music theater. One encounters a few errors in
the text and captions (Herbert von Karajan never conducted
``Gotterdammerung'' at the Met). Yet the opulent photos often take
the breath away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chronicle of Opera.'' By Michael Raeburn. Thames and
Hudson. $45. 256 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Every opera fan needs this book. With the unavailability of
Loewenberg's ``Annals of Opera,'' it was time for a year-by-year
listing of opera premieres and debuts by prominent singers. Here it
is, from the first entry, Bargalli's ``La Pellegrina'' (1589) to
Henze's ``Venus and Adonis'' (1997). The sidebars, citing important
world events, and the succulent visuals make this book one to keep.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Who in Opera.'' By Joyce Bourne. Oxford University
Press. $35. 457 pages.
</P>
<P>
   So, who are (1) Struhan, (2) Nina Micheltorena and (3) Palmieri?
Bourne's delightful opera guide, with its entries for more than
2,500 characters, will be a handy book to have around during
holiday parties for operaholics. Of special interest are the essays
commissioned from luminaries on their most rewarding
characterizations. (The answers to the above: (1) The Marschallin's
Major-Domo in Strauss' ``Der Rosenkavalier''; (2) Ramerrez's old
inamorata in Puccini's ``La Fanciulla del West''; and (3) a
political prisoner whose mock execution offstage turned out to be
the real thing in Puccini's ``Tosca.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Season of Opera, From Orpheus to Ariadne.'' By M. Owen Lee.
University of Toronto Press. $30. 241 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar from his Met broadcast intermission features, Lee
collects several of his essays and lectures in a volume that deals
with opera as a potent reinterpretation of myth. Much of the
writing is provocative, though I remain unconvinced by the author's
contention that Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' is the
greatest opera of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Callas by Callas, The Secret Writings of La Maria.'' By Renzo
and Roberto Allegri. Universe. $35. 166 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Can you live without this? The Allegris have prepared a new
biography of Maria Callas, centering around the diva's personal
letters. The book includes many previously unpublished photos and
is larded with bits of obscure Callasiana, like, whatever happened
to the soprano's immense wealth? The answer lies within.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Concerto, a Listener's Guide.'' By Michael Steinberg.
Oxford. $35. 506 pages.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Symphony patrons have been blessed with
Steinberg's illuminating program notes _ the best anywhere _ for
almost two decades. Steinberg's annotations on the symphony were
published a few years ago. Here is the companion volume (and the
final installment, devoted to vocal and choral works, will appear
later). You'll find most of the standard concertos, plus a few _ by
John Adams, Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Frank Martin and Erich Wolfgang
Korngold _ that augur to become part of the regular repertoire. If
this is under your Christmas tree, consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven.'' By Maynard Solomon. Schirmer. $30. 554 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The revised edition of Solomon's outstanding critical biography
updates the author's thinking on his subject since 1977, especially
in light of contemporary scholarship; and Schirmer has added a
pictorial biography of the composer. Solomon's objective account of
Beethoven's life is so engagingly written and yet so enlightened
that it claims pride of place on the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Harrison, Composing a World.'' By Leta E. Miller and
Frederic Lieberman. Oxford University Press. $35. 385 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, both faculty members at the University of
Californiat at Santa Cruz, have come up with the first full
critical biography of one of the great luminaries in their
neighborhood. The pair trace the events of Harrison's life, then
devote most of the book to the composer's world _ his affinity for
and incorporation of Asian modes and tunings, his politics,
homosexuality and even the reviews he wrote for the New York Herald
Tribune back in the 1940s. A 73-minute CD with Harrison's music is
included. An overdue tribute and doubly welcome on that account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Partch, a Biography.'' By Bob Gilmore. Yale University
Press. $35. 468 pages.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd and quite wonderful that the first critical biography
of a composer who defined mid-20th century American iconoclasm
should come from a British scholar; Partch does truly belong to the
world. Until now, Partch's own writings, often leaning to polemic,
have been the best source on his life. But Gilmore provides a
smooth narrative of a visionary career and how Partch came to build
the bizarre, fabulous instruments, that, even 25 years after his
death, have won him a huge following among a younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialogues and Discoveries: James Levine, His Life and His
Music.'' By Robert C. Marsh. Scribner. $27.50. 331 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh has been conducting interviews with the Met's artistic
director for 25 years and he has observed Levine since he was an
assistant to George Szell in Cleveland in the 1960s. He has edited
these colloquies for publication, prefacing them with a short
biography and following them with studies of Levine's working
methods and his recordings as conductor and pianist. What emerges
is a complex portrait of an artist obsessed with the power of music
to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Violin Book.'' Robin Stowell, editor. Miller Freeman. $75.
126 pages.
</P>
<P>
   This limited, slipcased edition is as seductive to the eye as it
is nourishing for the mind. The sundry contributors cover the
anatomy and acoustics of the violin, the famous violin makers, the
legendary performers and the evolving repertoire. Space is found,
too, for recommended recordings and all manner of fiddle lore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amadeus Book of the Violin.'' By Walter Kolneder. Amadeus
Press. $49.50. 597 pages.
</P>
<P>
   This English translation of Kolneder's final 1993 edition isn't
as opulent as the above, but it is considerably more informative.
The volume traces the construction, history and repertoire of the
violin with Teutonic thoroughness; it is liable to become a
standard reference work. In an age when books on music are
published fitfully (or not at all) in America, Oregon-based Amadeus
Press continues to issue meaningful _ and often indispensable _
additions to the library.

 &HT;    AS HAITIAN EXILES SEEK HIS ARREST IN FRANCE, 'BABY DOC' DUVALIER
CLAIMS HE DID NOTHING WRONG
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 500 words.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Emboldened by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Haitian-born photographer in
France plans to announce legal action Friday aimed at bringing
ousted Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to trial for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people were massacred or tortured to death
during the 31-year reign of ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier and his father,
Francois, known as ``Papa Doc.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the weekly French newsmagazine VSD, which hit
newsstands Thursday, Duvalier said he was innocent of any
wrongdoing, and that he deserved credit for helping usher democracy
in to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed an interest in returning to politics some day, and
said that ``his greatest desire'' would be returning to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 constitutional ban that prohibited infamous Duvalierists
from holding political office in Haiti expired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely not afraid because I have done nothing
wrong,'' Duvalier was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 1980s I put the country on the road to democracy,
and I abolished the death penalty in 1983,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But to the delight of Haitian groups in the United States,
Gerald Bloncourt recently formed a committee in Paris that hopes to
bring Duvalier to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bloncourt said Tuesday that he had gathered all the ``necessary
elements'' for a lawsuit and would announce legal action at a press
conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's acting on behalf of more than 60,000 Haitians
killed or tortured at the hands of Duvalier's notoriously brutal
Tontons Macoutes militia.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian groups welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much doubt that Duvalier personally attached electrodes
to anyone's body parts, but he was in command so he should be held
responsible,'' said Merrill Smith, director of Haiti Advocacy Inc.,
a non-profit lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Named ``president for life'' at age 19 following the death of
his father in 1971, Duvalier, now 47, was forced into exile in
France after being overthrown in 1986 by a U.S.-supported coup.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duvalier is reportedly broke and getting by on handouts
from supporters, he has maintained a peaceful existence away from
the spotlight -- that is, until Pinochet's case emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in October and is being detained in
Britain while Spain seeks his extradition to face charges of murder
and torture of its citizens during his 17-year reign, which ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise twist to the case, Britain's highest court on
Thursday ordered a new hearing into whether Pinochet is immune from
prosecution, setting aside a previous ruling that he is not immune.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's House of Lords had been asked by Pinochet's lawyers to
discard its previous judgement declaring he had no immunity on the
grounds that one of the judges involved was biased because of his
close ties to the human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords said Thursday that it would re-hear
Pinochet's case next month.
</P>
<P>
   The actions against Pinochet have inspired Haitian exiles in
France to seek a trial for Duvalier.
</P>
<P>
   Although French government authorities have claimed they've lost
track of Duvalier, police sources have said that he's been seen
recently in Paris and in Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The interview in the newsmagazine was conducted by a French
journalist who was taken ``somewhere in France'' by one of
Duvalier's friends for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, the Haitian government has encouraged
Haitian exiles to take Duvalier to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitian government is quite supportive of this effort,''
said Ira Kurzban, the Haitian government's Miami-based legal
adviser. ``We have substantial paperwork that could assist with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Ross Robinson, the Haitian government's lobbyist in
Washington, said Haitians in the United States want Duvalier to be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People suffered so much under Duvalier and people want him to
take responsibility for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added that Haitians also would like to see action taken
against Raoul Cedras, who savagely repressed the poor nation after
seizing power in 1991. By 1994, when Cedras was forced into exile
by a U.S. invasion, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Haitians had been
killed or tortured to death.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cedras reportedly lives in a posh neighborhood in Panama
City where he owns a penthouse apartment.

   LOS ANGELES _ Landing a song on the soundtrack of a box-office
smash can change Everything.
</P>
<P>
   But the six members of the hard-working Virginia group known as
Everything are keeping feet planted firmly on terra firma despite
the fact that their track, ``Hooch,'' was picked for use in Adam
Sandler's hit comedy, ``The Waterboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Together for eight years, Everything has been dubbed the
hardest-working band in the biz. The band has been on the road
steadily for the last five years, playing more than 200 shows
annually, including dates with acts as diverse as A Tribe Called
Quest, Cracker, Dave Matthews Band and even the Who. In addition,
the imaginative pop-alternative outfit is one of the only bands to
have opened for Phish.
</P>
<P>
   The concert-industry mag Pollstar ranked Everything, under its
own steam, among the 50 highest-grossing tours for four months
straight two years ago. Today, the group is on the road supporting
its major-label debut, ``Super Natural'' (Blackbird/Sire), which
has spent more than five months in Billboard's Heatseekers chart
for new or developing acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much music coming out every year, but somehow the
good stuff always shines through,'' said Everything
singer-guitarist Craig Honeycutt. ``Once you get to a certain level
with your music, you realize there's very good stuff in every
genre. The walls start to fall away, and your ears open up. We can
say we're influenced by a lot of different types of music now.''
</P>
<P>
   MY FAVORITE MARTIN: We asked recently retired Beatles producer
George Martin what he thought of today's rock scene on the 30th
anniversary of the release of ``The Beatles,'' universally known as
``The White Album.''
</P>
<P>
   The album has just been issued in a limited-edition CD package
that re-creates all the elements of the original 1968 double album
in scaled-down fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough music world out there now,'' Martin said. ``I'm
so glad I'm not in it. The competition is so great _ there's an
awful lot of good musicians around, and they're all clamoring for
attention. It's fairly significant that the record companies are
reissuing so much old stuff. They're marketing nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said at least one thing hasn't changed in three decades _
the importance of quality tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song is the thing,'' he said. ``The Beatles wouldn't be
what they are today without that marvelous songbook.'' &QL;

REVENGE MOTIVATES `BETTE' AND `BLADE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though no one is touting her for another Academy
Award, previous Best Actress winner Jessica Lange is deliciously
vengeful in ``Cousin Bette,'' which comes out on video next week.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in Paris shortly before the 1848 revolution.
Based on the Honore de Balzac novel, ``Bette'' is the story of a
proud spinster in her 40s (Lange) who has been betrayed throughout
her life. First by her own family, who favored her cousin Adelaide
(Geraldine Chaplin), and later by a young starving artist,
Wenceslas (Aden Young), whom she befriends and supports.
</P>
<P>
   When Adelaide dies (in a juicy scene in which her husband admits
his betrayals), Bette believe she will marry the widower, Baron
Hulot (Hugh Laurie), but the baron offers her only a housekeeper's
position. After all, he has the most desirable woman in Paris,
Jenny Cadine (Elisabeth Shue), as his mistress. But Bette, who
works as a seamstress in the theater where Jenny stars, is not a
woman to cross.
</P>
<P>
   When her cousin's daughter, Hortense (Kelly MacDonald), steals
away Wenceslas she enlists Jenny, whom she has befriended, and her
wiles to gain revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be the ax _ and I will be the hand that wields you!''
she tells Jenny.
</P>
<P>
   In his first film directing effort, acclaimed stage director Des
McAnuff stresses the wickedly funny in this cheeky satire (if you
see the film, you'll get the reference), which isn't above turning
to the bawdy for a joke or two.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected with this cast, the acting is superb. Bob
Hoskins is especially wonderful as the rich mayor of Paris, Crevel,
who once offered Hortense 200,000 francs for a look at her body and
then wants a discount a year later, and who unwittingly is used by
Bette to exact her pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Shot by cinematographer Andrzej Sekula (``Pulp Fiction''),
``Bette'' has a flashy look, and with its twists and turns it's
great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Another film about vengeance, ``Blade,'' also hits sores next
week. But while ``Bette'' is awash in sexual follies and human
foibles, the vampire film ``Blade'' is awash in (what else?) blood.
And it doesn't take long to start. Midway through the opening scene
_ set in a vampire nightclub hidden in the back of a meat-packing
plant _ blood pours down from the sprinkler system on the thirsty
partying undead just before they tear into their unwitting guests.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you can forget about anything like, say, subtlety
or wit. (This is no ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.) ``Blade'' is one
of those rides you know in the first minutes if you want to be on.
But if your taste runs the toward grisly (kind of like a steak from
the Pantry), then you can enjoy this guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1973, Blade was one of the first African-American
comic book superheroes. The story goes that his mother was bitten
by a vampire and was turning into one of the undead when he was
born. So Blade has the powers of the undead but can still walk
around in the day. Angered because of what happened to his mother,
Blade (played stoically by Wesley Snipes) has vowed to wipe out all
vampires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' is sort of like watching one of those old spaghetti
westerns starring Clint Eastwood. Morality was by degrees. And
while you might root for Clint, or in this case Wesley, you know
the hero is somewhat less than a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, if you missed ``The Rat Pack'' on HBO, it, too, comes
out on video next week. While there are some problems with it (it
should have been called ``JFK and Frank''), there are some
interesting moments and good performances, particularly from Ray
Liotta as Ol' Blue Eyes, Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis Jr. and Joe
Mantegna as Dean Martin. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the ``Mighty Joe Young'' remake just around
the corner, the people at Turner Classic Movies have a suggestion:
</P>
<P>
   See the original.
</P>
<P>
   They've made it possible to view the 1949 classic (from the
creators of ``King Kong,'' Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen) at 8
tonight. Terry Moore stars as a gorilla breeder who is persuaded by
an unscrupulous nightclub owner to bring her 12-foot gorilla to the
States as an attraction. But the sideshow act is upset when Joe
goes on a rampage. In true Hollywood fashion, however, Joe gets the
chance to redeem himself when an orphanage catches fire and
helpless children are trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Johnson, Robert Armstrong and Frank McHugh also co-star in
Ernest Schoedsack's production, which boasts outstanding special
effects for its time.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Mighty Joe Young'' opens Christmas Day and stars Bill
Paxton (``Twister'' and ``Apollo 13.'') and Charlize Theron (``Two
Days in the Valley'' and Woody Allen's ``Celebrity'').
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the ``See the Original'' theme, TCM presented
``The Shop Around the Corner'' earlier this week. This Jimmy
Stewart-Margaret Sullavan romantic comedy about two bickering
co-workers who fall in love through a lonely hearts club has been
updated for the '90s in ``You've Got Mail,'' which stars Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan and opens today in theaters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER: Actor John Travolta, who shot to stardom
in ``Saturday Night Fever,'' and regained it playing a hired killer
in ``Pulp Fiction,'' will be the recipient of a career achievement
award at the 10th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation will come Jan. 9 at the festival's Saturday
night awards gala at the Palm Springs Convention Center. Jack
Valenti, president and chief executive of the Motion Picture
Association of America, will be the first recipient of the Sonny
Bono Visionary Award, established in honor of the late entertainer
and congressman.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Motion Picture Association, Valenti oversees the
interests of the U.S. film and television industries in the global
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta's screen credits include ``Urban Cowboy,''
``Phenomenon,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Broken Arrow,'' ``Michael,''
``Primary Colors'' and the upcoming ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonny Bono Award is devoted to a person in entertainment who
demonstrates visionary skill in film. Bono started the film
festival in 1989 in this city, where he once was mayor before being
elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Debbie Reynolds will also be honored with a lifetime
achievement award. Her big break came in the 1950 MGM musical
``Three Little Words,'' which starred Fred Astaire and Red Skelton.
After her follow-up performance in the Busby Berkley musical ``Two
Weeks in Love,'' studio mogul Louis B. Mayer cast her as Gene
Kelly's leading lady in ``Singin' in the Rain,'' which may be the
greatest screen musical of all time.
</P>
<P>
   FREE SCREENING: The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing
Theatre offers a free screening of the 1945 drama ``Mildred
Pierce'' at 1 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Crawford won a Best Actress Oscar as the housewife who
takes a waitressing job and becomes enamored of Zachary Scott. Her
spoiled daughter, (Ann Blyth) makes a play for him, too, leading to
four-star adaptation of James Cain's novel about murder for cheap
love.
</P>

`PRINCE OF EGYPT' A CLASSY VERSION OF `TEN COMMANDMENTS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pharaonically ambitious ``Prince of Egypt''
does indeed take feature-length animation in impressive new
directions. Arguably the most beautiful film ever drawn, this
telling of the biblical Moses story is an unequivocal masterpiece
of both design and that rarest of cartoon qualities, good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Narratively and theologically, the results are a little iffier.
While certainly reverent, ``Prince's'' screenplay, which is
credited to Philip LaZebnik, strains strenuously to make it play
for contemporary sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the movie dispenses with key passages in the
book of Exodus and has a tendency to depict God's messenger as
something of a California dude (Valley boy Val Kilmer provides the
voice of Moses), there are more than enough moments of carefully
wrought religious spectacle to validate the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, complaints that it's like one big, colorful Sunday
school lesson are a matter of individual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting/comic chariot races and a magic show production number
straight out of Siegfried and Roy won't invoke most folks' memories
of childhood religious training. At the same time, though, the
story unfolds in a kind of walking-on-eggs manner, as if the
filmmakers were too awestruck _ or, more likely, too worried about
offending the slightest sensibility of a single potential customer,
believing or secular.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, though: ``The Prince of Egypt'' is
infinitely classier than its closest cinematic forebear, Cecil B.
DeMille's 1956 ``The Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting's better (and these are cartoons!). Interpretive
ideas are smarter; there's a fine, Genesis-like subtext here about
fraternal love and conflict, both between Moses and his virtual
brother Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and his blood siblings
Miriam (Sandra Bullock) and Aaron (Jeff Goldblum).
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps its most felicitous modern touch, ``Prince''
dispenses with ``Commandments''' rampant misogyny. In this one,
Moses' shepherdess wife, Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer), is not only
a tough customer, she's her husband's primary earthly support when
he returns to Egypt. And there's no Nefertiri figure to turn the
Moses-Rameses conflict into an overheated love triangle; the
conflict between the Pharoah and the Hebrew leader is purely a
matter of politics, conflicting interests and perceived personal
betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt's'' real elegance, however, is in its visuals.
Truly inspired by Egyptian art, the film has an architectural scope
as imposing and graphically audacious as the pyramids themselves.
Cities burst with beautiful, gigantic structures; the grandly
composed color scheme is only enriched, rather than dulled, by its
sun- and sand-blasted qualities; and water has never been animated
more effectively, whether as a tear on a mother's cheek, the Nile
expelling a plague of frogs or _ the show stopper _ the Red Sea
parting, then reforming with a mighty vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It's smart, too. The still-princely Moses' nightmare, from which
he realizes his true identity, is done in a stiff, scary,
hieroglyphic motif. And when the Angel of Death comes to claim
Egypt's firstborn, the screen mutes into a palette of mournful
grays that stirringly evokes the terror, tragedy and necessity of
it all.
</P>
<P>
   In the minus column, the songs aren't so hot (Stephen Schwartz,
of Disney's ``Pocahontas'' and ``Hunchback of Notre'' fame,
composed). Only the Whitney Houston-Mariah Carey shouting match,
``When You Believe,'' is really memorable, and that's never a good
sign for a musical soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Others might regret the short shrift given the Commandments
here. All we get on that subject is a single shot of Moses carrying
tablets down from the mountain; there's no hint as to why Exodus is
not just a great story of liberation but of the lesson that freedom
without law is worthless anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Reckon they didn't want to come off too preachy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt'' is credited to three directors _ Brenda
Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells _ but it's fairly common
knowledge that this is really DreamWorks partner Jeffrey
Katzenberg's baby. As he did at Disney before forming his own
studio with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, Katzenberg oversaw
everything about the movie and has tried his best to move the
medium into worthy new territory with it.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded at that; no one will mistake ``Prince of Egypt''
for a Disney product. But it is definitely a Hollywood product,
something that plays it as commercially safe as it can while
charting a path of divine inspiration.
</P>

LOVE LETTERS FOR THE '90S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thank heavens for e-mail. What else could have
brought the favorite romantic comedy team of the decade back
together again?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' re-unites the ``Sleepless in Seattle''
couple of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, under the supervision of
``Sleepless'' screenwriter-director Nora Ephron and associate
producer Delia Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a sequel by any means. ``Mail'' is based on the
old, Nikolaus Laszlo play ``Parfumerie,'' which inspired Ernst
Lubitsch's ultra-charming ``The Shop Around the Corner'' (1940),
the Judy Garland musical ``In the Good Old Summertime'' (1949) and
the stage production ``She Loves Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea of two unconscious romantics being brought together
via information age technology _ in this case, warring bookstore
owners who are unknowingly falling in love with each other over the
Internet _ echoes the ``Sleepless'' gimmick of a woman being
enchanted by the radio voice of a man she's never met.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the juxtaposition of a new medium like cyberspace against
an old one like print gave the Ephron sisters, who wrote ``Mail''
together, a framework on which they could hang the kind of
language-based and contemporary culture jokes that made
``Sleepless'' so bright-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that Hanks (who has become the world's biggest
movie star in the five years since ``Sleepless'' hit) and Ryan (who
now hates being typecast in most people's minds as a comic cutie)
went for the ``Mail'' despite their natural inclinations to avoid
froth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely rooted in who we are right now,'' Hanks,
42, says. ``This WalMartification of the world, and at the same
time this intangible quality that human beings have to fall in love
with somebody they don't know, this is part and parcel of our lives
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't four pages into the script before I was calling Nora
and saying, `Let's do this.' To me, it was just absolutely real and
right and proper and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was that Nora's managed to make a movie that's
romantic and you want them to get together and all that,'' Ryan
adds, ``but she's also been able to observe what's happening in our
culture right now. She's able to talk about the franchising of
America phenomenon. And it's pretty ingenious that they communicate
through e-mail; that's very modern, and it hasn't been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ryan's Kathleen Kelly runs a small, lovingly
operated children's bookstore called the Shop Around the Corner.
When a mammoth Fox &AMP; Sons superstore moves into her Upper West Side
Manhattan neighborhood, the discount chain outlet threatens to run
her independent operation out of business. Kathleen's only
consolation through this corporate assault is the sensitive and
caring e-mail buddy she recently met in a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, unbeknownst to her, he's really Joe Fox, hard-driving
scion of the bookstore chain empire. He doesn't know his new
cyber-sweetie is the despised competition either, but when he finds
out it's too late; he's already in love with her online persona.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for an e-mail update of ``Shop Around the Corner'' was
actually executive producer Julie Durk's. Her boss, producer Lauren
Shuler Donner (``Free Willy,'' ``Dave''), secured the remake rights
to the Lubitsch film from its owner, Turner Pictures, then
contacted Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terribly afraid that somebody else would get this idea
because love online is happening all over the place,'' producer
Shuler Donner says.
</P>
<P>
   Former journalist Ephron was intrigued by the creative
possibilities inherent in a communication technology that has
emerged so recently, yet has become second nature for millions of
people in record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is so fascinating to me about e-mail is
that the minute you start doing it, you understand what it is,''
says Ephron. ``It's not a phone call, it's not a letter, yet nobody
explains that to you. It's as if somebody suddenly gave you a
machine and you can speak French. We all know the parameters of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this thing that they do on it, like most of e-mail, has a
very kind of casual feeling. It might not be something important
enough to put into a letter or make a phone call about, but you can
make it into something that you write that's a whole, amazing
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   An amazing thing that basically looks like two people typing.
There was definitely a trick to keeping the vital comic rhythm of
``You've Got Mail'' going throughout its many static,
laptop-and-voiceover shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never too afraid of this because computers just are
interesting to watch, I don't know why,'' Ephron says. ``Now,
granted, we didn't have all of those charming graphics that they
have in movies like `The Net,' and if we had had any two actors
less good than these two, I don't know if those scenes would have
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you look at Tom's face when he writes that letter about
how he has a project that needs tweaking; he barely moves and it's
riveting. It's just a man sitting at a typewriter, and it's
interesting. Words are interesting _ but we did keep the scenes
short. You don't have any six-minute letters here.''
</P>
<P>
   Web activity is far less intriguing for the film's stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I wish I had time to surf the Web,'' says Hanks, who does
tend to stay busy with stuff like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the
long-filming adaptation of Stephen King's ``The Green Mile'' and
working on whacked-out award acceptance speeches. ``All I really do
is search for those nude pictures I did 20 years ago. Thank God
I've yet to find them!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a computer now, thanks to this movie, but I didn't have
one before,'' Ryan reveals. ``I do a lot of e-mailing, but I can't
stay in the chat rooms. I can't tell what anyone's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't found those Hanks nudes on the Web either, and Ryan
doesn't want to see what she knows has been posted on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some FBI guy called me up because there's some pornographic
composite thing of me out there,'' she reveals. ``There's somebody
who does this for joy, sticks celebrities' heads on other bodies.
That's why I've never gone to my Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   All the cutting-edge trappings aside, the core appeal of
``You've Got Mail'' was the chance to work again with respected
colleagues _ or, in the case of Hanks and Ryan, to really work
together, since they only shared two scenes in ``Sleepless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he read it, Tom called Meg and said, `Nora's
sending a script to you. I'm doing it and so are you,' '' Shuler
Donner notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is it's so easy to work with Tom,'' Ryan says of
the two-time Oscar winner. ``One thing that's so great about him is
that he could have all of this attendant Elvis stuff, he could come
with all these things, and he doesn't. He's just this guy who
everybody probably feels they know and probably do know. Even after
all this stuff that's happened to him, he's still gracious enough
to feel lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it was nice to have more scenes together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meg is very smart, she does not lie and she does not acquiesce
to somebody's personality just to foment a conversation,'' says
Hanks, who first worked with Ryan on the unsuccessful, 1990 whimsy
``Joe Versus the Volcano.'' ``So, without it being competitive in
any way, shape or form, the level of the game is constantly raised
with Meg. Nothing is done halfway; Meg kind of scares me in the way
you want to be scared by somebody you're working with and intrigues
me in the way you want to be intrigued.'' For Ephron, who has
directed ``Mixed Nuts'' and ``Michael'' since her second feature
``Sleepless,'' it was nice to come back to work with that film's
stars not feeling scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom said that, when you've done it once together, there's a
kind of shorthand that obtains,'' she says. ``I think Tom spent a
certain amount of `Sleepless' not sure if I knew what I was doing,
and he was probably right about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nora's surrounded herself with people that she really,
really respected, and she's learned from them,'' Ryan reckons.
``She just looked like she was having a great time when she was
making this. It was harder for her last time, but I think she's
found a way to make a movie satisfying on many different levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deceptively simple movie, and this is Nora's real
talent,'' Ryan concludes. ``She's able to observe our world in a
way that doesn't look like she's doing it. But she is.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's so, it comes back down to the basic reporter's tool
that Ephron has been using her whole adult life _ whether with a
pen, typewriter or a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really interests me, because I'm so much fundamentally a
writer as opposed to a director, are words,'' Ephron says. ``And,
by the way, most romantic comedies tend to be, secretly, about
words, because words wound and words appeal. Words are always what
is trafficked in a romantic comedy, because sex is usually not in
the room in any real way.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is really a movie about words. Beginning to end.''

OUR RATING: 3 { Stars  
 &HT;     By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nora Ephron's delightfully frothy romantic comedy,
``You've Got Mail,'' goes out of its way to endorse a set of
latter-day institutions _ America Online, Starbucks, super
bookstores _ deemed questionable in the eyes of many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's highly unlikely many will find fault with the movie's
most celebrated institutions, its eminently likable stars Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan. They're at their agreeable best here, too _ Hanks
doing his finest Jimmy Stewart; Ryan taking perkiness to new
heights. Only someone who has seen ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' one
too many times could resist their charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' is a shrewd update of Ernst Lubitsch's
little-seen, 1940 charmer ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' which
starred Stewart (making the Hanks casting even more of a slam dunk)
and Margaret Sullavan as feuding clerks in a small curio shop who
unknowingly fall in love through a lonely hearts club. In Ephron's
witty version (which she co-wrote with her sister Delia), Hanks and
Ryan play battling bookstore owners who anonymously exchange
soulful e-mail messages (bagels, butterflies and Jane Austen are
among the topics).
</P>
<P>
   It turns out both Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) live
in the same Upper West Side neighborhood (glowingly rendered in
such a way to make a native New Yorker either boast or laugh in
derision). Kathleen runs a charming children's bookstore, A Shop
Around the Corner (nice nod to Lubitsch), that's being threatened
by the imminent opening of a Fox Books superstore. (Think Barnes &AMP;
Noble.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Kathleen meet early in the film and are immediately
attracted to each other, even though both are otherwise involved.
But when Kathleen finds out Joe's last name is Fox (as in that
Fox), she is immediately repulsed, telling him, ``Instead of a
brain, you have a cash register. Instead of a heart, you have a
bottom line.'' And who does she turn to for comfort? Her cyberpal,
who happens to be, naturally, the one and only Mr. Joe Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this being Hanks and Ryan, there's a limit to how far
their rivalry will go. Yes, Joe is a corporate raider who laughs
when another independent bookstore goes under. But, at home, Joe
cuddles up with his golden retriever and composes poetic e-mail. As
for Kathleen, sure, she tells Joe off, but later she feels bad for
being a meanie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' could have been too cute by half, but Ephron
leavens the goo with a host of acerbic social observations on
relationships, cyberdating and the attachment men have to ``The
Godfather.'' (``It's the I Ching, the sum of all wisdom,'' Hanks
says in one e-mail message.) Only toward the end, once some of the
story's tension has been resolved, does the film falter. But by
then, the picture has accumulated so much good will that you can
forgive any minor missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and Ryan are capably aided by a supporting cast that
includes Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn as Ryan's bookstore cohorts
and Dabney Coleman as Hanks' bimbo-chasing father. Parker Posey and
Greg Kinnear play the romantic entanglements that inevitably must
be cast aside for our favorite couple to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Ephron could well have given these wonderful actors more to do;
indeed, reports indicate that she had to cut many of their scenes
to pare down the film's running time. It's just as well. ``You've
Got Mail'' rightfully belongs to Hanks and Ryan. Their pairing here
is even better than ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' if only because
they're given more to do together. It's a winning combination _
one, with any luck, we'll have a chance to enjoy again in the
future.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a dreadful, telling moment during the latest Middle
East theatricals, when President Clinton shared a Sunday press
conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The American President had urged the Palestinians to abandon
those clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the
destruction of Israel. Already, Yasser Arafat had arranged the very
show of hands which the Israelis and Americans had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly _ without any prior warning _ Netanyahu produced a
new ``condition'' which the Palestinians would have to meet if
Israeli troops were to make a further scheduled withdrawal from
occupied Arab land on Friday: Arafat would have to publicly abandon
any plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was silent. His face mirrored not perplexity but
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He had just promised Israel that he would ask Congress to give
it a further $1.2 billion to help Israel's ``security'' during the
final stages of the ``peace process.'' But he said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If he realized amid his own personal crisis that the Israelis
were torpedoing any hope of peace in the Middle East, he did not
reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had simply produced one more ``condition'' which
was supposedly included in the Wye agreement _ itself a restatement
of all the unfulfilled promises of the 1993 Oslo agreement _ and
the Americans went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Israelis said that Arafat must also halt all violent
demonstrations. This too, we were told, was part of the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing of the sort. There are no sentences, clauses or
paragraphs in the Wye treaty which forbid Arafat from declaring a
Palestinian state, any more than there are prohibitions on
demonstrations, however violent.
</P>
<P>
   But Wye was so dishonest a document _ so humiliatingly accepted
by Arafat and his cronies _ that it scarcely matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good thing today in raising your hands...'' Clinton
told the obedient members of the Palestine National Council who
were merely reiterating what they had already said four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks anymore whether the conditions set by the Israelis
are actually written into the Oslo or Wye agreements. ``Palestinian
compliance,'' as Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Ilan puts it _
note that word ``compliance'' _ has become part of the rubric of
this forlorn ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Netanyahu's domestic political crisis is produced as a
reason for Israel's refusal to abide by the peace accords _ as if
it is quite normal for a nation-state to break solemn signed
agreements with a third party when its prime minister has personal
problems with his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long complained _ and rightly _ that peace treaties
with Arab states might prove worthless if regimes changed and then
chose to disavow the undertakings of their predecessors. But when
Israel does just this, it is seen as a natural, if regrettable,
course of events.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Arafat has now been emasculated. To keep America's
friendship and secure Israel's next microscopic retreat, he has
sacrificed any chance of bargaining over the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot allow Palestinians to demonstrate against the doomed
``peace'' process unless their protest turns violent. He cannot
demand a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot demand even a part of Jerusalem as his capital _
Netanyahu having stated (without a murmur of dissent from Clinton)
that Jerusalem is the ``unified and eternal capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must arrest his own opponents with the assistance of the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the Palestinian leader who has so shamefully accepted
this totally lopsided agreement, who has smothered any aspiration
to freedom and democracy in his putative ``state,'' whose cruel
secret policemen now murder suspects on whim or _ how symptomatic
of their carelessness _ by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Egged on by the CIA experts who now measure his battle against
``terrorism,'' the chairman of the Palestinian Authority has now
turned his would-be state into a typical Middle East dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores his 88-member Palestinian Legislative Council. He
pays no attention to the laws they have passed. He bans books
(Edward Said, the distinguished Palestinian professor at Columbia
University, is merely one of his latest victims). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies
suggests that Palestinians believe democracy and human rights are
better respected in Israel that in ``Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   I still remember how Arafat boasted to me in Beirut in the dark
days of the early 1980s that his nation was ``a democracy among the
guns.'' But what he has created in the West Bank and Gaza Strip _
those pathetic slivers that he would call a ``state'' _ is a
grotesque version of the gunman's fiefdom which he ruled in Lebanon
20 years ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, he is a deteriorating man. His brain tumor _ following his
air crash in Libya _ has left him with a palpable shake in the
right hand that looks suspiciously like the onset of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be so quick to shuffle off the mortal coil as other
Arab leaders _ the cancer-riven King Hussein of Jordan, they say,
may be with us for only another two or three months _ but Arafat
let slip a remark last week that in two years' time, someone else
may be Palestinian leader. Chosen, the cynics said at once, by the
Israelis. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet what do Arafat's opponents elsewhere in the Arab world have
to offer? All the anti-peaceniks of Palestine met in Damascus last
weekend to condemn the vote of the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
   But when delegates called for the setting up of a rival PLO,
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine _ the sanest of the anti-Arafat league _ opposed the
motion and called for further political action in the occupied
territories. He was howled down by infuriated Palestinian radicals
shouting for ``unity.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what are we left with after the latest deplorable charade in
the Middle East? A powerless Clinton, to be sure, too frightened,
too lacking in concentration to dare criticize Netanyahu or do more
than say that Palestinians should ``determine their own destiny on
their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Netanyahu were to allow such a development _ which he
won't _ Arafat would never permit it.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton was the first American president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land. But he originally intended to land Air
Force One in Gaza. The moment the Israelis suggested this might
imply statehood, the leader of the world's only superpower meekly
agreed to fly in from Tel Aviv by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In a real battle of wits between equal partners, Arafat might
have made a few Netanyahu-like conditions to the Israelis: no
continuation of the ``peace process'' unless Israel renounced its
exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a capital (which precludes next
May's final status talks as surely does a Palestinian declaration
of a state); no more Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land in
contravention of U.N. resolutions and international law; no more
negotiations until Netanyahu ends Jewish settler attacks on
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, Arafat would not do that _ and America would not
talk to him if he did.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the surprise when Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu
ended their summit without any signs of the success proclaimed by
the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   Oslo and Wye destroyed any Palestinian hope for a just peace.
Israel was allowed to build more Jewish settlements on Palestinian
land, confiscate Palestinian identity papers, demolish Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat _ for perhaps 14 percent of the land of ``Palestine''
_ had to promise to protect the Israelis who were building the
settlements, confiscating the paper and demolishing the homes.
</P>
<P>
   And they called it peace. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a dreadful, telling moment during the latest Middle
East theatricals, when President Clinton shared a Sunday press
conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The American President had urged the Palestinians to abandon
those clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the
destruction of Israel. Already, Yasser Arafat had arranged the very
show of hands which the Israelis and Americans had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly _ without any prior warning _ Netanyahu produced a
new ``condition'' which the Palestinians would have to meet if
Israeli troops were to make a further scheduled withdrawal from
occupied Arab land on Friday: Arafat would have to publicly abandon
any plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was silent. His face mirrored not perplexity but
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He had just promised Israel that he would ask Congress to give
it a further $1.2 billion to help Israel's ``security'' during the
final stages of the ``peace process.'' But he said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If he realized amid his own personal crisis that the Israelis
were torpedoing any hope of peace in the Middle East, he did not
reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had simply produced one more ``condition'' which
was supposedly included in the Wye agreement _ itself a restatement
of all the unfulfilled promises of the 1993 Oslo agreement _ and
the Americans went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Israelis said that Arafat must also halt all violent
demonstrations. This too, we were told, was part of the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing of the sort. There are no sentences, clauses or
paragraphs in the Wye treaty which forbid Arafat from declaring a
Palestinian state, any more than there are prohibitions on
demonstrations, however violent.
</P>
<P>
   But Wye was so dishonest a document _ so humiliatingly accepted
by Arafat and his cronies _ that it scarcely matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good thing today in raising your hands...'' Clinton
told the obedient members of the Palestine National Council who
were merely reiterating what they had already said four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks anymore whether the conditions set by the Israelis
are actually written into the Oslo or Wye agreements. ``Palestinian
compliance,'' as Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Ilan puts it _
note that word ``compliance'' _ has become part of the rubric of
this forlorn ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Netanyahu's domestic political crisis is produced as a
reason for Israel's refusal to abide by the peace accords _ as if
it is quite normal for a nation-state to break solemn signed
agreements with a third party when its prime minister has personal
problems with his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long complained _ and rightly _ that peace treaties
with Arab states might prove worthless if regimes changed and then
chose to disavow the undertakings of their predecessors. But when
Israel does just this, it is seen as a natural, if regrettable,
course of events.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Arafat has now been emasculated. To keep America's
friendship and secure Israel's next microscopic retreat, he has
sacrificed any chance of bargaining over the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot allow Palestinians to demonstrate against the doomed
``peace'' process unless their protest turns violent. He cannot
demand a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot demand even a part of Jerusalem as his capital _
Netanyahu having stated (without a murmur of dissent from Clinton)
that Jerusalem is the ``unified and eternal capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must arrest his own opponents with the assistance of the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the Palestinian leader who has so shamefully accepted
this totally lopsided agreement, who has smothered any aspiration
to freedom and democracy in his putative ``state,'' whose cruel
secret policemen now murder suspects on whim or _ how symptomatic
of their carelessness _ by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Egged on by the CIA experts who now measure his battle against
``terrorism,'' the chairman of the Palestinian Authority has now
turned his would-be state into a typical Middle East dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores his 88-member Palestinian Legislative Council. He
pays no attention to the laws they have passed. He bans books
(Edward Said, the distinguished Palestinian professor at Columbia
University, is merely one of his latest victims). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies
suggests that Palestinians believe democracy and human rights are
better respected in Israel that in ``Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   I still remember how Arafat boasted to me in Beirut in the dark
days of the early 1980s that his nation was ``a democracy among the
guns.'' But what he has created in the West Bank and Gaza Strip _
those pathetic slivers that he would call a ``state'' _ is a
grotesque version of the gunman's fiefdom which he ruled in Lebanon
20 years ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, he is a deteriorating man. His brain tumor _ following his
air crash in Libya _ has left him with a palpable shake in the
right hand that looks suspiciously like the onset of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be so quick to shuffle off the mortal coil as other
Arab leaders _ the cancer-riven King Hussein of Jordan, they say,
may be with us for only another two or three months _ but Arafat
let slip a remark last week that in two years' time, someone else
may be Palestinian leader. Chosen, the cynics said at once, by the
Israelis. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet what do Arafat's opponents elsewhere in the Arab world have
to offer? All the anti-peaceniks of Palestine met in Damascus last
weekend to condemn the vote of the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
   But when delegates called for the setting up of a rival PLO,
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine _ the sanest of the anti-Arafat league _ opposed the
motion and called for further political action in the occupied
territories. He was howled down by infuriated Palestinian radicals
shouting for ``unity.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what are we left with after the latest deplorable charade in
the Middle East? A powerless Clinton, to be sure, too frightened,
too lacking in concentration to dare criticize Netanyahu or do more
than say that Palestinians should ``determine their own destiny on
their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Netanyahu were to allow such a development _ which he
won't _ Arafat would never permit it.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton was the first American president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land. But he originally intended to land Air
Force One in Gaza. The moment the Israelis suggested this might
imply statehood, the leader of the world's only superpower meekly
agreed to fly in from Tel Aviv by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In a real battle of wits between equal partners, Arafat might
have made a few Netanyahu-like conditions to the Israelis: no
continuation of the ``peace process'' unless Israel renounced its
exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a capital (which precludes next
May's final status talks as surely does a Palestinian declaration
of a state); no more Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land in
contravention of U.N. resolutions and international law; no more
negotiations until Netanyahu ends Jewish settler attacks on
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, Arafat would not do that _ and America would not
talk to him if he did.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the surprise when Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu
ended their summit without any signs of the success proclaimed by
the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   Oslo and Wye destroyed any Palestinian hope for a just peace.
Israel was allowed to build more Jewish settlements on Palestinian
land, confiscate Palestinian identity papers, demolish Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat _ for perhaps 14 percent of the land of ``Palestine''
_ had to promise to protect the Israelis who were building the
settlements, confiscating the paper and demolishing the homes.
</P>
<P>
   And they called it peace. &QL;

   SEATTLE -- Seattle is not a city much used to adversity. Since
the rise of Microsoft, the hi-tech industry and the invention of
Pacific Northwest cafe lattes, it has gone from boom to boom,
adding an exhilarating cosmopolitanism to its pleasantly
understated prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   So when Boeing, still the Seattle area's largest employer,
announced recently that it was laying off 48,000 workers in the
next two years, it came as the kind of shock the city had almost
forgotten existed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the job cuts are expected to hit the string of Boeing
factories and assembly plants around Puget Sound, the large natural
harbor dotted with islands that surrounds Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is a sharp drop-off in orders from Asia, compounded by
a chain of over-enthusiastic expansion decisions in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing _ which merged two years ago with McDonnell
Douglas to form an aircraft-producing behemoth _ has got caught in
a price war with its thriving European rival, Airbus Industrie,
cutting its profit margins to the bone in a declining market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work force has yo-yoed from 110,000 in the early
1990s, to about 230,000 now, and is set to fall to around 180,000
by the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a crisis on the scale of the early 1970s, when
Seattle was virtually a one-company town and someone put up a sign
_ since much copied _ asking whether the last person to leave could
please turn out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   But it is nevertheless the largest single job cut in living
memory _ a cut that is likely to be compounded by the fact that
every Boeing job generates two or three others in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis is particularly bad news for a city that built
the foundations of its present affluence on trade with the East in
the 1980s, and relied on it to survive the last, much smaller slump
at Boeing in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991-93 the state economy held up pretty well, because of
other areas _ obviously the high-tech area _ but also timber and
agriculture,'' said Charles Hill, a professor at the University of
Washington's business school. ``The problem now, of course, is that
timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does the news from Boeing spell recession in boomtown
Seattle? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the computer industry (which includes the local
software retailer amazon.com) are planning to add employees by the
thousands in the next few years, as is the building industry.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market is going through the roof, with hi-tech
workers building monster homes in the suburbs and along the
shorelines of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula _ a trend that
shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is that Seattle will lose its working class. The
friendly, diverse, endlessly tolerant city that attracted so many
people in the past few years risks turning into a haven for yuppies
and Microsofties to the exclusion of all others _ following much
the same pattern as San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the middle-class housing boom has encroached on suburbs
such as Renton and Everett, which traditionally belonged to
employees of the aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of Microsoft, the friendly small-town manners of
Seattle have been given a jolt by the aggressive, competitive ethos
of the world's fastest-growing economic sector. The resentment has
been as palpable as it has been unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   As David Brewster, a local columnist, wrote in the Seattle Times
recently: ``This form of hyper-capitalism, with its exaggerated
emphasis on homo economicus, is bound to have a transformative
effect on our region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing job cuts are only going to exacerbate that trend. In
all probability, many of the laid-off workers will find new
employment in construction. Local economists predict a slowing in
the economy but certainly not a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle will lose what is left of its innocence _ the
innocence that allowed it to profit from windfalls such as the
Alaska gold rush or the military construction boom of the Second
World War while enjoying a pleasant sense of provincial detachment
from the sources of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing cuts won't make Seattle a nicer place; they will drag
it reluctantly into the hard, real world. &QL;

 By SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY  
 c.1998 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ According to a bitter little joke that did the
rounds of Calcutta during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's emergency
rule between 1975 and 1977, India's troubles were due entirely to
Raja Rammohan Roy.
</P>
<P>
   He was an 18th-century Bengali social reformer who spearheaded
the movement to ban suttee, the Hindu practice of burning widows on
the husband's funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stories are flavored with extra spice. For not only does
another female, and a widow to boot, loom large on India's
political horizon, but Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, who
led the disgraced Congress party to victory in three states in
recent elections, was born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to these tales, you would be justified in supposing
that Indians are as uptight about the rest of the world as the
Chinese with their Middle Kingdom complex and horror of gweilos, or
foreign devils.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no country could be less xenophobic. Indeed, many
historians hold that India's receptive attitude to all comers, be
they from across the Hindu Kush mountains in the northwest or from
beyond the oceans, has been its undoing, playing into the hands of
predators and conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to a trusting nature a deep veneration of the Mother
Goddess, and its fleshly embodiment of mother, wife and daughter,
and you have an explanation of why so many women from abroad have
risen to positions of power and influence in India through the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sonia Gandhi _ whose husband, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime
minister when he was assassinated _ was Italian before she acquired
Indian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, now on the fast track to canonization, was an
ethnic Albanian from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the Frenchwoman known simply as The Mother who
presided over the devotees of Sri Aurobindo, a Bengali
revolutionary who fled to French-ruled Pondicherry.
</P>
<P>
   The community flourished and expanded under The Mother's
stewardship, with branches in every Indian city and hundreds of
thousands of worshippers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her at tennis in baggy satin slacks, or taking the
salute at the daily dusk parade of the faithful, from tiny toddlers
in green shorts to lumbering ancients in khaki, while the band
rolled out sonorous Wagnerian music.
</P>
<P>
   No detail of ashram administration, its farms and factories,
cars and clinics, was too petty or complicated for The Mother's
personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, most of the other foreign women who rose to
prominence in India were British. There is Margaret Noble, the
daughter of an Irish Protestant clergyman, who attached herself to
Swami Vivekananda, the 19th century Hindu preacher, and became
famous as Sister Nivedita.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mahatma Gandhi's most loyal disciples, Marjorie Slade,
known in India as Mirabehn, was not only the daughter of a Royal
Navy admiral but also Winston Churchill's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi the Congress Party's first female
European chief. There was Annie Besant, a radical humanist who went
on to found the Theosophical Society; also Nellie Sengupta, the
English wife of a Bengali nationalist barrister on whom Indians had
bestowed the sobriquet of Deshapriya, Lover of his Land.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these women were dragons, belying Francis Fukuyama's
idyllic view that a world run by women ``should become less
aggressive, adventurous, competitive, and violent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British closed down the nationalist-spiritual magazine
that Sister Nivedita edited, she warned darkly of violence.
``Evidently the Government is thirsting for the day when the
propaganda of assassination shall be the only method of service for
men who desire to give their lives to their country,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of her revolutionary activities, the Ramakrishna
Mission, the religious order with which Swami Vivekananda was
connected, eventually had to disavow her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Besant was just as formidable, declaring during World War
I, ``The moment of England's difficulty is the moment of India's
opportunity.'' She too had to be restrained by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Besant, you are distrustful of the British; I am not, and
I will not help in any agitation against them during the war,''
Mahatma Gandhi admonished her. He believed then that a victorious
Britain would voluntarily grant India independence.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard someone suggest that so many of these European
women attached themselves to eminent Indians that some might have
been plants.
</P>
<P>
   This was at a time when people in the milieu in which I grew up
were beginning to suspect the influence of Lady Mountbatten, the
wife of the last British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, on Jawaharlal
Nehru, soon to be India's first prime minister after independence.
</P>
<P>
   But those rumors were soon squashed. Whatever might be whispered
about the last viceroy's consort, not an adverse word would Indians
tolerate against foreigners, men and women, who gave themselves to
a people and a cause so far from home. That was an act of
identification that deserved gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners might even have an edge in a land that places such a
high value on everything imported. Mahatma Gandhi was addressing
Chinese women, not locals, when he said in 1947 that if only they
united, they could ``kick away the atom bomb like a mere ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has everything going for her. She is a
woman in a male-dominated society and an outsider in a land that
loves foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, if Mrs. Gandhi does scale dizzy political heights, would
she find it lonely at the top. Little noticed at home and abroad,
India's first lady, President K.R. Narayanan's wife, is Burmese. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ According to a bitter little joke that did the
rounds of Calcutta during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's emergency
rule between 1975 and 1977, India's troubles were due entirely to
Raja Rammohan Roy.
</P>
<P>
   He was an 18th-century Bengali social reformer who spearheaded
the movement to ban suttee, the Hindu practice of burning widows on
the husband's funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stories are flavored with extra spice. For not only does
another female, and a widow to boot, loom large on India's
political horizon, but Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, who
led the disgraced Congress party to victory in three states in
recent elections, was born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to these tales, you would be justified in supposing
that Indians are as uptight about the rest of the world as the
Chinese with their Middle Kingdom complex and horror of gweilos, or
foreign devils.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no country could be less xenophobic. Indeed, many
historians hold that India's receptive attitude to all comers, be
they from across the Hindu Kush mountains in the northwest or from
beyond the oceans, has been its undoing, playing into the hands of
predators and conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to a trusting nature a deep veneration of the Mother
Goddess, and its fleshly embodiment of mother, wife and daughter,
and you have an explanation of why so many women from abroad have
risen to positions of power and influence in India through the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sonia Gandhi _ whose husband, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime
minister when he was assassinated _ was Italian before she acquired
Indian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, now on the fast track to canonization, was an
ethnic Albanian from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the Frenchwoman known simply as The Mother who
presided over the devotees of Sri Aurobindo, a Bengali
revolutionary who fled to French-ruled Pondicherry.
</P>
<P>
   The community flourished and expanded under The Mother's
stewardship, with branches in every Indian city and hundreds of
thousands of worshippers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her at tennis in baggy satin slacks, or taking the
salute at the daily dusk parade of the faithful, from tiny toddlers
in green shorts to lumbering ancients in khaki, while the band
rolled out sonorous Wagnerian music.
</P>
<P>
   No detail of ashram administration, its farms and factories,
cars and clinics, was too petty or complicated for The Mother's
personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, most of the other foreign women who rose to
prominence in India were British. There is Margaret Noble, the
daughter of an Irish Protestant clergyman, who attached herself to
Swami Vivekananda, the 19th century Hindu preacher, and became
famous as Sister Nivedita.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mahatma Gandhi's most loyal disciples, Marjorie Slade,
known in India as Mirabehn, was not only the daughter of a Royal
Navy admiral but also Winston Churchill's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi the Congress Party's first female
European chief. There was Annie Besant, a radical humanist who went
on to found the Theosophical Society; also Nellie Sengupta, the
English wife of a Bengali nationalist barrister on whom Indians had
bestowed the sobriquet of Deshapriya, Lover of his Land.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these women were dragons, belying Francis Fukuyama's
idyllic view that a world run by women ``should become less
aggressive, adventurous, competitive, and violent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British closed down the nationalist-spiritual magazine
that Sister Nivedita edited, she warned darkly of violence.
``Evidently the Government is thirsting for the day when the
propaganda of assassination shall be the only method of service for
men who desire to give their lives to their country,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of her revolutionary activities, the Ramakrishna
Mission, the religious order with which Swami Vivekananda was
connected, eventually had to disavow her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Besant was just as formidable, declaring during World War
I, ``The moment of England's difficulty is the moment of India's
opportunity.'' She too had to be restrained by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Besant, you are distrustful of the British; I am not, and
I will not help in any agitation against them during the war,''
Mahatma Gandhi admonished her. He believed then that a victorious
Britain would voluntarily grant India independence.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard someone suggest that so many of these European
women attached themselves to eminent Indians that some might have
been plants.
</P>
<P>
   This was at a time when people in the milieu in which I grew up
were beginning to suspect the influence of Lady Mountbatten, the
wife of the last British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, on Jawaharlal
Nehru, soon to be India's first prime minister after independence.
</P>

   But those rumors were soon squashed. Whatever might be whispered
about the last viceroy's consort, not an adverse word would Indians
tolerate against foreigners, men and women, who gave themselves to
a people and a cause so far from home. That was an act of

high value on everything imported. Mahatma Gandhi was addressing

TRADING SWORDS FOR BLARING CROWDS

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Madness. Complete madness. It was schizophrenic,
split-brain, manic-depressive cognitive dissonance in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lives in its own world, but on Wednesday the
city's insanity was just a locked-ward version of the national
nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after President Clinton bombed Iraq, previously
scheduled pro- and anti-impeachment demonstrations turned into a
duel between conservative doves and liberal hawks. They were birds
of strange feathers, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the police fence were hundreds of conservative
demonstrators chanting for the impeachment of Bill Clinton and
arguing against the bombing of a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence were somewhat dispirited liberal
demonstrators chanting against impeachment and defending our attack
on the Third World country. Some of them, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Jacobson, who came from Palo Alto to be on the pro-Clinton
side of the fence, had to laugh after hearing conservatives condemn
Clinton's bombing of Iraq and liberals defend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a complete flip-flop from the '60s years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the anti-Clinton side of the fence, James Topscott
of San Francisco said he ran into a large anti-war demonstration in
another part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they're consistent,'' he said. ``They don't care who
the president is.''
</P>
<P>
   Those demonstrators carried signs like ``Impeach the system that
kills Iraqi children,'' and as always they marched on the San
Francisco newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Another '60s flip-flop: Many of the people on the pro-Clinton
side of the fence accused the anti-Clinton conservatives of being
outside agitators, of having been bused in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Hooterville,'' yelled Clinton supporter Mark
McClendon of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk show host Melanie Morgan, who had a bullhorn and was
leading the chants (including ``Pray for Chelsea'') said she
managed to call out the demonstrators on 24 hours notice, using her
talk show and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've brought out 5,000 demonstrators to other
demonstrations,'' she said, ``but the media never noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it took a Christmas bombing by Clinton. Nixon once gave us
a Christmas like that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Across the fence, a fence with no fence-sitters, the Glide
Church choir sang ``Love Train,'' and the Rev. Cecil Williams and
the Rev. Amos Brown gave anti-impeachment speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown and his arch-enemy, talk-show host Bernie
Ward, even sat on the same dais. Is that ``dais,'' or ``daze,''
which is what I'm in?
</P>
<P>
   Other '60s flip-flops: The conservatives had better signs, even
one saying ``Give impeachment a chance,'' held by a guy who said,
``Hey, make love, not war.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what his definition of making love was, but
presumably it was within sanctified marriages.
</P>
<P>
   More '60s flip-flops: The anti-Clinton conservatives had better
and stronger chants, borrowing the left-wing's ``Hey, hey, ho, ho''
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, the dirty liar's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for the liberals to respond with their own lame
hey-hey chants, and metrically clumsy ones like ``Hey, hey, ho, ho,
the Republican Congress has got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The best hey-hey-ers probably were those protesting both Clinton
and his attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to ``Hidey, hidey, hidey ho'' anyway?
</P>
<P>
   All this was a fitting end to one of the wildest days in
American history. The day before Congress was scheduled to begin
impeachment hearings, Clinton launched an attack against Saddam
Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and his Republican Guard.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a direct hit on the American Republican Guard, gaining
high poll ratings, making Sen. Trent Lott foam at the mouth, and
perhaps delaying the impeachment hearings until the next Congress
is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was exquisite, with the first cruise missiles
arriving just as people on the East Coast were getting ready to sat
down in front of the national news.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the president went on television, and then left
Secretary of Defense William Cohen the task of accusing Hussein of
``denial, delay and obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? But Hussein is completely evil. Think Linda
Tripp with anthrax bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of minutes after Clinton's speech, the ack-ack started
again and CNN cut back to Christiane Amanpour in Baghdad, just as a
bomb went off in a street right in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks produced,'' said an employee of Nordstrom's Pub,
where I was watching the action with a dozen stupefied waiters and
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even want to think it. Is the Pentagon using CNN to aim
its missiles?
</P>
<P>
   I hate to be paranoid here, but everyone's paranoid here.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Washington recently, three separate plans have been advanced
by which the U.S. armed forces would support Iraqi opposition
groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein. One of these
unwise ideas is called the ``enclave option.''
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents argue that the United States essentially would
help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi National
Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq, from
which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, however, is militarily ludicrous and would almost
certainly end in either direct American intervention or a massive
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave approach calls for the United States to declare the
rebel group, INC, as the legitimate government of Iraq, provide it
with the Iraqi regime's frozen assets, and help it recruit, train
and equip a highly mobile light infantry force of 10,000 to 20,000
troops, most of whom would be former Iraqi military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   These forces would then invade and occupy Iraqi Kurdistan, in
the country's north, and all of Iraq west of the Euphrates River
and south of the 32nd parallel, which would collectively be
declared ``Free Iraq.'' The United States would lift economic
sanctions on these zones and use airpower to help defend them from
Iraqi counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a haven for defectors and reducing Saddam's area of
control to the Mesopotamian river valleys, Baghdad and some of the
northwest, the INC argues, this strategy would either make the
Iraqi regime disintegrate or leave it vulnerable to an independent
rebel military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The INC has suggested that the entire operation would cost
little, take only a year or two and require such scant direct U.S.
military involvement that there would be almost no risk of
substantial American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the INC's president, Ahmed Chalabi, told a Senate hearing
last spring, ``Give the Iraqi National Congress a base protected
from Saddam's tanks, give us the temporary support we need to feed
and house and care for the liberated population, and we will give
you a free Iraq, an Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, and a
free-market Iraq. Best of all, the INC will do all this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan promises a huge payoff at a tiny cost, it has
unsurprisingly become the darling of Congress and critics of the
Clinton administration. It could well become popular with the
American public too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it
would lead inexorably to a replay of the Bay of Pigs. U.S.
officials would ultimately face the choice of intervening directly
or watching the rebels get butchered _ as happened with the INC's
last attempt to spark an insurrection, in northern Iraq from 1992
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East Institute's Andrew Parasiliti has observed,
``the INC enjoys more support along the Potomac than the
Euphrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the opposition's combat power comes from
two Kurdish militias operating in the north, Massud Barzani's
Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and one Shiite militia operating in the
south, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has its own agenda, and all have distanced themselves
from the umbrella organization. The leaders of all three groups
have said they are willing to coordinate their efforts but will not
follow the lead of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Internal opposition squabbling aside, America's regional allies
hate the plan. The Kuwaitis, Saudis, Jordanians and Turks adamantly
oppose all rollback efforts that do not include the direct use of
U.S. military power to ensure victory, fearing that half-hearted
efforts will fail and leave them facing Saddam's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that this plan is not just militarily
infeasible but downright dangerous. Even if one believes that
Kurdish forces alone, say, could hold the north, the plan still
would require some 10,000 to 20,000 lightly armed opposition troops
to control roughly 1,000 kilometers of land inside southern and
western Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This is an absurd force-to-space ratio. In contrast, U.S. Army
doctrine calls for a 20,000-man armored division to defend no more
than 15 to 35 kilometers of front.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the entire regular Iraqi army were to just remain
passive _ which has not been the case over the last eight years _
opposition troops would still face attacks from Saddam's 70,000-man
Republican Guard and 25,000-man Special Republican Guard. They
would have to hold vast stretches of territory without armor and at
a five-to-one numerical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a strategy of defending enclaves inside Iraq cedes the
initiative to Saddam once the opposition forces reach the Euphrates
and the 32nd parallel, letting him choose the time and place of
subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. air support could not protect the opposition troops
because Iraqi attacks could come during bad weather or simply at
night, when the U.S. ability to interdict ground troops is greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The United States simply does not have enough all-weather strike
aircraft to keep enough warplanes in the Persian Gulf to respond
instantaneously to regime attacks on opposition units inside Iraq
for the months and perhaps years that it would take to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Iraq is also particularly ill suited to this kind of
insurrection. The south's open desert terrain would be ideal for
Iraqi armored operations, and the area southwest of the Euphrates
is extremely sparsely populated. New opposition recruits would have
to come from Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, which Saddam would
be certain to defend furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Saddam could muster 10,000 to 15,000 loyal troops in
Basra's defense _ and remembering that U.S. air support would be of
limited help in urban operations, because of the doctrine to limit
civilian casualties _ Basra poses an insurmountable obstacle. A
tiny Iraqi rebel army could not survive without taking it but would
almost certainly be destroyed if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   For this enclave approach to have even a remote chance of
success, one of two assumptions would have to prove correct: that
the Iraqi regime and its armed forces would simply fall apart when
presented with a serious challenge, or that a few inexperienced
opposition light infantry brigades could somehow rise up to defeat
several Iraqi heavy divisions in open combat. Both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Iraq's armed forces were subjected to 39
days of incessant bombing, leaving them thoroughly demoralized. But
during the ground war, key units like the Republican Guard still
fought extraordinarily hard. These troops would fight once more
against the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the Iraqi rebels' military track record to date.
At Basra and Kirkuk in 1991 and again at Irbil in 1996, Iraqi army
and Republican Guard units easily crushed dug-in rebel Kurdish and
Shiite light infantry. The only opposition success came against the
Iraqi 38th Infantry Division _ the worst formation in the Iraqi
army, and at a time when that unit was demoralized, depleted,
surprised and without much armor or artillery support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INC bravely claims that it could emulate the success
of Chad in 1986-87, whose rebel forces smashed Libyan armored
power. But the Chadian army was made up of battle-hardened veterans
who had fought together for years and developed a high degree of
unit cohesion. Its military leadership was superb. And the enemy
Libyan army in 1986 was one of the most inept on earth.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly first-rate, the Iraqi army is more professional,
more experienced and better trained. And the combined Iraqi
opposition has no military organization at all. If the past is any
guide, it probably could not field a competent force even if given
years to train and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The INC leadership has shown little flair for field command,
identifying competent leaders, or honing their command skills. And
the finest soldiers the Iraqi opposition could boast would be Iraqi
army defectors, collected in dribs and drabs, and then thrown
together with political dissidents, tribesmen, intellectuals and
other opponents of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Such men are unlikely to suddenly discover a capability for
maneuver warfare that they heretofore utterly lacked. Worst of all,
many of these turncoats would be Saddam's spies, who would help
scuttle this bid to oust him just as informants have destroyed
every past opposition effort to do so. Clearly, relying on the
INC's battlefield prowess would be the mother of all mistakes.

<P>
   In Washington recently, three separate plans have been advanced
by which the U.S. armed forces would support Iraqi opposition
groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein. One of these
unwise ideas is called the ``enclave option.''
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents argue that the United States essentially would
help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi National
Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq, from
which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, however, is militarily ludicrous and would almost
certainly end in either direct American intervention or a massive
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave approach calls for the United States to declare the
rebel group, INC, as the legitimate government of Iraq, provide it
with the Iraqi regime's frozen assets, and help it recruit, train
and equip a highly mobile light infantry force of 10,000 to 20,000
troops, most of whom would be former Iraqi military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   These forces would then invade and occupy Iraqi Kurdistan, in
the country's north, and all of Iraq west of the Euphrates River
and south of the 32nd parallel, which would collectively be
declared ``Free Iraq.'' The United States would lift economic
sanctions on these zones and use airpower to help defend them from
Iraqi counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a haven for defectors and reducing Saddam's area of
control to the Mesopotamian river valleys, Baghdad and some of the
northwest, the INC argues, this strategy would either make the
Iraqi regime disintegrate or leave it vulnerable to an independent
rebel military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The INC has suggested that the entire operation would cost
little, take only a year or two and require such scant direct U.S.
military involvement that there would be almost no risk of
substantial American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the INC's president, Ahmed Chalabi, told a Senate hearing
last spring, ``Give the Iraqi National Congress a base protected
from Saddam's tanks, give us the temporary support we need to feed
and house and care for the liberated population, and we will give
you a free Iraq, an Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, and a
free-market Iraq. Best of all, the INC will do all this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan promises a huge payoff at a tiny cost, it has
unsurprisingly become the darling of Congress and critics of the
Clinton administration. It could well become popular with the
American public too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it
would lead inexorably to a replay of the Bay of Pigs. U.S.
officials would ultimately face the choice of intervening directly
or watching the rebels get butchered _ as happened with the INC's
last attempt to spark an insurrection, in northern Iraq from 1992
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East Institute's Andrew Parasiliti has observed,
``the INC enjoys more support along the Potomac than the
Euphrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the opposition's combat power comes from
two Kurdish militias operating in the north, Massud Barzani's
Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and one Shiite militia operating in the
south, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has its own agenda, and all have distanced themselves
from the umbrella organization. The leaders of all three groups
have said they are willing to coordinate their efforts but will not
follow the lead of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Internal opposition squabbling aside, America's regional allies
hate the plan. The Kuwaitis, Saudis, Jordanians and Turks adamantly
oppose all rollback efforts that do not include the direct use of
U.S. military power to ensure victory, fearing that half-hearted
efforts will fail and leave them facing Saddam's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that this plan is not just militarily
infeasible but downright dangerous. Even if one believes that
Kurdish forces alone, say, could hold the north, the plan still
would require some 10,000 to 20,000 lightly armed opposition troops
to control roughly 1,000 kilometers of land inside southern and
western Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This is an absurd force-to-space ratio. In contrast, U.S. Army
doctrine calls for a 20,000-man armored division to defend no more
than 15 to 35 kilometers of front.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the entire regular Iraqi army were to just remain
passive _ which has not been the case over the last eight years _
opposition troops would still face attacks from Saddam's 70,000-man
Republican Guard and 25,000-man Special Republican Guard. They
would have to hold vast stretches of territory without armor and at
a five-to-one numerical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a strategy of defending enclaves inside Iraq cedes the
initiative to Saddam once the opposition forces reach the Euphrates
and the 32nd parallel, letting him choose the time and place of
subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. air support could not protect the opposition troops
because Iraqi attacks could come during bad weather or simply at
night, when the U.S. ability to interdict ground troops is greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The United States simply does not have enough all-weather strike
aircraft to keep enough warplanes in the Persian Gulf to respond
instantaneously to regime attacks on opposition units inside Iraq
for the months and perhaps years that it would take to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Iraq is also particularly ill suited to this kind of
insurrection. The south's open desert terrain would be ideal for
Iraqi armored operations, and the area southwest of the Euphrates
is extremely sparsely populated. New opposition recruits would have
to come from Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, which Saddam would
be certain to defend furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Saddam could muster 10,000 to 15,000 loyal troops in
Basra's defense _ and remembering that U.S. air support would be of
limited help in urban operations, because of the doctrine to limit
civilian casualties _ Basra poses an insurmountable obstacle. A
tiny Iraqi rebel army could not survive without taking it but would
almost certainly be destroyed if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   For this enclave approach to have even a remote chance of
success, one of two assumptions would have to prove correct: that
the Iraqi regime and its armed forces would simply fall apart when
presented with a serious challenge, or that a few inexperienced
opposition light infantry brigades could somehow rise up to defeat
several Iraqi heavy divisions in open combat. Both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Iraq's armed forces were subjected to 39
days of incessant bombing, leaving them thoroughly demoralized. But
during the ground war, key units like the Republican Guard still
fought extraordinarily hard. These troops would fight once more
against the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the Iraqi rebels' military track record to date.
At Basra and Kirkuk in 1991 and again at Irbil in 1996, Iraqi army
and Republican Guard units easily crushed dug-in rebel Kurdish and
Shiite light infantry. The only opposition success came against the
Iraqi 38th Infantry Division _ the worst formation in the Iraqi
army, and at a time when that unit was demoralized, depleted,
surprised and without much armor or artillery support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INC bravely claims that it could emulate the success
of Chad in 1986-87, whose rebel forces smashed Libyan armored
power. But the Chadian army was made up of battle-hardened veterans
who had fought together for years and developed a high degree of
unit cohesion. Its military leadership was superb. And the enemy
Libyan army in 1986 was one of the most inept on earth.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly first-rate, the Iraqi army is more professional,
more experienced and better trained. And the combined Iraqi
opposition has no military organization at all. If the past is any
guide, it probably could not field a competent force even if given
years to train and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The INC leadership has shown little flair for field command,
identifying competent leaders, or honing their command skills. And
the finest soldiers the Iraqi opposition could boast would be Iraqi
army defectors, collected in dribs and drabs, and then thrown
together with political dissidents, tribesmen, intellectuals and
other opponents of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Such men are unlikely to suddenly discover a capability for
maneuver warfare that they heretofore utterly lacked. Worst of all,
many of these turncoats would be Saddam's spies, who would help
scuttle this bid to oust him just as informants have destroyed
every past opposition effort to do so. Clearly, relying on the
INC's battlefield prowess would be the mother of all mistakes.

   IRAQ-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Russia, China and France deplored the
U.S. and British attacks on Iraq, with the harshest rhetoric coming
from Moscow. Russia said the attacks could scuttle a plan by
Russia's parliament to approve the long-delayed START II nuclear
reduction treaty. Russia, China and France -- long supportive of
more conciliatory posture toward Iraq -- faulted the Clinton
administration for refusing to seek approval from the U.N. Security
Council before launching the strikes. Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov called on U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler to be
replaced. The Duma, the lower house of parliament, accused the U.S.
and Britain of international terrorism. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   IRAQ-BRITAIN _ LONDON _ At the height of the last crisis over
Iraq, Prime Minister Blair and President Clinton spoke together by
phone eight times in 12 hours. There is no reason to believe that
the two leaders communicated any less this time. Among world
leaders, Blair stands nearly alone in his support of the United
States particularly his close personal friend Bill Clinton. On
Thursday, Blair defended Clinton against assertions that the
military strike was launched to help Clinton with his domestic
crisis. Blair said that after consulting with Clinton, it became
clear that they would have been derelict in their duties not to
launch the attack. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   IMPEACH-BASE _ WASHINGTON _ Despite a last-minute flurry of
activity from Democratic allies, such as an anti-impeachment rally

   CLINTON-DOUBTS _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton found himself
Thursday having to defend his decision to attack Iraq from critics
asking whether the raids were timed to impact impeachment
proceedings. True or false, the allegations themselves complicate
the presidential decision-making process, make it difficult for
Clinton to get across the message behind his moves and raise
questions, in the minds of some, about his motives. Similar
questions have dogged Clinton all year and appear certain to
continue well into next year. (Deans, Cox News Service 700).

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON When it comes to Iraq and impeachment,
the wag-the-Buddy theories aired on Capitol Hill and in foreign

head fit the holes in Clinton's. (Glass, Cox News Service 560).

   GA-FLA-ALA-WATER _ Georgia, Florida and Alabama governors are

PATRIOTS STADIUM SITE OVERSHADOWED BY BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ That was one giant step forward Tuesday for
Connecticut officials in their efforts to bring the New England
Patriots here, but the journey is not done.
</P>
<P>
   And the next step is likely to be more troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the General Assembly's approval of a $375 million
deal for the National Football League franchise, Connecticut
officials must now assemble the land on which the stadium will
stand. The targeted parcels are mostly a mix of largely
underdeveloped land and parking lots along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also two large and important buildings on the
land, and how to go about removing them and paying for the
relocation is still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings are owned by CTG Resources Inc., an energy
holding company. One, the Connecticut Natural Gas Co.'s steam
energy plant that heats and cools downtown Hartford, is just about
where one end zone of the proposed stadium would be. The other
building, the gas company's headquarters, extends out from that end
zone to the prospective site for 50-yard-line seats.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings loom over both the site and Connecticut's plans
for the new home of the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial package approved overwhelmingly by the
General Assembly provides money for the stadium, it provides no
money for the purchase of the land or the development rights. In
fact, it makes no mention of the specific site at all.
</P>
<P>
   All it says is that, ``The state must acquire by condemnation,
purchase, lease, lease-purchase or otherwise the real property for
the stadium facility site and the infrastructure improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My current understanding is that the companies are going to
donate the land for the site,'' said Dean Pagani, Governor John
Rowland's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that might be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fiondella, the president, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., has been
leading the corporate charge to redevelop the site as Adriaen's
Landing, a $1 billion development of mixed uses, including a
stadium, a convention center, retail space, residential space, a
hotel and activities centers. Phoenix owns about 30 percent of the
land, only a sliver of which is designated for use for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years _ long before Patriots' vice president
Jonathan Kraft saw the plans for the site and figured the stadium
ought to be for the Patriots and UConn football, instead of just
the Huskies _ Fiondella has been trying to rally other businesses
and the state and city governments to the cause of redeveloping
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It has been Fiondella's idea that Phoenix, CTG and the other
major landowners _ The Travelers Group and the City of Hartford _
would form a land-management company, to be called the Adriaen's
Landing Management Company. The companies would donate the land to
the land management company, and then the management company would
sell the development rights.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the parcels on which the stadium would stand _
mostly on CTG Resources land _ would be yielded as part of the
development deal for Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original plans for Adriaen's Landing, which have been
proceeding publicly since May, well before the Patriots expressed
an interest, the state set up the Capitol City Economic Development
Administration to preside over the redevelopment. Earlier this
year, the state appropriated $350 million to get Adriaen's Landing
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, an agreement on the companies donating the land in
return for the development rights has not emerged from the
negotiation among the companies and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some discussions to be held on how all of that
will work out,'' said Keith Anderson, a spokesman for The
Travelers. ``There has been no agreement, yet, and what will come
out of this I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the negotiations are successful, it is unclear how
much the companies will seek for the development rights they would
sell in return for donating the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a revenue projection that says what the return
will be for the shareholders of the companies or the residents of
the city,'' said Deputy City Manager Patricia Williams. ``Frankly,
there has been no room for an appraisal. The project has great
support, but it has not progressed to a detailed study.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Fiondella insists that the ultimate price tag on
the development rights is not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really about how much money we are going to make,''
said Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Phoenix. ``These companies are
acting out of a sense of enlightened self-interest. It is important
for them and for the city that Hartford is redeveloped, that it is
viewed as a destination and that we begin to retain some of the
young people, the working force of the future, that is leaving
Hartford, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is not struck, the state may have to resort to
costly and potentially lengthy condemnation proceedings. That has
the potential of delaying the start of construction of the stadium.
If there is a major delay, according to officials familiar with the
details of the bill passed by the General Assembly Tuesday, the
Krafts would still have the right to back out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The major stumbling block appears to be CTG Resources Inc. While
Phoenix and Travelers have some parking lots on the land, which
will have to be replaced if employees are going to have some place
to park their vehicles after Adriaen's Landing and the stadium
rise, CTG Resource's subsidiary, Connecticut Natural Gas, would
have to move both its headquarters and the steam plant somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective bill is $100 million, some portion of which
could come from the development costs of Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   But what officials at CTG Resources have in mind is unclear.
They were not commenting beyond a statement by a company
spokeswoman that discussions about the land are ``ongoing and
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press release issued in May, CTG Resources president and
chief executive officer Arthur C. Marquardt said that the company
was pleased about the prospect of joining in the Adriaen's Landing
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, moving all of our operations would be a huge
undertaking,'' Marquardt said. ``But if all the other pieces can
come together to make this happen, we think it would be well
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other pieces, according to business and government
sources close to the negotiations, is the possibility that CTG
Resources, through its subsidiary, Connecticut Natural Gas, might
become the energy provider to all of the facilities encompassed
within Adriaen's Landing, including the stadium. CTG Resources has
said publicly that would represent a 25 percent increase in its
downtown heating and cooling business.
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources, which announced in July of 1997 that it was
seeking to diversify and expand its business, has said it would
invest nearly $30 million of its own money as part of the steam
plant relocation if it becomes the energy supplier to Adriaen's
Landing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has publicly discussed a possible joint
venture with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority to
produce steam at the recovery authority's trash-to-energy plant in
the South Meadows section of the city, replacing the steam plant on
the stadium site.

<P>
   Over the next several weeks, the bill that Connecticut lawmakers
passed to build a $375 million stadium in Hartford for the New
England Patriots will become a 250-page development contract that
must be signed by both team owner Robert Kraft and Governor John
Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The document will contain the nitty-gritty language, spelling
out in detail exactly how the stadium will be built. The
development agreement is expected to be completed before a Jan. 15
deadline and once Kraft signs it, he will be legally bound to move
the team there, officials say, or face legal action. Once the lease
between the team and the state is enacted, sometime during the
stadium's first year of operation, Kraft would have to pay the
state's remaining cost of financing the stadium if the team leaves
before the 30 year lease expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development agreement irons out the details not contained
in the bill. Even though the bill is long and extensive, it's still
pretty much a guide, a map of what is supposed to take place,''
said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani. ``There should be a fairly
significant portion of it done already because the lawyers involved
in putting the legislation together have been working on the
development agreement at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The document could include a firm date for the stadium opening,
now targeted at 2001. But in order to meet that construction
deadline, the site must be cleared by next July, officials said.
The agreement will also explain in detail how funds will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Rowland, though, dismiss any suggestion that bumps
could be encountered in the next several weeks as the final
development agreement is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about how this might
not happen,'' Pagani said. ``The stadium is going to get built.''

&HT;        SHUSTER WEIGHS IMPEACHMENT FOR SECOND TIME, MURTHA WON'T
IMPEACH
</HEADLINE>
    BY Lisa Fine  
   c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 -- The first time Rep. Bud Shuster was
considering impeaching a president, it was 1974 and President
Richard Nixon resigned before the House of Representatives could
take a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four years later, the Everett Republican is part of the
historic process again, and is still unsure how he'll vote on
impeachment articles against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, who is among a dwindling number of moderate Republicans
whose swing votes could determine whether the case against the
President will go to the Senate, is under pressure from seemingly
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is reading the various reports and documents,'' said Tim
Hugo, Shuster's chief of staff. ``He is taking this responsibility
very seriously, having been through this before with Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's office has received comments from about 600 callers,
about 60 percent of whom were in favor of impeachment, Hugo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hugo said, the White House called. They responded to
Shuster's request to see a copy of Clinton's answers to the House
Judiciary Committee's questions.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure from either party will not sway Shuster, Hugo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about partisan politics for Shuster,'' Hugo said.
``It is a constitutional obligation and one he takes very seriously
having been through it before. He is reading every word of
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster has been the target of an ethics investigation, which
was recently reopened, a point that aides say doesn't make Shuster
any more or less sympathetic toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ethics Committee is investigating whether personal and
professional ties between Shuster and his former chief of staff Ann
Eppard, who became a lobbyist in 1994, may have benefited her
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a part of the decision at all,'' Hugo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, has definitely made up
his mind. And half of the 250 callers that phoned his office since
Monday support his decision to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   `` We've had times where you can't get through on the lines,''
said Murtha's spokesman Brad Clemenson. ``Some people are asking
why won't you impeach him if he's done something wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha remains unswayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still hasn't seen anything that has risen to the level of
an impeachable offense,'' Clemenson said.

   ANTI-IMPEACHMENT FORCES CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED
   650 words
   
   By JULIA MALONE
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a vote looming Saturday in the House of
Representatives, stunned Democrats are puzzling over the revival of
an impeachment effort they thought they'd snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the outnumbered pro-impeachment forces had steadily
gained momentum. But where were the labor unions and the rest of
President Clinton's political base? Where were the Wall Street
financiers and business leaders to warn against the uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute flurry of activity from Democratic allies,
many of Clinton's champions were barely visible for the past five
weeks, as momentum gained for impeachment in the House. The full
House is scheduled to begin impeachment debate Friday before
Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was almost disbelief that this was actually going to get
to this level,'' said Naomi Walker, spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO.
The labor organization had suspended its stop-impeachment efforts
after the Nov. 3 elections in which Republicans unexpectedly lost
seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought (Republicans) had heard what they said in
November'' and would give up on impeaching Clinton, Walker said.
The unions have hurriedly reassembled a lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street and in corporate America, the silence has been
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a former Wall Street investment
banker, has made no apparent attempt to whip up concerns about the
economic effects of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the underlying economy, which is in the long run
what drives markets ... I think the most likely scenario is still
to look forward to solid growth and low inflation,'' he said
Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have business leaders expressed a general concern about
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a business issue,'' said Frank Coleman,
spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said his members,
instead of viewing it as an economic question, are asking, ``Do we
really want to do this?'' and ``Don't we want to draw the line
somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's admitted misconduct also has been a factor. It
has sapped some of the enthusiasm from defenders, according to
longtime Clinton ally, Will Marshall, president of the Progressive
Policy Institute. The research group is an off-shoot of the
moderate Democratic Leadership Council that Clinton helped found
and has been a strong policy partner of this White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of people have rallied behind the president and
defended him over the course of the last year,'' Marshall said.
``And many of them felt burned when he, in the end, was forced to
admit what had happened'' in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said ``most people think he acted deplorably,'' and he
added many Democrats have therefore shifted their focus from
Clinton himself to defending ``the results of a democratic
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had the steady backing of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson led a prayer vigil-turned-rally that drew
hundreds of people to the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, the day the
impeachment date originally was scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defenders, many of whom sported labor union jackets,
carried anti-impeachment signs at the rally, and when a speaker
asked the crowd if the president should be impeached, the group
shouted, ``Never!''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson has not been highly visible in the Clinton defense
in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, our presence will have made a statement,'' Jackson
said in calling for the 11th-hour vigil. ``If we lose the vote, at
least we were witnesses to this action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Hollywood supporters also waited until the last
minute, when the battle appeared to be lost. Barbra Streisand and
Jack Nicholson were headliners at a star-studded rally Wednesday in
Los Angeles. But by then, the undecided lawmakers were already
lining up in Washington to announce they would vote for
impeachment.

<P>
   Proponents of toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq have
advanced an option known as ``the Afghan approach.'' They argue
that the United States could simply help the Iraqi opposition mount
an insurgency on the model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan
Contras or the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that one key to successful guerrilla
war is a friendly neighboring country willing to provide the
insurgents with a secure base _ and none of Iraq's neighbors are
viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan approach calls for the United States to help the
Iraqi opposition establish a safe haven next to the theater of
operations. It would then recruit, train and equip a force that can
conduct a guerrilla insurgency against Saddam's regime. Guerrilla
warfare is the strategy of the weak, who can win only by slowly
wearing down their opponents' strength while slowly building up
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao's classic three-step approach _ start on the
defensive, force a stalemate, then go on the offensive _ the
opposition would start small and avoid conventional battles with
the Iraqi army until the rebels had a good chance of winning. After
many years, the insurgents would topple Saddam's regime and gain
control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   One can surely surmise that this plan, which requires only a
modest commitment of outside resources and no risk of substantial
American casualties, would be acceptable to the United States,
where it could be sold to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the Afghan plan is unacceptable to U.S.
regional allies, and their cooperation would be needed for it to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Successful guerrilla insurgencies require a secure rear area
where the rebels can train new recruits, shelter dependents, care
for their wounded, stockpile weapons and supplies, prepare for new
operations, and retreat and regroup in the face of government
offensives.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan played this role for the Afghan mujahideen, Honduras
did so for the Nicaraguan Contras, South Africa for UNITA, China
and later North Vietnam for the Viet Cong and so on. But no country
on Iraq's borders will host the opposition today. None of them is
prepared to live in a state of open warfare with Iraq for as long
as the rebellion takes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to prove _ most of the candidates for the job can
be dealt with quickly. Saudi officials have repeatedly stated that
they are not willing to go to war with Iraq indefinitely. Besides,
the Saudi territory bordering Iraq is sparsely populated desert _
awful terrain for mounting an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, while eager to see Saddam go, is also chary about a
long-term state of belligerency _ and also has uninhabited desert
on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which supported past measures to overthrow Saddam, has
consistently balked at allowing direct military moves against Iraq
from its territory, and it too has a vast unpopulated desert on its
Iraqi frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was always only a half-hearted member of the anti-Saddam
coalition and has never been willing to participate in direct
military operations against Iraq, even during the Persian Gulf War.
It too has mostly uninhabited desert on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only two plausible candidates, Turkey and Iran.
Turkey is certainly geographically suitable; the Turkish-Iraqi
border area consists of forested mountains and is well populated.
Unfortunately, the Turks have removed themselves from the running
because they know that any anti-Saddam insurgency based in Turkey
and northern Iraq would center around the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ankara worries that supporting such an insurrection would fuel
Kurdish political aspirations in general and embolden its own
Kurdish rebels. Despite repeated pleas from U.S. officials, the
Turks actually prefer to keep Saddam Hussein in power and have even
favored his efforts to reassert control over Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the final possibility, is the ideal staging ground for an
Iraqi insurgency. Indeed, it has sponsored both Kurdish and Shiite
guerrillas over the last four decades. Iran's border with Iraq runs
through abundant mountains, hills, forests and swamps; many
communities actually straddle the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since the United States and Iran are barely on speaking
terms these days, getting them to cooperate in sponsoring an
anti-Saddam insurgency would pose a formidable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems with the Afghan approach stem from the lengthy
time frame it would take to work. First, a long, drawn-out
guerrilla war in Iraq would eventually stick in the craw of world
opinion. The United States would find itself increasingly isolated
at the United Nations and elsewhere, which would affect other
foreign-policy issues _ including maintaining the sort of sanctions
and inspection regimes that keep Saddam relatively weak and
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this plan might eventually get rid of Saddam, but it
says nothing about how to manage the challenge he poses in the
present and foreseeable future. By embracing the Afghan approach,
the United States could easily find itself stuck in a couple of
years with a rebellion still in its larval stage and a resuscitated
Iraq increasingly free from international restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even if the Afghan approach succeeded, it might open up
a Pandora's box of new troubles. Destabilizing Saddam is not the
same as installing a pro-U.S. government in Baghdad. Instability in
Iraq could eventually lead to a military or security-service coup,
but this would not necessarily help the Iraqi National Congress,
the country's umbrella opposition group, or any other pro-Western
group gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iraq might even collapse into civil war. The result of
an Afghan-like insurgency, in other words, could be an Afghan-like
descent into chaos.

insurgents with a secure base _ and none of Iraq's neighbors are
viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan approach calls for the United States to help the
Iraqi opposition establish a safe haven next to the theater of
operations. It would then recruit, train and equip a force that can
conduct a guerrilla insurgency against Saddam's regime. Guerrilla
warfare is the strategy of the weak, who can win only by slowly
wearing down their opponents' strength while slowly building up
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao's classic three-step approach _ start on the
defensive, force a stalemate, then go on the offensive _ the
opposition would start small and avoid conventional battles with
the Iraqi army until the rebels had a good chance of winning. After
many years, the insurgents would topple Saddam's regime and gain
control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   One can surely surmise that this plan, which requires only a
modest commitment of outside resources and no risk of substantial
American casualties, would be acceptable to the United States,
where it could be sold to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the Afghan plan is unacceptable to U.S.
regional allies, and their cooperation would be needed for it to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Successful guerrilla insurgencies require a secure rear area
where the rebels can train new recruits, shelter dependents, care
for their wounded, stockpile weapons and supplies, prepare for new
operations, and retreat and regroup in the face of government
offensives.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan played this role for the Afghan mujahideen, Honduras
did so for the Nicaraguan Contras, South Africa for UNITA, China
and later North Vietnam for the Viet Cong and so on. But no country
on Iraq's borders will host the opposition today. None of them is
prepared to live in a state of open warfare with Iraq for as long
as the rebellion takes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to prove _ most of the candidates for the job can
be dealt with quickly. Saudi officials have repeatedly stated that
they are not willing to go to war with Iraq indefinitely. Besides,
the Saudi territory bordering Iraq is sparsely populated desert _
awful terrain for mounting an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, while eager to see Saddam go, is also chary about a
long-term state of belligerency _ and also has uninhabited desert
on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which supported past measures to overthrow Saddam, has
consistently balked at allowing direct military moves against Iraq
from its territory, and it too has a vast unpopulated desert on its
Iraqi frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was always only a half-hearted member of the anti-Saddam
coalition and has never been willing to participate in direct
military operations against Iraq, even during the Persian Gulf War.
It too has mostly uninhabited desert on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only two plausible candidates, Turkey and Iran.
Turkey is certainly geographically suitable; the Turkish-Iraqi
border area consists of forested mountains and is well populated.
Unfortunately, the Turks have removed themselves from the running
because they know that any anti-Saddam insurgency based in Turkey
and northern Iraq would center around the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ankara worries that supporting such an insurrection would fuel
Kurdish political aspirations in general and embolden its own
Kurdish rebels. Despite repeated pleas from U.S. officials, the
Turks actually prefer to keep Saddam Hussein in power and have even
favored his efforts to reassert control over Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the final possibility, is the ideal staging ground for an
Iraqi insurgency. Indeed, it has sponsored both Kurdish and Shiite
guerrillas over the last four decades. Iran's border with Iraq runs
through abundant mountains, hills, forests and swamps; many
communities actually straddle the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since the United States and Iran are barely on speaking
terms these days, getting them to cooperate in sponsoring an
anti-Saddam insurgency would pose a formidable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems with the Afghan approach stem from the lengthy
time frame it would take to work. First, a long, drawn-out
guerrilla war in Iraq would eventually stick in the craw of world
opinion. The United States would find itself increasingly isolated
at the United Nations and elsewhere, which would affect other
foreign-policy issues _ including maintaining the sort of sanctions
and inspection regimes that keep Saddam relatively weak and
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this plan might eventually get rid of Saddam, but it
says nothing about how to manage the challenge he poses in the
present and foreseeable future. By embracing the Afghan approach,
the United States could easily find itself stuck in a couple of
years with a rebellion still in its larval stage and a resuscitated
Iraq increasingly free from international restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even if the Afghan approach succeeded, it might open up
a Pandora's box of new troubles. Destabilizing Saddam is not the
same as installing a pro-U.S. government in Baghdad. Instability in
Iraq could eventually lead to a military or security-service coup,
but this would not necessarily help the Iraqi National Congress,
the country's umbrella opposition group, or any other pro-Western
group gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iraq might even collapse into civil war. The result of
an Afghan-like insurgency, in other words, could be an Afghan-like
descent into chaos.

MARINES RETURN TO NICARAGUA, THIS TIME ON AID MISSION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua _ Children on school buses and
market-bound farmers driving horse-drawn carts pulled off the road
to gawk as convoys of U.S. military construction equipment moved
down their pitted highways on a mission to provide hurricane
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred bulldozers, graders, jeeps and trucks, painted
camouflage green and driven by U.S. soldiers with crew cuts, rolled
out this week from the Pacific Coast port of Corinto in 30 small
caravans, bound for the northern provinces of Esteli, Matagalpa,
Jinotega and Nueva Segovia, where rains from the hurricane named
Mitch washed out roads and bridges and demolished homes, crops and
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The convoys were a remarkable sight for Nicaraguans, not only
because of the massive display of equipment and the substantial
reconstruction assistance it represents, but because they mark a
new chapter in the uneasy history of relations between the United
States and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   As the military machines rumbled slowly through riverbeds where
concrete bridges had been washed away, they were accompanied by
Nicaraguan soldiers. That escort was in stark contrast to a time
less than 10 years ago when the Nicaraguan army was defending
against attacks by the U.S.-funded and trained contra rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua's newspapers and television broadcasts are filled with
reports marking the arrival of the troops and with discussions of
the irony of the military presence, in light of both the contra war
that sought to oust the leftist Sandinista government and episodes
with the Marines earlier in the century.
</P>
<P>
   From 1909 to 1925 and again from 1926 to 1933, the U.S. Marines
occupied Nicaragua, installing and ousting presidents at will and,
in the process, provoking the resentment of the Nicaraguan
population. Nationalist leader Augusto Cesar Sandino, from whom the
Sandinistas took their name and their inspiration, waged a fierce
guerrilla war against the U.S. troops. Unable to defeat Sandino's
ragtag army, the Marines withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasio Somoza Garcia, a Nicaraguan military leader, had
Sandino killed and declared himself president in 1937. He and his
sons would rule the country until 1979.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of the U.S. military this week, a headline the
daily La Prensa read Tuesday: ``The north will be `invaded' today
by North American soldiers.'' Wednesday's newspaper headline:
``Marines return to the Segovias: history repeats itself, but this
time in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   One young Marine, Lance Cpl. Carlos Perez, sat under the shade
of a tree Tuesday in the town of El Realejo, where soybean fields
serve as a staging area for deploying the American equipment. He is
one of 220 Marines in the country providing logistical support for
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, from Puerto Rico, chatted with his buddies as he waited
for orders to ship out. His destination was Ocotal, the capital of
Nueva Segovia and the site of one of Sandino's fiercest attacks on
the Marine barracks, which still stand on one side of the town's
central plaza. But unlike his Nicaraguan hosts, Perez was oblivious
to the history there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to purify water,'' he said. ``That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tracy Leahy, a helicopter crewman from Los Angeles, was
more conscious of the effect of the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate situation, with the tensions of the past,''
Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy will help deliver equipment and personnel to Wiwili, a
remote town on the Coco River, along the Honduran border where the
Army plans to replace a health clinic that was washed away Oct. 26
by the hurricane. The humanitarian effort takes place in a region
where the contra rebels repeatedly destroyed health clinics, as
well as schools, bridges and electrical generators during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which stalled over Central America for days, killed
more than 9,000 people and left as many as 2 million others
homeless in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. reconstruction project in Nicaragua involves 1,800
military personnel who will rebuild bridges and roads, repair water
systems, build a health clinic and provide primary and preventive
medical care in rural communities damaged by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The troops are scheduled to work for about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be opening up secondary roads to allow farmers to get
their crops to market, because without that, the short-term
disaster could hurt them in the long-term,'' said Army Col. Lynn
Collyer, who is in charge of the support teams that will provide
food and shelter for the military engineers and medics.
``Everything we're doing is going through the Defense Ministry, the
Health Ministry and the Ministry of the Interior.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Although the current president, Arnaldo Aleman, is close to the
United States, the country is nevertheless approaching this new
cooperation with care.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan military escorts not only serve as protection for
U.S. soldiers, but signal that the United States does not have free
run of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Assembly has been debating whether to
allow the president to extend the soldiers' stay to get more work
done. The head of the Nicaraguan army assured legislators this week
that the American presence would not become permanent because the
Nicaraguan constitution prohibits foreign military bases in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Nicaraguans, particularly Sandinistas who have
vivid memories of the U.S. intervention of the 1980s, fear the
humanitarian project could be a pretext for further interference in
Nicaragua's internal affairs, perhaps even an attempt to influence
the outcome of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Chavarria, who oversees several small development
projects for peasant farmers in the province of Leon, estimated
that one-third of the population supported the U.S. assistance,
one-third opposed it and the rest were indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavarria considers himself a Sandinista, he said he
thought the military assistance might be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The help is needed,'' he said. ``And we're living in different
times now. Maybe this is an opportunity for the U.S. to show us
it's capable of dealing with us differently than it used to.''

   AS HAITIAN EXILES SEEK HIS ARREST IN FRANCE, 'BABY DOC' DUVALIER
CLAIMS HE DID NOTHING WRONG
   With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.

   c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Emboldened by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Haitian-born photographer in
France plans to announce legal action Friday aimed at bringing
ousted Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to trial for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people were massacred or tortured to death
during the 31-year reign of ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier and his father,
Francois, known as ``Papa Doc.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the weekly French newsmagazine VSD, which hit
newsstands Thursday, Duvalier said he was innocent of any
wrongdoing, and that he deserved credit for helping usher democracy
in to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed an interest in returning to politics some day, and
said that ``his greatest desire'' would be returning to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 constitutional ban that prohibited infamous Duvalierists
from holding political office in Haiti expired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely not afraid because I have done nothing
wrong,'' Duvalier was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 1980s I put the country on the road to democracy,
and I abolished the death penalty in 1983,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But to the delight of Haitian groups in the United States,
Gerald Bloncourt recently formed a committee in Paris that hopes to
bring Duvalier to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bloncourt said Tuesday that he had gathered all the ``necessary
elements'' for a lawsuit and would announce legal action at a press
conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's acting on behalf of more than 60,000 Haitians
killed or tortured at the hands of Duvalier's notoriously brutal
Tontons Macoutes militia.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian groups welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much doubt that Duvalier personally attached electrodes
to anyone's body parts, but he was in command so he should be held
responsible,'' said Merrill Smith, director of Haiti Advocacy Inc.,
a non-profit lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Named ``president for life'' at age 19 following the death of
his father in 1971, Duvalier, now 47, was forced into exile in
France after being overthrown in 1986 by a U.S.-supported coup.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duvalier is reportedly broke and getting by on handouts
from supporters, he has maintained a peaceful existence away from
the spotlight -- that is, until Pinochet's case emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in October and is being detained in
Britain while Spain seeks his extradition to face charges of murder
and torture of its citizens during his 17-year reign, which ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise twist to the case, Britain's highest court on
Thursday ordered a new hearing into whether Pinochet is immune from
prosecution, setting aside a previous ruling that he is not immune.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's House of Lords had been asked by Pinochet's lawyers to
discard its previous judgement declaring he had no immunity on the
grounds that one of the judges involved was biased because of his
close ties to the human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords said Thursday that it would re-hear
Pinochet's case next month.
</P>
<P>
   The actions against Pinochet have inspired Haitian exiles in
France to seek a trial for Duvalier.
</P>
<P>
   Although French government authorities have claimed they've lost
track of Duvalier, police sources have said that he's been seen
recently in Paris and in Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The interview in the newsmagazine was conducted by a French
journalist who was taken ``somewhere in France'' by one of
Duvalier's friends for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, the Haitian government has encouraged
Haitian exiles to take Duvalier to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitian government is quite supportive of this effort,''
said Ira Kurzban, the Haitian government's Miami-based legal
adviser. ``We have substantial paperwork that could assist with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Ross Robinson, the Haitian government's lobbyist in
Washington, said Haitians in the United States want Duvalier to be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People suffered so much under Duvalier and people want him to
take responsibility for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added that Haitians also would like to see action taken
against Raoul Cedras, who savagely repressed the poor nation after
seizing power in 1991. By 1994, when Cedras was forced into exile
by a U.S. invasion, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Haitians had been
killed or tortured to death.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cedras reportedly lives in a posh neighborhood in Panama
City where he owns a penthouse apartment.

   THE MOOD ON CAPITOL HILL IS HARDLY MERRY
   620 words
   By BOB DART
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Oh Holy Night'' blared from a boom box set beside
a Christmas creche on the steps of Congress on Thursday, but
seasonal peace and goodwill could barely squeeze into the cacophony
of emotions on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Mistrust overpowered any sense of merriment on this day of dual
crises, and crusaders from conflicting causes rallied their
followers with claims of spiritual support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 19 years, and this year is the most
strange,'' observed Rita Warren, 70, the grandmother from Fairfax,
Va., who set up the Nativity scene on east side of the Capitol and
played an audiotape of Christmas carols.
</P>
<P>
   On a nearby corner, Fred Phelps, pastor of the Westboro Baptist
Church of Topeka, Kan., stood with some of his flock _ calling for
the impeachment of President Clinton and condemning the bombing of
Iraq. Wearing a cowboy hat, Phelps carried a sign bearing a
caricature of Clinton and the words ``Impeach Fags'' in one hand
and an Iraqi flag in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation is going to hell in a handbasket carried by the
pervert-in-chief,'' said Phelps, who said he has followed the
president to several sites to lead similar protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picketed his mother's funeral in Hot Springs, Ark.,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Clinton supporters congregated near the
Capitol Christmas tree for an anti-impeachment rally led by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson. Arriving by the busload, many wore jackets
bearing the names of labor unions. Asked by a speaker if Clinton
should resign, they chanted ``Never. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of protests was borne out on placards in the
crowd. While some carried pro-Clinton messages such as ``Impeach
Congress,'' others said ``Don't Bomb Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, in this season, unite and heal the wounds,''
implored Kurt Schmoke, the mayor of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, standing by her figures of Joseph, Mary, the baby
Jesus and the three wise men, Rita Warren had her own causes to
espouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Italy in World War II during the bombing,'' she
recalled. ``I was praying for the children in Iraq all last night.
If Clinton doesn't get impeached here, the Lord will take care of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The military action had brought an unexpected delay to most
House members who returned from holiday recess for the impeachment
debate and possible votes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The inconveniences fall especially heavy on about 40 lame-duck
members who are legislatively homeless. Their offices already are
occupied by other members in anticipation of the start of the new
Congress on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Known for catering to the comforts of his charges, Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, set up desks for the Republican ``departing
members'' in his suite of offices in the Capitol. Some Democrats
were working on folding tables in a converted banquet room in the
basement of the Rayburn House Office Building, and others found
refuge in the offices of other members.
</P>
<P>
   In this Departing Member Center, blue partitions divided the
room into cubicles, and the lame ducks were assigned a desk, chair,
telephone and computer. None was happy about being called back to
cast this last vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible way to go out,'' Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring after 34 years in Congress, Hamilton said, ``There are
1,001 other issues I would prefer to vote on'' than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee member Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is moving
over to the Senate but kept his office until the impeachment
hearings ended. On Wednesday, his staff filled and moved boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been packing, and the phones been ringing off the hook,
and there's impeachment (which Schumer opposes),'' said Nicole
Rutberg, a staffer. ``It's been hectic.''

   &UR; Part I: THE `ROLLBACK' FANTASY _ WHY DIDN'T THE U.S. and
BRITAIN LAUNCH AN IRAQI BAY OF PIGS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October, Congress rushed to embrace an Iraq Liberation Act,
authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid to democratic
Iraqi resistance groups. President Clinton's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight. The
basic idea behind it? That the United States should refuse to
accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and help install the
Iraqi opposition in his place. (slugged:
BC-IRAQ-OPPOSITION-GROUPS-ONE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Part II: THE `ROLLBACK' FANTASY _ WHY NOT HAVE THE IRAQI
NATIONAL CONGRESS SEIZE CHUNKS OF IRAQ? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of current U.S. policy argue that the United States
should help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi
National Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq,
from which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule. But this
plan is militarily ludicrous and would almost certainly end in a
massive bloodbath. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-REBELS-INCOMPETENT -TWO-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Part III: THE `ROLLBACK' FANTASY _ HOW ABOUT SPONSORING A
GUERILLA WAR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One more option for toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is
known as ``the Afghan approach.'' It stipulates that the United
States could help the Iraqi opposition mount an insurgency on the
model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan Contras or the Viet
Cong. Iraq's neighbors, however, aren't terribly relieved at this
prospect. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-GUERILLA-WAR-THREE-NYTSF &LR;  &QL;

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a somewhat large
difference between Minnesota (No. 1) and the New York Jets (2), but
a much smaller difference between Denver (3) and San Francisco (4).

``THE EMPEROR'S SHADOW'': WAS A UNITED CHINA WORTH ANY SACRIFICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about absolute power! When an assassination attempt is made
on the life of the first Chinese Emperor, Ying Zheng (Jiang Wen),
while he is traveling through the countryside, his order to have
everyone within three miles of his party killed is instantly and
unquestioningly obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make Ying (who is known today as Qin Shi Huangdi) one
of history's all-time worst monsters? Not according to ``The
Emperor's Shadow,'' which portrays Ying as a shrewd but misguided
idealist who believes that the securing of his power to realize his
dream of a united China is worth any sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Zhou Xiaowen's entertaining epic-size portrait of Ying,
who rose to power in the third century B.C., you have the
inescapable sense of a film steeped in politics. After Ying
conquered and united several feuding Chinese kingdoms, his empire
lasted for a scant 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie illustrates in its scenes of ferocious battle-ax
combat, torture and mass beheadings, Chinese peace and unity were
achieved at a staggering human price.
</P>
<P>
   Did the end justify the means? Ying insisted it did. At the same
time, the film implicitly compares his brutal exercise of power
with China's Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong. That campaign to
re-make and unify the country didn't last long either.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about ``The Emperor's Shadow,'' which opens Friday in
Manhattan, is splendidly oversized. The ``shadow'' of the title is
Gao Jianli (Ge You), Ying's childhood friend, a man as fiercely
opposed to violence as the future emperor is its unquestioning
advocate in the name of expedience. A physically fragile musical
genius and master of the zither, Gao as a child shared a wet nurse
with Ying.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunningly dramatic early scene, the teen-age Ying and Gao
are about to be beheaded by a conquering army. Moments before the
ax is to fall, Gao begins strumming his instrument. The music gives
Ying the courage to face an imminent death from which both are
spared at the very last second.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, the two boys steal into the tent of the
enemy leader, who is dead drunk, drag him into a ditch and bury him
alive. In the film's eeriest moment, they put their ears to the
dirt and listen in wonder to his muffled death throes.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the film jumps ahead many years. Ying, now the
imperially ambitious ruler of his own realm. sends for Gao, who
lives in the neighboring kingdom of Yan, which Ying's army has just
conquered. A believer in the power of music to stir masses of
people, Ying intends to make his childhood friend his court
composer and hopes he will write an imperial anthem.
</P>
<P>
   But Gao, who would rather die than serve such a brutal leader,
goes on a hunger strike. When Ying enlists his eldest daughter and
favorite child Ying Yueyang (Xu Qing) to try to save Gao's life,
the two fall in love, and after a frenzied bout of lovemaking, the
daughter, who had lost the use of her legs in a riding accident,
suddenly finds herself able to walk. But since Ying has bethrothed
her to the son of his most trusted general, the two are unable to
marry.
</P>
<P>
   Passion, politics, a life-and-death power struggle between two
intractable Olympians of opposing temperament: this heaving,
nostril-flaring historical drama asks big questions about imperial
ambition and art, about the value of friendship versus loyalty to
one's principles.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have heard of these people, but like historical
characters who are household words, they are larger than life,
exercising the will of their unbounded egos while arrogantly
strutting across the world's stage.
</P>

``LENA'S DREAMS'': THE ACTOR'S LIFE FOR THEM: AUDITIONS AND
REJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woe is the actor's life: judgment, rejection, humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Lena is angry. She is angry at the people who assess
her at auditions. She is angry at Jorge (David Zayas), the
neglectful agent who hasn't bothered to check on her three call
backs as a candidate to star on Broadway opposite Andy Garcia in
``Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is angry at her boyfriend, Mike (Gary Perez), who is in
the midst of giving up his own acting ambitions to take a steady
job, so they can get married and have children, a decent apartment
and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Lena is angry at herself. Ten years after beginning
her career and five years _ or is it seven? _ after vowing at 25 to
quit if she didn't achieve success by 30, Lena is seething with
rage as she faces another birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Played by Marlene Forte, this Cuban-American actress is the
passionate centerpiece of ``Lena's Dreams,'' which opens Friday at
Anthology Film Archives. Anyone who has ever struggled to achieve
success as an actor in New York is likely to identify with Lena and
her friends, who study, accept unremunerative roles in workshop
productions and get rare roles only to be ignored or slighted by
some undistinguished critic, should the play even merit a review.
And in the meantime, they wait on tables and live on little money
and lots of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, some make compromises or drop out. Mike's friend
Johnny (Jeremiah Birkett) is happy with the occasional commercial,
and Lena's pal Suze (Susan Peirez), Johnny's former girlfriend, has
opted for law school, marriage to a wealthy lawyer and a big house
in the suburbs, all to her regret.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Heather Johnston and Gordon Eriksen,
``Lena's Dreams'' is not a film of many surprises but one of
well-observed truths. Focused primarily on Lena and at its
liveliest in her volcanic eruptions, ``Lena's Dreams'' maintains a
gritty sense of the reality of its characters' lives while keeping
the romance of show business alive in its heart.
</P>
<P>
   Camaraderie, friendship and love, it suggests, are the true
rewards. Struggle is to be cherished, and success _ as indicated by
the loneliness and alcoholism in the life of Angela (Kai Adwoa), an
acting teacher who achieves stardom at 40 _ may be a false goddess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting is a miserable profession,'' Angela says. ``If you can
do something else and be happy, do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Lena's Dream'' makes clear in its forthright, unadorned
way is that for some people, there is no happiness in doing
anything else.

FOR CLINTON, THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients) ,
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like Richard Nixon a quarter century ago, Bill
Clinton is not going to give up the power and perquisites of the
presidency without a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   We can argue endlessly about the timing of Clinton's order to
fire missiles at key targets in Iraq, but there can be no argument
about the embattled president's authority to issue the order.
</P>
<P>
   Until the moment he gives up the presidency, whether voluntarily
or not, he can _ and undoubtedly will _ wield the authority of his
office as he deems proper.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor over impeachment proceedings in Congress,
Clinton, like Nixon, will perform his duties as if there are no
possible barriers to his filling out the term to which he was
elected. That would mean remaining in the White House until Jan.
20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To almost anyone who remembers Nixon, Clinton's plucky
performance in visiting Israel and Palestine-controlled Gaza last
week was eerily reminiscent of Nixon's triumphal journeys through
Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and the Soviet Union in
June 1974, just two months before his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic irony of Clinton's and Nixon's misdeeds was brought
into clear focus far from the halls of Congress as people in other
lands acclaimed them as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   After a tumultuous reception in Alexandria, Egypt, Nixon
remarked to President Anwar Sadat: ``There is an old saying that
you can turn people out but you can't turn them on. They have
touched our hearts, and I'm sure the hearts of millions of
Americans who saw that welcoming on television.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza last week, Clinton told the cheering Palestine National
Council, ``This has been a remarkable day.'' And indeed it was. The
Palestinians had just voted to eliminate from their doctrine a call
for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   History undoubtedly will record Nixon and Clinton as among
America's most intelligent and tenacious presidents, while at the
same time emphasizing their character flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a painful, life-threatening attack of phlebitis and the
demands of his doctors that he discontinue his trip, Nixon went
through all the receptions, speeches and tourist events that had
been planned for him.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from the Middle East, Clinton undoubtedly knew that
his congressional foes would accuse him of ordering an attack on
Iraq to frustrate the impeachment process. But, like Nixon, he did
his thing.
</P>
<P>
   When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, little did
they anticipate that 211 years later their blueprint for removing a
president from office would collide the implementation of his
constitutionally decreed authority as commander-in-chief of the
armed services.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened. Impeachment proceedings had to be
suspended briefly by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant decision of many Republicans to give higher
priority to attacking a foreign foe than to impeaching the chief
executive demonstrated that even members of House and Senate who
view the president as a charlatan and want him removed from office
understand the political imperative of supporting the
commander-in-chief in a military crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has America faced such a strange choice. But then America
never has had a president quite like Clinton _ one who manages to
retain his high standing with voters despite shoddy personal
behavior and the determination of his congressional opponents to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater ordeal still lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As Nixon was the architect of his own downfall, Clinton likewise
has brought his troubles on himself.
</P>
<P>
   He may at times appear to be a forlorn figure, with diminished
influence, but, like Nixon, he will be an active president until
the termination of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   With his order to fire missiles at Iraq, the president should
have quieted contentions that from here on out he will be a
president without power or portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the White House in disgrace, Nixon made a
comfortable life for himself writing books and touring the world.
His philosophy, he said, was to never give up.
</P>
<P>
   That also would appear to be Clinton's philosophy. While
politicians ridiculed the timing of the assault on Iraq, the
president emphasized that all of his national security advisers,
including military professionals, supported his decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the historic session in Gaza, Hillary Rodham Clinton's sad
expression seemed at times to reflect her understanding that all
the hope and glory of the moment could evaporate within weeks or
months.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, congressional Democrats and Republicans, frozen by
partisanship into unyielding positions, had been unable to
determine how to fulfill the old Gilbert and Sullivan admonishment
to ``let the punishment fit the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nixon's day, some Republicans crossed over to join Democrats
in condemnation of a Republican president. This time, the opposing
sides could not achieve a consensus on the proper punishment for
Clinton's crime of lying in a court deposition and to a federal
grand jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the lengthy, Judiciary Committee hearings
Wisconsin's Thomas Barrett, a Democrat, looked about him and
protested, ``Something is wrong here.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong he detected was absolute partisanship by the committee
members. Republicans, sitting in the majority, demanded impeachment
of Clinton. Democrats, in the minority, opposed impeachment and
urged censure.
</P>
<P>
   Except for South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who voted
against one count of impeachment, members of the two parties
remained bound by partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``comeback kid'' is to save his presidency, he is going
to have to give the performance of a lifetime when the 106th
Congress convenes in January.

``THE GENERAL'': IRISH THIEF OF HEARTS AND OTHER TRINKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``The General'' was shown as part of this year's New
York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2. The film
opens Friday in Manhattan.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   No doubt John Boorman's canny, elegant new film, ``The
General,'' about the notorious Irish thief Martin Cahill, hits
unusually close to home for the filmmaker. The real Cahill actually
did hit Boorman's home some years ago and stole the gold record
that had been awarded to Boorman for ``Dueling Banjos,'' from
``Deliverance.'' Now he has his chance to return the favor, and
what a chance it is.
</P>
<P>
   He tells this tale of an Irish underworld original with an
unerring instinct for the captivating detail. And he presents this
film (photographed by Seamus Deasy) in such seductively beautiful
black and white that it has the visual precision of a photo essay.
The black-and-white tones (shot on color stock) are so rich that
the ski masks of burglars wind up looking like velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman begins this story, a much more familiar one in Ireland
than it is here, with the brutal end of Cahill's career. (He died
in 1994, caught not by the police who had dogged him for years but
by the Provisional IRA.) Boorman then deftly traces the basis for
Cahill's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed after Gen. Douglas MacArthur, he showed a taste for
larceny at an early age (and is played as a boy fleetingly by
Eamonn Owens, fiery young star of ``The Butcher Boy'').
</P>
<P>
   Always fascinated and sometimes aghast, ``The General'' watches
Martin develop his trademark style. As played magnificently by
Brendan Gleeson, who bears an amazing resemblance to the real
Cahill, he had a modus operandi often bordering on pure mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill went to such great lengths to hide his face from public
view that he is most often seen in photographs hiding inside the
hood of a ski parka.
</P>
<P>
   He presided over an unusual two-house domestic arrangement that
involved both his wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and her sister, Tina
(Angeline Ball).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most films based on true stories whose real participants
are alive, well and legally represented, ``The General'' doesn't
seem to pull its punches about its surviving characters. Boorman,
working in top form with a keenly acerbic overview, has written the
film so sharply that the facts speak well for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With his police nemesis, Inspector Ned Kenny, beautifully
embodied by Jon Voight as a weary Javert who knows all Cahill's
tricks, Cahill becomes for Boorman a figure of compelling
controversy as well as a source of great crime tales.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's most startling juxtapositions, Cahill
punishes one of his own men so savagely that the act becomes part
of his legend. Then he takes this same man to a hospital, having
decided that the punishment was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman's great skill in unifying ``The General'' lies in
creating a big, blustery, most unlikely hero whose nature so easily
embraces both these extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky crime sequences here are especially well staged, and make
fine use of Cahill's rampant contradictions. The most brazen (and
famous) of these finds Cahill playing the art lover and with his
band of henchmen spiriting off a cache of treasures, including a
Vermeer, offering their own priceless opinions about the artwork,
and carefully leaving the ``Please Do Not Touch'' sign undisturbed.

EAU DE MISS PIGGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a known fact that desperate shoppers will buy just about
anything at Christmastime, which could explain the thinking behind
the new Miss Piggy fragrance line called Moi.
</P>
<P>
   Moi perfume sells for $24 a bottle at Bloomingdale's and is said
to smell like ``a rendering plant in August.'' No, wait, that was a
typo. It's supposed to smell like ``a bouquet of seductive flowers
warmed with `come-hither' notes of warm blonde woods.''
</P>
<P>
   As a guy who once gave his wife cocktail napkins for a Christmas
gift, I am probably not the best person to ask whether you should
or shouldn't give Miss Piggy perfume to that special someone in
your life unless, of course, you want that special someone out of
your life very quickly, in which case I recommend you buy her a
barrel of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This is in no way meant to disparage Miss Piggy, Kermit or any
of the other Muppets, all of whom are terrific and would probably
make good elected officials in the sense that, being nothing more
than elaborate socks, they are very trustworthy, and even more
importantly, chaste.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that many women yearn to smell like Miss
Piggy, seductive flowers and notes of warm blonde woods
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For all her charms, Miss Piggy is still a pig, or, more
accurately, a pig sock, an olfactory and/or semantic distinction
that many women may have trouble making.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever been downwind from a pig farm, the word
``bouquet'' takes on an entirely different meaning from that
intended by the makers of Moi.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be a problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``One might think that, but I think that Miss Piggy herself is
so lovable that she brings with it not the normal feeling about pig
scents,'' Nancy Lueck, a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Piggy is the Elizabeth Taylor of that world,'' said
Topper Schroeder, one of the developers of the new perfume. ``This
is not your ordinary pig,'' he added, referring, one hopes, to Miss
Piggy and not Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I am not the only one who has doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of when you think of Miss Piggy's smell?
It's not good,'' said Laura Ries, president of Ries &AMP; Ries, a
marketing strategy group in Atlanta. ``She's a Muppet. Who wants to
smell like a Muppet?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Big Bird, possibly, or maybe Oscar the Grouch. (One can
only pray that the fragrance-makers do not get it in their heads to
make a scent based on Rizzo the Rat, The Count, Gonzo or Animal.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I may be, and probably am, wrong about this whole
thing. Aside from the fact that she is not, technically, real, Miss
Piggy has a lot of wonderful qualities, so many that Elizabeth
Taylor ought to be honored to be mentioned in the same sentence
with Miss Piggy instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Piggy is strong, capable, independent and self-assured, yet
at the same time very feminine. She has written best-selling books,
appeared in hit motion pictures and television shows and been on
the covers of People, Life and TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   She is certainly not the kind of person (pig? puppet?) that
would take kindly to people taking cheap shots at her new fragrance
line or, worse yet, raising questions about the personal hygiene of
her and her kin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm so embarrassed by this whole thing that I'm going
to run out and buy several bottles of Moi for my wife this
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be a step up from the cocktail napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>

   STRIKES ON IRAQ PROMPT BITTER CRITICISM FROM RUSSIA, OTHERS
   With US-IRAQ-1218.
   By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
   c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The threat of retaliation from Iraq may be slight. But
the United States and Britain came under an intense diplomatic
counter-attack Thursday from Russia, bristling over the decision to
strike Iraq without prior United Nations consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the strikes ``grossly
violated'' international law and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
called them ``outrageous.'' Russia said the attacks could scuttle a
plan by Russia's parliament to approve the long-delayed START II
nuclear reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of parliament, the Communist-dominated Duma,
overwhelmingly approved a resolution accusing the United States and
Britain of ``international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   China, France, Iran and others also denounced the attacks on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the harshest condemnation came from Moscow. Since the end of
the 1991 Gulf War, Russia has resolutely opposed efforts to punish
Iraq with military force for its failure to cooperate with United
Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has relished the prominent diplomatic role, projecting an
image of itself to the world as something more than a tattered
superpower beset by domestic economic and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In seclusion in recent weeks recovering from pneumonia and
exhaustion, Yeltsin went on national television to call the strikes
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency, quoting unnamed defense ministry
sources, said units of the Russian air force and navy were put on
alert in response to the attacks on Iraq. But it was unclear for
what purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has the false idea that it is the world's policeman
who has the right to do away with any nation without considering
the position of the U.N.,'' said Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strong reaction placed it into a direct and bitter
dispute with the United States and Britain at a time when Moscow
hopes to solicit Western aid to overcome its deep economic crisis.
The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the air
strikes ``represent a blow to Russian-American relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of angry rhetoric. I hope there would not be
real long-term damage to the U.S.-Russian relationship. But
certainly this has driven a wedge between them,'' said Dmitri
Trenin, an analyst at the Carnegie Institute in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   China said there was ``no excuse or pretext'' to launch the
strikes. China's U.N. envoy Qin Huasun called on the United States
and Britain ``to stop forthwith all military actions against
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin spoke by telephone to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The
Kremlin said the two men ``noted with satisfaction that their
positions coincided'' on the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
   France, which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human
consequences'' of the military strikes, but added with regret that
Iraq could not ``show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation''
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain, France, Russia and China comprise
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The
decision by the U.S. and Britain to launch strikes has left the
body deeply divided and immobilized on a diplomatic course of
action on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The air strikes were launched only after diplomacy was exhausted
and chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had documented
Iraq's failure to hand over documents and allow unrestricted access
to inspection sites, the U.S. and Britain said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia and China called on Butler to be replaced, holding
him responsible for instigating the military action.
</P>
<P>
   China's Qin said Butler played a ``dishonorable role in this
crisis'' and that his reports to the U.N. were ``unfounded and
evasive of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov said Butler misled Russian officials during his recent
visit to Moscow. ``He was in Moscow and said three or four files
would be closed, that the work was going fine, and then, without
consultation, he withdrew his personnel and a strike was
launched.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright compared the
criticism of Butler to an attempt to ``shoot the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are traditional allies of Iraq and eager to
renew trading with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq owes Russia about $7 billion for arms purchases dating back
to the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s, when the Soviet Union was a
major arms supplier. Iraq cannot begin to repay those debts until
it can again export the bulk of its oil, now forbidden under the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russia is increasingly dependent on Western help since its
economic collapse last summer, and analysts suggested that Russian
strong rhetoric would fade as the U.S.-British campaign wraps up.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to withhold approval of the Start II treaty has been
used before as leverage in diplomatic wrangling with America.
Russia's Duma has repeatedly delayed action on the START II treaty,
signed by the United States and Russia in 1993. The pact cut the
Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma also sought to remind the world of President Clinton's
domestic problems, if it needs any reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber agreed to consider a motion calling on Monica
Lewinsky to help halt the military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,''
said the motion by ultra-nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov.

REFLECTING ON THE AGE OF WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Age of Women is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   And as women cross more thresholds in corporations, government
and other playing fields, more books will document their climb.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the recently published ``Powerchicks: How Women
Will Dominate America'' (Longstreet Press, 280 pages, $22) by Matt
Towery.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, I was less than impressed. The title was an
immediate irritant. The book is void of photographs or graphics and
appears to have extra space between the lines to make it appear
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the author is a former Georgia state legislator. How
enlightened could he be, I wondered. Towery is chairman of a
national printing company in Atlanta. Didn't Tom Wolfe just write
about the white male dominance of Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   But the topic intrigued me so much that I put my prejudices
aside and gave the book a try. I'm glad I did.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what prompted Towery to write this book, but he did
a fairly decent job. In the first few paragraphs, he explains his
title as a term that could insult older feminists, but that newer
generations of women seem to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   He then discusses where women are in terms of the news media,
government, business and voting power, and where they are predicted
to go.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he gathers are impressive:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women make more than 80 percent of the consumer spending
decisions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women have climbed from 3 percent of management and
administrative positions in the private sector in 1977 to between
35 percent and 45 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 2000, women will own half of all small businesses in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, women earned 53 percent of all bachelor's degrees and
52 percent of all master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-three percent of law school students and 40 percent of
medical students are women.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, there were 7.2 million more female voters than men.
Fewer than 50 percent of all women surveyed voted for the same
candidates as their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those statistics I had read before; some I had not.
What's interesting is that few have put this picture together in
such a way that the masses have caught on to the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Towery quotes Cynthia Tucker, the first African-American women
named editor of a major national newspaper, as saying that this
growing influence is ``a slow and quiet revolution.''
Interestingly, those are the same words used later in the book by
Elizabeth Dole, who is often mentiones as a possible GOP
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Dole are among many women Towery interviewed or
quotes from other media sources. Writing about the others, whether
they are in the news media, entertainment, politics or business or
are ``stay-at-home professionals,'' Towery finds the most
influential in the group, traces their careers and chronicles their
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is ``the most powerful story of our lifetime,''
Towery concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any politician, corporations, foundation or other enterprise
that hopes to be successful in the coming new century must accept
the reality of this inescapable shift in our society,'' he writes.
``Those who fail to recognize its existence, or refuse to take note
of its unfolding, will become relics of the past, struggling to
function in a new century unlike any before witnessed. A century in
which women will not only be equal to men but, in ever-increasing
aspects, their superior.''

   Shel Holtz tells readers upfront that this book is not about how

Instead, he promises a return on investment for your online
program, as well as tactical tools. Still, using the Internet for
public relations is just in its infancy. Holtz plans to show

   ``Essential Manager's Manual''
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Heller and Tim Hindle
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a how-to book that covers the waterfront, this
is it. The mammoth 864-page tome discusses topics from body posture
to creating self-managed teams. Robert Heller is a management guru
in England and founding editor of Britain's ``Management Today.''
Tim Hindle is a business writer and runs a London-based business
language consulting firm. Although myriad topics are covered in
short, two-page segments, the graphics keep this book more lively
than most on the subject.

   ``Coaching, Counseling and Mentoring: How to Choose &AMP; Use the
Right Techniques to Boost Employee Performance''
</P>
<P>
   By Florence M. Stone
</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Whether encouraging employees (coaching), fixing poor
performance (counseling) or helping top performers excel
(mentoring), managers have their work cut out for them. A business
writer and editor with the American Management Association,
Florence Stone discusses each of these three important aspects of
management. She provides numerous vignettes describing the real
work world and then offers principles and ideas on how a manager
should react to them successfully.

SADDAM: DICTATOR OR DEMOCRAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - We've been duped.
</P>
<P>
   Foryears now, Saddam Hussein has pretended to be a bloodthirsty
dictator with a special hatred for the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   He manufactured and stored weapons of mass destruction as part
of this clever deception. He defied U.N. weapons inspectors and
ignored international treaties. He rearmed his military and
brutally suppressed his own people.
</P>
<P>
   All with the sinister expectation that someday, when called
upon, he'd come to the aid of his good friend and fellow Democrat,
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the military operation against Iraq was officially
announced Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott issued a
statement saying he can't support airstrikes because he finds
``both the timing and the policy subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton's critics are correct, then his dark and
crooked plan to put off an impeachment vote by bombing Iraq could
not have been carried off alone.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's got to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   And others.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United Nations' chief weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, issued what must be a phony report saying his workers were
not permitted to search Iraq's arsenal of chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Butler claimed Iraq was ignoring a promise made only three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements only prove to men like Lott that Butler, who
(begin ital) claims (end ital) to be Australian, (just as Saddam
(begin ital) claims (end ital) to be Iraqi) is actually in cahoots
with his good friend and fellow Democrat, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his speech Wednesday that it was Butler's report
that prompted the United States and Great Britain to take action.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following the Butler report,'' Blair said, ``after more than a
year of obstruction and a catalog of broken promises . . . we have
no option but to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who (begin ital) claims (end ital) to be British, went on
to outline so-called objectives that include diminishing Iraq's
ability to build or use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   All of it an obvious ploy _ in the eyes of some _ to delay an
impeachment vote on Blair's good friend and fellow Democrat, Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to act and act now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed if we didn't act, Iraq would rebuild its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons arsenal within months.
</P>
<P>
   The order to attack, Clinton said, was based on the unanimous
recommendation of his national security team, which includes fellow
conspirators like the vice president, the secretary of defense, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of state and
his national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   These people, in turn, must have directed all the co-conspirator
lackeys within their departments to implement their part of the
dastardly scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Lott saw through it early.
</P>
<P>
   Others took a little more time.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the Speaker-elect of the House of
Representatives, Bob Livingston, said, ``We support our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``As to the matter of timing (of the attack), we
just would leave that to the best judgment of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports indicated there are 24,000 military personnel located in
the Persian Gulf area on the ground and more than 20 ships.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four thousand men and women from the Army, Navy and Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four thousand husbands and wives, sons and daughters,
brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four thousand individuals (begin ital) claiming (end
ital) to be honest and patriotic, (begin ital) claiming (end ital)
to come from all parts of the country and to be of varied political
persuasions.
</P>
<P>
   But who are, if Lott and the others are correct, only performers
in an elaborate hoax to bail out their good friend and fellow
Democrat, Bill Clinton. &QL;

   _ Women have climbed from 3 percent of management and
administrative positions in the private sector in 1977 to between
35 percent and 45 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 2000, women will own half of all small businesses in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, women earned 53 percent of all bachelor's degrees and
52 percent of all master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-three percent of law school students and 40 percent of
medical students are women.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, there were 7.2 million more female voters than men.
Fewer than 50 percent of all women surveyed voted for the same
candidates as their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those statistics I had read before; some I had not.
What's interesting is that few have put this picture together in
such a way that the masses have caught on to the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Towery quotes Cynthia Tucker, the first African-American women
named editor of a major national newspaper, as saying that this
growing influence is ``a slow and quiet revolution.''
Interestingly, those are the same words used later in the book by
Elizabeth Dole, who is often mentiones as a possible GOP
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Dole are among many women Towery interviewed or
quotes from other media sources. Writing about the others, whether
they are in the news media, entertainment, politics or business or
are ``stay-at-home professionals,'' Towery finds the most
influential in the group, traces their careers and chronicles their
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is ``the most powerful story of our lifetime,''
Towery concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any politician, corporations, foundation or other enterprise
that hopes to be successful in the coming new century must accept
the reality of this inescapable shift in our society,'' he writes.
``Those who fail to recognize its existence, or refuse to take note
of its unfolding, will become relics of the past, struggling to
function in a new century unlike any before witnessed. A century in
which women will not only be equal to men but, in ever-increasing
aspects, their superior.''

Instead, he promises a return on investment for your online

<P>
   By Robert Heller and Tim Hindle
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a how-to book that covers the waterfront, this
is it. The mammoth 864-page tome discusses topics from body posture
to creating self-managed teams. Robert Heller is a management guru
in England and founding editor of Britain's ``Management Today.''
Tim Hindle is a business writer and runs a London-based business
language consulting firm. Although myriad topics are covered in
short, two-page segments, the graphics keep this book more lively
than most on the subject.

</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Whether encouraging employees (coaching), fixing poor
performance (counseling) or helping top performers excel
(mentoring), managers have their work cut out for them. A business
writer and editor with the American Management Association,
Florence Stone discusses each of these three important aspects of
management. She provides numerous vignettes describing the real
work world and then offers principles and ideas on how a manager
should react to them successfully.

TIME FOR OLD AGE TEST, SO BRING A PENCIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Last week, I got some good news. Jeff, a 34-year-old
bachelor and my last single friend, announced that he was getting
married.
</P>
<P>
   I hung up the phone and rushed into the living room to tell my
husband. He looked at me in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you . . . crying?'' he asked, pointing at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm very happy for him,'' I explained. ``Kristin is a
wonderful girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristin's not a `girl,' '' my husband emphasized. ``She's a
woman!''
</P>
<P>
   I sucked in my breath. ``Don't be ridiculous!'' I said, blowing
my nose. ``She's a girl. She wears a Size 2!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you think you're a girl, too?'' he asked, cocking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I replied adamantly, and pointed to my chin.
``Acne!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, I hate to point out the obvious,'' he said. ``but you're
crying because you're happy. Last night when I told you I was going
to bed, you said, `I'll be there in a minute. I'm waiting for the
weather report,' and the other day when we took your car to the
store, you had a full tank of gas! You're not a girl. You're
getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. He was cutting with round scissors and
eating paste in an elementary classroom when the Challenger shuttle
exploded. I, on the other hand, heard about the disaster while
cutting with an X-Acto knife and breathing deeply around glue in a
college art class.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to argue, I wanted to deny the whole thing, but I
didn't. I retreated into my office, sat down and thought about it.
OK, so I've seen grandmothers on ``Jerry Springer'' who are my age,
but so is Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Was I past my prime? Were the days of youth behind me? Is there
a little expiration stamp someplace on my body that says ``Best if
used by 10/31/95''? I needed a test, I decided, and I grabbed two
pencils from the desk drawer and stormed into the bathroom. I had
to know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Placing a pencil under each boob, I stood back and waited. And
waited. But the pencils didn't budge, they didn't fall, they didn't
wiggle, even when I shimmied. They were adhered to me as if I had
stuck them there with chewing gum or Polydent.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks in a sock. Past my prime. So past my prime, in fact, that
I could have leaned a little to the left and drafted an entire
letter or signed a check to my doctor for hormone therapy. I leaned
against the bathroom sink and sighed. When did this happen? How
could I have not seen the symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   My mind raced with excuses, but it was all there. In little
flashes, my mind clicked from one scene to the next. In the last
election, I voted for a Republican. A week ago, I watched the
Billboard Music Awards and didn't know who anyone was. Standing in
line behind a kid with a tattoo across his entire arm, my mother's
voice popped into my head and snarled, ``Now there's a wise
investment. The only time it really pays off is when you're lying
on a steel table in a morgue without a driver's license in your
pocket.'' I don't understand the new commercials for Levi's. I
saved $19.34 on groceries a couple of days ago by using coupons and
a Fresh Value card. When my mother asked me what I wanted for
Christmas, I replied that I wanted some moles removed. I just
finished reading something that had an ``Oprah's Book Club''
sticker on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   But those red flags of maturity can be explained, I told myself.
You can attribute all of it to stress or improper prescription drug
use in combination with alcohol. To a possible chemical imbalance.
Maybe I have a brain tumor. Radiation and psychoanalysis can fix
all of that. There's hope, I struggled. Maybe my boobs are just
taking a nap.
</P>
<P>
   I always knew this day would come, but so soon? Did it happen
one day when I realized that I was sitting at a KFC drive-through
window, dressed in a sweat shirt and slippers, waiting for my order
of popcorn chicken to come up? Or was it the moment a child cut
across my yard and I yelled out from behind the screen door, ``Hey
you! I just planted winter rye!''
</P>
<P>
   And if so, if I am maturing, what's next for me? Do I wake up
one day and find my uterus nestled at my feet, next to my cat? When
do I start sneezing and peeing at the same time? When do I get
teeth that I can keep in a glass of water or pull out at parties?
</P>
<P>
   It can't be true, I thought. I am completely immature. I'm in a
bathroom jumping around with yellow sticks in the folds of my
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But after I put my shirt back on and went outside to check the
mail, it was all in front of me in black and white, and there was
no denying it. Waiting passively for me in the mailbox was a
letter. A simple little letter telling me that I had already been
approved for an unsecured Visa credit card.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was an act of God when I got my long-distance phone
service reconnected. But an unsecured Visa? Could it be true? Have
I really been paying my bills on time? It's worse than I thought.
Just how old have I become?
</P>
<P>
   I ran inside to tell my husband, who was walking toward me with
arms outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I called you old,'' he said, putting his arms around
me. ``I just get so frightened when I see you show any kind of
emotion besides anger and hate. It's so unlike you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' I said, hugging him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the full tank of gas,'' he added, ``I thought,
`What has this creature done with my wife?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't me,'' I replied, hugging him harder. ``Nana filled
up the tank after we ran out of gas and had to walk a half-mile so
she could get her perm. Oh honey, you must have been so scared!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ow!'' my husband yelled suddenly, and pulled away. ``Something
sharp just stabbed me! Is that a pencil growing out of your body?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a little thing called `payback,' '' I said,
laughing. ``Now quit crying. A little lead never hurt anybody!'' &QL;

``OUTSIDE OZONA'': ASSORTED ITINERANTS ON A DESOLATE SOUTHWESTERN
ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest mystery about ``Outside Ozona'' isn't the identity
of the serial killer who cuts out the hearts of his female victims.
(The murderer, who is obvious from the moment he appears, is shown
doing his dirty work roughly halfway through the film.)
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is why reputable actors agreed to appear in a movie
whose plodding screenplay, by J.S. Cardone, who also directed, has
the feel of an earnest, immature play-wrighting exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in this implausible, awkwardly acted melodrama
are Texans and Oklahomans whose tidy little speeches are devoid of
vernacular tang or credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The story methodically cuts from an Oklahoma radio station where
a rebellious all-night disk jockey (Taj Mahal) plays the blues
instead of country music, to the chagrin of the station manager
(Meat Loaf) and assorted itinerants on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Tuning in to the all-night broadcast while driving through the
desolate Southwest are three sets of couples and a weather-beaten
trucker. While listening to these cardboard characters bicker, it's
all too easy to picture them as entries in a screenwriter's
notebook, with each one's background details and personality traits
duly ticked off as the movie slogs along.
</P>
<P>
   The couples include a grumpy unemployed clown (Kevin Pollak) and
his white-trash girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller); two feuding
sisters, one a yuppie nightmare, the other an easygoing
salt-of-the-earth type, and a young Navajo woman and her dying
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Forster is a rugged trucker with a heart of gold who
rescues a stray dog at a filling station, and Swoosie Kurtz plays a
hard-bitten truck-stop waitress who pines for him. David Paymer is
a soft-spoken Chicago psychiatrist who is unaccountably on the road
in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the story culminates in a fiery highway collision,
these lifeless creations have worn out their welcome by talking our
ears off without saying anything of significance.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSIDE OZONA
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by J.S. Cardone; director of photography,
Irek Hartowicz; edited by Amanda Kirpaul; music by Taj Mahal and
Johnny Lee Schell; production designer, Martina Buckley; produced
by Carol Kottenbrook and Scott Einbinder; released by Tri-Star
Pictures. Running time: 98 minutes. This film is rated R.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Robert Forster (Odell Parks), Kevin Pollak (Wit Roy),
Sherilyn Fenn (Marcy Duggan), David Paymer (Alan Defaux), Penelope
Ann Miller (Earlene Demers), Swoosie Kurtz (Rosalee), Taj Mahal
(Dix Mayal) and Meat Loaf (Floyd Bibbs).
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Ozona'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has violence, nudity, profanity and
considerable gore.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   HANNUKAH-RELIGION-COX (Undated) _ It's a minor holiday in the
overall scheme of things, but this Jewish festival that celebrates
freedom has become a major happening because it falls around
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   HANUKKAH-HNS (San Francisco) _ On the scale of importance,
Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday that ranks with Purim _ far below
Passover, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. But don't tell David Eiland,
co-owner of Just For Fun, a gift shop. By Venise Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   STAPLES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ A childlike faith should permeate
the whole Christmas season, not because of Santa, but because of
Christ's birth and what that means. You see, I love the blessing
and mystery that are Christmas. I like that it represents the
fulfillment of prophecy, the birth of the Messiah. And what could
be more mysterious than a virgin giving birth? What could be a more
perfect gift to us all? What, indeed, requires more faith? By
Gracie Bonds Staples.
</P>
<P>
   LADY OF GUADALUPE-TEX (Fort Worth) _ Our Lady of Guadalupe's
image as a prayerful Madonna framed by golden rays adorns the
interiors of large and small churches around the world. The famous
icon also dangles from rearview mirrors and is emblazoned on
T-shirts of gang members. It also has a special place in Arturo
Loredo's restaurant on Fort Worth's north side. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ ``God Can Heal Your
Wounded Heart'' is the holiday message outside a church in
Arlington, Texas. Why display such a sad message in the holiday
season? Curiously, it's a message that is entirely appropriate.
People often feel the greatest emotional pain during the holiday
season, say spiritual leaders and psychiatrists. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   CARDINAL-ANNIVERSARY-BOS (Boston) _ In his 14 years as cardinal
here, Bernard Law has changed noticeably from an aggressively
public figure to a gentler power broker. By Diego Ribadeneira. 1500
words.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-HANUKKAH-BOS (Undated) _ Many Jews worry that Hanukkah
is falling victim to rampant commercialization. Others say it's not
a bad thing if it helps to pass Jewish practices to children. By
Diego Ribadeneira. 1200 words.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ His Jesuit superiors encouraged
the talented young dancer and, as a result, the Rev. Robert
VerEecke has woven his passion into his ministry. By Diego
Ribadeneira.
</P>
<P>
   DIVORCE-RABBIS-NYT (New York) _ While Orthodox Jews who want a
divorce in civil law still have to observe the same procedures as
any other Americans, obtaining a Jewish get, or divorce, is
necessary to remarry within Orthodoxy. Women have long complained
that Jewish courts, which act like binding arbitration panels, have
favored men, particularly on matrimonial issues. In many instances,
men have refused to grant their wives a get, leaving the women
unable to remarry. Men, conversely, face no such consequences. And
men sometimes obtain a get without their wives' consent or
knowledge. By Nadine Brozan.
</P>
<P>
   MENORAH-HOLIDAYS-LADN (Los Angeles) _ It may be most familiar as
a simple nine-branch candelabra, but collectors _ who today pay
anywhere from a few dollars to several thousand _ long have been
enjoying the menorah as art. By Carol Bidwell.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ People often feel the
greatest emotional pain during the holiday season, say spiritual
leaders and psychiatrists. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (New York) _ Ever since a 1990 study showed
that the intermarriage rate among Jews had recently gone over 50
percent, American Jews have been immersed in discussions of
``Jewish continuity.'' That study has provoked a ``profound
reorientation'' for Jewish organizations, John Ruskay, chief
operating officer of the UJA-Federation of New York. They have
shifted from an ``external agenda'' of combating anti-Semitism and
mobilizing support for Israel to an ``internal agenda'' of
confronting ``the full challenge of emancipation.'' By Peter
Steinfels.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You can tell a lot about country music listeners by
seeing how they react when certain names are evoked.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Reba, for example, and rising singer Jo Dee Messina
gives the expected response: ``She's just great,'' Messina gushes,
speaking in her rapid, no-twang style. ``I love her so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the subject of Sylvia comes up, a one-name goddess from the
``Breakfast Club'' decade who sported feathered hair and sang
feathery songs. ``Oh, my God!'' Messina yells, before she starts
singing: `` `Well, your nobody called today, and she hung when I
asked her name' _ I still know every word!''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, Messina is a child of the '80s. She's vague
about her age (``I'm in my mid-20s'' is all the Massachusetts
native will say), but she still gushes with the enthusiasm of a
star-struck teen when she looks back at her formative years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, remember Deborah Allen?'' she says in a rush of
words. ``I remember lying in bed, screaming that song:
``''`BAY_BEE! BAY-BEE! BAY-BEE! BAY-BEE, I LIED!' Man, Deborah
Allen actually wound up singing background on my record, it was
very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a one-time major player such as Allen would be
singing for a relative newcomer like Messina shows how quickly
things change in Nashville. Messina already knows that. After her
1996 debut album was released, she went through some nasty
management problems that left her on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a witch when it comes to my savings account,'' she says.
``Now I don't get limos. I don't do private planes. I think those
things make you not approachable. I love for people to come up to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be part of her appeal. She's a bit of a musical
everywoman, with life-affirming songs such as ``Bye Bye'' and ``I'm
Alright'' (the title track of her second disc) giving her an
identity as a fiery, strong-willed survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, some of the fans cry when they meet me,'' she says.
``It's happened a few times this month. It makes me uncomfortable.
I don't know how to respond. I mean, hot peppers burn my mouth,
too! I'm afraid to walk down a dark alley alone at night. I'm the
same makeup as everyone else, so I don't know how to handle that
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina, who works with superstar Tim McGraw and producer Byron
Gallimore (both handled production duties on her two discs), has a
bright, brash eagerness and full-throttle energy that may recall an
earlier country singer.
</P>
<P>
   She recorded Dottie West's mid-'80s hit ``Lesson in Leavin'''
for ``I'mAlright.'' While the late West tends to get overlooked by
historians, the fiery singer has her disciples, Messina included.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the first crossover stars,'' Messina says. ``She
sold a bazillion records before she died. I always tell in my show
how she is a person who shouldn't be forgotten.'' &QL;

LAWYERS DEBATE HOW BEST TO DEFEND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The chance to defend the president against
charges of impeachment in a Senate trial would be the ultimate
dream case to some defense lawyers, but others said their skills
would be useless in what will amount to a political event, not a
legal one.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment by the House of Representatives all but
certain, with a trial in the Senate to follow, President Clinton
will need a good criminal defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a tricky situation. The president's lawyers will have
to balance the chance of future criminal prosecution if he admits
he lied and tried to cover up his affair with a White House intern,
against the need to head off what could turn out to be a sordid
parade of witnesses and excruciating details about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brown, the San Francisco public defender, said he would
advise getting a grant of immunity from future prosecution and then
offering a full-blown mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is likely to avoid being removed from office by
the Senate, Brown said the president could find his margin of
support dissolve if senators believed he was contorting legal
definitions to claim innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brown advised, ``Get up there and say, `Look, I was in
a situation that was untenable and I misrepresented what happened.
I did play around with the definitions, but it's not enough to boot
me out of office.'''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson, the only other president to face an impeachment
trial, snubbed the Senate and was tried in absentia 120 years ago.
But Brown said Clinton could not do that because it would force
Congress to call a parade of witnesses to recount the sordid
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets a factual trial, he's going to be damaged even
more,'' Brown said. ``Then the Senate has to listen to direct
testimony from Monica Lewinsky about some unsavory sexual acts.
`What did he do next, Miss Lewinsky?' `Now, where did he put the
cigar, Miss Lewinsky?' Who wants to listen to that?''
</P>
<P>
   But actually getting the president to follow a defense lawyer's
advice may not be that easy, said Jim Collins, a criminal trial
attorney in San Francisco. Collins said whoever represents the
president isn't going to have a lot of control over strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not just a lawyer _ you're dealing with the White
House, politics, Clinton's place in history and Clinton and his
wife who are used to controlling things,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he did not know enough of the nitty gritty to give
specific advice, but once the matter hit the Senate, his strategy
would rely more on politics than the law anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be telling him, `Look, you don't need me for the
Senate. All you need is for your political people to get to those
20 or 30''' senators who can be counted on to vote against removing
the president, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   When the House convenes, it will debate impeachment charges that
Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power in connection with the cover-up of his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a 228-207 majority in the House where a
majority vote in favor of one or more articles of impeachment would
trigger a Senate trial. If convicted by a two-thirds majority in
the Senate, Clinton would automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Choper, who teaches constitutional law at the University
of California at Berkeley, said the chief concern for the
president's lawyers should be to keep Clinton from saying anything
that could later be used to prosecute him in a criminal court _
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer in terms of winning,'' Choper said.
``This is a question of not getting him into more trouble. ... If
he testifies, he better not say anything that's contrary to what he
said before, and he should just put the best light on what his
answers have been.''

MUSIC ANGEL AMY GRANT BRINGS JOY TO CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It was completely unplanned on her part. But the way
things are going, Amy Grant may just become the Perry Como of her
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Something about her warmly reassuring voice and comfortable way
around a Christmas tune have permanently linked her with the
holiday. And once she donned a wintry white gown and sat down for a
photographer, a new Christmas ambassador was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a natural affinity and love for all things
Christmas,'' Grant says, calling from her Nashville farm.
``Traditions evolve and so do associations. I was 22 when I
recorded my first Christmas album. My gosh, I'll be 38 next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two seasonal collections _ 1983's ``A Christmas Album'' and
1992's ``Home for Christmas'' _ have firmly entrenched themselves
in households, the same way Bing Crosby and Johnny Mathis a lbums
did before hers.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a holiday concert came about naturally for the
Christian popster, whose long string of hits includes such bubbly
fare as ``Baby Baby'' and ``The Lucky One.'' In 1993, she was
approached by the Nashville Symphony to perform at a Christmas
benefit show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `very' low-key,'' Grant recalls. ``A friend volunteered
to put together a backdrop. We invited some local guests. Then we
did two shows at the Grand Ole Opry house, and they both sold
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent years saw more Nashville holiday shows, with each
growing a little more extravagant. Last year, she took the
production on the road for the first time, and audiences simply
didn't stay away. The show sold out more often than not, even if
Grant's recording career was in a mild slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works on a lot of different levels,'' Grant says. ``First
off, you don't have to be a fan of mine to enjoy the show. There
are several moments highlighting different symphony players. It's
ball gowns and extravagant lights and quite exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Grant hit the road, touring in support of her
acclaimed ``Behind the Eyes'' disc. That show was stripped down and
low-key, a long way from the big-scale festivities planned for
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two tours just appeal to such different sensory
experiences,'' Grant says. ``With `Behind the Eyes,' I was really
front and center. It was like, `Come crawl through my head while I
sing for you.' This is simply a lavish celebration of the holiday
season. I love it _ it's a thrill to do this every night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a cheap thrill, that's for sure. She has lined up heavy
hitters Michael W. Smith and CeCe Winans (Grammy winners both) to
share the stage with her, as well as the Nashville Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 of us on the road,'' she says, pausing to count
the numbers. ``It's 14 trucks and 14 buses to move us around. There
are 28 drivers. It's just huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with sponsorship from Chevrolet and Target, it's a costly
proposition. The big question: Why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it and I can,'' she says. ``And I don't mean that in a
flippant way. It takes an incredible amount of manpower to put on a
Christmas tour. Because of my Christmas records, I eventually found
myself in the prime position of having the opportunity to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are emotional paybacks in addition to
monetary ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like everybody that walks in the door has a sense of
being part of something so magical and so much bigger than any one
of us could generate on our own,'' she says. ``I simply love an
evening like that.'' &QL;

   RAMADAN MEANS FASTING, PRAYER FOR MUSLIMS
   400 words
   By NICHOLE MONROE
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the new moon appears _ most likely on Sunday _
about 120 million Muslims worldwide will observe the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   The most holy time of the year for Muslims, the monthlong
Ramadan requires fasting, prayer and goodwill to the poor. The
purpose is to develop discipline, restraint and a closer
relationship with Allah, or God.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British forces launched massive air strikes on Iraqi
military and communications sites late Wednesday, and the strikes
continued during the night Thursday. Though President Clinton said
when the strikes began Wednesday that his administration decided
not to initiate attacks on Iraq during the Islamic holy month, he
has still met criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite compassionate of him that he is considerate to the
feelings of Muslims, but it is very unfortunate that he would take
lightly killing people while respecting the holy days,'' said
Shaker Elsayed, secretary general of the Muslim American Society, a
nonprofit, charitable organization based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the month of Ramadan, Muslims forgo all food and drink
from dawn to sunset, according to literature from the American
Muslim Council, a political activist organization based in
Washington. Sexual relations during daylight hours is prohibited,
and honorable behavior is expected. Muslims also are obligated to
give a financial donation to the poor, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended daily routine of Muslims during Ramadan includes a
modest meal before dawn, morning prayers, possibly a brief nap in
the late afternoon, sunset prayers and a complete meal.
</P>
<P>
   After the meal, families often go to their places of worship for
evening prayers before returning home at about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. national security officials said Thursday that no
``artificial deadline'' would be set for the attacks on Iraq, but
some critics are saying it would be foolish to continue bombing
through Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, director of the American Muslim Council, said if
the attacks continue through Ramadan, Clinton will continue to
receive disapproval from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   Elsayed agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be outrageous that while Muslims are fasting and
preparing for the holy month, bombs would be falling over their
heads,'' Elsayed said. ``If you can imagine someone bombing the
United States during Thanksgiving dinner, it would be similar.''

</P>
<P>
   Some radiational force or other in the rings around a faraway
planet gives the Ba'ku tribe, who live there in bucolic reverie,
eternal life and youth. But in their midst, observing from a
concealed command center, the ancient Son'a wait their moment to
gather up these celestial New Agers, ship them off to another
location and soak up those regenerative powers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Winging in to look over the place, Capt. Jean-Luc Picard
(Stewart) and the crew of the starship Enterprise meet the Ba'ku
and their amazingly well-preserved 309-year-old matriarch (Ms.
Murphy), who explains in no uncertain terms that outside ways
aren't welcome.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Picard, who takes a romantic shine to the woman
and upholds the Federation's standing rule not to interfere with
others. But such sentiments mean little to the San'o commander
(Abraham), who needs a face lift about every hour to keep from
disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out that a rogue Federation admiral (Zerbe) is
allied with the San'o to harvest the youth substance for ``the
universal good.'' Picard and crew revolt and a sprawling space
battle, full of the old techno razzle-dazzle, is begun.

<P>
   In Denver, a struggling rock musician named Jack Frost (Keaton)
jumps in a very big old Cadillac for the drive to Aspen where he
and his band are to play a command gig at a recording executive's
party. Back at his cute snow-covered house, his perky wife, Gabby
(Ms. Preston), and plucky 12-year-old son, Charlie (Cross), put up
with another of Jack's absences.
</P>
<P>
   It's Christmas Eve, after all. Jack has barely gotten back from
his last road trip. The kitchen sink needs fixing. Charlie, a
hockey player, needs help with his wrist shot. Jack, who means well
but is overextended, forgets to attend one of Charlie's games.
</P>
<P>
   On the road to Aspen, Jack starts thinking. To heck with the
gig, he's going home to be with the family. On the drive back, the
car leaves the road and Jack is killed.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Christmas one year later. Still bereft, Charlie makes a
snowman and puts his father's hat on it. That night it gets all
windy and sparkly, the way it does in movies of this kind. The
snowman comes alive. It's Jack, back from the beyond. Charlie is
flabbergasted, but the two bond and finally get to do some
dad-and-son things.
</P>
<P>
   But a warm front is approaching. Besides, as in life, Jack has
to go. Amid more wind and sparkle he reappears as Jack to Charlie
and Gabby, then departs secure in the knowledge that they know how
he felt about them and can carry on.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Nothing is more violent than a car crash, but here
there is no crash at all. Jack looks startled and there is a little
flash of light. Otherwise, only a couple of respectable snowball
fights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Jack growls appreciatively at the little wisp of nothing
Gabby dons one night. What transpires isn't depicted. Gabby also
remarks that she is being hit on at her job, but the fellow is 63,

bothered by that element. But parental death is always sensitive no
matter how cutely packaged, so that is a consideration. On balance,
though, they should be entertained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 Ditto. &QL;
</P>
<P>

worthwhile things to say. Some older children may wish it had been

   In 1593, people behind on their debts got their boots burned
(with their feet in them). With cash-flow problems at the Rose
Theater, the heat is on for a marketable piece of work from a
rakish and normally confident young man about the local drama scene
named Will Shakespeare (Fiennes).
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, about the best Will can offer at the moment is
something he calls ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.''
Frankly, it's not his best work. Will's gifts, in fact, have dried
up and with them his sexual appetite. Life, he tells his therapist,
is like ``picking a lock with a wet herring.''
</P>
<P>
   A rival up-and-comer named Christopher Marlowe (Everett)
half-mockingly offers some pretty good suggestions for turning
around ``Romeo,'' but it isn't until Will sights the gorgeous,
high-born Viola de Lesseps (Ms. Paltrow) that he jump starts
himself both creatively and sexually. Viola has dramatic
aspirations herself, but since it is illegal for women to appear
onstage, she dresses herself as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   A wildly passionate relationship ignites. In bed the two couple
steamily. At the writing stand, Will strips feathers from his quill
and scribbles madly, with the still-wet pages of the forming
masterpiece rushed on stage to be rehearsed by his Juliet (Viola
with a penciled mustache).
</P>
<P>
   For her, theirs is a ``love that overthrows life.''
Unfortunately, she has been promised to Lord Wessex (Firth), a
union approved by Queen Elizabeth herself (Ms. Dench). And Will, it
evolves, has a wife up in Stratford-on-Avon. It's a mess, but the
play's the thing.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE There is some knock-about, but it's natural,
lighthearted and appropriate for the time and setting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX The humor is often bawdy. The sex is ardent but tasteful;
the lovers are naked but not shown fully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP The young loved both the 1968 ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' with Olivia Hussey, and the 1995 ``William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet,''' with Leonardo DiCaprio. This version may well
be vetoed because of the sex, but many teen-agers will find it full
of fun and a witty treat.

REDONE ACURA TL RATES TLC  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Welcome back, Acura. All is forgiven. Well, maybe not
all. Some of the boneheaded mistakes that have blurred Acura's
image are still just a little hard to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: taking the aggressive, sparkling Legend that first
came out in the late '80s and turning it into a dull-witted luxury
barge. Or ditching great names like Legend and Vigor in favor of
the nonsense letters RL and TL.
</P>
<P>
   Or taking a midstream, outsourced sport-utility vehicle like the
Isuzu Trooper and selling it as an upscale Acura NSX. Or letting
the sharp little Integra languish like an unloved runt of the
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Acura still manages to build excellent cars, noted
for comfort and reliability, just like its proletarian stablemate,
Honda. That's what keeps 'em coming to the showrooms and ensures
Acura's continued success.
</P>
<P>
   And for '99, there's the TL 3.2. This completely new version of
Acura's middle-size sedan brings back much of Acura's old spark,
with the kind of engine performance and responsiveness that we
should expect from an automaker that calls itself ``a premier
luxury/performance nameplate.''
</P>
<P>
   The big news for TL is that along with added power, refinement
and a new body and interior, there's an even bigger plus: a price
break. Not just a modest dip but a significant one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a TL would set you back $30,700 in full luxury trim,
and $33,000 for a TL with a video-enhanced Global Positioning
System for navigation. For '99, the decked-out TL costs $27,950
(not including dealer prep and other add-ons) and $2,000 more for
the GPS, the only option.
</P>
<P>
   That's good value, considering the high level of features that
come standard. And it undercuts the competition by a fair chunk.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a shortened Honda Accord chassis, the TL's body is
somewhat generic, looking very Honda-like and barely
distinguishable from the run of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is very nice, trimmed in leather, loaded with power
and comfort features and quite spacious, despite the compact
exterior dimensions. A real clinker is the wood-grain plastic trim.
C'mon, guys, this is the '90s. Toss that junk.
</P>
<P>
   The low dashboard is set far forward, in Honda's typical style,
adding to the feeling of roominess, while the back seats have
decent headroom and legroom.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a bit soft sprung to be considered a sports sedan, but
it is a finely executed car that benefits greatly from Honda's
wonderful VTEC V-6 engine. The VTEC engine, named for Honda's
innovative valve system that adjusts according to engine speed, is
standard on all TLs.
</P>
<P>
   Engine power is smooth and seamless, with a discreet little
growl under acceleration that lets you know it's serious. The V-6
takes the sedan from standstill to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds.
It also turns in decent gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission is automatic, with the SportShift feature that
allows drivers to shift for themselves, which is OK, but still a
poor substitute for real stick shift. Honda and Acura continue to
offer manual transmissions only in their four-cylinder cars.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS is the only option on the TL, which otherwise arrives
slathered with a hedonistic array of power and convenience options,
and a superfine stereo. The closest competitor is the Lexus ES300,
with the TL well-priced in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS, which uses a video screen on the dashboard to map your
route and lets you watch yourself skitter across the map, works
with compact discs assigned to specific areas of the country, and
controlled by a satellite system. A pleasant female voice helps
guide the way, sounding alarmed if you miss a turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to use, though driving around familiar Phoenix terrain,
I almost always could think of a better route than the one picked
by the computer. We actually used it to find a place on the other
side of the Valley that we otherwise might have struggled to
locate. It worked great.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, though. The video screen is fun to watch, and,
therefore, very distracting to the driver. Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   I also question the basic value of these things, especially when
it boosts the price tag by two grand and requires a specific
compact disc for each area of the country. Besides, I know how to
refold a map.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the navigation system, the TL has the style and
driveability to become a pack leader in the midrange luxury cadre.
</P>
<P>
   Well-designed, well-engineered and well-finished, the TL escapes
one of the big raps against Honda and Acura, that their cars are
good but generic. The redone sedan is enjoyable to drive and
displays enough character to avoid being boring.
</P>
<P>
   And it marks a welcomed return to interesting cars for Acura.
OK, I didn't mention the high-performance, high-priced NSX sports
car, but that's a whole different trip, and well beyond the
reasonable expectations of most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I'm expecting the arrival of a revamped RL, which has been
given a personality implant, an Acura spokesman told me. Hopefully,
it will be as well-realized as its smaller sibling, TL. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL GERST 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It's Christmas morning, and it's a Norman Rockwell
tableau: hundreds of twinkling lights dancing, the pungent pine
scent of the tree filling the air, children eagerly eyeing gaily
wrapped packages.
</P>
<P>
   From the kitchen, the warm, comforting aroma of roasting turkey
whets the appetites of all, while from everywhere else comes the
discordant clanging of quarters spilling into a hundred coin trays.
And suddenly, a raucous alarm bell heralds one more Christmas wish
come true: Three red, white and blue 7s finally line up, and
someone is going home with pockets full and spirits lifted.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? Absolutely nothing. It's
Christmas in Las Vegas, and nothing could be better.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the holidays, there are two types of people:
those who love the celebration and those who hate it. Vegas is the
perfect destination for both.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're a holiday-hater. The very idea of sitting around
drinking eggnog with relatives you barely know and care for even
less makes you shudder. Maybe you have no children to share in the
celebration. Maybe for you Christmas is just another dreary winter
day when everybody but you seems to be having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas is the antidote. Vegas is nonstop fun, and Christmas _ or
any other holiday _ only intrudes if you really want it to. Go
ahead and ignore the minimal tributes to the season, the extra
strands of lights and random boughs of holly sparingly placed
throughout the glittering pleasure domes. For most of Las Vegas,
Christmas is just another workday. Of course, that work consists
primarily of helping you to have a good time, feeding you,
entertaining you and offering you a world of strange delights to
sample.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy to see how Vegas could suit the holiday-hater.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're a person who loves the holidays, who sees it
as a time when families gather to embrace the magic of the season?
That holiday spirit doesn't reside just at Grandma's house or in
Cousin Bill's new rec room. It lives within the hearts of those who
cherish it, and if the people who count are gathered around a
festive table at a magnificent restaurant in Las Vegas, Christmas
will be there.
</P>
<P>
   On the Strip and downtown, the hotels and casinos pay a cursory
tribute to the season. Look closely at the glitter and lights, and
you begin to pick out the Christmas decorations. Random poinsettias
among the tropical foliage at the Mirage. An out-of-place-looking
Christmas tree dwarfed by the Statue of Liberty replica at New York
New York. A giant wreath hanging incongruously between the
bas-reliefs of pagan Egyptian gods at the Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, drive a few miles off the Strip into the residential
neighborhoods, and you'll swear you were in any other medium-sized
city in America. The homes are aglow with traditional seasonal
decorations, complete with reindeer on the roofs and manger scenes
in the yards. Lighting contests are being judged, kids are visiting
department-store Santas, and adults are frenziedly trying to find
that last-minute gift.
</P>
<P>
   If you still have doubts about Las Vegas as a Christmas
destination, here are a few other reasons to have a very Vegas
Christmas:
</P>
<P>
   It's cheap. December is a relatively slow month for the Las
Vegas tourism industry. Hotel occupancy hovers around 80 percent _
compared with the annual average of 90 percent _ and that means you
can probably find an excellent deal on a room. The holiday season
also sees a slowdown in convention activity. You can benefit from
their absence.
</P>
<P>
   The food is outstanding. Las Vegas has long been known as the
home of the inexpensive, all-you-can-eat buffet. But don't stop
there. Many of the finest restaurants in town plan special dinners
for Christmas. For instance, last year at Gatsby's in the MGM
Grand, you could have feasted on caviar, foie gras,
roasted-chestnut soup, Louisiana ostrich, potato-wrapped lamb
chops, garlic mashed potatoes and a pear tart with cranberry ice
cream for $75, wine extra.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brown Derby, the fare was more traditional: roast turkey,
smoked ham, prime rib and lamb chops with all the trimmings for
only $32.50. Or you could have had dinner Southwest-style at Mark
Miller's Coyote Grill, where, for $39.50, you could take your pick
of lobster-and-sweet potato bisque, cornmeal-crusted prawns or a
Navajo elk tostada, then select an entree of potato-crusted salmon,
seared duck breast or a Black Angus fillet.

   AOL voice plays Cupid in big-screen Net romance
   By Jill Vejnoska
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got Elwood.
</P>
<P>
   Right there, on the other end of the phone line: the voice that
launched thousands of chat room forays and uttered the unnaturally
upbeat phrase that comforts the lonely and annoys the already
overworked.
</P>
<P>
   The voice you hear whenever you log onto America Online. The one
so omnipresent, so chirpily there, it has to be computer-generated.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I'm not real,'' Elwood Edwards, 49,
confirmed by phone from his Ohio home last week.
</P>
<P>
   Please. As if anyone could make this up. Nine years ago, Edwards
spoke three little words into a tape recorder at the small company
where his wife then worked. Now that same phrase is the title of a
big budget holiday movie, and Edwards, who has a speaking part (and
nothing else) in the film, got to schmooze with stars Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan at last Thursday's glittering New York City premiere.
</P>
<P>
   In ``You've Got Mail,'' opening Friday in Atlanta, Hanks and
Ryan play business competitors who unwittingly fall in love online.
Logging onto their AOL software-loaded laptops at various times,
each is thrilled to hear Edwards' recorded voice trill, ``You've
got mail!,'' signaling another enchanting e-mail received from an
admirer they know only by a screen name.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? After all, true love doesn't come around too often.
Not so Edwards' voice, which AOL estimates is heard 27 million
times a day by its 14 million subscribers. That's about 13,950,000
more subscribers than the nascent AOL had in 1989, when employee
Karen Edwards suggested that her husband's friendly voice greet
users logging on.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the broadcasting industry who got his first radio
job while still in high school in New Bern, N.C., Edwards needed
only a few takes to record four phrases that remain as much a part
of AOL today as modems and secret passwords. (He's also heard
saying ``Welcome'' and ``Goodbye'' in the movie; only ``File's
done'' didn't make the cut.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's the irresistibly imitable ``You've got mail!'' that has
become embedded in our collective '90s subconscious, so much so
that when writer/director Nora Ephron wanted to update the 1940
film ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' she turned to AOL and its
ripe-with-symbolic-possibilities catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The giant online company won't disclose the terms of its
agreement with the filmmakers, who prominently display AOL's logo
on Hanks' and Ryan's laptops; nor will it say how it compensates
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Even the voice himself is somewhat mute on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go so far as to say I have a great relationship with
AOL,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   What he does like to talk about is how he and Karen met, online,
back in 1987. Given the story line of ``You've Got Mail,'' it all
sounds a bit too perfect, too manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Too much like that voice pouring out of cyberspace 27 million
times a day?
</P>
<P>
   But the couple really did ``meet'' in 1987 in a Christian chat
room on AOL precursor Q-Link, exchanging messages for about three
months before meeting and finally marrying in 1988. And anyway,
Edwards says, his ``You've got mail!'' message definitely isn't
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me it's grammatically incorrect, but I
think perhaps that has added some of the charm and humanity to
it,'' said Edwards, who recently left his job as general manager of
a Houston TV station to open his own voice-over business. ``I think
sometimes people are a little wary of perfection.''

   EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER20
   Vic Chesnutt's big break
   By Steve Dollar
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a few months ago, Vic Chesnutt was pondering an uncertain
future. Capitol Records, which had signed the celebrated
Athens(Ga.) singer-songwriter to his first major-label deal in
1996, dropped him just as the company would have been preparing to
release his sixth album, ``The Salesman and Bernadette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just didn't understand at all what was going on
with me, and rightly so,'' says Chesnutt, 34, who was released from
his contract as the label underwent major management shifts. A
performer who genuinely lives or dies on the unpredictable tangents
of his personality, a guy whose mood ring hums like a neon sign,
Chesnutt occupies a curious niche: He's the rare artist who doesn't
fit any. ``They pretty much gave the record to me and said, `Go
find somebody who cares.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Capricorn Records did. The Atlanta-based
semi-major label, whose '90s roster includes alt-rock hit machines
Cake and 311, released ``Salesman'' last month. ``Ahhh,'' Chesnutt
offers, talking from his home in a quiet neighborhood on the
fringes of Athens. ``No more Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the loosely conceptual song cycle about a traveling
salesman and his long-lost love has generated the best reviews of
Chesnutt's decade-long recording career.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a trembling quiver that's loose, self-possessed and amply
self-mocking, plus music that dips and flows just as thoroughly,
Chesnutt's oeuvre is passive/
</P>
<P>
   aggressive indolent: The same song can put you to sleep, then
beat you up,'' wrote critic Eric Weisbard in an eight-out-of-10
review in Spin magazine. Upcoming appearances on Conan O'Brien and
the PBS concert series ``Sessions at West 57th'' promise to put the
singer more prominently in the public eye than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for him, the notoriously diffident Chesnutt has a lot of
backup: the sprawling Nashville ensemble Lambchop, a kind of
lopsided C&AMP;W big band whose numbers can swell to more than a dozen
at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Both acts perform, separately and together, at Variety Playhouse
tonight. ``I'm always on the verge of belting it out with
Lambchop,'' says Chesnutt, who expects to perform ``Bernadette''
straight through, much as it was recorded, complete with funeral
dirges, memory plays, alcoholic reveries, jaunty Ellingtonian
shuffles and inspired lines such as ``Last night I nearly killed
myself chasing rum with rum; There were crows flying all around my
head and I sure caught and ate me some.''
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, the band lends Chesnutt's twisted literary
ramblings a musical range they've never enjoyed before: ``Those 12
people blasting at one time really gives me power. It made me want
to rise to the occasion, which I occasionally did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambchop co-founder and songwriter Kurt Wagner has been a
Chesnutt fan for years, and had long relished the opportunity to
make a record with him, since first seeing him perform in a
Nashville bar in the late 1980s. It was an evening so seemingly
dismal as to be transcendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was amazingly drunk and amazingly articulate at the same
time,'' Wagner recalls. ``It was pretty much a life-changing sort
of thing. There was nobody there to see it but me and a couple of
cops and some friend of mine's wife. The cops were on their rounds.
I don't know if they knew what they were seeing. There was no peace
to be kept. I guess they were waiting for him to fall off the
stage. He had made a sign that said, `I suck: Tapes $5,' out of a
piece of cardboard slapped to the stage. At the end, I went and
bought as many (cassettes) as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how far Chesnutt has come that, these days,
Emmylou Harris wants to sing with him. The vocalist makes a cameo
appearance as ``the recollected voice of Bernadette'' on the
album's ``Woodrow Wilson'' track. It turns out that members of
Harris' band, Spyboy, are Chesnutt fans, and a mutual friend,
singer-songwriter Joe Henry, acted as a go-between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried that she wouldn't like the song,'' Chesnutt
says. ``The lyrics are odd. It doesn't have a big chorus or
anything. But she loved it.''
</P>

   RESIGNATION CALLS MOUNT AS IMPEACHMENT VOTE NEARS
   By NICHOLE MONROE
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as U.S. troops engage in battle abroad,
members of Congress from both parties are calling on President
Clinton to resign in order to spare the nation the trauma of an
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show substantial support for the idea, but
Clinton said this week he would not even consider stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-led air strikes against Iraqi targets were already under
way Wednesday night as Republican House members gathered to discuss
how the war should affect impeachment procedures scheduled for this
week, but some angry members were ready to drum out the commander
in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an insult to the American people. He should resign,''
said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the president refuses to resign for the sake of the nation,
I believe
</P>
<P>
   he should be impeached and face Senate trial,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even one Democrat, Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York, said
Wednesday that if the House impeaches Clinton, ``I believe he would
have to resign at that point because his usefulness would be lost
in dealing with other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation bandwagon started rolling in earnest with
appearances on last Sunday's talk shows by House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Mouse Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that if Clinton resigned, he would be the ``savior of
his party'' and that it would be a way of ``going out with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a press availability during his Mideast trip Sunday,
Clinton declared, ``I have no intention of resigning. It's never
crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And when White House spokesman Joe Lockhart was asked at a
Wednesday briefing about polls that showed broad support for
resignation if Clinton were impeached, he dismissed their
significance, noting that a ``wide disparity'' exists depending on
how the questions are phrased.
</P>
<P>
   In its Thursday editions, The Washington Post acknowledged that
polling methods were a factor in a widely publicized finding this
week. An ABC News/Washington Post poll published Wednesday said
that 59 percent of respondents said Clinton should quit because
``it was the quickest way of bringing this matter to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Post noted Thursday that in another survey taken at the
same time, it had asked simply whether Clinton should resign or
``remain in office and face trial in the Senate. Only 43 percent of
people responding to that question said Clinton should quit.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a CBS News/New York Times poll published the same
day, only 43 percent agreed ``it would be better for the country if
Bill Clinton resigned from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post concluded that the differing results indicate that
``most of those favoring resignation do so mainly because they want
the scandal to end and not because of Clinton's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the reasons, history indicates that Clinton could
be endangered if polls show steady, strong support for resignation.
</P>
<P>
   When President Nixon resigned in 1974 as the House prepared to
consider articles of impeachment, he did so after loss of public
confidence led his allies in Congress to withdraw their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the disappearance of the (political) base, I now believe
that the constitutional process has been served, and there is no
longer a need for the process to be prolonged,'' Nixon said in his
resignation address to the nation.

   A princely epic, but no classic
   By Eleanor Ringel
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The powers that be at DreamWorks talked to everyone from
evangelists to ministers to rabbis to Muslim theologians to make
sure the world's major religions found nothing overtly offensive
about their new animated musical epic, ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only person they didn't contact was the ghost of Cecil
B. de Mille.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. He could have told them he'd already done this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Though unquestionably impressive on its own terms, ``The Prince
of Egypt'' can't help but summon echoes of de Mille's Oscar-winning
``The Ten Commandments.'' They have the same awesome visuals, the
same cast-of-thousands scale, the same insistently reverential
approach, though God sounds less patriarchal here, more like a
cross between a talk-show host and a New Age guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' tells the story of the Hebrew people's
liberation from slavery in Egypt. All the big scenes, with
occasional embellishments, are here: Moses being discovered in the
bulrushes by the Pharoah's family; his run-of-the-palace
coming-of-age and getting his adopted brother Rameses into trouble
with his high-spirited pranks; his discovery of his true birthright
and ensuing banishment; his finding a new home and family in the
desert; his being summoned by God to lead the Israelites out of
bondage; the 10 plagues (the killing of the firstborn Egyptian
males is especially chilling, recalling the finale of ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark'').
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets us as far as the climactic parting of the Red
Sea, then pretty much backs out gracefully. We glimpse Moses
delivering God's sacred words from Mount Sinai, but for stuff like
the orgiastic worship of the Golden Calf, you'll have to go back to
de Mille. After all, for all its well-researched solemnity and
righteous eschewing of fast-food tie-ins, ``Prince'' is still a
family film.
</P>
<P>
   A huge amount of care has been lavished on this movie, and it
shows. All the bases have been covered, from the spectacular
animation to the spectacular voice talent: Val Kilmer as Moses;
Ralph Fiennes as Rameses; Jeff Goldblum as Moses' brother, Aaron;
Michelle Pfeiffer as Moses' wife, Tzipporah; Sandra Bullock as his
sister, Miriam; Patrick Stewart as the Pharaoh Seti, Rameses'
father; Steve Martin and Martin Short as charlatan court magicians.
</P>
<P>
   But is ``Prince'' the sort of animated classic that will be
embraced (think ``Beauty and the Beast'' or ``Toy Story'')? Not
really. Though the writers have worked hard to give Moses a certain
spunk, and they do avoid cute sidekicks, they can't escape a kind
of squeaky-clean Sunday-school-lesson aura. The picture isn't
sanctimonious; it's too smart for that. But it is reined in. It's
dressed for church (or temple or mosque), and you can sense that
the clothes itch just a little.
</P>
<P>
   That said, you don't want to miss it. This movie is too well
done. The kids, who may not be all that familiar with de Mille or
the Book of Exodus, will be blown away by the story and the
effects. Everyone else will appreciate the sheer artistry on
display. But overall, ``The Prince of Egypt'' is just a bit too
kosher. It could have used a little ham.
</P>

   By grace of `Gods,' maybe an Oscar
   By Eleanor Ringel
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To a new world of gods and monsters!''
</P>
<P>
   So says a ``mad'' scientist in James Whale's masterful ``The
Bride of Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   That toast _ inspired, insane and ever so slightly campy _
provides the title for Bill Condon's fine new film, ``Gods and
Monsters.'' It's an inspired, insane and ever so slightly campy
reimagining of Whale's final days.
</P>
<P>
   Openly gay before it was even borderline acceptable, Whale rose
from being a working-class British lad to prominence as one of
Hollywood's most successful directors. He was (and still is) best
known for his classic horror films _ especially the first two
Frankenstein movies. ``The rest were done by hacks,'' he sneers in
``Gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Whale died in 1957 under mysterious circumstances. He hadn't
made a movie in more than a decade and had been largely forgotten
by the fickle, power-hungry Hollywood community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters,'' which is based on a speculative novel by
Christopher Bram, gives us Whale at twilight, played by the
marvelous Ian McKellen as an elegantly sardonic recluse whose
swimming pool and Cezannes can't erase his memories of a dirt-poor
childhood and the horrors of World War I or the encroaching
bitterness of a discarded artist. A stroke has left him physically
frail, and his mental state is increasingly precarious despite the
constant vigilance of his sternly devoted housekeeper (Lynn
Redgrave).
</P>
<P>
   Whale's hermitic existence is occasionally interrupted by a
worshipful monster-movie fan; in one scene, we see him subject a
young male visitor to a wry interview-by-striptease. But his
routine is totally thrown askew by the appearance of the new
gardener. He's Clay (Brendan Fraser), a hunky, decidedly hetero
ex-Marine who becomes Whale's unwitting object of desire.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is less a tale of predatory seduction than a daring
danse macabre. It's a pas de deux of death and desire, of
self-invention and self-destruction, of passion and poignant
remembrance of things past.
</P>
<P>
   There's terrific work everywhere you look. From Redgrave's
fussily funny fraulein _ she's like a parody of Cloris Leachman's
parodic performance in ``Young Frankenstein'' _ to Fraser's
not-quite-naif. The former ``George of the Jungle'' transforms a
potentially one-joke role into a fully dimensional character. His
symbolic value as Whale's final ``monster/creation'' is laid on a
little thick, but Fraser manages to carry it off, right down to the
squared-off head and shambling gait that began with Boris Karloff
and reached its pop-culture apotheosis in Herman Munster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film's gnawing, unsettling center is McKellen. He
captures it all: Whale's impishly insinuating lasciviousness, his
malignant self-loathing, his tragic isolation. He gives us a wary,
weary genius, trapped in his own private Sunset Boulevard. The
critics' prizes have already started piling up. An Oscar nomination
seems a sure thing.

   `Ozona' an oasis of cliches in desert
   By Steve Murray
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director J.S. Cardone came up with the idea for ``Outside
Ozona'' during nighttime drives through the desert: He wondered who
else was out there, traveling through the dark, listening to the
same lonesome, small-town radio station.
</P>
<P>
   It's a poetic idea (if a tad reminiscent of ``American
Graffiti''), but he buries its potential under movie cliches and
caricatures. His band of strangers in the night include ex-stripper
Earlene (Penelope Ann Miller) and her carny-clown boyfriend Wit
(Kevin Pollak); Odell (Robert Forster), a trucker who befriends
Native American Reba (Kateri Walker) and her dying grandmother; and
a pair of bickering sisters (Sherilyn Fenn and Beth Ann Styne) who
give a lift to a nebbishy fellow named Alan (David Paymer), a
serial killer who specializes in carving the hearts out of women.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dope-smoking DJ Dix (Taj Mahal) fills the airwaves
with C&AMP;W and R&AMP;B and opens up the phone lines, to the consternation
of his manager, Floyd (Meat Loaf). You hear those names and know
you're in for a long night with so-called ``colorful characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's intended tone is impossible to guess. It tries to
balance its white-trash caricatures and clown jokes with the grisly
butcheries of the killer. Forster provides some laid-back appeal,
and Lucy Webb as an agent on the killer's trail has some nice
deadpan moments. But the material inspires most of the actors to go
cartoonish.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame them. The characters are as superficial as the
blue eye shadow and pink lipstick Miller has to wear. The writing
never rises above homespun philosophizing, such as, ``Sometimes
you're the windshield, and sometimes you're the bug.'' Watching
this, you'll sympathize with the bug.
</P>

LAS VEGAS: Black Angus fillet. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gambling never stops. From the slots that greet you at the
airport to the packed casinos along the Strip, you can make or lose
a fortune in a night. But legalization of gambling in other parts
of the country has diminished the city's role as a gaming resort
destination. A tourist poll done for the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority shows that, for the first time, more people are
coming for the entertainment than the gambling. Even so, no other
city can boast casinos as opulent, gaudy, hectic and enormous as
those in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ]The entertainment is amazing. Whatever your taste, you'll find
it in Las Vegas. Be prepared, though. Many top-line stars take
their own vacations during this time of the year. Mirage mainstays
Siegfried and Roy always take the week off.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are fewer stars to go around, it's wise to plan
early which show to see so you can reserve good seats. Pick up the
latest copy of Showbiz Weekly at your travel agent or go to its Web
site at www.lvshowbiz.com for a searchable schedule. What's On/Las
Vegas also has a helpful site at www.whats-on.com. Be sure to check
hotel Web sites, where the schedules may be more up-to-date. And
you may get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas night, Rodney Dangerfield opened at the MGM, and
he'll be back this year. Across the casino, in the main room,
Jackie Chan took time out from breaking things with his head to
host a cavalcade of Asian superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, George Carlin _ the best bargain in town at
under $40 _ had the audience screaming at Bally's; Lionel Ritchie
had them rocking at the Mirage; and the Temptations had them
doo-wopping at the Desert Inn.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you don't find a headliner you like, the big hotels
feature opulent production shows at a reasonable price, usually
around $40. Take your pick of magicians, impressionists or
showgirls. And, if you've wondered whatever happened to David
Cassidy since ``The Partridge Family,'' he's at the MGM, starring
in EFX.
</P>
<P>
   If your taste runs toward the mildly prurient, the topless shows
and strip joints don't close for the holidays. As one tired-looking
dancer at Girls of Glitter Gulch succinctly put it on Christmas
Day, ``It's just another day, baby. Want a dance?''
</P>
<P>
   The shopping is unparalleled. Las Vegas has shops and malls that
make your local upscale mall look like a two-bit strip center.
Visitors spend about $25 billion a year, and that has attracted all
the top names in retail.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes south of the Strip is the Fashion Outlet Mall,
with more than 100 stores and restaurants. The shopping gallery at
the new high-roller hotel Bellagio features Chanel, Hermes,
Tiffany, Gucci, Prada and Armani.
</P>
<P>
   But the crown jewel of malls is the Forum Shops, adjacent to
Caesars, a neoclassical masterpiece with a domed ceiling that
imitates the changing sky. Inside, find statues and enormous Roman
fountains _ even an animatronic Atlantis fountain that comes to
life each 90 minutes as the story of the lost continent unfolds
with flame and thunder. And when you're not gaping at the
architecture, visit FAO Schwarz, Gucci, Bernini, Versace, Ralph
Lauren, Niketown or the Virgin Megastore.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is outstanding. No snow and slush in Las Vegas.
During December, you can expect highs in the low 70s during the
day, dropping to the mid-40s at night, all under cloudless skies.
It's cool enough for a sweater or light jacket and perfect for golf
or tennis, although you'll find the pool areas empty of all but the
hardiest swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdness is everywhere. Las Vegas truly is one big theme
park of enormous proportions. If you have a car, the first thing
you must do is make the drive from the south end of Las Vegas
Boulevard _ the Strip _ all the way downtown, not just to orient
yourself to this strange new world, but to see some of the most
remarkable architecture on the planet. Admittedly, a lot of it is
bad taste, but consider what you'll see:
</P>
<P>
   The pyramid-shaped Luxor, fronted by an obelisk and a replica of
the Sphinx, stands like an otherworldly sentinel at the far south
end of the Strip. Next door is the medieval castle Excalibur.
Across the street and down the block is the largest hotel in the
world, the emerald-tinted MGM Grand with its new, colossal golden
lion standing guard. The Manhattan skyline, Brooklyn Bridge and
Statue of Liberty wait across the street at New York New York.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the Strip, you'll pass the Bellagio's Mediterranean
village and the Eiffel Tower under construction at the Paris. The
canals are being readied at the Venetian. The frenetic light show
of Bally's and the Flamingo Hilton are a contrast to the majestic
Roman edifice of Caesars Palace, and the exploding volcano in front
of Mirage and the pirate battles in Treasure Island's lagoon draw
young and old.
</P>
<P>
   Drive on past some of the older Strip hotels and the gaudiest
McDonald's you'll ever see, then past the Stratosphere needle
rising more than a thousand feet in the air, restaurant revolving
at the top, the scary-looking Big Shot roller coaster circling the
tower's mast. Downtown, park and walk to Fremont Street, now a
pedestrian mall, but still home to many of the city's oldest hotels
and casinos, including the Horseshoe and the Golden Nugget. This is
the Vegas you remember from old movies, though now a high-tech
canopy above the street treats visitors to a remarkable video show
at night.
</P>
<P>
   So, go ahead and place your bet. The odds of having a merry
Christmas in this weird winter wonderland are excellent.

   U.S.-BRITISH COOPERATION ON IRAQ HIGHLIGHTS CLINTON-BLAIR
PARTNERSHIP
   With US-IRAQ-1218.
   By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
   c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the November episode of the Iraqi crisis, Prime
Minister Tony Blair logged eight phone calls to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in 12 hours before the decision was made to call off the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, as the cruise missiles again were being
targeted to strike Iraq, the phone lines between No. 10 Downing
Street and the White House again were heating up. Afterwards, it
was Blair who first informed the world of the attacks offering the
rationale for the joint American-British action, setting the stage
for Clinton's Oval Office address.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to military action, Britain is the United States
best -- and at times, only -- friend.
</P>
<P>
   And while much of the rest of Europe spent Thursday equivocating
over the attack -- even hinting the air strikes may have had more
to do with Clinton's domestic problems -- than the world's quarrel
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Blair maintained a strong
defense of his close, yet troubled friend.
</P>
<P>
   In Parliament, Blair was challenged about the timing of the
attack. George Galloway, a member of Parliament from the Labor
Party, said that the attack amounted to a new Crusade against an
Arab capital. ``But this time led not by Richard the Lion Heart,
but Clinton the liar,'' Galloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair denied Clinton's troubles were a factor, saying he was
convinced to act by the evidence and his experience. ``I know that
President Clinton reached the same conclusion for the same
reasons,'' Blair said. ``And had he acted differently out of regard
for the internal matters of U.S. politics that would have been a
dereliction of his duty as President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, not for the first time, he has shown the courage to
do the right thing, and he has my full support.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While Blair has his political difficulties, his day after the
first round of attacks was blissful to what his friend was
encountering in Washington. With a few exceptions, the House of
Commons -- not always the friendliest chamber in the world --
offered little but support. Even William Hague, the leader of the
opposition Tories gave his proud blessings.
</P>
<P>
   The news media seemed solidly behind the attack with the
tabloids seeming to revel in headlines such as The Express's ``We
had to Bomb Him'' and Sun's ``BLITZED.'' From the front pages,
Blair -- and Britain -- seemed powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, people who called in television talk shows and sent e-mails
to the BBC's web site expressed nevertheless suspicion about the
timing, suggesting that Blair had gone along with the attacks to
help his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Like their predecessors, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher,
they are close in ideology and political styles. Close in their
ages and political backgrounds, the biggest difference between
Clinton and Blair is their private lives: Blair's is as smooth as
Clinton's is turbulent.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair argues that the Monica Lewinsky affair is an
American problem, the scandal also has dogged Blair for the past
year. Last summer, as Blair welcomed his friend to Northern Ireland
where the two leaders had worked hard to forge a peace, the visit
was undercut by constant questions about the president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   When the prime minister was in New York earlier this year to
address the United Nations, it was the same day that Clinton's
televised grand jury testimony was released.
</P>
<P>
   Blair frequently has been forced into the position of defending
the honesty and integrity of his country's most powerful ally.
</P>
<P>
   For Blair, the main problem with his special relationship with
Clinton appears to be convincing skeptics at home that he is not
merely submitting to the wishes of his senior partner. He at times
is referred to as America's poodle.
</P>
<P>
   Blair shrugs off such attacks. ``When people ask me about
standing by President Clinton,'' Blair said Thursday, ``I've never
been a fair-weather friend and I don't intend to start now.''

`TROUBLE ON THE CORNER': A PSYCHOLOGIST DESCENDING INTO LUNACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his feature film debut, as the writer, director and
co-producer of the darkly comic ``Trouble on the Corner,'' Alan
Madison has assembled an exceptional cast: Tony Goldwyn, Giancarlo
Esposito, Roger Rees, Tammy Grimes, Debi Mazar, Joe Morton, Edie
Falco, Anna Thomson, Daniel Von Bargen, Charles Busch, Mark
Margolis and Bruce MacVittie.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the ensemble is Goldwyn as Jeff, a psychologist treating
patients in his apartment in a crumbling Harlem tenement that is as
vivid a character as any of his troubled patients, who often
include his eccentric neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the literal and figurative weight of his dwelling and his
near-sexless marriage to a motherly nurse (Ms. Falco), Jeff is
looping into lunacy. En route to becoming unhinged, he is no help
to his patients, as they often complain. And they are no help to
him.
</P>
<P>
   He is upset by the volatile Sandy ( MacVittie), who has a taste
for 14-year-old girls; he cannot fathom the love of Daryl (
Esposito) for his terminally ill partner; he offers no satisfaction
to the wife (Ms. Thomson) of his butcher (Von Bargen), who revels
in blood.
</P>
<P>
   In the estimation of his patients, the therapist is dull and
hollow and knows nothing of love. While his wife sleeps, the
frustrated Jeff spies through a hole in their crumbling bathroom
ceiling, trying to learn more about the sexy new upstairs neighbor
(Ms. Mazar), who never takes off her gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff is nearing a state of lethal combustion.
</P>
<P>
   The performances _ among them Ms. Grimes as a Bible-spouting,
newspaper-collecting widow; Busch as the local psychic; Rees as a
disheveled dog-walking lawyer, and Morton as a police detective
enlisted by Jeff to do something about the predatory Sandy _ are
expert.
</P>
<P>
   And the atmosphere is convincing. But ``Trouble on the Corner''
suffers from a monotony of pace. It takes too long to get where
it's going; and when it arrives, it offers an explanation for
Jeff's derangement that seems too hasty and facile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trouble on the Corner'' is playing through Dec. 30 in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE ON THE CORNER &QL;

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to the
following automotive features moved during the last week.
</P>
<P>
   For retransmission of these stories, call 888-346-9867.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-COLUMN-AZR (Undated) _ Is this the greatest toy ever
invented or what? It's like one of my kids' Hot Wheels came to
life, and I got to drive it around. Everything you want to know
about the Plymouth Prowler can be summed up in three letters:
F-U-N. This wedgy eggplant doesn't have a serious bone in its
chassis. Nor should it. By Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ General Motors has rolled
out big guns in its truck shootout with Ford, and the GM arsenal
includes two brands, not one. I've already told you about the
all-new 1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickups, introduced in September,
the first major redesign of the full-size Chevy trucks in a decade.
But the GMC truck division also has its version of the new pickups,
called the Sierra, and if you thought the new Chevy trucks were
something special, you've got to check out the 1999 Sierra. By G.
Chambers III.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING-COX (Atlanta) _ When most of us think of hot rods,
cars like Z28 Camaros, 5.0 Mustangs or hemi-headed Mopars come to
mind. Now there's a new player in the hot rod segment, and an
unusual one at that. Mercedes-Benz offers perhaps one of the most
performance-oriented lineups in the marketplace. Starting with the
C230 Kompressor sedan, the German automaker seems on a mission to
restore an almost lost commodity to the automotive marketplace _
torque. By Linda Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ Back in September, we introduced
readers to the new high-powered version of the Mercedes-Benz M
Class sport/utility/van/whatevermobile, the ML430 with its brand
new 268-horsepower V-8 engine. Back then, the columnist had been
favorably impressed by the quickness, agility, and go-anywhere
ability of this new Benz. (Well, go almost anywhere; it won't swim,
it won't fly, and it does not leap tall buildings at a single
bound.) But the proof of a car is living with it over the long
term. By John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-ESCALADE-NYT (Undated) _ Escapade? Escalate? No, it's
Escalade, defined by Webster's as ``the act of scaling or climbing
the walls of a fortified place using ladders.'' While these trucks
_ the first in Cadillac's 96 years of existence _ are perfectly
capable of scaling heights, few will venture much farther off-road
than the valet parking lane at the yacht club. The Escalade's
capabilities will rarely be used to their potential. By James G.
Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-LINCOLN-NYT (Undated) _ After nearly six decades as
the undisputed leader of the U.S. luxury market, Cadillac is poised
to lose its crown to Lincoln this year. As of Nov. 30, Lincoln had
sold 170,265 cars and trucks in 1998. That was nearly 7,000 ahead
of Cadillac. The gap grew in November, prompting Cadillac to
virtually concede the race. By Michelle Krebs.

LIFE-AFFIRMING `GODS' GOES DEEP ON RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Gods create. Always been that way, no matter the
mythology. So try this syllogism on for size. Moviemakers create
worlds out of cheesecloth, dreams out of celluloid, idols out of
flickering phantoms. Therefore, moviemakers are gods.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider this old Hollywood wives' tale, attributed to
several producers, most often Sam Goldwyn: ``Make a star, make a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps director Bill Condon had something like that in mind
when he conceived his cinematic fantasia on the life of '30s film
director James Whale, titled not so coincidentally ``Gods and
Monsters''?
</P>
<P>
   Whale, of course, did create monsters. The Frankenstein monster,
and the monster's bride, most famously; and the spooky villains of
``TheOld Dark House'' and ``The Invisible Man.'' And he was
cognizant of his role. The preamble to ``Frankenstein'' states,
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of
science who sought to create a man after his own image without
reckoning upon God.''
</P>
<P>
   Such audacity is seldom destined for a good end. Whale's career
did not survive the '30s by much. Not because he was gay, as is
usually said. He simply ran out of hits, and nothing offends
Tinseltown's sense of smell more than a man with bad box office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the English-born filmmaker was found floating in his
Hollywood swimming pool. It is generally agreed he was a suicide,
but there are those who persist in believing it was murder.
</P>
<P>
   Condon has used Christopher Bram's novel, ``Father of
Frankenstein,'' which imaginatively and fictionally posits what
happened on that fatal day, as the basis for a film that is one
part tribute, one part eulogy to the golden age of motion pictures
and the artists who gave it its luster _ and to those who sat in
the darkened theaters and were forever changed by what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   If that were all Condon's film had to offer, cinephiles would
get their fix and the picture would make a quick exit from the
multiplexes. ``Gods and Monsters'' is destined for a larger
audience because it is concerned with much more. It is a powerfully
acted, movingly directed story about the dangers and pleasures of
connecting to another human being. A love story, if you will,
although no one in the film ever really commits themselves. It is a
parable that teaches that the creation of love, like the creation
of life, seldom turns out as the gods intend.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes place during the last weeks of the director's
life. Whale (an almost certain to be Oscar-nominated performance by
Ian McKellan) is recovering from a stroke when he conceives a
passion for his gardener, the hunky Clay Boone (Brendan Fraser,
proving that he can be as affecting and serious an actor as he was
a funny one in ``George of the Jungle'').
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished painter, Whale offers to sketch the naive Boone,
who does not realize at first that he is dealing with a gay man. By
the time he does, the relationship between the two has passed
beyond the issue of sex into something far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Since his stroke, Whale has been victimized by a series of
``brainstorms'' that make him an unwilling voyeur of the past: He
is constantly flashing on scenes from the abusive family life he
has spent his adult life denying; on his traumatic experiences in
the trenches of World War I; and on his unconsummated relationship
with the only man he suspects ``may have ever loved me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone's childhood and adolescence were equally troubled. He,
too, has never really loved someone, or felt he has been loved.
Slowly, painfully, Whale draws the bleakness out of Boone and is
greatly moved, seeing in him the son he never had. But his mind is
spinning out of control. As Boone begins to think of him in a
fatherly way, Whale begins to regard Boone as that long-ago lover.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who is straight, finds it difficult to cope with this, as
does Whale's devoted Hungarian housekeeper Hanna (Lynn Redgrave, in
the film's third memorable performance). She is a devout Catholic
who abhors her ``Mister Jimmy's'' sexual proclivities but respects
him as a kind and sensitive man.
</P>
<P>
   Neither love nor hard-learned lessons in tolerance protect them
from watching helplessly as one fuse after another blows in Whale's
brain. To Boone's horror, he finds himself drawn into the
director's plan for ending the misery. In a climatic night of
horror, an attempted rape leads to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of ``Gods and Monsters'' lies in Condon's
skillful mix of reality and metaphor. After watching Whale's 1935
masterpiece, ``The Bride of Frankenstein,'' and blossoming under
his regard, Boone comes to think of the director as his friend and
mentor, his ``creator,'' in fact, since Boone is literally born
again as a functioning human being.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the movie in turn, Whale begins to see Boone as his
``beloved monster.'' Suddenly, it is no longer Colin Clive and
Boris Karloff ``we'' are watching in the clips from ``The Bride of
Frankenstein,'' it is Whale and Boone. The line between the screen
and the auditorium is erased and, as in so much of today's
movie-made America, it becomes difficult to tell which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' is a serious movie, dealing with serious
issues, but Condon never loses his sense of humor. His screenplay
is often witty and sometimes just plain funny, as in a poolside
interview with a geeky college student that a bored Whale turns
into a game of strip poker.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an extended set-piece at a party at George Cukor's
estate, which involves Princess Margaret, Elizabeth Taylor, Karloff
and Elsa Lanchester, the real ``bride'' of Frankenstein. Condon has
a marvelous time (as does the audience) puncturing the egos and
pretensions of the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ending itself, which it is to be hoped no one gives away, is
wonderfully life-affirming.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, James Agee once said, are a chance to travel the paths
we would otherwise avoid. So it is with ``Gods and Monsters.''
James Whale is consumed with a nostalgia for what never was, Clay
Boone for what might never be. Such a collision of hopes is a
forceful reminder that those who wait to know the outcome of the
journey never take the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' is unrated. There is moderate profanity
and a brief instance of male frontal nudity. 4 stars. &QL;

 UNDATED: `Bonfire''' (Holden). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
</P>
<P>
   1998. Warner. $104.16. 85 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Proft's film sets up some potentially funny situations for
Leslie Nielsen, who has shown he can make the most of them in the
``Naked Gun'' series. In Proft's takeoff on ``The Fugitive,'' he is
Ryan Harrison, Lord of the Violin, wrongfully convicted of a
killing committed, he claims, by a one-armed, one-eyed, one-legged
terrorist. ``Titanic,'' ``Baywatch'' and other productions are ripe
for spoofing, but too much of this is adolescent humor with no real
comic payoff. ``Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very
funny'' (Anita Gates). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLADE
</P>
<P>
   1998. New Line. $107.37. 121 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a different kind of disco, sprinkler heads in the ceiling
spew blood for a crowd of vampires. Enter Blade (Wesley Snipes), a
ridiculous figure draped with what looks like automobile seat
belts, who blows the celebrants to bits. A half-human, Blade has
been dedicated to ridding the world of vampires, who claimed his
mother moments before he was born. That sounds like a low-rent
``Batman,'' but though the limited Snipes seems to have found a
role he is comfortable with, the vehicle is no more than a
``cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NEW TITLES OF INTEREST, SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE HAD A
THEATER RELEASE AT ONE TIME OR APPEARED ON TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   ANTOINE ET ANTOINETTE and RENDEZVOUS DE JUILLET: The French
director Jacques Becker, who began as an assistant to Jean Renoir
and is remembered primarily for his masterpiece, the period love
story ``Casque d'Or'' (1952), made only 13 films. But Becker was
also highly regarded by New Wave filmmakers for lesser works that
blended love and social settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine et Antoinette'' (78 minutes), about the troubled
relationship of a young Parisian working-class couple, won the
Grand Prix at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1947.
``Rendezvous de Juillet'' (1949) follows a group of young people
who spurn the bourgeoisie in postwar Paris. Water Bearer. $29.95
each. French with English subtitles. Release date: Tuesday.
Information: (800) 551-8304.
</P>
<P>
   GORILLA BATHES AT NOON: In Dusan Makavejev's film, the collapse
of the Soviet Union takes on a certain poignancy through the
goofball adventures of Maj. Victor Borisovich, who is stranded in
Berlin after his unit deserts. Riding a bicycle decorated with the
hammer and sickle and wandering as a kind of post-Communist
Candide, Victor visits a Siberian tiger at the zoo and watches a
huge statue of Lenin being dismantled. Facets. $59.95. 83 minutes.
English, German and Russian with English subtitles. Information:
(800) 331-6197.
</P>
<P>
   SAM SHEPARD: STALKING HIMSELF. Bits of his plays and interviews
with actors are capped with a close, revealing conversation with
the playwright himself, a notably private man who discusses his
troubled youth and relationship with his father. 1998. Fox Lorber.

 Fighting Video Piracy  
 Where Do All the Old Films Go?  
 New Releases of Video Cassettes: Reviews by New York Times
Critics  
 Other New Titles of Interest  
(mk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THEATERS FIGHT PIRATING OF FILMS: When reached on his cell
phone, Bill Shannon was in Brooklyn helping police shut down
another video piracy operation. ``It was one of the bigger ones,''
he said. ``A lab and warehouse, 173 VCRs, 7,000 pieces of finished
product. There were 10 arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon directs the antipiracy efforts of the Motion Picture
Association of America, the studios' trade association. Bootleg
videos have been everywhere for years, of course. But recently,
Shannon said, the association has been devoting more resources to
the problem, and prosecutors and police have been taking it more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The association announced on Monday that it was enlisting the
public. Through Dec. 31 in 33 theaters in New York City, messages
on screen before films are shown ask audiences to watch for people
using camcorders to shoot the films while they are on the big
screen and to report them to theater managements.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes from camcorders are duplicated to make usually very poor _
but occasionally quite good _ copies of movies, which are then sold
on street corners, in flea markets and similar outlets.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is a hotbed of such activity. ``I don't know why
New York,'' said Jack Valenti, the association's president.
``Everybody there is a wannabe filmmaker, I guess.'' Earlier this
year 70,000 bootleg copies of ``Titanic'' were confiscated in New
York. The overwhelming demand for that film made it a special case,
but piracy is always rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Bootleg videos often appear before a film opens in theaters,
which means they have been made from prints that have been stolen
or otherwise misappropriated with the help of someone with access
to them. Camcorders, which are better and smaller than ever (making
them harder to detect), appear during the theater run. ``They've
always been a problem because you don't have to steal something or
bribe somebody,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   By the association's estimate, the studios lose $250 million a
year to piracy.
</P>
<P>
   SALVAGING OLDIES: It's surprising how often well-known older
films fall out of video distribution. For example, until recently
Woody Allen's ``Take the Money and Run,'' John Huston's ``Prizzi's
Honor,'' Jonathan Demme's ``Melvin and Howard'' and Mike Nichols'
``Silkwood'' were around only in old cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   One small distributor, Anchor Bay of Troy, Mich., is very
aggressive at recycling titles like these. All four films are out
in new Anchor Bay editions, and next year they will be joined by
``Lovers and Other Strangers'' (Diane Keaton's film debut), ``The
Ipcress File,'' with Michael Caine and Nigel Green, Werner Herzog's
``Fitzcaraldo,'' and many other older and highly regarded films.
</P>
<P>
   Why do studios seemingly ``let go'' of notable old movies?
``They're under the gun to sell new titles,'' said Jay Douglas,
Anchor Bay's vice president of acquisitions. Emphasis on the new
sometimes loosens the grip on the old. Studios hang on to
television rights but consider it too expensive to keep marketing
many of their old movies as packaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   Often video rights revert to producers, directors or
institutions like banks. ``That's opened the doors for us to make
licensing deals,'' Douglas said.

<P>
   1998. Miramax. $104.96. 92 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Young black New York professionals convene for mating and power
games, but fortunately a certain screwball element slips through in
Christopher Scott Cherot's film. The savior is Lee Plenty, a
self-deprecating aspiring novelist who, by reason of having
attended college with these people, finds himself in the same shark
tank. The only one without money, Lee camps out in the apartment of
the avidly materialistic Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), who is about
to be engaged to an arrogant singer (Hill Harper). Lee's relaxed,
engaging response to the situation, Stephen Holden wrote in The New
York Times, makes him ``one of the most original and likable
characters to pop up in a movie in quite a while.''

<P>
   COUSIN BETTE
</P>
<P>
   1998. Fox. $100.96. 107 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release
date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In tackling a film version of Balzac's novel, Des McAnuff's film
tries to connect a feverish mid-19th-century tale, an antecedent of
``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' to today's egomaniacal movers and
shakers. Out to avenge her mistreatment at the hands of cloddish
relatives, the black-clad title character (Jessica Lange) gives
back as good as she gets. If only she weren't so grim and
monochromatic about it, we might get more satisfaction. But on
screen such an elaborate literary tale ``feels as rushed,
overstuffed and devoid of texture as Brian DePalma's hopelessly
stunted screen adaptation of `Bonfire''' (Holden).

   UNDATED - You'll have to get over the idea that they've made a
sequel to ``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``You've Got Mail'' does have the same two stars and the
same writer-director, and, yes, it's a romantic comedy about people
who haven't met _ but it's a different one.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``You've Got Mail'' becomes quite romantically
wonderful at times, it may work better for people who didn't like
``Sleepless in Seattle'' than for people who started meetin g all
their dates at the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   How should you approach ``You've Got Mail''? Think Hepburn and
Tracy. That's the kind of easy comic grace that the re-pairing of
Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks brings to the affair.

   Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) and Joe Fox (Hanks) are Net friends,
conducting a long-running e-mail relationship without ever having
met.
</P>
<P>
   Or so they think.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they have met in non-cyberspace, but they don't know
it because they despise each other.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen has good reason for her feelings. She owns a small
children's bookstore on Manhattan's Upper West Side, while Joe owns
the new giant bookstore moving into the neighborhood and
threatening to run her out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Though the story spins slowly around the eventuality of their
realizing who they are and what they might mean to each other,
writer-director Nora Ephron uses their situation to explore several
provocative, but non-romantic, themes.
</P>
<P>
   Through their thoughtful e-mail messages, Ephron establishes a
literary communion that mirrors the intellectually seductive lure
of ``84 Charing Cross Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephron pours out her love for books and for people who care
about the written word. She takes her time to create complex
characters so that Kathleen and Joe rise beyond the moony looks of
a sentimental love affair.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Ephron reduces the number of one-liners. The movie
is often amusing, and ultimately winning, but rarely causes you to
laugh out loud. Ephron builds the story, not slowly, but leisurely,
so we have time to share their lives in full dimensions. The
director can succeed without fast, snappy comedy because Ryan and
Hanks carry the movie over the gaps in its laugh lines.
</P>
<P>
   With those eyes and that smile, Ryan begins the movie in her
typically adorable fashion, wearing socks with her flannel PJs. But
she grows with the character until, like Hanks, she isn't only
funny or romantic but a real person struggling with her future.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and Ryan are so comfortable working together, in the
sparring comedy and the deeper moments, that they allow each other
room to express a range of emotions. There's nothing rushed or
forced about them. They click when they fight, and they blend when
they fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``You've Got Mail'' is a re-imagining of the Jimmy
Stewart-Margaret Sullavan comedy ``The Shop Around the Corner,''
people will more often compare it to Ephron's ``Sleepless in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it isn't as sentimental as ``Sleepless,'' ``You've Got
Mail'' is for people looking for a little less volume in their
romances and a little more sophistication in their comedies. Go to
see it when you feel like taking the time to settle in, as you
would with a good book. The movie grows on you until you don't want
to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``You've Got Mail'' contains some minor profanity but
no sex or nudity. 4 stars. &QL;

`PRINCE' RAISES ART TO NEW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Cast of thousands! Years in the making!
</P>
<P>
   It's rare to see that kind of film promotion anymore. With the
rare ``Titanic'' exception, studios can't afford such costly
spectacle. Except in the wonderful world of animation, where
artists are set free to create as spectacular a movie as ``The
Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   This animated Bible story raises the level of film artistry to
new heights, and it's a joy to go along for that ride.
</P>
<P>
   In lively fashion, ``The Prince of Egypt'' traces the story of
Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), the Hebrew baby raised in the royal
house of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In this version of the Moses story, the boy grows into a
teenager, thinking he is an Egyptian prince. He prepares to take
his place with his brother, Ramses (Ralph Fiennes), and continue
the expansion of the Egyptian empire, which is built upon the bent
backs of Hebrew slaves.
</P>
<P>
   When Moses discovers the truth of his Hebrew heritage, he leaves
Egypt and lives in the wilderness until God appears and instructs
him to go back and lead his people to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   These adventures are told in bright, lively style that will
please kids and parents alike, with vibrant use of songs to
dramatize the story and just enough humor to leaven it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' comes from DreamWorks Pictures, headed
by Steven Spielberg and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Other studios have tried to move in on Disney's profitable family
animation market _ most notably Fox Studio, with its
Phoenix-produced ``Anastasia'' _ by imitating Disney. DreamWorks
tries something new: raising the level of animation to challenge
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Disney reacts to the
challenge. If it raises its own standards, we could be in for a
whole new realm of animated delights.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork in ``The Prince of Egypt,'' vastly aided by
computer-enhanced animation techniques, is spectacular and so
gorgeous that you often forget you're watching animation.
</P>
<P>
   The parting of the Red Sea is a marvel that would awe Cecil B.
DeMille himself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also takes a good deal of the cute out of the typical
Disney animated fairy tale. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' has its funny moments, but it tells the
Bible story with the intention of illuminating the historic issues
of slavery and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Biblical scholars and fundamentalists may object to the
liberties taken with the story.
</P>
<P>
   But any movie that gets families talking about religious issues
has performed a valuable service to our society.
</P>
<P>
   That makes ``The Prince of Egypt'' a good film for children,
although kids younger than 5 may find a couple of scenes of
Egyptian cruelty a little too realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, the film's producer, has said the movie may be
inappropriate for children under 7 _ not because there's anything
untoward but because the story may be too difficult for young
children to follow.
</P>
<P>
   I think young kids will get caught up in the excitement of the
action, the music and the artwork, and not mind what story
subtleties they miss.
</P>
<P>
   They don't care about the adult jokes in such movies as
``Mulan,'' and they won't be affected by the things that go over
their heads here.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is more sophisticated than the typical animated
film, it's thoroughly enjoyable, and kids should find it a
thrilling experience.
</P>
<P>
   If you're taking young kids to see ``The Prince of Egypt,'' you
may want to talk to them about the Bible story before they see it,
as the movie is bound to raise questions for discussion afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Most animated movies are rated G, which is as family-friendly as
the ratings get. While ``The Prince of Egypt'' is on a par with the
others, it is rated PG because of its more sophisticated subject
matter. 4 stars. &QL;

`THE PRINCE OF EGYPT': FAIRY TALE? MUSICAL COMEDY? NOPE, BIBLICAL
EPIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a film bearing Dreamworks' great expectations and the
scrutiny of so many religious advisers, ``The Prince of Egypt'' is
one animated biblical epic with understandable jitters.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant to achieve, a new breakthrough for the animator's
art and a sacrosanct yet frisky entertainment for viewers large and
small, may have been as impossible as it sounds. But ``The Prince
of Egypt'' is a well-made work with much to recommend it, even if
its worthiness is not the brightest flare on the movie horizon this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' tries to do something different, and
often winds up better than you'd think, especially once the obvious
unease is out of the way. In a film whose souvenir program
describes Moses as one of ``the greatest heroes of all time,'' a
big show of action-adventure bravado may be unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a jolt to find the animated Moses in a madcap
chariot race (with the Pharaoh to be, Ramses) that topples assorted
archeological treasures or to find armies of animated Hebrew slaves
singing about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   The film's strenuous efforts to deliver entertainment value are
jarring at first. (Will baby Moses, floating through the bulrushes
toward the flimsily clad Egyptian princess destined to adopt him,
be struck by an oar en route?) But they give way to an intriguing
if highly abbreviated translation of the Book of Exodus into the
realm of animation.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the film medium in which the miraculous is
most possible, and the subject matter readily lends itself to the
visual milieu. Even if the biblical plagues have been reduced to a
brief montage (doubtless to avoid scaring the wits out of young
viewers), they've also been designed with creative audacity.
</P>
<P>
   The spectral plague upon firstborn children is one of the most
hauntingly vivid sights here, even if it's followed a shade too
soon by a song of celebration from the departing Hebrew slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' touches biblical bases from Moses'
adoption to his receiving the Ten Commandments and manages to have
different personalities for each stage along the way. As a young
scamp (with the voice of Val Kilmer), Moses seems dangerously close
to the standard-issue Disney adventurer, right down to that fatuous
ballad about what to do with his life. (``Here among my trappings
and belongings I belong/And if anybody doubts it, they couldn't be
more wrong!'')
</P>
<P>
   The film works best when it stops relying on easy fluff and lets
what is, after all, a mighty strong story, speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Moses leaves his Egyptian foster parents, marries a
very foxy Zipporah (with the voice of Michelle Pfeiffer) and
discovers the magnitude of his mission, the film at last assumes
the gravitas that would have elevated it from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody need count on animation for theology instruction, but
``The Prince of Egypt'' does illustrate the epic nature of the
Exodus story. And the Dreamworks team, led by the directors Brenda
Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells, rises to occasions like the
parting of the Red Sea with all the computer-generated splendor at
its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most visually daring moments, including a dazzling
fantasy sequence in which hieroglyphics come to life, offer
glimpses of how breathtaking an even riskier, less conventional
work of Bible-based animation could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince'' gets its rather superfluous star power from a cast
that includes Ralph Fiennes as Ramses; Sandra Bullock as Moses'
sister, Miriam; Jeff Goldblum (one of the few really identifiable
voices here) as Aaron, and Steve Martin and Martin Short as two
jokey minor characters whose clowning is kept minimal. Patrick
Stewart makes a lofty, Scottish-sounding Pharaoh, and Helen Mirren
plays the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest voices here are the extraneous ones of Whitney
Houston and Mariah Carey, belting out that obligatory ballad from
Stephen Schwartz's mostly unremarkable score. The animation itself
is expert and eye-filling, though two-dimensional backdrops (as in
Disney's ``Mulan'') remain lifeless relative to the
three-dimensional characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested) and is not suitable for very young children. Biblical
plagues, the suffering of slaves and the drowning of Pharaoh's army
are essential parts of its story.

GOLF SCORES NO LONGER A HANDICAP FOR SOFTWARE INVENTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN D. ABBEY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ John Pritchard, a bank association
executive and avid golfer, had a problem. He wanted to play exotic
golf games with complicated scoring methods such as Nassau,
Scramble, Vegas and others even more obscure for those who like to
bet a few dollars on the side.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't keep up with the scoring _ and didn't like
relying on a partner who kept scratching out numbers on a small
piece of paper with a nub of a pencil. So he did something about
it. He invented a computer program that fits on certain types of
hand-held computers, allowing individuals and golf foursomes to
keep score of one or even multiple golf games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a golfer, I knew what I needed,'' he said. Now, three
years after first coming up with the idea, the businessman and
councilman in the upstate New York town of Clifton Park wants to
license the program to a computer manufacturer and sell it over the
Internet to other golf-obsessed individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Score Pro, allows entry of golf course information,
player handicaps, game choices and wagers prior to a golf round.
The program automatically calculates scores and winnings. Unlike
some other golf scoring programs, he said, it permits recalculation
is someone enters an incorrect score.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more or less a hobby for me,'' said Pritchard, who is
now entering into negotiations with Philips Electronics,
manufacturer of a hand-held computer with enough computing power to
operate the software. But the project has occupied him for evenings
and weekends as he ran, tested and debugged the software through a
contract with the General Electric Co. He is now at the stage that
the product is being marketed for $39.95 on its own website
(http://www.scorepro.com).
</P>
<P>
   He also plans ads in the catalogs that come with certain
hand-held computers. The program runs on hand-held machines with
16-bit processors, a hefty amount for a small machine, as well as
certain Psion devices. At the moment the machine does not run on
the popular Palm Pilot series of pocket organizers, which do not
have enough computing power.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard would not say how much he has invested in Score Pro,
only saying that the figure is substantial. Nor will he say how
much he expects to earn from the project. But he said he is turning
down initial offers of investment capital because he does not want
to give up any equity in the company he has created to own the
software, Sandtrap Software Llc.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not give up his job as executive director of
the Independent Bankers Association of New York State Inc. in
Albany, he said.

LAUGHTER AMID RITUAL IN OLD JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the 300 objects in ``Edo: Art of Japan:
1615-1868'' at the National Gallery of Art, the screens depicting
Japanese festivals are worth a trip to Washington all by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In their scenes of outings and amusements associated with the
festivals, the folding screens show society from top to bottom,
warts and all. Priests, nursing mothers, shopkeepers, street
musicians, fishermen, farmers and gamblers are all gently
caricatured, almost like cartoons. Think Mardi Gras mixed with the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The element of humor and parody really begins here,'' said
Robert Singer, curator of the exhibition, which runs through Feb.
15, and an author of the excellent 480-page catalog, which sells
for $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paintings of shrine festivals served as valued souvenirs for
wealthy travelers, treasured emblems of family origin, or
commodities offered in the negotiation of regional marriages,''
said Singer, the curator of Japanese art at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-panel 17th-century screen at the National Gallery
depicts the annual festival of the Tsushima Shrine in Owari, Japan.
This celebration was held to secure protection against outbreaks of
plague. On the screen, crowds watch on the riverbank as men propel
sacred boats festooned with banners; people laugh at a man who has
fallen overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Festival screens are often remarkably faithful to the key
sites and activities of the particular festival portrayed,'' Singer
writes in the catalog. The screens were ``produced by someone who
observed the two-day event and made meticulous visual notes to
produce such an accurate record.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky collectors can find similar screens, which were generally
made in pairs, for sale in galleries. For example, Naga Antiques at
145 East 61st St. has a pair of six-panel screens from the
mid-1600s of ``Scenes in and Around Kyoto'' by the Tosa school. One
presents a panoramic view of ancient Kyoto dominated by the Nijo
Castle. The other depicts the Gion Festival, another one held as
protection against plagues. There is a delegation of holy men
inspecting the Great Buddha Hall, a horse race and a procession of
dignitaries going to the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, who said he had not seen the Naga screen, explained in
the catalog that a typical Gion screen ``shows a rite that
developed into a ritualized contest in the urban display of wealth,
with neighborhood organizations of the merchant class vying with
each other in the sumptuousness of their decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   The screens are only one example of the art that flourished
during the Edo period, when Japan was essentially closed to
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edo closed the country, so it obliged the Japanese people to
develop their own culture,'' Earl Powell III, the director of the
National Gallery, explained. ``That's why you see such amazing
creativity in the artwork.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 1615 also ushered in a long period of prosperity and
peace, which allowed popular urban culture to flourish. Edo, the
old name for Tokyo, was the New York of its day. In the early
1600s, newly wealthy merchants were busy building houses and
decorating them with textiles, scrolls and screens.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton Longhi, a private dealer in Manhattan, is selling an
anonymous six-fold screen from around 1660 that depicts the
Sumiyoshi Festival, which was held every summer on the shores of
Osaka Bay. This festival honored deities who brought prosperity to
fisherman, travelers, poets and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involved transporting a cart from its permanent resting
place to the shrine precincts,'' Longhi explained. Deities in
palanquins were carried in a procession over an arched trestle
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most beautiful screen in the National Gallery show
is the six-panel Hikone screen, circa 1630, from the Hikone Castle
Museum outside Kyoto. A National Treasure of Japan, it depicts a
``house of pleasure'' with courtesans and their admirers. The
women, men and musicians are silhouetted against a gold-leaf
background. In a garden, a young woman walks her exotic pet dog,
pretending not to notice the foppish samurai warrior nearby. He is
lazily leaning on his sword, perhaps a sign of his uselessness in a
time of peace, admiring a woman who wears a pale blue robe printed
with banana leaves. Her hair is loose. Behind her, a child holds a
sprig of camellias, a symbol of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, denizens of the demimonde play a board game in
front of a screen with a 16th-century-style landscape painting in
sepia. A male client reads verse to a woman. Three musicians play
string instruments. Each character and robe is distinct and
individually portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a good screen, all the faces and costumes should be
different,'' said Longhi. ``Screens reflected what was in vogue at
the time: hairstyles, textiles and fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer said: ``This has become the `Mona Lisa' of Japan.
Everyone reads something different into it. There is a melancholy
and wistfulness for the past that comes through. But even I, who
spent four years trying to borrow this for the show, cannot tell
you exactly what it means and why there's a Chinese landscape scene
in a brothel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other Edo screens resemble cinematic close-ups. Naga has a
$125,000 one showing a red banner hanging from a rope strung
between two trees. On it, the artist has painted a rearing stallion
and a docile mare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese artists had a whimsical sense of humor,'' said Jim
Marinaccio, the owner of Naga. The screen is a trompe l'oeil take
on what one might see if the banner were not there. But the joke is
that there are no horses on the other side. Banners were used to
enclose a space for a very private outdoor picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Liza Hyde, a private dealer in Manhattan who specializes in
flower screens, has a $300,000 pair of large Edo flower-cart
screens, signed and sealed by Ooka Shumboku (1680-1763). Each
portrays a lacquered carriage that holds a basket with a profuse
arrangement of flowers. One represents spring, the other, fall.
Such screens were associated with aristocrats and carried their
crests. The carts are drawn by a band of cherubic children who
probably symbolize the wish for offspring and the continuation of
the family line.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hyde surmises that the screens were used as wedding
decorations. Others say they were used for all kinds of auspicious
occasions. The flower arrangements are easily as elaborate as
anything done today by the New York party impresario Robert
Isabell. Flying Cranes Antiques, at 1050 Second Ave. in Manhattan,
has more affordable screens, like a late-Edo horse race at Kamo
Shrine painted by a Kano school master. This bird's-eye view of
Kyoto, partly obscured by gold clouds, shows courtiers on horseback
racing on a track of golden flakes. Considering the amount of gold,
it almost seems reasonable at $22,500.

`MARILYN MONROE': GIRL-WOMAN: THE INTERIOR MARILYN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During her short lifetime, Marilyn Monroe was hailed, in Groucho
Marx's words, as ``Mae West, Theda Bara and Bo-Peep all rolled into
one.'' She was ``a phenomenon of nature,'' Nunnally Johnson
declared, ``like Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three and a half decades since her death, that legend has
been burnished, deconstructed, transmogrified and commodified. Her
life has not only generated the usual biographies and pop tributes,
but it's also spawned novels, plays, songs, movies, academic
papers, gender studies and at least one opera.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Leaming's uneven new biography attempts to strip away
the accretions of myth that have grown up around the actress to
give us a portrait of Monroe the woman: a deeply troubled and
unstable individual, who never managed to overcome the sense of
abandonment she experienced as a child growing up in a succession
of foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe who emerges from this volume is, at once, vulnerable
and demanding, naive and manipulative, courageous and craven: a
woman capable of putting her own career on the line to stand by her
husband-to-be, Arthur Miller, during his testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, but also capable of cruelly
disparaging his writing to others; a woman who desperately sought
the respect of others yet who repeatedly sabotaged that respect
through her tempestuous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leaming _ the author of biographies of Orson Welles and
Katharine Hepburn _ eschews the sort of controversial stands taken
by earlier Monroe biographers like Anthony Summers who dwelled, in
the best-selling ``Goddess,'' on the mysterious circumstances of
her death and her relationship with Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leaming, in contrast, skims fleetingly over Monroe's
relationships with Kennedy and his brother, President John F.
Kennedy, and writes matter-of-factly about her suicide.
</P>
<P>
   As this book tells it, the central drama in Monroe's life was
her relationship with the playwright Arthur Miller. Ms. Leaming
suggests that Monroe's romance with Miller represented her quest
for dignity and self-esteem and her escape from a tawdry Hollywood
past, while its sad, acrimonious end became a metaphor for the
dissolution of her fondest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In relating this story, Ms. Leaming creates a novelistic
narrative, animated by dramatic set pieces and vivid cameo
portraits. But while this method makes for a highly readable story,
it frequently sidesteps the standards of serious biographical
research.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as an omniscient narrator, Ms. Leaming displays a
troubling penchant for sweeping generalizations without providing
the reader with the sort of detailed footnotes that might back up
such insights into the protagonists' states of mind: she writes in
one chapter, for instance, that Monroe ``would never feel safe in
Arthur's love again,'' after she read entries about herself in his
notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, ``Marilyn Monroe'' suffers from bouts of
melodramatic romance-novel prose (``Marilyn had grown up being told
that she was the embodiment of sin and evil''), what-if speculation
(``And who can say what would have happened to Marilyn's
relationship with Arthur Miller had she gone to Mississippi in
November to shoot `Baby Doll' with Kazan?'') and editorial
assertions that tell the reader exactly what to think and feel.
</P>
<P>
   Of Lee Strasberg, the head of the prestigious Actors Studio and
Monroe's father figure and mentor, Ms. Leaming writes, ``From first
to last, Strasberg was chillingly mercenary.'' While she argues
that the ``fierce possessiveness'' of Joe DiMaggio would ``blight
his relationship with Marilyn,'' she patronizingly adds that ``his
impeccable behavior following Marilyn's death'' allowed him to
finally recapture ``some of the `deft serenity' he once knew on the
baseball field.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller, Ms. Leaming writes that his play ``After the
Fall'' was an ``unctuous exercise in self-justification,'' creating
a fictional portrait of Monroe as ``a shrill, devouring harpy''
while signaling the playwright's own surrender of ``the moral
authority that had sustained him through a decade of artistic
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, in exposing Marilyn as he did,'' she snidely
writes, ``Miller, who had refused to name names, became something
of an `informer' himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Such editorializing seems aimed at underscoring Monroe's own
fears of rejection; it's supposed to create sympathy for Monroe as
a woman, repeatedly taken up and abandoned by men.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the arc of Ms. Leaming's narrative suggests that Monroe's
struggles for self-respect all came to nought: that for all her
efforts to turn herself from a sex symbol into a serious actress
with creative control over her pictures, she ended up in Hollywood
much the way she began.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her failed marriage to Miller, in the wake of her
firing from her last movie, Ms. Leaming writes, she ``seemed to
drift back to a life she'd once worked very hard to escape'' posing
nude for photographers and attending all-night parties reminiscent
of the 1940s party circuit where she'd been treated like chattel by
powerful men.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Leaming's view, the sense of worthlessness bequeathed to
Monroe by her mentally unstable mother (who, the actress claimed,
had tried to smother her in her crib) had become a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy that her psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson,
was unable to head off.
</P>
<P>
   The actual ``triggering event'' for Monroe's suicide, she
argues, ``seems to have been nothing more than her doctor's having
gone to a dinner party with his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier, Marilyn had been frantic at the prospect,'' she
writes. ``By now, it would have become a life-and-death matter, his
absence on a par with all the abandonments she had suffered,
beginning with her father. Perhaps she thought she would punish
Greenson for having left her tonight. Perhaps she thought she could
force him to return. Perhaps she thought that, as others had done,
he'd rescue her before it was too late.''

`YOU'VE GOT MAIL': ROMANCE.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Meg Ryan's character gets the sniffles and retreats from
the world in ``You've Got Mail,'' she puts on pajamas and curls up
in bed with her trusty laptop or a favorite book. Someday, when
this cozy romantic comedy becomes a videocassette, it too will be a
comfort object perfect for such moments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan, Tom Hanks and the archly funny Nora Ephron join
forces, this time much more easily than they did in ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' to make an inviting love story that entangles a man, a
woman, a couple of computers and a New York neighborhood so
picturesquely idealized that it feels like Paris. Even if you
already live on the Upper West Side, you might feel the urge to
move there before the film is over.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of that place, its populace and this precise moment
in our technological evolution are captured so endearingly here
that ``You've Got Mail'' becomes a New York story reminiscent of
early Woody Allen romances, turning the characters into charmingly
neurotic products of the place they call home. And in this setting,
as far as ``You've Got Mail'' is concerned, the most important
landmarks are intimate little hangouts and good old-fashioned
books.
</P>
<P>
   Being firmly on the side of the angels, this film treasures the
written word so proudly that the closing credits thank a long list
of publishing houses. And they really ought to be thanking Ms.
Ephron in return. The film's mix of romance and reading matter is
seductive in its own right, providing comfy book-lined settings and
people who are what they read and write. When they fall in love,
they do it wistfully, as if not quite believing that real life can
measure up to really good fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The most important literary outpourings here are those exchanged
through e-mail, which makes the film that much more amusingly
attuned to its time. The screenplay by Ms. Ephron and her sister,
Delia Ephron, adapts Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 delight, ``The Shop
Around the Corner,'' to the e-mail age with gratifying ingenuity
and with its share of extra observations about how times have
changed. The star-crossed correspondents, who in Lubitsch's film
were employees of the same amazingly gracious retail establishment,
have been promoted to people who run their own businesses. That
makes their stress and loneliness all the more real, to the point
where it's easy to see what drives Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen
Kelly (Ms. Ryan) into the world of cyberflirtation.
</P>
<P>
   By making Kathleen the second-generation owner of a sweet little
bookstore for children (titles on the shelves have clearly been
chosen with loving care) and Joe the tycoon whose megastore may
stomp her out of business, the film gives an additional shrewd
angle to its foolproof old story.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Kathleen and Joe loathe each other in person but
are unwittingly close confidants, electronically sharing their
innermost thoughts. Should this sound merely like a lot of typing,
Ms. Ephron finds plenty of ways to put laptops in bed and otherwise
make e-mail visually interesting, starting with a nifty credit
sequence that turns all New York into the environment for a video
game. In addition, she makes time for shots at the big bookstore as
a place that sells ``cheap books and legal addictive stimulants,''
in the wry words of Hanks' Joe. That's about as nasty as Joe needs
to be under feel-good circumstances like these.
</P>
<P>
   The film wafts through its urban paradise, a litter-free place
full of flowers and friendly passers-by, as it watches Kathleen and
Joe warily circling each other. Complicating matters are a few too
many supporting characters, though many of these get the
screenplay's best lines. (Says Jean Stapleton, as a genteel older
friend of Kathleen's, about an old flame: ``It wasn't meant to be.
He ran Spain.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the film nicely incorporates its minor figures into its
sociological milieu, like the two little children who are among
Joe's next of kin. ``Matt is my father's son,'' he explains.
``Annabel is my grandfather's daughter. We are'' pause ``an
American family.'' Dabney Coleman and John Randolph play the
much-married fathers, and at one point three generations of lonely
male Foxes find themselves luxuriously ensconced on family boats at
the 79th Street Boat Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan plays her role blithely and credibly this time, with an
air of freshness, a minimum of cute fidgeting and a lot of fond
chemistry with Hanks. And he continues to amaze. Once again, he
fully inhabits a new role without any obvious actorly behavior, to
the point where comparisons to James Stewart (who starred with
Margaret Sullavan in the Lubitsch film) really cannot be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has none of Stewart's lanky grace or leading-man
patina, the wonderful Hanks has all the same romantic wistfulness
and the same poignant shyness when he learns who Kathleen really
is. He shares Stewart's lovely way of speaking from the heart.
Hanks also makes fine use of the film's comic opportunities, as in
a scene that has him explaining how ``The Godfather'' resembles the
I Ching as a guide to life. ``What should I take on vacation?'' he
asks rhetorically. Advice from ``The Godfather'' on this question
goes this way: ``Leave the gun, take the cannoli.''
</P>
<P>
   In a film that makes Kathleen's sensibility clear by having her
quote Joni Mitchell, the principals' erstwhile mates are part of
the trenchant local color. Parker Posey plays Joe's girlfriend, a
piranha from the publishing world (``Patricia makes coffee
nervous,'' Joe remarks), and Greg Kinnear plays a writer for The
New York Observer prone to stupefying pronouncements. These
characters are as apt a part of the scenery as Dan Davis' warm,
audience-friendly production design.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' deserves to trigger a revived interest in
the late honey-voiced singer Harry Nilsson, whose music on the
lighthearted soundtrack provides just the right mix of jauntiness
and yearning. Nilsson's beautiful music hasn't figured this
prominently in a film since it turned up in ``Midnight Cowboy,''
used to quite different effect.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tree is a sermon in itself. A big, sturdy oak
with serpentine limbs, it's the first thing the audience sees in
``Parade,'' the solemn, high-reaching new musical directed by
Harold Prince that opened Thursday night at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The oak's branches glow, in sinister abstraction, through a
scrim before a single note is sung, and it will be a dominant
presence throughout the evening, casting a metaphoric shadow that
is both premonitory and admonitory. A man, a good man, will be
hanged from that tree before ``Parade'' is over. It is the image of
a brutally unfair fate awaiting its victim, and we are never, ever
allowed to forget what it signifies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we would have anyway. One thing ``Parade'' cannot be
accused of is fuzziness of focus. Inspired by the story of Leo
Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched in Marietta, Ga., in 1915 for
the murder of a 13-year-old girl, this musical provides a
painstakingly rendered chart of the wheels of injustice. And it
never lets up in its insistence on the innocence, on several
levels, of its protagonist and the moral blindness and corruption
of his persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   That the result is often more podium-thumping screed than
compelling story is in itself a heartbreaker. ``Parade'' prompted
raised eyebrows and arch jokes (have you heard the one about the
dancing lynch mob?) long before it went into previews, and the
involvement of Livent Inc., the financially ailing Canadian-based
theatrical company, as one of its producers only added to the air
of gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Parade'' also represented the possibility of answered
prayers for anxious lovers of the American musical. The genre,
after all, is represented this season in new productions on
Broadway only by the flaccid ``Footloose'' and the revivals of
``Peter Pan'' and ``On the Town,'' and this is by no means an
atypical season.
</P>
<P>
   Here at last was a show of daring aspiration, shaped by a young
composer of talent and invention, Jason Robert Brown, and a
Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright, Alfred Uhry (``Driving Miss
Daisy''). What's more, it was to be overseen by the director who
had done more than any other to extend the boundaries of the
Broadway musical and to confound expectations of what the form's
proper subject matter is.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Nazi party, a portrait of marital disharmony set
in the gloom of a decrepit show palace, the rise of a politician
and his ravenously ambitious wife in Argentina, a homicidal barber
in Victorian London: Prince repeatedly turned ostensibly sour
material into scintillating theater with his fabled productions of
``Cabaret'' (1966), ``Follies'' (1971), ``Evita'' (1978) and
``Sweeney Todd'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1993, he was still breathing hit-making musical
life into unlikely themes with ``The Kiss of the Spider Woman,''
the Kander-Ebb show about South American political prisoners that
joltingly juxtaposed cinematic fantasy sequences with scenes of
barbaric torture. Given this context, is ``Parade'' really such a
stretch, especially given the participation of its star, Brent
Carver, who appeared to such resonant effect in ``Spider Woman''?
</P>
<P>
   That Carver, through no fault of his own, is a far less
compelling presence here says much about what has gone wrong with
``Parade.'' As the gay, escapist story spinner forced into
political engagement in ``Spider Woman,'' this first-rate actor
guided his audiences through the labyrinth of one man's very
conflicted interior. The role of Leo Frank in ``Parade'' offers him
no such opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The character, a Jewish scapegoat in a blood-lusting Southern
society, is a martyr, pure and simple, a man whose worst crimes are
emotional reserve and fastidiousness. Carver renders these traits,
in both his singing and acting, with delicacy. But there's no
getting beyond the impression that his Leo is as flat and iconic as
a bleeding saint in a religious mural.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Carolee Carmello, who gives a stirringly
heartfelt performance as Leo's wife, Lucille, all of the actors in
``Parade'' appear claustrophobicly trapped in that mural. It is
sometimes hard to distinguish them from the two-dimensional cutout
figures used to fill out the crowd scenes in Riccardo Hernandez's
visually arresting but oddly distancing set, in which only vistas
of picturesque landscapes give off any warmth at all.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondingly, Brown's songs, while artfully shading classic
hymn and march forms with dark dissonance, also keep you at an
intellectual remove. He has a tendency to use martial drumbeats and
knell-like chords to underscore his melody lines, and the devices
give the effect of someone continually whispering in your ear:
``Look at what these people are doing to a blameless man. Just
look.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved with the creation of ``Parade,'' which
has been incubating for six years, have said that its real center
is the love story of the Franks, partners in a sterile arranged
marriage who finally fall in love during Leo's trial and
imprisonment. Yet in the performance, the balance of the show is
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's first act is devoted almost entirely to the
mechanics of framing Frank and the agitating of popular sentiment
against a social outsider by a yellow press. As a jaded journalist,
played by Evan Papas, sings, shortly after Leo's arrest, ``Take a
superstitious city and a little Jew from Brooklyn with a college
education and a mousy little wife.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the recipe, all right. From the beginning, both Uhry's
book and Brown's lyrics baldly set up Frank's status as an alien,
with references to his disdain for Southern cooking and tendency,
as a song lyric puts it, to say ``shalom'' instead of ``howdy.''
When Mary Phagan (the appealing Christy Carlson Romano), a teen-age
worker in the National Pencil Factory where Frank is a
superintendent, is found murdered in the factory's basement, the
police immediately fix an accusatory gaze on the exotic Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a streamlined railroading process of the sort that
has become common fodder for socially sensitive television movies
of the week. The expediency of pinning the crime on Leo is
established through a series of scenes in which blatantly corrupt
politicians say things like: ``You got a lousy conviction record,
Hughie. How long you think they're going to keep you in office if
you let this one off the hook?''
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Atlanta grow ever louder in their cries for
vengeance, goaded by a satanic newspaper publisher, Tom Watson
(John Leslie Wolfe), who is given to statements like ``Jesus was
not a Jew.'' An ambitious prosecuting attorney, Hugh Dorsey
(Herndon Lackey), is seen cutting a deal with a black factory
janitor with a prison record (Jim Conley, who brings some flair and
fire to the proceedings) to testify against Frank.
</P>
<P>
   When three young female factory employees show up in court to
speak of Frank's lascivious behavior toward them, you have no doubt
that they have been coached to lie, despite an all-too-brief
fantasy interlude in which Frank becomes the leering, worldly
figure of their testimony. (The vignette provides what is by far
the best work of Carver and the choreographer Patricia Birch in the
show.) As Lucille sings passionately to a reporter: ``He is a
decent man! He is an honest man!''
</P>
<P>
   As any number of Alfred Hitchcock movies confirm, ``wrong man''
plots, even rudimentary ones, can generate alarming levels of
suspense. But to do so, they have either to admit you, Kafka-style,
into the baffled, frightened mind of the persecuted or to sweep you
up into the frenzy of the persecutors, making you feel vicariously
implicated. That was the strategy of ``They Won't Forget,'' the
1937 Mervyn LeRoy film inspired by the same events.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Prince and Ms. Birch use the ensemble to create
tableaux of tidal waves of crowds, in ways that recall the mob
scenes in ``Evita,'' you never escape an overriding feeling of
disdain, a chilly indignation. Nor is Leo ever allowed to doubt
himself, to wonder (as most of us surely would) if he had somehow
gone mad. The shy Lucille is clearly tortured by the public
scrutiny of herself and her husband, but she also never seems to
wonder if her husband might indeed be guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmello nonetheless creates a vital and affecting portrait
of a sheltered woman thrust out into a harsh and dangerous world.
Made up and dressed to look a bit like Eleanor Roosevelt (the
period-appropriate costumes are by Judith Dolan), the actress' very
accent and vocal inflections bespeak both a heritage of Southern
Jewish gentility and a fluttery primness that never quite conceals
a yearning for a more fully lived life.
</P>
<P>
   The second act is mostly hers, as Lucille convinces Georgia's
governor, John Slaton (John Hickok), to reopen her husband's case.
Though much of what follows has the feeling of a historical
detective story, there is something infinitely touching about the
valiant hope that Ms. Carmello projects. In her climactic love
duet, during a conjugal visit to Leo in prison just before his
abduction and murder by a mob symbolically commanded by a
Confederate Civil War veteran, you suddenly feel you've been given
emotional entry to a show that has determinedly kept you outside of
it.
</P>
<P>
   That moment arrives too late. The death of Leo Frank may be an
unlikely subject for a musical, but that is not what sabotages
``Parade.'' Musicals can be grim and even grotesque as long as they
let you feel their heartbeat, the pulse that animates the behavior
onstage. You need only think of ``Sweeney Todd,'' which drew its
audience into improbable identification with its crazed, murderous
title character.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the odds are comparatively in favor of
``Parade.'' It arrives with an innately sympathetic hero,
undoubtedly worthy of our tears. But for those tears to flow, we
have to get to know Leo Frank as a man, not a symbol. The civics
lesson that is ``Parade'' forbids our ever approaching such
knowledge.

   RAMADAN HOLIEST PERIOD OF FASTING, PRAYER FOR MUSLIMS
   With US-IRAQ-1218.
   By NICHOLE MONROE 
   c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the new moon appears -- most likely on Sunday
-- about 120 million Muslims worldwide will observe the holy month
of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   The most holy time of the year for Muslims, the monthlong
Ramadan requires fasting, prayer and goodwill to the poor. The
purpose is to develop discipline, restraint and a closer
relationship with Allah, or God.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British forces launched massive air strikes on Iraqi
military and communications sites late Wednesday, and the strikes
continued during the night Thursday. Though President Clinton said
when the strikes began Wednesday that his administration decided
not to initiate attacks on Iraq during the Islamic holy month, he
has still met criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite compassionate of him that he is considerate to the
feelings of Muslims, but it is very unfortunate that he would take
lightly killing people while respecting the holy days,'' said
Shaker Elsayed, secretary general of the Muslim American Society, a
nonprofit, charitable organization based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the month of Ramadan, Muslims forgo all food and drink
from dawn to sunset, according to literature from the American
Muslim Council, a political activist organization based in
Washington. Sexual relations during daylight hours is prohibited,
and honorable behavior is expected. Muslims also are obligated to
give a financial donation to the poor, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended daily routine of Muslims during Ramadan includes a
modest meal before dawn, morning prayers, possibly a brief nap in
the late afternoon, sunset prayers and a complete meal.
</P>
<P>
   After the meal, families often go to their places of worship for
evening prayers before returning home at about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. national security officials said Thursday that no
``artificial deadline'' would be set for the attacks on Iraq, but
some critics are saying it would be foolish to continue bombing
through Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, director of the American Muslim Council, said if
the attacks continue through Ramadan, Clinton will continue to
receive disapproval from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   Elsayed agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be outrageous that while Muslims are fasting and
preparing for the holy month, bombs would be falling over their
heads,'' Elsayed said. ``If you can imagine someone bombing the
United States during Thanksgiving dinner, it would be similar.''

   WACO'S EDWARDS TO VOTE AGAINST IMPEACHMENT
   585 words
   By EUNICE MOSCOSO
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an impeachment vote fast approaching and U.S.
bombs falling on Iraq, Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, said Thursday he
will vote against impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what the president did was indefensible and immoral,
but I do not think his actions, however wrong, reached the high
constitutional threshold for impeachment,'' the Waco representative
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards added he would support a ``bipartisan congressional
censure'' and that future criminal action against the president
``would be appropriate punishment for his affair and subsequent
misleading statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders decided Thursday to begin the impeachment
debate Friday on the House floor and finish action on the four
articles of impeachment against Clinton by Saturday, even if U.S.
attacks against Iraq are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards delivered harsh words Thursday against Republicans who
publicly questioned the timing of U.S. military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of unsubstantiated, personal attack against our
president at a time when brave American pilots and armed forces are
in harm's way is wrong. It is irresponsible. It does harm to the
morale of our forces in the Persian Gulf,'' he said, on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and other GOP lawmakers suggested
Wednesday the president had ordered the Iraqi attack to divert
attention from the looming impeachment vote, which originally had
been scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the criticism hit more people than just Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge some of my colleagues to reconsider their ill-advised
comments from last night,'' Edwards said. ``An attack on the
integrity of this operation is in fact an attack on the integrity
of our joint chiefs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Edwards quoted Defense Secretary William Cohen, a
Republican, who said Wednesday he was prepared to place 30 years of
public service on the line to say the motivation was not political.
</P>
<P>
   After Edwards concluded his statement, Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston, R-La., responded to it and others made by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he ``must remind all members that although it's
permissible to debate and speak critically of the president or the
administration on matters of policy or politics, remarks and debate
may not descend to personality by arraigning the president's
personal conduct or by charging other members with having done so
off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he agreed with the first part of Livingston's
statement about not allowing personal attacks against the president
but added that it was ``a real stretch'' for Livingston to say a
member didn't have the right to speak out against other members'
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That logic would suggest that if Joseph McCarthy could accuse
the president of being a communist, that no member of the House
would have a right to come to this body and say that that is an
irresponsible attack on the integrity of the presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot even imagine that the free speech rights of members
of the House could be limited in that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the comments from Livingston, Edwards said he respected
the speaker-elect and that he believes Livingston will have a much
more bipartisan approach than his predecessor, Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he would continue to speak out against unfounded
accusations about the timing of U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of statements need to stop, and they need to stop
today,'' he said. ``I stand by my statement.''

   Mini reviews of current movies
   By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the same artists are involved, this sequel to
``Babe'' loses its way in the big city, turning the noble piglet
into little more than a supporting player. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celebration'' R (profanity, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ulrich Thomsen, Henning Moritzen, Thomas Bo Larsen,
Paprika Steen.
</P>
<P>
   At the gala 60th birthday party of his father, a young man
(Ulrich Thomsen) reveals a dark family secret in this Danish long
day's journey into night. A mix of old-fashioned theatrics, pop
psychology and cinema verite filmmaking, it's a wonderfully
compelling melodrama. 1 hour, 45 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''
</P>
<P>
   44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated, but contains sexual themes and
brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant reimagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center.1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' Unrated (plot contains pedophilia)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly
comic look at several citizens of New Jersey whose lives are
defined by sexuality. Director Todd Solondz says he prefers the
expression ``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is
about as dark as they come.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 14 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Catherine O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-fried hokum about an unwed mom-to-be (Drew Barrymore) and
the stepsons (Luke Wilson and Jake Busey) of her late boyfriend.
One wants to kill her, the other wants to kiss her. A mix of
Hollywood blandness and small-town condescension, the movie can't
decide if it's a romance or a farce. But Catherine O'Hara chews the
scenery nicely as the boys' vengeful mom. 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' PG (profanity, rude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college kid who has to hitch his
way home to New York in time for Christmas Eve. If he's late, he'll
lose the Porsche his dad has promised. This Disney comedy has some
clever moments as Thomas, a scam artist, has to learn the meaning
of family. But it aims too often for the far-fetched. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. We're not making this
up. The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of
those stale Hollywood sermons about taking time out for your kids.
It's less substantial than a snowball in July. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer: Ringmaster'' R (profanity, sex, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   If you like ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' you'll probably
appreciate this rude and crude look at putting on an outrageous
daytime talk show _ here dubbed ``The Jerry Show.'' Follow two
groups _ including a mother and daughter sleeping with the same man
_ as they angle to get on ``Jerry,'' then sit back and watch the
fights break out.
</P>
<P>
   1hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' R (profanity, drug use, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah.
</P>
<P>
   A suddenly single fortysomething (Holly Hunter) leaves her tony
Upper East Side co-op and ventures into new territory, an
cross-town jazz bar, where she becomes friends with the resident
torch singer (Queen Latifah), and has a ``kinda'' relationship with
her building's elevator operator (Danny DeVito). The tone is
bittersweet, the story unresolved, but the performances are fresh
and funny.1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper.2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Ozona'' R (profanity, nudity, violence, gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert Forster, David Paymer, Taj Mahal and Meat Loaf.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in this story about a band of strangers are as
superficial as the blue eye shadow and pink lipstick that star
Penelope Ann Miller has to wear. The writing never rises above
homespun philosophizing, such as ``Sometimes you're the windshield,
and sometimes you're the bug.'' Watching this, you'll sympathize
with the bug. At Phipps Plaza. 1 hour, 38 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n' roll
to the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential. 1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' R (violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock classic. It's very
well made and acted, with a terrific performance by Vince Vaughn as
Norman Bates. But it's an odd cinematic experiment that never seems
to know exactly what it intended to prove.1 hour, 38 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Kung fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. Chan and Tucker learn to work together, in part by
imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one works.1 hour, 37
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' R (violence, profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche.1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but simple. It's a
character-driven black comedy with some powerful moral-qualm
undercurrents. In the deep snows of rural Minnesota, two brothers
(Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a
downed plane with $4 million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to
split the money leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events.
Expertly played by the ensemble cast.1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew saves an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal its juju. The movie is full of jokes
and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed for
Trekkers who need an update on their intergalactic family album.1
hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' R (profanity, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   When a stag party goes murderously out of control, the
groom-to-be and his pals (Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern
and Christian Slater) go to great lengths to cover their tracks.
Even if it means killing a bunch of people, or each other. This
pitch-black comedy from Peter Berg is the sort of sick-joke
experience you'll tend to love or hate.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village (population 52) when it's discovered that one of the
residents is the holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7
million. The movie is a little too eager to please, a little too
Lucky Charms Irish. But the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian
Bannen and David Kelly, are practiced charmers, and there are lots
of winning little moments along the way. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
write for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

   It's tough taking on a 1940s classic loved by all, but Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan are up to the task
   By Steve Murray
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of seemingly sure-thing movies that tanked _ think
``Meet Joe Black'' and the ``Babe'' sequel _ you can't take
anything for granted in Hollywood. You might even fear the worst
from the can't-miss reunion of the ``Sleepless in Seattle'' team,
re-creating a classic film. But you can stop holding your breath.
``You've Got Mail'' delivers.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Ernst Lubitsch's beloved 1940 film ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' hits the Internet age, giving director and co-writer Nora
Ephron a chance to reunite Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in a story ideal
for their charms.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks plays Joe Fox, scion of a book-chain business that's
inexorably wiping out mom-and-pop shops. Such as the one owned by
Kathleen Kelly (Ryan), a children's book nook called, yes, the Shop
Around the Corner.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of her mother, now deceased, the store represents the
human touch that seems nearly extinct in today's corporate,
electronic landscape. But here's an irony: Even though she's
suspicious of the cultural globalization represented by the
computer, Kathleen gets her biggest kicks online. She's carrying on
a romantic e-mail correspondence with a man she knows only as
``dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you haven't seen Lubitsch's movie or the two musical
versions of the story (``In the Good Old Summertime'' onscreen and
``She Loves Me'' onstage), you can probably guess the rest. Yep _
unbeknownst to either party, Joe and Kathleen, who openly spar over
the buffet table at West Side parties, are each other's electronic
sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   The movie further complicates things by giving our leads
significant others. Kathleen's neo-Luddite boyfriend, Frank (Greg
Kinnear), is a newspaper columnist so opposed to technology that he
writes on a peculiar machine called a typewriter. Joe's editor
girlfriend, Patricia (Parker Posey), is so high-strung that, as he
puts it, she makes coffee nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They're both broadly drawn enough to pose no threat to the
central romance. Besides, Joe and Kathleen are their own biggest
obstacles, battling ever more fiercely in the real world while
their online attraction deepens.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's update to the Internet era is more than just a
logical change. There's something about the disembodied nature of
chat rooms and e-mail that contains both anticipation and
loneliness. And while ``Mail'' (written by Ephron and her sister
Delia) ignores some of the darker edges in ``Shop Around the
Corner,'' Hanks and Ryan make their characters' search for love
delicate and real.
</P>
<P>
   The Ephrons give us a glossy, storybook Manhattan of clean
streets and cozy, well-decorated apartments. The lively supporting
cast includes Steve Zahn, the stoned crook from ``Out of Sight,''
and Jean Stapleton as Kathleen's employees. Kinnear is pleasant in
a two-dimensional part, while the manic Posey has too little to do
but steals every scene she's in.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan threatens to go into overkill on cuteness, hopping around
her apartment in her pajamas at the movie's beginning. But she
calms down and delivers a lovely, modulated performance _ even if
she's not Margaret Sullavan, who did the role for Lubitsch. It also
helps that Ryan has Hanks to play off of. With every new movie,
through his charm and his range, Hanks continues to prove that he
really is
</P>
<P>
   our best replacement for Jimmy Stewart _ who, by the way,
starred in ``The Shop Around the Corner.''

   MTV special proves 'twas a hip-hop year
   By Phil Kloer
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Barbara Walters counts down her ``10 Most Fascinating
People of 1998'' on Tuesday night, you can bet she'll be
hard-pressed to get a mention in of the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z,
Marilyn Manson or Courtney Love. For those, you'll have to turn to
``Ultra Sound: Year in Rock '98'' (4 p.m. E.S.T. Saturday on MTV),
the music channel's annual retrospective of those who try so hard
not to be retro.
</P>
<P>
   As the special points out, 1998 wasn't much of a year for rock.
Albums by Pearl Jam and Smashing Pumpkins didn't live up to sales
expectations; the aforementioned Manson and Love's band Hole
debuted well but soon went south, even if ``Celebrity Skin'' had
maybe the greatest hook of the year. But they have a little fun
with the idea of interchangeable one-hit wonders, going to a
Matchbox 20 concert and asking fans if they can name even one
member of the band. They can't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a hip-hop year, with MTV paying the most
attention to Lauryn Hill, Jay-Z, DMX, Master P and the Beasties.
(It would have been cool if they could have spared a few seconds
for Outkast.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a segment on boy bands, those quintets like Backstreet
Boys and 'N Sync known for their shaved chests, step dancing and
squealing teeny-fans, and one on Mariah Carey, who's interviewed
lounging on a couch, her hair spread out behind her in an effect
that must have taken hours to capture, saying she leads a ``boring
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra, who hated rock, gets a passing mention for his
death, which is more than he would have wanted in a special like
this.
</P>
<P>
   And it all winds down, as the year itself does, with the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, with video clips played while Offspring
sings its signature line: ``And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly
for a white guy.''
</P>

TELL KIDS THE TRUTH ABOUT SEX AND VALUES 
 FOR USE FRI., DEC. 18 OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: With the headlines from Washington being what they
are, how do you explain to young kids issues about sex? I didn't
think I would have to tell them for years!
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The basic rule in talking to kids about sex is to be
honest and straightforward. Answer the questions that are asked and
not the ones that you assume they'll want to know. Kids should know
about sex from very early on, not because they need the information
but because you'll get the practice of being honest and
straightforward about a subject that is difficult for all of us to
talk about. The earlier you start telling them about the basics,
the easier it will be for you when they really need the
information. Don't assume it's EVER too early and when it comes to
headlines, you can just explain in a straightforward manner not
only about sex but about your value system, understanding they will
evolve their own.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: What do you do about ``difficult'' people at work?
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Realistically we all know that some people are more
difficult to get along with than others because we clash in style,
because they don't do what we want them to do, because they remind
us of our mother or our father. The first thing NOT to do is to
define them as difficult, as your enemy, as the bane of your
existence Once you define someone as ``difficult,'' you have given
them an enormous amount of power. See if you can problem-solve
instead of label. See if you can say, for example, ``Listen, if you
can tell me what would make you happier, I would be glad to do it''
rather then telling an audience how difficult the person is.
Complaining will just convince you that the person has more power
than you do.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Monday, Monday, why do I always have the Monday
morning blues and is there anything I can do about them?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. JOY: Before you decide that's what everybody has, let's take
a look at your lifestyle. Are you changing your sleep patterns over
the weekend. It may be that you are catching up on sleep by
sleeping late. Then when Monday morning comes and you have to get
up at the usual time, your mind is saying ``Oh, no!'' as your body
is following suit. So see if you can't take naps over the weekend
rather than sleeping in.
</P>
<P>
   Second, are you over imbibing over the weekend? That Monday
morning blahs may be a simple hangover. OK, I know I sound like
your Aunt Matilda, but you know what I'm saying.
</P>
<P>
   Third, make sure your work isn't just so stressful for you that
you just dread going into work. Monday morning can be just another
day of the week. It's never going to be like Friday, but at least
you can get rid of some of those blahs.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: You wrote the book ``Dating for Dummies,'' so how do
you find the perfect date?
</P>
<P>
   DR.JOY: Don't look for ``the perfect date,'' because then you'd
be looking for ``the perfect date 2'' and then where are you? Most
of us aren't perfect. The first thing to do when you're starting
dating is making sure that you're not particularly needy. It's not
appropriate to use another person as the Spackle and the plaster of
your life. What you want to do is be your best, most self-assured,
most you-ish self. Then if you meet somebody, terrific. And if you
don't meet somebody, then hey! your life is working very well on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that this is Noah's Ark and you have to have somebody
of the opposite sex or you're going to drown because a storm is
coming is just not accurate. The weather forecast isn't all that
bad. You can learn to swim, you can buy a boat or you can float.
The point is that before you start looking for someone in your life
make sure there already is a special someone in your life. And that
special someone is Y-O-U.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Hi, Dr. Browne! I want this girl to notice me but how
should I approach her. She does not know me. I don't know her. I
see her in my grandmother's apartment building Do you have any
ideas that would help me?
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The way to make contact with anybody at any age is
first of all through the eyeballs. Look them in the eye, SMILE.
That's all you have to do to begin with. What you want to do is
neither be frightened by the experience or frighten the other
person. As people get to know you, as they see you, as you look
familiar and non-threatening, they will open themselves up a little
more to you.
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience, young or old, dating or not dating, is
just a little bit of discovery. Smile and if she smiles back and
makes eye contact, then you can move on that important subject the
weather.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The spirit of Christmas resides in Brooklyn, at 7823
12th Ave. in Dyker Heights. There, in a four-bedroom brick row
house, Peter and Janet Marcolini have hung, strung and sprung a
dazzling array of decorations for a quarter century, each year
noticeably more than the year before. They may be running out of
space, but they will never run out of heart.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they have transformed their house into a wild,
psychedelic eruption of seasonal sensation _ an electrical
exclamation of elves, Santas, reindeer and, of course, a prominent
manger scene, although one in which, on the night I saw it, Mary's
light had just burned out. Hope, children and all the other
Christmas verities are the Marcolinis' touchstone. Why else would
they have felt the need for a baby when their two children were
approaching the age of leaving home?
</P>
<P>
   But they did feel the need, and so 5-year-old Jessica was
strolling the family's personal winter wonderland in pajamas and
overcoat, smiling and pointing out the marvels that her parents,
one a mozzarella and salami salesman and the other a full-time
homemaker, had labored more than two months to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love Christmas,'' Jessica said.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Danny and I found the Marcolinis on our recent prowl
for the spirit of the season, the latest in our periodic silly
walks. We favor themes. During one stroll we walked 27 miles around
the edge of Manhattan, enduring both 98-degree heat and a
three-hour rainstorm. We circled Staten Island, in search of the
borough's soul, finding it in the perfect calzone. And we walked
the length of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, managing to get lost on
a straight boulevard with numbered cross streets.
</P>
<P>
   We came to southern Brooklyn, where Danny grew up in northern
Bay Ridge, on a less directed, considerably more spiritual mission.
Hereabouts is supposed to be the city's most ostentatious Christmas
finery _ though some connoisseurs prefer Howard Beach in Queens,
and Brooklyn's Mill Basin _ with attractions like 40-foot
Nutcrackers with moving arms, the closest stuff to what's displayed
in suburban Florida, Texas and other citadels of Christmas
decoration. Whole streets glow like diamonds. Outside of sputtering
air-conditioners on a hot August afternoon, Dyker Heights at
holiday time is surely Con Ed's warmest heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   Danny, too, really, really loves Christmas. I was willing to be
persuaded. So he told me his youthful memories of seeing trees
planted in wooden milk containers and listening to Lionel Barrymore
perform ``A Christmas Carol'' on the radio. He says that in Dyker
Heights, Christmas is the kind of day when you could have had two
legs amputated the day before and still feel pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not be good for walking, which has become Danny's
main thing. He is diabetic, and long saunters, 10 miles or more
regularly, help keep his insulin intake down. He also enjoys the
activity, though he suggests that might be a genetic defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insanity doesn't run in my family,'' Danny says. ``It walks.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Daniel Anthony Perasa is indisputably crazy about
holidays. He dyes his beard green for St. Patrick's Day, wears a
diaper and a sash on New Year's Eve, and likes to dress up as Santa
for Christmas in July celebrations. He loves to tell how he asked
his wife, Annie, to marry him on the same day he met her, and she
immediately said yes. He is always saying how much he loves her.
</P>
<P>
   His second-best story is about the doctor who delivered him on
Oct. 9, 1938, and who predicted that the weak baby would live no
more than five years. As it happened, Dr. Nicholas died on Oct. 9,
1943, the very day Danny was not supposed to live to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first funeral,'' Danny says, chortling.``I enjoyed
it immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   We meet at the 86th Street subway stop on the R Fourth Avenue
line. Danny, who is wearing a battered leather jacket, has the day
off from his job taking telephone bets at OTB. His opening remark
is that he has just seen two nuns jaywalking, and is contemplating
whether that constitutes a venal sin. He says he is happy about the
chilly rain that is beginning to fall, because the heretofore
unseasonably fine weather had threatened to provoke his Florida
relatives to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need Christmas on a nice day,'' Danny declares.
``This is the kind of day you need Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   We lumber squishily down 86th Street and turn left on 11th
Avenue. We had heard that the epicenter of Christmas in Dyker
Heights was on 83rd and 84th Streets roughly between 11th and 13th
Avenues, so we head in that direction. Dyker Heights is a small
neighborhood of cozy row houses, million-dollar mansions and a few
apartment buildings. Once Scandinavians predominated, then
Italians, who still do. In the rush to suburbia, this wasn't a
section of the city that people left. New groups, from Russians to
Arabs, are gradually coming in, and free space remains dear indeed.
</P>
<P>
   We trundle down 83rd Street in the fading light. We admire a
lawnful of dolls from around the world. Nicole Dofrio, a
13-year-old eighth grader, approaches us. We ask her if her family
has any outside decorations. Mommy is still ``browsing,'' she says.
So what does she think of her neighborhood's vaunted Yuletide
displays?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are usually snobby, noisy and only care about
themselves,'' she says sweetly. ``I think they only put up good
decorations because they're rich.''
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter block later, Danny has put that comment in
perspective. ``Christmas decorations don't mean the guy inside the
house isn't a grouch,'' he says. ``It just means he went to the
trouble to tell the world he's not a grouch.''
</P>
<P>
   We begin to notice a curious but persistent characteristic. Most
lawns contain a mix of religious and secular symbols, usually with
as much separation between the two as the often limited space
allows. In the creche scenes, the star of the show, Baby Jesus, is
uniformly absent. We later learn that he is placed in mangers at
the peak moment, at midnight on Christmas Eve. But the mix of
images is strange, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the impression the Blessed Virgin is going to switch
seats and end up behind Rudolph,'' Danny says.

 NEW YORK: Danny says.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waiting for true darkness, we find ourselves on 13th Avenue, a
commercial street where some of the signs on stores are in Italian.
At B&AMP;A Pork Store at 7813, neon signs have been placed in the
window, in front of massive logs of dangling provolone, depicting a
bowed wreath and wishing one and all a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year. Another butcher shop urges people to order baby lambs and
baby goats for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   On 84th Street between 13th and 14th Avenues, reindeer are
dramatically mounted on a light wire, literally spilling over the
street. Many homes play music on loudspeakers. We often hear Nat
King Cole singing ``The Christmas Song,'' an absolutely wonderful
tune. Stone figures of lions, which grace the entrances to grander
homes, often wear garlands and lights. In the view down some
streets, white lights coalesce in a shimmering vision of the North
Pole. Sometimes, we pass a little house where a single window is
framed by colored lights.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel is 84th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues,
with huge revolving displays. But a smaller one makes what some
would consider the biggest statement. At 1158, the owner has put
some tasteful ribbons on evergreens, set up two wooden deer and
built a little wall of white branches. No lights. There is a small
sign, partly obscured by evergreens. It says: ``Jesus is the reason
for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the block, a huge house shows the complete story of Dickens'
``Christmas Carol,'' with bigger than life-size figures on the
ground, suspended in the air and whirling about. It is truly
spectacular. A sign says: ``God bless everyone. The Cabo family.''
</P>
<P>
   The display draws a continuing audience. Paula Apesa, who lives
in nearby Bensonhurst, drives by with her children, Vincent, 8, and
Samantha, 6. ``They make me drive by every day,'' she says. ``They
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men who grew up in the neighborhood and still live there
stop by, as they say they often do. ``This is a Brooklyn thing,''
says Henry Ruiz, 21, a stockbroker on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few weeks before Christmas, we see cars with license
plates from California, Oregon and Texas, cruising by to check out
the displays. As Christmas approaches, many families post Santas
outside their houses, many of them giving away candy or other
gifts. There will be brass bands and costumed characters meandering
through the neighborhood. Tour buses of senior citizens, groups of
Hasidic Jews and cars with families will line up for blocks, some
waiting for hours to see the show.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Robert Brenton, a 19-year-old business student at Hunter
College. He says that the ostentatious displays surely reflect the
neighborhood's wealth, but that there is more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way most of the world is now, it's just a real good
thing to see a traditional Christmas,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   We stop a few houses away to talk to Frank and Lydia Nola, who
have made their small grounds an electric reindeer farm. We ask why
their display, like so many others, relies mainly on white light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do it all in color, but now we do it all in
white,'' she said. ``Not so bright. More light.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nola volunteers, ``We need another deer, but they're not so
easy to find.''
</P>
<P>
   We continue to walk. Danny tells about the time his sister's
wreath was stolen from her front door in Bay Ridge and the next
day, someone knocked on the door to sell her the same wreath. Over
at 1224, where a glowing deer appears to drink from a real
fountain, Joe Deturo, an off-duty police officer, stops with his
year-old son to admire the sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish a lot more people would do something like this,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Nella Comisi happens to come out of her house, and we ask her
about the display in front of it. She says her brother Rocco has
spent years building it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yells and yells when the lights don't work, but every year,
he buys more and more.'' She also says what we suspect: that
competition is not unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``One neighbor does it, then the next does,'' she says. ``I
think they try to keep up with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comisi's father has come out of the house to see what's
going on. Danny asks him what he thinks. His daughter translates
the question into Italian. He listens to the translation, then
appears to search for a word. Finally, he smiles from ear to ear.
``Bellissimo,'' he says
</P>
<P>
   Several people have told us about a wonderful ``Nutcracker''
display on 84th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues. All the
characters in the story are dramatically and enormously depicted in
a design that works off the tall pillars in front of the mansion.
We go to the house, ring the bell and Florence Polizzotto answers
the door.
</P>
<P>
   She says her husband, Alfred, a local lawyer, had cancer 10
years ago and wanted to express his love of life after recovering.
He hired designers to come up with the display, but wouldn't tell
her what it cost. She also says they plan to give away 5,000
presents to children this year, as they did last year. And she says
they are collecting donations for the Make a Wish Foundation. She
says that in one instance children suffering from cancer came to
their home in their wheelchairs to say thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, she says, there may be something completely new.
``There's going to be a tremendous change,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   We happen upon the Marcolinis' home next. They tell us that in
addition to the 40 moving sculptures in the window, they have 30
more in reserve. They rotate them each year. They say that they
also do big electrical displays for Halloween and Easter, but that
these pale before what they do for Christmas, their favorite
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, they say, when Marcolini's sister passed away,
they didn't put up their decorations. Hundreds of people knocked on
the door to ask what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcolinis know their house does not blow people away like
the ``Nutcracker,'' ``Christmas Carol'' or other newer displays
people have paid experts to install in recent years. ``Now my house
is like nothing,'' Mrs. Marcolini says, almost as if she believed
it. ``But it's not a competition, and my house is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   They say their whole crazy Christmas adventure began when
somebody gave them a seven-foot-high electric Santa. They felt they
had to do something with it, and one thing kind of led to another.
</P>
<P>
   Danny and I like that story. We say goodbye and begin to whistle
as we stroll toward Christmas. Magically, the rain changes to snow,
and the tinkling of sleigh bells can be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, all right. I made up the snow.

</P>
<P>
   Moderate snow spread across parts of the Canadian province of
Manitoba on Thursday ahead of a streaking low-pressure system
diving southeast from Alberta into Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, this ``Alberta clipper'' will forge into the Great
Lakes region, bringing a stripe of moderate snow to parts of
northeast North Dakota, northern Minnesota and northern Michigan.
Two to 5 inches of snow are possible. Accumulations could be
locally heavy, mainly in northeast Minnesota, where easterly winds
off Lake Superior inject additional moisture. Ultimately, snowfalls
will be limited by the system's fast movement.
</P>
<P>
   The coldest arctic air mass of the season will forge southward
into the northern Rockies and northern high Plains in the wake of
the Alberta clipper, accompanied by snow showers and flurries.
Steadier snows will develop along east-facing slopes of the
mountains, where easterly winds rise up the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, arctic air will spill over the Rockies into
Washington and Oregon, driven westward by a very strong
high-pressure system over the Yukon. The central barometric
pressure of the high will register more than 31.60 inches of
mercury, setting the stage for arctic air to gradually spill
westward over the Cascades toward the Pacific Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   The sluggish upper-level low that spawned thunderstorms over
southern Arizona on Thursday will be dislodged and sent eastward
into Texas, raising the chance of moderate rains, some with
thunder. Rain will later move into Louisiana and parts of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Death Valley Days
</P>
<P>
   At least two dozen times each year, Death Valley, Calif., is the
hottest place in the nation. On Wednesday, it made that claim again
as the mercury soared to 88 degrees, establishing a new record for
the day and the month. The long nights of early winter, nearly 14
hours, allow the desert air to lose much of the warmth it gains on
a sunny December day. Death Valley typically takes a distant second
to the hot spots around Los Angeles when the Santa Ana winds
descend and heat the air at the coast. However, strong winds
descending the nearby Spring Mountains added to the desert warmth.

   FBC-COACHES _ Former Georgia assistant Chris Scelfo faces an
uneviable task as he prepares for his first game as Tulane's coach
_ he doesn't have much of a staff to work with. Many of the former
assistants under former coach Tommy Bowden have joined their boss
at Clemson, leaving Scelfo with a small staff to prepare for the
Liberty Bowl in two weeks. Florida will face Syracuse in the Orange
Bowl without its offensive and defensive coordinator while
Tennessee will meet Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl without its
offensive coordinator after David Cutcliffe left to become the
coach at Ole Miss. At Ole Miss, Cutcliffe won't have much of a
staff to work with as many of the former assistants followed Tommy
Tuberville to Auburn. How are teams preparing for bowls with
limited staff? (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GASOUTHERN _ For most of his career at Georgia Southern,
Earthwind Moreland has received more notoriety for his first name
than his play on the field. But he is one of the primary reasons
that the Eagles will be playing for the Division I-AA national
championship Saturday against Massachusetts. The former walk-on is
the team's top defensive back and one of the leaders of a defense
which figures to be tested against the Minutemen. If the Eagles are
to be successful, they'll need a big performance from the former
walk-on named after the '70s singing group. (Reese, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-PIONEER _ After losing 18 starters from last year's team,
including NFL draftee Wilmont Perry at running back, Livingstone
was expected to be facing a major rebuilding job this season.
Instead, the small school from North Carolina has rebounded to earn
a spot in the Pioneer Bowl for the second straight year. Most of
the team's success has centered on the performance of Perry's
replacements _ true freshmen Carlton Jones and Ray Chambers, who
have combined to rush for nearly 2,000 yards. (Reese, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BKC-FRESNO _ Controversy has always seemed to follow Fresno
State coach Jerry Tarkanian. Beginning with his days at Long Beach
State, continuing with UNLV and now at Fresno, Tarkanian has always
had players who had their problems with the law and he has had a
long-time feud with the NCAA. Last season's Fresno State squad
received nationwide attention after a CBS news special profiled its
problems off the court. Despite his troubles, Tarkanian always
seems to field one of the best teams in college basketball. His
latest edition will meet Georgia Saturday in the Delta Air Lines
Classic. (Wilkinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BKC-KENTUCKY _ After losing several key starters from last
year's national championship team, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith was
forced to look for a leader of this year's Wildcat team. The leader
has emerged in the form of Heshimu Evans, the former transfer from
Manhattan University who has become the team's leading scorer.
Evans is averaging 15.5 points per game and scored 31 points in a
key victory over Maryland earlier this week. Evans will lead the
Wildcats into Saturday's game against Georgia Tech in the Delta Air
Lines Classic. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In theory, the Duane Hanson retrospective at the
Whitney Museum of American Art could not be better timed.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson was born in the tiny farming town of Alexandria, Minn.,
in 1925 and died in Davie, Fla., in 1996. A late bloomer, he spent
the last three decades of his life making uninflected, minutely
detailed cast replicas of resoundingly average Americans _ stoical,
often fleshy denizens of malls, tract houses, group tours and gyms
_ and enjoying what must have been a painful combination of
financial success and critical neglect.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have been a figurative sculptor almost from the
start, born to do exactly what he ended up doing. The first piece
in this exhibition was made when Hanson was 13 and had yet to see a
real work of art.
</P>
<P>
   It is a life-size wood carving based on Gainsborough's ``Blue
Boy,'' which he saw in reproduction in an art book. Weathered and
chipped, it's like folk art _ perhaps an elegant ship's figurehead.
Its narrow features and patchy surface also give it a tremulous,
soulful fragility reminiscent of El Greco.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson studied art at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., the
University of Minnesota and Cranbrook and then wavered between
abstraction and figuration throughout the 1950s and much of the
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, he began making life-size polyvinyl acetate
casts from living people, devoting his energy at first to
sensationally violent subjects. The show includes, from 1967, a
gruesome gangland murder victim just raised from sleeping with the
fishes and a young man killed in a motorcycle accident, his leg
shattered and his abdomen torn open.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's first New York show took place in 1970 at the OK
Harris Gallery in SoHo, after which his work tended to be more
subtle in its sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, his carefully painted trompe l'oeil
figures, which sometimes took up to a year to make, were snapped up
by a small band of collectors, given periodic museum shows, and
included in history books and public collections. Still, although
admired in Europe, especially Germany, his work was ignored or
reviled in many sectors of the American art world.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. The last 20 years have brought an end to
abstract art's dominance and a widespread resurgence of various
realisms among younger artists. Dummies and artificial body parts
are routine in nearly every medium, from photography to performance
art.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptors, in particular, have returned to realistic renderings
of the human form with a kind of vengeance, and the vengeful
include such well-known talents as Robert Gober, Kiki Smith, Juan
Munoz, Charles Ray, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Jeff Koons.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, one would think that Hanson's work might emerge
as an interesting and important precursor, that it might be time
for his stolid waitresses, tourists and construction workers to
have their moment in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say. People who have long disdained Hanson's
figures may not be converted by this exhibition, but they will
definitely find him harder to dismiss or pigeonhole.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 25 of Hanson's fully detailed Americans, made between
1967 and 1995, loiter around the Whitney's third floor. On crowded
days some of the pieces, especially a policeman leaning against a
wall like a museum guard, may blend with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Others will be hard to miss. Hanson favored types who don't
often go to museums: construction workers on a lunch break, a
retired couple in gaudy vacation wear, a weight lifter, a cowboy,
an obese man sitting on a lawn mower, and two blond children
playing Connect Four.
</P>
<P>
   There are several women, demoralized, and conscious of it, to
varying degrees. One pushes a toddler in a stroller. Another,
heavy-set, slovenly and slightly hostile of expression, struggles
with packages. A third, with frazzled gray hair and slip showing,
sits lost in thought, reading a letter with opened mail piled on
her knees. A fourth, a dignified black woman with a rolling trash
barrel slung with cleaning equipment, is clearly a janitor. A fifth
is a weary waitress slumped against a wall. A sixth, sitting on a
folding chair surrounded by books and amateur paintings, is a
flea-market vendor. She is reading a 1985 issue of a magazine named
Sky, the pages open to an article on Hanson's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the presences of these figures a kind of critical tug of war
ensues. On the one hand there's an undeniable intensified reality
to Hanson's work. As surely as Pollock's drips or Donald Judd's
fabricated boxes, his figures eliminated the artist's touch and
personal history. Instead they emphasized physical facts, planting
themselves in the viewer's space and consciousness with a new
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A good Hanson _ one whose pose is natural and whose skin tones
are convincingly painted _ confronts us with an obdurate sense of
physical and psychological weight. The female half of ``Old Couple
on Bench'' of 1994, for example, is shocking in its implacable,
unchanging immobility, at once lifelike and yet so very unlike
life.
</P>
<P>
   Against this reaction is the frequent suspicion that one is
looking at little more than a finely tuned mechanical skill _ a
high-level form of taxidermy backed by a feel for the class codes
and subliminal signals of American dress and accessories that would
do a Hollywood wardrobe designer proud.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a Hanson figure reads as pure subject matter, a punch
list of telling details as legible as the attributes of a
Renaissance saint. Another woman, part of the couple that is
``Tourists II,'' wears flip-flops better suited to her back yard
and carries two bulky tote bags and a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Every detail adds substance to the glazed, uncomprehending
expression of someone traveling the globe but missing everything,
forming a giant cliche. Yet these details anchor an experience of
this character as a totality, an unavoidably present being and
object displacing substantial amounts of psychic and physical
space.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hanson's figures seem to occupy a zone that is not quite
art and definitely not life, the artist is in a category by
himself. He may be a kind of naive and aberrant pop artist. He
didn't cull the signs and symbols of the vast American
unconsciousness from popular culture, like Warhol or Lichtenstein.
Rather he went directly to the source, the origin of that
unconsciousness in the American mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   In the flesh, the precursor theory falls flat. Hanson's
straightforward evocation of American stereotypes may sometimes
find echoes in the work of '80s appropriation artists like Richard
Prince and Cindy Sherman. Like their images, his sculptures trigger
full-blown narratives, daily American tragedies, almost before you
know it.
</P>
<P>
   But his work hardly presages the figurative sculpture of the
'90s, which almost invariably represents the body fragmented or
truncated, disturbingly distorted in form or scale, caught in one
private act or another, or with its constituent parts savagely
rearranged. (Its role models are more likely to be Jasper Johns and
Bruce Nauman.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanson's art is less a harbinger of the new realism than a last
gasp of the old, the end point of a centuries-long tradition of
meticulous, devotional verisimilitude that began in Northern Europe
in the late 15th century. (Its roots are abundantly visible in
``Van Eyck to Bruegel'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the artists of the Northern Renaissance, Hanson viewed the
figure as whole and inviolate, something to be respectfully
replicated down to the last detail and presented as is, in all its
everyday ordinariness. The most affecting quality of his art may
simply be his own careful attention to his figures' painted
surfaces and telling details. It balances the brutal honesty of his
approach with a tenderness that is reverential, sweet and
self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   The clue here is a piece from 1979 that opens the exhibition.
Titled ``Self-Portrait With Model,'' it portrays Hanson seated at a
small coffee-shop table across from a heavyset woman who has just
finished a chocolate sundae: A slight figure, he gazes at her in
quiet awe, like one of the Magi at the adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duane Hanson: A Survey of His Work From the '30s to the '90s''
is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., New
York, through March 21. It was organized by the Whitney and the
Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and will travel to the
Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in Tennessee, April 18 to June 13,
1999.

ADDITIONAL STATE SUBSIDY TO REVITALIZE BRITISH OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British Arts Council announced Thursday that it
would increase its subsidy to the struggling Royal Opera House by
more than $21 million over the next three years, a move the opera
said would allow it to reinstate a portion of its canceled 1999
season and to charge less for tickets when it returns to its
refurbished headquarters next December.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Opera, which also presents ballet and other works,
will use the money for 10 performances of ``Paul Bunyan'' at the
Sadler's Wells Theater in April. It will also put on a short series
of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in May and June, and hold a
concert at the Barbican with Placido Domingo on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Royal Ballet will perform a four-week summer
season at Sadler's Wells in July and will embark on its planned
trip to Asia in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Today's news of the increased funds also spurred Bernard
Haitink, music director of the Royal Opera, to withdraw his threat
to resign. Several months ago, Haitink said that he could not
remain in the job if the cash-starved opera went ahead with plans
to cancel the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, he said, ``I am pleased to remain music director
of the Royal Opera House and look forward to opening what will be a
wonderful new theater.''
</P>
<P>
   In increasing the grant to $26.4 million from $23.8 million for
the 1999 season _ and promising a further increase, to $33 million,
in each of the next two years _ the Arts Council, the
government-financed agency that dispenses money to cultural
organizations, was expressing its view that after years of
mismanagement and financial ineptitude, the opera house had finally
begun to put itself in order.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it undergoes a $353 million refurbishment of its home in
Covent Garden, scheduled to be completed at the end of 1999, the
opera house has been running its day-to-day operations at a deficit
for years. After a series of musical-chair changes in top
management, it finally arrived at a plan this fall to restore its
financial health.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was extreme, involving the cancellation of the
entire 1999 opera season, layoffs and salary cuts for many staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arts Council believes the Royal Opera House is now putting
itself back on track for a sustainable future to insure a solid
base for world-class opera and ballet after considerable management
and financial problems in the past,'' the agency said in a news
release. But, it added, the extra money came with strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it said, the opera house promised to lower
the price of opera tickets, which can cost as much as $218 each for
the most expensive seats at the most expensive operas. It also
promised to increase access by staying open during the day and
attracting visitors with new shops and restaurants, to enhance its
exposure with educational programs and television broadcasts and to
raise $165 million in private donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the grant figures are in anticipation of, and
conditional upon, a satisfactory, detailed business plan based on
an artistic program of quality and a genuine concern for access and
education,'' the Arts Council said.

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 15 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Denver (13-1) at Miami (9-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos and Dolphins are two of the league's most recognized
and successful franchises, and this late-season Monday night
matchup gives both a chance to glow anew. It was supposed to be The
Game, the one that would decide if Denver recorded an unbeaten
regular season, but the Giants took care of that last week.
Denver-Miami, however, still provides plenty to anticipate. It
gives us ballyhooed quarterbacks in Denver's John Elway and Miami's
Dan Marino, the only two passers in league history to have compiled
50,000 passing yards. It gives us the terrific running back Terrell
Davis against a Miami defense that has allowed just 8.7 points a
game at home, where the Dolphins are 6-1 this season. It can't be a
perfect season for Denver, but 14-1 sounds awfully nice. Davis
rips. Denver roars.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SATURDAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jets (10-4) at Buffalo (9-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Jets hammered Buffalo, 34-12, back on Nov. 8 and shut down
Doug Flutie while Vinny Testaverde soared (258 passing yards, three
touchdowns). The roles will likely be reversed. Flutie will want
this game badly and he will play with emotion and determination. He
led the Bills to 44 points against the Raiders last week and would
love to hang a higher number on a Jets defense that four times this
season has allowed 9 or fewer points. But the game will probably be
reduced to the running of Antowain Smith for the Bills and Curtis
Martin for the Jets. Who wins that battle? Go with Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (7-7) at Washington (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the season fell apart for Tampa Bay. It fell to pieces
for Washington long ago. The Redskins, however, are showing some
life. Quarterback Trent Green has thrown 14 touchdown passes and
only two interceptions in his last seven games. Skip Hicks has
provided a lift in the running game. Dan Wilkinson has seven sacks.
But Tampa Bay still has plenty to play for: a shot at the playoffs
if it ends with consecutive victories. The Tampa Bay offense cannot
match Washington's, but the Tampa Bay defense far outshines the
Redskins' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (5-9) at Chicago (3-11).
</P>
<P>
   Duane Starks, a Ravens cornerback, leads all rookies with five
interceptions. That has been one of the few bright spots for the
Ravens in a season of high hopes that spiraled into despair. Of
course, the Bears have known little but despair for consecutive
seasons now. This game could be full of mistakes; expect Baltimore
to make a couple fewer, and that wins the game. It is a homecoming
of sorts for Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh. He was a Bear from
1987 through 1993 and is second in Bears passing yards with 11,567.
He will find the Soldier Field turf familiar, the old Bears crowd
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 28-23.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (6-8) at Giants (6-8).
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City beat Dallas and the Giants beat Denver last week;
both teams enter on high notes, in a season when their identical
records mean that their seasons have been busts. Both teams won
their divisions last year but now see tougher times. Maybe the
worst is over for both. They could settle in and play a hard-nosed
game full of big hits and physical runs. The Chiefs have the edge
in yards gained, in fewer yards allowed and in turnover
differential (plus 6 to minus 3). But the momentum should swing the
Giants' way, playing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (2-12) at Pittsburgh (7-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have won only two games this year and one was
against Pittsburgh, back on Oct. 11 in Cincinnati, a 25-20 victory.
Carl Pickens earned 204 receiving yards in that game and scored the
game-winning touchdown on a tricky Bengals call with 20 seconds
left. No such magic this time. Pittsburgh is struggling mightily on
offense but finds a cure in the Bengals. This is the game when
quarterback Kordell Stewart rolls, when Jerome Bettis busts through
the defense, when Steelers linebacker Jason Gildon adds to his
team-high sack total and when Pittsburgh, for a game, feels good
again.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (4-10) at Carolina (2-12).
</P>
<P>
   The Rams upset New England and now feature Steve Bono at
quarterback for the rest of the season. He replaced the injured
Tony Banks (knee), who suffered through a torturous season in which
he was asked to do so much with so little around him and responded
accordingly _ with little production. The Panthers cannot wait to
get this season completed. Kevin Greene leads them in sacks with
14. He almost added another when he nearly sacked a Panthers
assistant coach on the sideline last week. Horrible behavior.
Greene apologized. The entire Panthers team needs to apologize for
making fans suffer through this mess of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 21-9.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (11-3) at New England (8-6).
</P>
<P>
   Big game for New England. It loses, and its playoff chances are
hurt immeasurably. And it must play without quarterback Drew
Bledsoe and with Scott Zolak as his replacement. Who knows how the
Patriots will respond? How Zolak will respond? The 49ers will blitz
Zolak from every angle. He is big but not extra mobile. New England
is fuming after losing at St. Louis last week. This is a game it
must win with defense. Look for Ty Law and the Patriots' defense to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (8-6) at Green Bay (9-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' game begins and ends with quarterback Brett Favre.
The last Super Bowl was a reminder, when Green Bay Coach Mike
Holmgren let the Broncos score just so Green Bay could get the ball
back for Favre to have a final shot at winning the game. Favre did
not produce then, but he has in dramatic fashion over the last five
seasons. He is three touchdowns short of another 30-touchdown
passing season; it would be his fifth straight. This season,
however, he also has 21 interceptions. The Oilers look at this game
as a supreme test in their quest for respect and for the playoffs.
Favre is the present, but Oilers quarterback Steve McNair is the
future. And this is the type of matchup that makes McNair and the
young Oilers look special. McNair will produce the last shot. And
the decisive one.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 27-25.

LEONARD M. RIESER, 76; WAS KEEPER OF THE `DOOMSDAY CLOCK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The keeper of the ``Doomsday Clock'' has died.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard M. Rieser of Norwich, Vt., who as chairman of the board
of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was seen in numerous news
photographs resetting the hands of the ``Doomsday Clock'' that the
journal uses to dramatize the threat of nuclear war, died of cancer
Tuesday in Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   A participant in the Manhattan Project, which developed the
first atomic bomb, Mr. Rieser was a professor and administrator at
Dartmouth College for 30 years
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rieser was born in Chicago. He attended Dartmouth for two
years before transferring to the University of Chicago, where he
graduated in 1953 under an accelerated program while serving in the
Army. He did research for the Manhattan Project in Chicago and then
in Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he witnessed the
first atomic bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he earned a doctorate at Stanford University,
where he taught before joining the faculty at Dartmouth in 1952. He
was chairman of Dartmouth's physics department from 1957 to 1959.
From 1964 until his retirement in 1982, he alternately served in
the posts of dean of faculty and provost of the school.
</P>
<P>
   He had been chairman of the board of the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rieser was interested in making sure children got a chance
to learn about science. When he discovered that his children's
elementary school didn't have a science program, he began making
regular visits to the school with magnets and test tubes, sporting
his electric light bow tie to spark the youngsters' enthusiasm. He
helped establish the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich and was
president of its board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Rosemary; a daughter, Abigail, of
Northampton, Mass.; three sons, Leonard of Philadelphia, Timothy S.
of Washington, D.C., and Kenneth Willis of Princeton, N.J.; two
brothers, Lawrence of Jackson, Wyo.; and William of Perkasie, Pa.;
and three granddaughters.

 UNDATED: Oilers, 27-25.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (3-11) at Seattle (7-7).
</P>
<P>
   Seldom is a player on a 3-11 team rewarded, but Marshall Faulk
was. He leads the Colts in rushing yards (1,228) and in receiving
(78 catches for 862 yards) and was deservedly awarded with Pro Bowl
honors. Peyton Manning, the Colts' rookie quarterback, has taken
all 865 snaps this season and that says a lot. Manning is tough and
talented _ his rookie-record 24 touchdown passes attest to that _
and the Colts have a foundation on which to build over the next
couple of seasons. Seattle, however, is a team that was supposed to
have already built its foundation. It is one of the biggest
underachievers in recent years. The Seahawks are better than their
average record, and they show it for a game.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 33-17.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (7-7) at San Diego (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have sunk since losing quarterback Jeff George. One
of the reasons is that they ran their offense as if George was
still there, instead of turning games over to the energetic,
game-swinging running back Napoleon Kaufman. He has 217 carries
this season. Jamal Anderson of Atlanta has 362. Eddie George of
Tennessee has 319. Even the rookie Fred Taylor of Jacksonville has
more, with 220 carries, and he hasn't even been a starter the
entire season. The visiting team in this matchup has won four of
the last five meetings and nine of the last 12. Look for Chargers
tight end Freddie Jones and the Chargers' defense to buck the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (12-2) at Detroit (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   This game has ``Win One for Dan Reeves'' swirling all over it.
Reeves, the Falcons coach, could be released soon from an Atlanta
hospital after undergoing quadruple bypass surgery. He will not be
in Detroit for this game and Rich Brooks, his offensive
coordinator, will call the shots. But Reeves' players will be there
and that is plenty. The Falcons are on the mark to score more than
426 points this season; that is their club record for points set in
1981. Jamal Anderson has 10 100-yard rushing games and will earn
his 11th against a shoddy Lions defense. The Lions lost by 35-13 at
San Francisco on Monday night. The nation saw what they were: a
team with so many holes, especially along the defensive line and at
linebacker, and a club that continues to waste the special talent
of Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (6-8) at Arizona (7-7). &QL; 
Arizona makes the playoffs if it wins, Tampa Bay loses and the
Giants lose or tie. It would be the Cardinals' first playoff
appearance in 16 years. That is an awfully long time. That is a
great incentive to win. And Arizona will, behind the running of
Adrian Murrell (he needs 48 yards for his third consecutive
1,000-yard rushing season). Linebacker Simeon Rice (9 sacks) will
provide a boost. And quarterback Jake Plummer (3,069 passing yards)
also helps pave the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 18-15.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (3-11) at Dallas (8-6).
</P>
<P>
   Footsteps. Dallas hears them. They have slipped to only a
one-game lead over Arizona with two to play. And Dallas' final two
games are against divisional foes (the Eagles and Redskins) who
know them well. Since Koy Detmer became the Eagles' starting
quarterback, Philadelphia has averaged 16.7 points in three games;
before that, it averaged 8.4 points. And did you know that the
superb Eagles linebacker William Thomas is the only player in the
league with at least a sack and an interception in each of the last
seven seasons? Detmer on offense and Thomas on defense are reasons
the Eagles might steal this one. Dallas, however, slips by.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (10-4) at Minnesota (13-1).
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham has a 107.2 quarterback rating. Robert Smith
is averaging 4.7 yards per carry. Minnesota is averaging nearly 400
yards of offense a game. Randy Moss leads the NFL in receiving
yards (1,209).The Vikings are on pace to score 549 points and that
would break the league record of 541 set by Washington in 1983.
John Randle leads the Vikings defense with 8.5 sacks. Minnesota is
rolling. In come the Jaguars. If Mark Brunell is healthy and can
play four quarters, the Jaguars will make it fun. Without him, the
Vikings will make it ugly. Either way, Minnesota wins.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 30-20.

   EAST TEXAS LAWMAKERS STILL OPPOSING EACH OTHER ON IMPEACHMENT
   450 words
   By EUNICE MOSCOSO
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the nation braced for the possible impeachment
of President Clinton and the consequences of a military strike
against Iraq during the busy holiday season, a Texas lawmaker
summed it all up in five words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a strange time,'' said Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all the chaos, Sandlin of Marshall said
Thursday his decision to vote against impeachment has not wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the U.S. Constitution requires that impeachment is
only used for fundamental offenses against our system of
government,'' he said. ``This does not reach the standards of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Democrat Rep. Ralph Hall of Rockwall is equally staunch
in his decision to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he believes the president committed perjury at least
11 times and that perjury is a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took an oath to uphold the law,'' he said, adding that
``there is no pleasure'' in casting a vote to impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders decided Thursday to begin the impeachment
debate Friday on the House floor and finish action on the four
articles of impeachment against Clinton by Saturday even if U.S.
attacks against Iraq are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said he thinks it is ``inappropriate'' and
``outrageous'' to consider impeaching the president in the middle
of an armed conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to go ahead and vote,'' he said. ``The
Congress has to set an agenda just as the president set his.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he doesn't think the attacks on Iraq ``strengthened
the president at all.'' When asked if an impeachment debate could
hurt the morale of U.S. troops, Hall said he couldn't answer that
question but added, ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   A simple House majority of 218 votes is enough to impeach
Clinton. If the House approves articles of impeachment, the Senate
would be forced to hold a trial. It takes a two-thirds Senate
majority to convict a president and remove him from office, and few
people believe the Senate, which will have 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats next year, will find the 67 votes needed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said it would be a ``misuse'' of the system to use
impeachment to ``dispose of'' the problem, knowing that the Senate
will not convict the president. He added that a Senate trial would
be ``very divisive for the country'' and would ``certainly put the
brakes on'' dealing with several important issues such as Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said he has spoken to about 100 House members in the
past few weeks and that some Republican House members are searching
for ``a way out'' but are concerned their party leaders would
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply can't find a graceful exit,'' he said.

MANGOLD SWITCHES DIRECTORIAL GEARS 
THE INTERNET AS A PLOT DEVICE 
ROCK 'N' ROLL REUNION, SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., N.Y.)   (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ever since the witty war film ``King of Hearts''
demonstrated with hilarity that ``crazy people'' locked up in
asylums may well be saner, or at least more humane, than those
outside, movies have occasionally flirted with the notion of
whether we should trust the guard or the inmate. Think of ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' or even ``The Dream Team,'' films
that were both poignant and comic.
</P>
<P>
   The ``King of Hearts'' for the new generation may be ``Girl,
Interrupted,'' which is based on the powerful memoir by Susanna
Kaysen about how her rebelliousness and uncertainty as a teen-ager
at the height of the 1960s got her committed to an institution.
This time, don't expect a lot of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Girl, Interrupted'' is James Mangold, who was
also one of the writers of the screenplay. The film stars a host of
strong young actresses, including Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie,
Brittany Murphy and Clea DuVall. Shooting will begin in late
January in Harrisburg, Pa., and though there is a relatively modest
$20 million budget, Mangold promises that the film will have great
emotional heft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to play the women as just victims,'' Mangold
said. ``There is not going to be a misty gauze over this
institution. There's a way to tell this story with an aggressive
point of view, without pulling punches. These characters have a
clear lens on their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangold was not the most obvious choice to make this difficult
movie, which involves a harrowing emotional journey. His last film
was ``Cop Land,'' a critically well received police drama that
starred Sylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Harvey Keitel and Robert De
Niro. That movie had a lot of testosterone, not fine emotional
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But Mangold said that ``Cop Land,'' not ``Girl, Interrupted,''
was the aberration and that he was more comfortable with wordplay
than gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Cop Land,' I missed working with women characters,'' he
said. ``I felt like I'd spent 12 weeks in a locker room. I was
suddenly perceived as a guy who was going to make these cop movies,
or guy movies. I've always been interested in dramas that really
mean it, that have a point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangold said he read an early script for the movie shortly after
finishing ``Cop Land'' and immediately sat down to write his own
version, focusing on creating a clear narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is really episodic and I wanted to build a strong
narrative structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the story has much in common with ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' another sort of journey. As in that story, Mangold
said, the journey is harrowing and, at times, joyful. But at the
critical moment, when Dorothy learns that she has had the key to
escaping Oz in herself all along, she can move on only by leaving
behind the companions who helped bring her this knowledge. And so,
too, Susanna grows by saying goodbye to the friends in the
institution who were essential to her passage.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Couple
</P>
<P>
   Will young people line up to see an old-fashioned romantic
comedy?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question Nora Ephron is testing in ``You've Got
Mail,'' her latest effort to make falling in love funny and
compelling. The movie is expensive _ $60 million before marketing
costs _ so unlike the cheaper ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' her last
foray into the genre, this film is going to require a broader
audience to deliver a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ephron, who directed and was a writer and producer of
``You've Got Mail,'' to be released on Friday, acknowledged that
this movie had to bring in a more youthful audience and could not
be for women only, as some romantic movies tend to be. Her solution
was using the Internet as a plot device; it is how the fated lovers
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Shuler Donner, one of the producers, said the Internet
was the movie's ``insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is basically a young person's thing,'' Ms. Donner
said. ``They like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't call ``You've Got Mail'' a sequel to the highly
successful ``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's at all similar,'' said Ms. Ephron, although
she admitted that having Meg Ryan (who just received a Golden Globe
nomination for her role) star opposite Tom Hanks again and having
them follow a tangled path before finding each other, and love,
again might lead some to that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepless'' frequently referred to a film from the golden era,
``An Affair to Remember.'' And ``You've Got Mail'' is essentially a
remake of a film from the golden era romantic comedy, ``The Shop
Around the Corner,'' which starred James Stewart and was set in
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the story has a long provenance. It was originally a
play, ``Parfumerie,'' by Nikolaus Laszlo, then ``The Shop Around
the Corner,'' the film directed by Ernst Lubitsch. It was
transformed into a musical, ``In the Good Old Summertime'' and then
transformed again into a Broadway musical, ``She Loves Me.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``You've Got Mail,'' the couple has moved from Budapest to
New York; in fact, Ms. Ephron described the film as a valentine to
the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where she lives and which is
lovingly portrayed.

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ Early damage assessments show how U.S.
and British air strikes are tearing at the heart of Iraqi military
sites, as attacks continue for a second day. Developing. (Deans,

   IRAQ-AIRSTRIKES _ BAGHDAD _ The reaction and result of the air
strikes on the ground in the Iraqi capital. What were the targets,
and what was the damage? Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

<P>
   IRAQ-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Watching congressional debate of a
resolution backing the attack on Iraq. Many are expected to call it
a brazen political coincidence as impeachment vote looms.
(Sherman/Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   IRAQ-GINGRICH - Speaker Newt Gingrich on Thursday cautioned
critics of President Clinton's decision to attack Iraq that ``there
is no alternative'' to U.S. leadership. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>

   IRAQ-BOMBING _ WASHINGTON _ Has the United States really done
any good by launching air strikes against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein? Developing. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RAMADAN _ WASHINGTON _ The significance of the Muslim holy
period of Ramadan has been mentioned by many as a major factor in
the timing of the U.S. air strikes. What is it? Why is it
significant? (Monroe, Cox News Service).

   IRAQ-WORLD _ WASHINGTON _ A wrap-up of the world reaction to the
U.S.-Britain bombing of Iraq. Developing. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Russia, China and France deplored the
U.S. and British attacks on Iraq, with the harshest rhetoric coming
from Moscow. Russia said the attacks could scuttle a plan by
Russia's parliament to approve the long-delayed START II nuclear
reduction treaty. Russia, China and France -- long supportive of
more conciliatory posture toward Iraq -- faulted the Clinton
administration for refusing to seek approval from the U.N. Security
Council before launching the strikes. Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov called on U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler to be
replaced. The Duma, the lower house of parliament, accused the U.S.
and Britain of international terrorism. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-BRITAIN _ LONDON _ At the height of the last crisis over
Iraq, Prime Minister Blair and President Clinton spoke together by
phone eight times in 12 hours. There is no reason to believe that
the two leaders communicated any less this time. Among world
leaders, Blair stands nearly alone in his support of the United
States particularly his close personal friend Bill Clinton. On
Thursday, Blair defended Clinton against assertions that the
military strike was launched to help Clinton with his domestic
crisis. Blair said that after consulting with Clinton, it became
clear that they would have been derelict in their duties not to
launch the attack. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

<P>
   IRAQ-DEPLOY _ Specialized air groups from Georgia bases,
including the Air Force's only all-weather airborne target locator,
have been ordered to the Persian Gulf but so far there are no
unscheduled large-scale deployments. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-FAITH _ Hanukkah, Ramadan and Christmas make this holiday
season a special and spiritual time for observant Jews, Muslims and
Christians. But Wednesday's bombing of Iraq by U.S. forces is a
sober reminder that the problems of the world never go away. We
talk with ministers, rabbis and, hopefully, an Iman to guage the
reaction of Atlanta's faith community as military action continues
in the Mideast. (White/Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15-18.

   HAITI-BABYDOC _ MIAMI _ Inspired by the extradition case against
General Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Haitian exiles are seeking a
trial for Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, the former dictator of
Haiti. A committee has been formed to seek his trial for crimes
against humanity. An estimated 60,000 people were killed during his
regime and that of his father, Francois. Duvalier is apparently
living in France. We get reaction from Haitian communities in
Florida, Georgia and elsewhere. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-PRESSURE _ WASHINGTON _ A week that began with tough
talks for peace in Jerusalem, careened into political battling to
save the presidency from impeachment and wound up with the United
States making war on Iraq has put a set of pressures on President
Clinton few chief executives anywhere might imagine. How has he
held himself together, and how is he holding up? (Deans, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-BASE _ WASHINGTON _ Despite a last-minute flurry of
activity from Democratic allies, such as an anti-impeachment rally
at the Capitol on Thursday, many of Clinton's champions were barely
visible for the past five weeks as momentum gained for impeachment
in the House. (Malone, Cox News Service 520).

<P>
   CLINTON-DOUBTS _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton found himself
Thursday having to defend his decision to attack Iraq from critics
asking whether the raids were timed to impact impeachment
proceedings. True or false, the allegations themselves complicate
the presidential decision-making process, make it difficult for
Clinton to get across the message behind his moves and raise
questions, in the minds of some, about his motives. Similar
questions have dogged Clinton all year and appear certain to
continue well into next year. (Deans, Cox News Service 700).
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON When it comes to Iraq and impeachment,
the wag-the-Buddy theories aired on Capitol Hill and in foreign
capitals miss the point. It's that Saddam Hussein and President
Clinton enable each other. In other words, the rocks in Saddam's
head fit the holes in Clinton's. (Glass, Cox News Service 560).

   GA-FLA-ALA-WATER _ Georgia, Florida and Alabama governors are
expected this week to extend the deadline for reaching a settlement
in the states' interstate water war, possibly delaying for at least

   Ms. Ephron and Ms. Donner said they hoped men might be lured
into theaters even if there isn't a single car chase or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, I think, won't mind getting dragged to this,'' Ms. Donner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ephron said: ``It's meant to be a divine little fairy tale.
No, don't use the word `divine.' It's a fairy tale. But so many
people have met through the Internet. We'll have slightly more
women than men, but I think men can relate to this, too.''

<P>
   Not Fade Away
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll can save your life.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dark-rimmed perspective on rock music in movies like
``The Doors'' or even the sendup ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' it might
be difficult to embrace rock as a savior. In the film ``Still
Crazy,'' rock gets a good going over as egocentric and sometimes
silly. It comes through, nevertheless, not just as a banner for the
younger generation but also a means for aging boomers to pass into
middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy,'' which is distributed by Columbia Pictures, is
getting a brief run to qualify for the Academy Awards; it will be
in wider release on Jan. 22. It has received two Golden Globe
nominations. It was directed by Brian Gibson and stars Stephen Rea,
Billy Connolly, Bill Nighy, Jimmy Nail, Juliet Aubrey and Helena
Bergstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll is really the backdrop to a touching if amusing
drama about a group of old friends _ the now down and out members
of the once hot rock band Strange Fruit, better known as the Fruitz
_ dealing with the vulnerabilities of middle age. But the music
plays an important role in the story.
</P>
<P>
   That should come as no surprise, given that the film was written
by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, who also wrote ``The
Commitments,'' the acclaimed movie about a group of Irish youths
who try to escape poverty by forming a band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save us from what?'' Clement responded, when asked if the
movie was intended as a tribute to the salvation power of rock
music. He went on to say, though, that his views on the power of
music were shaped by the documentary he made of Elton John's tour
of the Soviet Union in 1979, which offered a vision of a sort of
freedom the concertgoers could only imagine. ``I learned that in
some way rock 'n' roll is a very potent force, much more for good
than evil,'' Clement said.
</P>
<P>
   La Frenais said of the Elton John tour and its impact, ``There
was something about the universality of the rock 'n' roll
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing partners said they had been offered many projects on
rock themes after the success of ``The Commitments'' and had turned
them down because they did not want to be seen as rock writers.
They embraced ``Still Crazy,'' about a reunion of the Fruitz 20
years after breaking up, because of its treatment of middle age and
the rough passage of the characters into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make this wise as well as witty,'' La Frenais
said. ``It's about entering middle age after having peaked too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reunion is mostly disastrous and filled with
misadventures, but it does illuminate at least for a moment the
grim lives of the band members.
</P>
<P>
   As for their own age, Clement and La Frenais would only say,
``We have been around as long as the Stones, but not as long as the
Kinks.''

MOSES MOVIE AN EPIC IN ANIMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Moses has been brought to the screen before, most
familiarly in Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 extravaganza, ``The Ten
Commandments.'' That spectacle now seems leaden and weighed down by
corny acting, dated special effects and a miscast Charlton Heston
as Moses.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a pleasure to report that DreamWorks' animated retelling
of Moses' journey from slave to youthful prince, and from prince to
the king of the Hebrew people, is more visually breathtaking,
subtle in its delivery and as thrilling as any blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   In the tale of Moses, from the biblical book of Exodus, an
infant is placed in a basket and set adrift in the Nile by his
mother and sister. They are trying to save the baby from the mass
infanticide that Egyptian King Rameses has ordered after a vision
warns him a Hebrew prince will rise and overthrow his empire.
</P>
<P>
   The baby in the bulrushes will touch shore at the door of
Rameses' wife, the Queen of Egypt. He will be named Moses and
raised alongside her son. He will be loved and adored despite his
unknown heritage. And while one son is destined to rule Egypt, the
other will become a prince of slaves, dividing a dynasty in the
struggle for his people's freedom and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Shade and subtlety are what mostly elevates ``The Prince of
Egypt'' above its cinematic predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy to simply turn the brothers into mortal enemies,
making one a hero and the other a villain, as DeMille's epic
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The animated version, with its inspired blend of voice talent
including Ralph Fiennes as the Egyptian king-to-be, Rameses, and
Val Kilmer as Moses, carefully examines the crisis of heart and
duty that erupts from the legacy of the sin of the father.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are brothers who have loved each other deeply.
They are marvelous, playful creatures, full of fun, mutual respect
and affection. Ultimately, they are both defined by birthright as
well as what they have been bred to do, with Fiennes making Rameses
as compelling and tragic as Moses, who, after considerable
soul-searching, remains courageous and true to his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a woman director has been called upon to
head the production team for an animated feature and Brenda Chapman
(with co-directors Steve Hickner and Simon Wells) brings a unique
voice to ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Fiennes and Kilmer, the talent in the movie is a marvel.
Danny Glover, Sandra Bullock, Helen Mirren, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Steve Martin, Martin Short and Patrick Stewart lend their
distinctively identifiable vocal chords to their characters. And
the casting of both British and American actors creates a dramatic
chasm between the Egyptian and Hebrew factions.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto of Stephen Schwartz, who won an Oscar for
``Pocahantas,'' and a fine score by Hans Zimmer, winner of an
Academy Award for his ``The Lion King'' soundtrack, convey
emotional plight and conflict and contribute harmony and melody
without overwhelming the delicate balance between story and song.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 animators and technicians from some 35 countries
took four years to bring ``The Prince of Egypt'' to the screen,
using modern technology to recreate an elegant ancient world's
architecture and environment. The result is a film that seamlessly
blends time, legend, effects, backgrounds and character.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another in a series of animated movies this holiday
season that have delivered more inspired and innovative filmmaking
than most of their live-action counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince of Egypt. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner,
Simon Wells. Cast: voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra
Bullock, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart, Steve
Martin, Martin Short, Jeff Goldblum. Dreamworks SKG. 90 minutes.

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East (including the Caspian basin), leaving the rest
of the world dependent on the region's collection of predators and
vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In terms
of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its advantages over
gasoline substantially outweigh its few disadvantages. But until
now it has only been practical to produce ethanol from a tiny
portion of plant life _ the edible parts of corn or other feed
grains.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few
years, ranging from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus
been too expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized
niche of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent
reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final product
still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about double today's
wholesale price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing, however, are radically changing the viability of
ethanol as a transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a
few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions
of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on
renewable technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because private investment often follows federal commitment,
industrial research and development has also reached new lows.
These disturbing trends occur at a time of national economic
prosperity when America has both time and resources for investing
in biofuels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot afford to wait for the next energy
crisis to marshal its intellectual and industrial resources. Our
growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle Eastern oil is a
fool's game _ there is no way for the rest of the world to win. Our
losses may come suddenly through war, steadily through price
increases, agonizingly through developing-nation poverty,
relentlessly through climate change _ or through all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extremely short-sighted not to take advantage of the
scientific breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the
offing, accelerate them and move smartly toward ameliorating the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, we will make life far less dangerous and far more
prosperous for future generations. If we do not, those generations
will look back in angry wonder at the remarkable opportunity that
we missed.

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East (including the Caspian basin), leaving the rest
of the world dependent on the region's collection of predators and
vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In terms
of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its advantages over
gasoline substantially outweigh its few disadvantages. But until
now it has only been practical to produce ethanol from a tiny
portion of plant life _ the edible parts of corn or other feed
grains.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few
years, ranging from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus
been too expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized
niche of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent
reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final product
still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about double today's
wholesale price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing, however, are radically changing the viability of
ethanol as a transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a
few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions
of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons

THE TIE THAT BINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Netherlands' Prince Claus started something _
although it's not clear just what _ when he had a bad neck day
recently and ripped off his tie, throwing it at the feet of wife
Queen Beatrix and growling that it was ``a snake'' around his
throat.
</P>
<P>
   This unexpected royal fashion rebellion was greeted with cheers
in some places but will run into trouble in the Washington power
scene, where the official male dress code requires jacket and tie
for all serious business.
</P>
<P>
   The prince has a prominent ally in screen legend Paul Newman,
who recently told Vanity Fair his greatest extravagance is owning
two ties and one suit. Tongue in cheek, he deplored the trait of
others to own 40 ties and 60 suits. Asked what quality he most
likes in a man, he replied ``two ties.'' Asked what quality he most
likes in a woman, he said,``no ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous actors, of course, can get away with dressing any way
they want without regard to making a good first impression on
bosses, clients and friends. Maybe princes can get away with it
too, although in Great Britain stuffy Charles hasn't gotten that
message yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ties, despite their apparent lack of any useful function, have
over the centuries become an elementary part of the male uniform.
Somebody must appreciate them. What else can women give their mates
that's relatively cheap?
</P>
<P>
   Male neckwear apparently first caught on about 1688, when
Croatian mercenaries appeared in France wearing linen scarves
around their necks. The French called it a ``cravate'' and the fad
was popularized by Louis XIV, the autocratic Sun King who reigned
until 1715. The habit quickly spread to Great Britain, which claims
credit for inventing the hang-down version.
</P>
<P>
   These days we live in a far more informal world than that of the
foppish Sun King.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the nation's capital, ties are king. The
official dress code of the U.S. Congress mandates jackets and ties
for male members who appear on the floor, although they may get
away with sweaters if they hide out in their offices unseen by
cameras. Female members have more leeway, ordered only to wear
``appropriate attire.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens showed up on the Senate
floor in a classy Western bolo tie and was rebuked for violating
the rules. An exception, however, has been made for Colorado's Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate, who
insists bolos are part of his cultural heritage and refuses to wear
anything else around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, the Pentagon and the White House are equally
formal. No president has ever been spotted without a tie except on
a boat or beach on vacation. A tie figured in the President
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky saga. When he wore one she had given him on
a day she testified, cynics wondered if it was meant to be some
sort of silent signal to her. (If it was, she missed it.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only male officials but even reporters working in those
hallowed corridors are expected to appear in appropriate neckwear.
Except for the guys lugging cameras, the media's days of looking
scruffy are over. Now they blend into the rest of official
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the high court, there is no written rule, but any man failing
to measure up sartorially would be socially shunned. Even the male
justices wear ties under their black robes, although the ties are
hidden. Justice John Paul Stevens is considered a maverick because
he is the only one who prefers a bow tie to the down-the-chest
thing. The two female justices wear white jabots.
</P>
<P>
   But for those not bustling about on self-important business,
Prince Claus may reflect a growing trend. When the most
sought-after ties can cost well over $100, it becomes a thrifty
cultural statement not to wear one.
</P>
<P>
   The wearing of ties, in fact, has been increasingly criticized
by rational men fed up with them. Ties have been accused of
reducing the flow of blood to the brain, causing men to make
mistakes. The neckwear has been ridiculed as an ornament that does
nothing but provide an excuse for bad taste. It has been called the
chador of male fashion, the men's clothing equivalent of Hindu and
Muslim women's headgear.
</P>
<P>
   And in some settings ties are in trouble. Few restaurants in the
nation's capital or any other city care any more about the attire
of either men or women, so long as the individuals are clean,
decently covered and wear shoes. Turtlenecks are good. Only the
most exclusive joints and the private clubs have the clout to
insist on coats and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Theater-goers also show up in virtually anything they please,
including knit shirts and khakis, although spandex and collarless
tee-shirts are considered tacky.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago it became fashionable for corporations to set
aside Friday for casual wear, particularly among young employees.
Once greeted with enthusiasm, however, this concept has been
declining in popularity because some workers can't tell the
difference between being informal and looking like a homeless
beggar.
</P>
<P>
   There's a happy dress-code medium in here somewhere. And maybe
the world can do without ties, but some of us would be nostalgic
for those with rows of petunias, cavorting elephants or Santa
Clauses on them.

PATRIOTS SPIN IS ALL 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Patriots spent most of Thursday's media session
responding to questions about their opponents. At least during the
buildup to Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers, the
Patriots will be in a supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have the better record (11-3), the marquee players,
and the momentum. The Patriots (8-6) are trying to salvage what
began as a promising season but has deteriorated with only four
wins in their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots seem willing to capitalize on being in a
position of possibly being overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with being the underdog,'' wide
receiver Tony Simmons said. ``You can't underestimate anybody. You
have to go out and do what you need to do, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what is going to happen. If things don't happen
the way you want them to, you have to adjust very quickly. You have
to go out and try to win and expect to do your best.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons could be in the starting lineup for the first time since
Nov. 23, when the Patriots began a three-game winning streak with a
26-23 victory over Miami. Simmons returned to the bench and has
caught only two passes in victories over Buffalo (25-21) and
Pittsburgh (23-9) and a loss to St. Louis (32-18).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for me,'' he said. ``I have to go out
and do it. You keep saying it, but you've got to go out and prove
it and make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who has a reputation as an effective blocker, has
mostly capitalized on his chances. He caught four passes for 109
yards and a touchdown in a 21-16 victory over Indianapolis in his
second start. He had four receptions for 95 yards in a 41-10 loss
to Atlanta the next week and benefited by working with Scott Zolak
_ Sunday's starting quarterback _ for a spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adjustment everyone has to make,'' Simmons said.
``Other guys have played with Scott before I got here, so it's not
any more or less of an adjustment for me. Everyone just has to
understand that he's been out there before.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons caught one pass against St. Louis after replacing Terry
Glenn, who broke an ankle. Now Simmons and another potential
starter, Troy Brown, will be expected to duplicate some of Glenn's
achievements. Brown missed six games but returned to catch two
passes for 42 yards against St. Louis, his first receptions since
Oct. 19. Simmons has 17 catches for 374 yards and 2 touchdowns, and
Brown has 23 receptions for 346 yards and a touchdown. Glenn caught
50 passes for 792 yards and 3 touchdowns before being sidelined for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony will be a factor,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``We will be
counting on him.''

<P>
   The American public overwhelmingly supports the military action
in Iraq and accepts President Clinton's explanation about its
timing and its purpose, according to four national polls taken on
Wednesday evening after the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread public support is customarily the first reaction to
any military action by the United States, as the public rallies
around the president. These first opinion polls show that that is
occurring this time as well, despite questions raised by Clinton's
critics about the timing of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The air strikes against Iraq were viewed favorably by about
three-quarters of the public _ 73 percent in the ABC News poll, 79
percent in the CBS News poll, 75 percent in the NBC News poll and
74 percent in the poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for CNN
and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minority expressed reservations about the timing of the
attack. Most Americans accept that immediate action by the United
States was warranted and proper, rather than a ploy to delay
Thursday's scheduled congressional debate on impeachment. In the
Gallup poll, for example, 62 percent said Clinton ordered the
military strikes ``solely because he felt it was in the best
interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News found that respondents supported the air strikes
regardless of their attitudes on whether Clinton should be
impeached. But opinion on the timing of the strikes differed
depending on people's views of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who supported impeachment were evenly divided on whether
the timing of the air strikes was motivated by Thursday's scheduled
debate, while those who opposed impeachment overwhelmingly rejected
the notion that Clinton's decision was connected to those
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans (60 percent in the ABC News poll) continued to
oppose the impeachment proceedings against Clinton. The decision by
the House of Representatives to temporarily delay the vote was
supported by 61 percent of the respondents in the NBC News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the CBS News poll, 62 percent said the military action was
worth the costs of attacking Iraq, even if it meant that American
lives were lost. Last month, slightly fewer, 54 percent, agreed
that forcing Saddam Hussein to comply with United Nations
inspections was worth the potential costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the public is divided on whether this military action will
achieve its goal. In the ABC News Poll, 41 percent said the attack
would interfere with Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass
destruction, while 46 percent said it would not accomplish that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The national polls were conducted by telephone on Wednesday
night; ABC News interviewed 510 adults, CBS News 413 adults, NBC
News 503 adults and Gallup 543 adults. The margin of sampling error
for each poll is five percentage points in either direction. In
addition, polls conducted entirely in one night introduce
additional potential error because only people at home during a
limited time period can be reached.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In May 1988 the Tony-winning British-born actor
George Rose was murdered in the Dominican Republic, where he
maintained a home.
</P>
<P>
   At first the police called the death an accident. But further
investigation revealed that Rose, best known for his performances
on Broadway in ``The Pirates of Penzance'' and ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood,'' had been beaten to death and that his body had been
placed in a car that was then pushed into a ravine to create the
appearance of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Four men were charged with the murder, including an 18-year-old
man who had lived with Rose and whom he had adopted. At a news
conference in Santo Domingo, the suspect was quoted as saying he
had planned the killing out of jealousy over Rose's affection for a
younger boy who was living in the house.
</P>
<P>
   (At the time, some of Rose's acquaintances disputed that
characterization of the relationship, saying that the 68-year-old
actor had adopted the teen-ager _ whose biological father was also
charged with the killing _ principally because he wanted an heir.)
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Spread Eagle,'' the new play at the WPA Theater
starring Brian Murray, does not acknowledge any connection to the
bizarre circumstances of Rose's killing, it's impossible for
playgoers not to note the similarities between the real and
fictional events.
</P>
<P>
   Murray plays Toby Arundel, an aging British stage actor who buys
a vacation house in Mexico, where he falls in love with his
teen-age house boy, Javier, played by Matthew Saldivar. Toby makes
arrangements to adopt Javier and declare him his heir but becomes
enamored of a younger servant, Diego (Joe Quintero), in whom he
discovers a latent acting talent. After arguing with Javier and his
father over Toby's plans to take Diego to New York, Toby is
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Luigs, the author of ``Spread Eagle,'' appears to have in
mind the kind of story of sacrificial love conjured by ``M.
Butterfly,'' David Henry Hwang's Broadway play, based on actual
events, examining a French diplomat's devotion to a Chinese man
masquerading as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   As in Hwang's play, Luigs' protagonist is a worldly dupe, an
older man who enters into a dangerous liaison with a younger man of
questionable motives that brings the hero both ruin and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final 20 minutes of ``Spread Eagle,'' however, Luigs,
the author of the off-Broadway musical ``Das Barbecu,'' strikes up
nothing close to the vibrant theatricality of Hwang's work.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the outstanding contributions by Murray, who invests
Toby with a complexly engaging mixture of cynicism, passion and
compassion, and by Quintero, a real discovery as a serving boy who
finds his calling in the pages of ``Antony and Cleopatra,''
``Spread Eagle'' feels long and rather ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It is padded with digressive scenes seemingly borrowed from
other plays _ like an embarrassing one in which Toby, a la Maria
Callas, gives an attenuated master acting class back in London _
that are drags on the pacing and tend to rob the affecting ending
of its full power.
</P>
<P>
   How specifically the playwright intended the parallels to the
Rose case is unclear. Luigs is more interested in spiritual than
temporal matters. Toby is an unlikely candidate for sainthood, yet
his only real sin in Luigs' eyes is his blindness to the social
mores of the alien culture he meddles with.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The writer develops this core issue in a clever climactic scene
in which Steve Mones, as Javier's father, angry over Toby's
attentions to the younger boy, protests that promises had been
made, as if his son were a bride left at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Luigs and the director, Constance Grappo, were lucky to secure
Murray's services. His Toby _ the second he's played this year,
following his darkly captivating Sir Toby Belch in Lincoln Center
Theater's ``Twelfth Night'' _ is neither a stereotypically rancid
British ex-pat nor brittle gay outsider.
</P>
<P>
   There's a delicate balance in his performance, a world-weariness
that makes his escape to the Mexican coast a practical retreat, and
a boyishness that allows him to appreciate it as an adventure. To
his credit, he never lets go of either quality.
</P>
<P>
   His scenes with Quintero, an actor who reveals his depth in
almost imperceptible increments, are lovely. It's fun to watch the
technically gifted Briton and the emotive Mexican break down the
text of ``Antony and Cleopatra'' and actually to sense the magic
being passed from the stage veteran to the unlikely tyro.
</P>
<P>
   When in the end Quintero's Diego pleads with Toby to take him to
New York, you virtually hear the volcano erupting in Diego's heart.
All his hopes, awakened by Toby, now rest tragically in Toby's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency of ``Spread Eagle'' leaves you a little
wistful. There's too much glib predictability, for example, in
Toby's British friends, played by the blameless Patricia Kilgarriff
and Graeme Malcolm, and in the slightly creepy relationship between
Toby and Javier, a surfeit of sentiment that sounds whipped up by
the copywriters at Hallmark. If only it were all up to the level of
Murray and Quintero.
</P>

CONTINUED ADVENTURES IN THE INFRARED 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was backing up my hard drive recently when it suddenly
stopped. The cable connecting the backup device to my laptop had
come unplugged. Once again I cursed being part of the wired
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Most laptop peripherals have some sort of wire or cable to
connect to the computer. At times, the cables come loose, short out
or just don't work for some unknown reason. PC Card modems are a
particular problem because many models have two cables: one
connecting the card to the phone cord, and the phone cord itself,
which connects to the wall jack.
</P>
<P>
   My recent experience with wireless communications has started me
on the quest to get rid of as many wires as possible and have
peripherals talk to my laptop and each other via infrared.
Fortunately, the standard for how devices communicate by infrared
is set. Most manufacturers of infrared-enabled devices are members
of the Infrared Data Association (IrDA). Microsoft, a member, has
built infrared support into Windows 95/98.
</P>
<P>
   My latest foray into the wireless world was with the new DI 27
infrared modem for the Ericsson 600/700 series GSM phones. The DI
27 is a small unit that snaps on to the bottom of the phone. Since
the phone I have, the CF788 model, is only four inches long, the
phone/modem combo stretches to a whopping 5 inches. The DI 27 comes
with a CD-ROM, called the Mobile Office. The software lets you
manage the phone book and compose short messages from your laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the modem follows the same procedure, a Windows
Wizard, as any other modem. The difference is that no wires are
required. Once the DI 27 was installed, I was able to dial out to
my Internet service provider and get my e-mail and surf the Web the
first time I tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, going wireless affects the modem speed. You can't get
the same kinds of bandwidth that one gets over telephone wires. But
the DI 27 is rated at 9600 BPS, and with compression I was able to
get a 19.2 connection. That's acceptable speed for e-mail. It's a
little slow for any serious Web surfing because of large graphics
on many sites.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a minor problem compared to the convenience of
having the ability to connect from anywhere. During a recent trip,
I got lost on the way to meet friends for dinner. I kept getting a
busy signal when I tried to call for directions. I finally just
pulled off the highway, got out the laptop and the cell phone and
went to MapBlast for directions. I got back on track and arrived a
few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   I was not, however, able to use the phone and message manager
</P>
<P>
   software on the laptop. Every time I tried to install that piece
of the software, it crashed. After finally getting through to
Ericsson's technical support, I discovered that the DI 27 Mobile
Office has a conflict with Microsoft Outlook. Ericsson said it is
working on a fix for the problem, but in the meantime, you can't
use both. But I can manage the phone book from the phone and I'm
not going to be sending that many messages from the phone. Of
course, I heard that someone has written a program to do the same
thing from the Palm III.
</P>
<P>
   With all this wireless stuff, have I lost my membership in the
wired generation?

 HYPERTEXT FICTION ADDS A THIRD DIMENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hypertext fiction was born in the mid-1980s when writers tried
to expand the boundaries of literature by using computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But technology's boundaries have expanded since then, so
hypertext-fiction authors are now experimenting with techniques
that literally introduce a new dimension into their work.
</P>
<P>
   Holo-X and Waxweb, a pair of Web-based projects that were
launched independently on Thursday, employ Virtual Reality Markup
Language (VRML) software to create three-dimensional environments
for their words and images. The Tomb Robbers, a work-in-progress
that was put online last week, incorporates 360-degree QuickTime VR
panoramas that serve both as illustrations and story-navigation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Moulthrop, author of ``The Tomb Robbers'' and a
hypertext-fiction pioneer, said, ``I feel pretty strongly that
virtual space has profound aesthetic possibilities. These may not
be narrative so much as something else, but stories are a way to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Most examples of hypertext fiction, whether disk- or Web-based,
expect readers to immerse themselves in a story by clicking on
highlighted words, which are in turn linked to other written
passages.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, though, high-tech wordsmiths have routinely
employed drawings, photographs and other two-dimensional graphics
to lend meaning to their on-screen tales, so 3-D software was an
inevitable addition to the genre's ever-expanding palette of
multimedia tools.
</P>
<P>
   Those who intend to visit Holo-X must be forewarned that its
language is as rude as its graphics are crude. The writing on the
site is hyperlinked erotica, and while much of it strays down
conceptual pathways, there are still plenty of explicit
descriptions and more than a few naughty words. At the same time,
the graphics sport the cartoonish look that currently characterizes
VRML.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are able to enjoy or overlook the content, Holo-X
offers a fascinating glimpse at the future of hypertext. At its
best, fiction creates a world of its own. Here, it is embodied by
one, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit a simple one. Once the Holo-X site loads on a browser
that has been configured with the correct VRML plug-in, a 3-D
rendering of a single room appears on the screen. Visitors can
twirl around the space and zoom in on objects like a diary or a
wall socket that are connected to pop-up windows filled with
hyperlinked text. The site also contains a number of multimedia
elements, like a boom box that leads to music files.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative aspect of the site is a ``dialogue engine''
that generates the comments of the site's shapely protagonist, the
Sorceress of Language in Uncharted Territories (you can work out
the acronym yourself). Her comments, which appear as text, are
generated randomly, but the choices have been carefully programmed
so as not to lose the thread of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a substantial amount of writing,'' said Jay
Dillemuth, one of Holo-X's authors, in an interview from his
Berkeley, Calif., office. ``If it was all played linearly, there
would be over two-and-a-half hours of her talking.'' Instead, each
of the 20 possible scenes lasts 1 to 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The prose was penned by a half-dozen contributors, including
Dillemuth, Alex Cory and Caroline E. White, the site's principal
partners, and Mark Amerika, author of the hypertext fiction
Grammatron. When not romping in the gutter, the writing often
aspires to the poetic, as in this example: ``The joyful night in
inky spasms descends upon the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Holo-X's function is somewhat akin to that of a mink stole on a
prostitute: the high-toned site is designed to lure readers to
XRave, an adult-oriented virtual community that the partners plan
to open on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But Dillemuth maintained that Holo-X also represents an honest
effort to find a wider audience for experimental poetry and
hypertext fiction. ``That's where the sex comes from,'' he said.
``It's a way to bring users in and then undermine their
expectations by having it be smarter than it normally would be.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, David Blair's Waxweb became the first hypertext
fiction with VRML elements to be published on the Web. A
science-fiction story about an engineer who keeps bees that
eventually keep him, Waxweb began life as a full-length feature
film in 1992. The film was the first to be transmitted on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Blair launched a final, considerably more elaborate
version of the project. He also unveiled a preview site for his
next film- and VRML-based project, the abbreviated title of which
is The Telepathic Motion Picture of the Lost Tribes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1995 iteration of the Waxweb site, Blair took objects
from the movie, rendered them in 3-D and transformed them into
navigation devices. They continue to work in this fashion in the
new incarnation, but the New York artist has created new animation
for the objects and integrated them with the site's text and a
streaming-video version of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the site's complexity can be daunting, but once its
icon-driven commands are mastered, Waxweb's world of evocative
imagery comes alive, in part because it demands a high level of
user involvement.
</P>
<P>
   For Blair, the spatial attributes of VRML are essential to the
aesthetic mix, plunging his viewers into ``the short, constantly
crossed distance from text to space to moving picture -- time into
space, and back again, with story in both.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulthrop described his ``Tomb Robbers'' demo as a sketch, most
of it less than a week old. ``I can't swear there is a story in the
current version, or if it is the right story,'' he cheerfully
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The demo allows navigation through colorful panoramas or their
accompanying text, but the circular illustrations are clearly the
more attractive device for traveling through the imaginary realm. A
few of Moulthrop's students at the University of Baltimore are also
tinkering with QTVR panoramas as narrative tools.
</P>
<P>
   Moulthrop said he has always enjoyed the crossbreeding of text
and graphics found, for example, in comics and concrete poetry, and
that QTVR technology might appeal to him as a hypertext-fiction
author for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or you could come at the problem from hypertext theory,
arguing that some illusion of geometry is necessary to compensate
for the invisible complexity that underlies these machineries,'' he
said. ``But these are rationalizations for what is in fact a deeply
irrational affinity. I'm playing with QTVR right now because it
feels like a good thing to do. It seems to affect my brain in
interesting ways.''

   games generally works well, a new report suggests that some
publishers may be undermining the ratings, by marketing games
featuring gore and violence to children barely out of their Sesame
Street years.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict became apparent last week, after the release of the
fourth annual ``Video and Computer Game Report Card'' issued by a
media watchdog group, the Minneapolis-based National Institute on
Media and the Family. The report was unveiled at a news conference
with Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, who helped
push for the industry to adopt its voluntary rating system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report is timed for the onset of the busy
holiday game-buying season; overall, the industry is expected to
record about $6 billion in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a combination of telephone interviews with parents,
visits to game retail and rental outlets and inspections of about
90 games, the report card offered word of some positive
developments for parents concerned about games that emphasize
violence and offensive themes, finding that the rating system is
generally working well.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings appeared on virtually all the video and computer game
boxes examined for the report, and the researchers generally agreed
with the ratings assigned to the games -- seven categories ranging
from ``early childhood'' to content suitable for ``adults only.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report found that the ratings have not proved
altogether successful in keeping children away from graphic
content.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the report indicated that too few parents know
about or use the ratings. A national telephone survey of 529
parents conducted this summer by the National Institute on Media
and the Family found that only about 40 percent routinely checked a
game's rating when making a purchase. Another problem, the group
found, is that few retailers have policies in place to discourage
children from buying games rated for the older crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report charged that a small group of game makers
and distributors is marketing games to a younger-than-appropriate
age group. ``We are not claiming it's widespread, but there are
examples and we are asking the industry to take a look at it,''
said David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited several examples of inappropriate marketing,
among them an advertisement for a game called Resident Evil 2 in
the magazine Sports Illustrated for Kids. The game, made by Capcom
Entertainment, carries an ``M'' rating, indicating it is
appropriate for those age 17 and above.
</P>
<P>
   But the advertisement in Sports Illustrated for Kids was for a
toned-down version of the game made by a different company, Tiger
Electronics Ltd., and adapted for hand-held units. This version
carries a ``T,'' rating, meaning it is suitable for those 13 and
older, said Sandra M. Schneider, vice president of Tiger
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated for Kids, meanwhile, is aimed at 8- to
14-year-olds, and about half of its readership is older than 12,
said Tracey Vogt, a spokeswoman for the company. Magazine officials
saw little that was inappropriate in the advertisement itself and
felt the product was targeted at a good portion of the
publication's readership.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh found those arguments unconvincing, suggesting that many
parents would not distinguish between the various versions of the
game. He also said he is concerned that the advertisement could
whet the appetite of the magazine's younger readers for the more
violent version of the game. ``They use products that would gain
the attention of kids to sell products that are not supposed to be
sold to kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry representatives insist that matters are not as
simple as presented in the study, and that game marketing is
generally appropriately targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, which represents 41 major game publishers,
said that it is impossible for publishers ``to create an airtight
system'' to prevent children from ever being exposed to advertising
for games aimed at an older market.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein stressed that he is not defending some of the
advertisements in the industry, which prominently highlight the
goriest aspects of violent games. Nonetheless, he says there are
other brakes on children's access to arguably inappropriate
material that the report card fails to consider.
</P>
<P>
   One is that increasingly, the players themselves are older, and
that computer games are now often played by adults, not just young
boys. Another, he said, is that buyers of the items are usually
adults, because few children have the $50 or so available to buy
the games.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh remains skeptical and says it is children, in many cases,
who buy the games. His assessment of this year's report is that it
contains both good news and bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been progress in a lot of areas, and there are some
concerns in others,'' he said. The EDUCATION column is published

A CASE OF SPAM AND FREE SPEECH AT INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Hamidi, a former Intel Corp. employee who is unhappy
with the company, has succeeded several times since late 1996 in
getting his message across to current employees of the giant
chipmaker, with the help of the company's own e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   A California State judge may have put an end to that, however.
In late November, the judge, heeding arguments from Intel, issued a
preliminary injunction barring Hamidi and the group he founded,
Former and Current Employees of Intel, from sending bulk e-mail to
any addresses on the company's internal network.
</P>
<P>
   For some lawyers, the matter is just another open-and-shut case
involving unsolicited bulk e-mail, known as ``spam.'' They see it
as just the most recent example of a court's proper use of its
authority to stop a would-be intruder from delivering an unwanted
message through virtual trespass.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the case, Intel Corporation v. Kourosh Kenneth
Hamidi, et.al., is a different and troubling one. They say what was
quashed by the court's injunction was not the cyberspace equivalent
of pesky junk mail, but non-commercial speech deserving of the most
deferential First Amendment treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the matter, which is before Judge John R. Lewis of
California State Superior Court in Sacramento County, is scheduled
for Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi is a one-time Intel hardware engineer who was dismissed
in 1995 for reasons that are not entirely clear. The company says
the firing was not performance related, but that Hamidi was
dismissed after a long leave. Hamidi says he was dismissed because
of his protest of various company policies.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi accuses the company of a variety of abusive employment
practices, among them age and disability discrimination,
accusations the company denies. He is also the spokesman for FACE
Intel, which he says has about 100 members, both former and current
Intel employees. The group maintains a Web site featuring dozens of
critical essays about the Santa Clara-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in December 1996, according to court papers, Hamidi
and the group began sending e-mail messages to large numbers of
Intel employees at work. The messages ranged from accusations that
company layoffs would be far larger than the company had admitted
to suggestions that FACE Intel could help employees find better
jobs, but all had an anti-Intel theme.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi said he launched his e-mail campaign ``to inform and
educate Intel employees and support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company asked Hamidi and the group to stop the mailings. It
also used technological blockers to try to prevent the messages
from reaching their destinations, but with limited success. After
30,000 or so Intel employees received a September mailing, the
company filed suit against Hamidi and FACE Intel, essentially
charging them with trespassing on the company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Coeta J. Chambers, a company lawyer, insists that the matter is
a classic spam case, and that what distressed the company was not
the content of Hamidi's missives, but the inconvenience and
disruption they caused. Employees annoyed about the unwanted mail
would complain, for example, and computer personnel spent hours
trying to block the messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If each of the 29,000 employees targeted by these e-mailings
only spent two minutes evaluating, questioning and resolving these
highly disruptive and critical attacks on Intel, evident from the
text of the messages, Intel would lose almost 1,000 person-hours of
productive labor for each e-mail,'' one Intel court document said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Chambers said, Hamidi has other outlets for
expressing his views, including the Web site and demonstrations
like those that FACE Intel has conducted outside Intel offices.
</P>
<P>
   She said the mailings, sent to a company that does not make its
employee e-mail addresses public, are analogous to an outsider
stepping onto company property and demanding that a message he
bears be delivered to each member of the work force. ``The issue is
his trespassing, sending thousands of unwanted, unsolicited
messages to people who don't want to have them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers agree, saying a company has a right to keep its
property from being commandeered. ``This is an outsider trying to
use corporate facilities to put forth his own message,'' said Jay
W. Waks, a New York City employment lawyer who works on behalf of
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But Yochai Benkler, a professor at New York University's law
school and a specialist in communications law, is disturbed that in
this case, a virtual property right trumped the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   To date, commercial messages like advertising have typically
been the issue in lawsuits over spam. Perhaps the best known of
these was a suit that Compuserve successfully brought against Cyber
Promotions, a bulk e-mail promotions company. And courts have been
sympathetic to companies that want to put a stop to the disruption
that junk e-mail causes.
</P>
<P>
   But Benkler said the important difference in the Intel case is
that the controversial messages were not about commerce, they were
about ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, the court should have given more protection
to Hamidi. Moreover, Benkler said, the precedent could undermine a
notion that the United States Supreme Court emphasized in its
landmark Communications Decency Act case. The court noted that the
Internet can be a powerful democratizing force, one that gives
those who may not be able to afford a printing press or a broadcast
license the ability to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to connect to the Internet, Benkler argued, Intel
joined a sort of public network and should not, therefore, be
allowed by a court to silence speakers on it. ``With Hamidi, you
have here a pamphleteer,'' Benkler said. ``Maybe he's even
offensive to some people. But he is a person with a political
agenda of reaching a large constituency, the employees of Intel.
This is what we would hope for with the Internet. Let them decide
if he's a weirdo or someone to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hamidi, who has not hired a lawyer and is
representing himself in the case, says he wants to continue the
fight. ``Today it's Ken Hamidi's speech,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``But it's going to affect the free speech of
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He may get some assistance in his battle. Lawyers from both the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an electronic rights organization, are researching the
case and considering whether to get involved.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A BUG'S LIFE,'' featuring the voices of Dave Foley,
Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   With the same anthropomorphism that gave Lasseter's ``Toy
Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued, visually ingenious feat of
animation tells a tale of ant courage while incorporating lively
wit and an enchanting sense of nature. And it's a showcase for the
incredible range of facial expressions that make this type of
animation more and more invitingly lifelike all the time (Janet
Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``CELEBRITY,'' starring Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Joe
Mantegna, Winona Ryder and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Woody
Allen (R, 113 minutes). Following in the footsteps of ``La Dolce
Vita,'' Allen presents a New York in which the only thing worse
than being famous for nothing is not being famous at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, he places Branagh as a journalist with
all the Allen tics but none of the filmmaker's comic flair. The
bitter breakup at the center of the film (with Ms. Davis as the
journalist's beached wife) is regularly upstaged by guest-star
segments, a few of which stand out in witty relief against an
otherwise weary backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron dazzles as a capricious, headstrong model, and
Ms. Griffith plays a pampered movie diva with aplomb. Best of all
is Leonardo DiCaprio's brief, wicked appearance as a bad-boy wonder
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliviera and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's
plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles'
film is all in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a
road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search
of the boy's father, Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to
the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough
bravura performance is one of the year's very best (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``DANCING AT LUGHNASA,'' starring Meryl Streep, Brid
Brennan, Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack.
Directed by Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as
are the other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film
adapted from Brian Friel's delicate play.
</P>
<P>
   And if O'Connor has lost some of the play's intensity by opening
it up so overwhelmingly, he's also gained a good deal in the way of
lovely Irish scenery and quaint rural charm.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five unmarried
sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the return of
their gently eccentric brother from many years' missionary work in
Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this beguilingly
atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter these
characters' lives (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ELIZABETH,'' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand.
</P>
<P>
   For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama
for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ENEMY OF THE STATE,'' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   He also carries the story ably in his first real leading role,
that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds himself under
surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National Security
Agency and a satellite in space.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it all hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop
for plot questions. Sterling cast members like Hackman as an
eccentric technology wiz and Voight as a chilly advocate of
surveillance tactics add an additional touch of class (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``GODS AND MONSTERS,'' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan
Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a
performance that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the
year, McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, the gay
``Frankenstein'' director, playing him late in life.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds
his past coming back to greet him just as the present offers new
fascination in the Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also
fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a
Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days might have
been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll
portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast
and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``HAPPINESS,'' starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip
Seymour Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not
rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his ``Welcome to
the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores
loneliness in his murderously funny fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily
to ``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloguing this film's
perverse details: what emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a three-sister family with
hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming
pederast who is also a respected doctor and a loving father is
impossible to forget (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``JACK FROST,'' starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston and
Joseph Cross. Directed by Troy Miller (PG, 100 minutes). Keaton
stars as the title character, one of those rock-and-roll musicians
who are also great husbands and devoted dads.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about what happens after Jack dies in a Christmas
Eve automobile accident and returns to his family as a large,
wisecracking marshmallow man parked on the front lawn. As one more
Hollywood effort to look on the sunny side of fatality, this one is
so sugarcoated that it makes other recent efforts in the genre look
blisteringly honest by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The actors are as plausible and nice as possible in displaying
emotions as sincere as the soap flake snow that coats the sets
(Maslin). &QL;

COURT REVERSES PINOCHET EXTRADITION RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the latest twist to a convoluted legal odyssey,
England's highest court reversed itself Thursday and said the
former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, deserved a new appeal
because one of the three judges who ruled against him last month
had not disclosed a potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision, by a panel of five judges in the House
of Lords, was a rare rebuke of a colleague. It means Pinochet's
lawyers will be allowed to argue again next month that Pinochet
should not be extradited to Spain to face charges that he engaged
in torture and murder during his 17-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   The new panel will be drawn from seven Law Lords who did not sit
during the initial appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While not ruling whether Lord Leonard Hoffmann was biased
against the former dictator, five of his colleagues concluded that
Hoffmann's failure to disclose his association with Amnesty
International had given the appearance of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Amnesty International argued before a panel of five
Law Lords, including Hoffmann, who sits on the board of a charity
that raises money for Amnesty International. Hoffmann's wife has
worked for Amnesty International for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, who oversaw the latest appeal,
said, ``The earlier decision of this house cannot stand and must be
set aside. Lord Hoffmann, who did not disclose his links with
Amnesty International, was disqualified from sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers here say Lord Hoffmann may be forced to resign
because of the controversy, which has deeply embarrassed the
judiciary and has undermined its credibility. Lord Chancellor Derry
Irvine, Britain's highest legal authority, underscored the
seriousness with which the legal community is taking the matter by
writing a letter to Lord Browne-Wilkinson which said, ``We must
make every effort to ensure that such a state of affairs could not
occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann cast the deciding vote against Pinochet, breaking a 2-2
tie by saying the former dictator was not entitled to immunity from
prosecution because he was a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Law Lords form the highest court in England and Wales.
Historians said that aside from an obscure property case in 1823,
this was the first time anyone had challenged a Law Lords decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, a native of South Africa, was one of three Law Lords
who ruled that Pinochet did not have sovereign immunity because he
had engaged in gross violations of human rights by engaging in the
torture and murder of political opponents during and after the 1973
military coup in which he seized power.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International says attempts to paint Hoffmann as biased
are specious. It says the charity on which he serves as an unpaid
director was also supported by the chief justice of the High Court,
whose decision to initially grant immunity to Pinochet was
overturned by the Law Lords. They also argued that the London law
firm representing Pinochet had donated to the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bunting, a spokesman for Amnesty International,
acknowledged Thursday's ruling was ``a step backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We will remain optimistic that any future
Lords' decision will come to the same conclusion as last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the first victory for Pinochet's lawyers since
October, when the British High Court agreed with them that Pinochet
was entitled to sovereign immunity because the allegations against
him had stemmed from actions he took as a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Spain and several human rights organizations,
including Amnesty International, appealed the High Court ruling in
the House of Lords, which ruled in their favor on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jack Straw, the British home secretary, cleared the
way for the extradition proceedings to begin, saying the former
dictator was not entitled to any form of immunity and did not
deserve to avoid prosecution on compassionate grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A Chilean government report says at least 3,197 people were
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's reign, while human rights
organizations say the figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet remains under house arrest at the mansion he is renting
20 miles southwest of London during the extradition proceedings,
which could drag on for months.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's determination to go ahead with the proceedings has
severely strained relations with Chile, which recalled its
ambassador from London to protest Straw's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pinochet is returned to Spain and is convicted, he will
not be sent to prison, because under Spanish law no one older than
75 can be incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   But in what is a warning to despots everywhere, Pinochet could
spend years defending himself, as other countries have formally
lodged warrants for his arrest or have hinted that they want to try
Pinochet for murdering and torturing citizens who got caught up in
his coup.
</P>
<P>
   While the Spanish will get first crack at Pinochet, France and
Switzerland have formally asked that he be extradited to face
charges for the murder of their nationals. Italy is considering
making a similar request.

   Bleeding ulcer won't keep Jackets' Collier off the court
   By Norman Arey
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech was bitten again by the injury bug. This
time its budding star Jason Collier, who has played only two games
for the Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-1 transfer from Indiana, who has 44 points and 16
rebounds in his first two starts, was diagnosed Thursday as having
a bleeding ulcer. Collier had gone through a bout with the flu two
weeks ago and then continued losing weight last week, but he
thought it was becaue of his exam schedule and the lingering
effects of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night after the Yellow Jackets' win over Wofford,
Collier began throwing up blood. Tech team physician Angelo Galante
provided the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to be careful about what I eat,'' Collier
said. ``(Trainer) David (Chewning) is coming up with a diet that
I'll have to stay on, and I'll be taking some anti-acid-type stuff.
But it shouldn't affect my playing, and I don't think I'll miss any
games or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier's ulcer is the latest problem in a year gone bad for
Tech coach Bobby Cremins and his basketball program. The Jackets
lost superstar Dion Glover for the year with a knee injury on the
first day of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Babul, a starter at small forward, has missed three games
with a severe ankle sprain and is not expected to play against
Kentucky Saturday With starting guard Travis Spivey and backup
center Pablo Machado gone via transfer, the roster already was
depleted.

EPHRON GETS SPAM-HAPPY WITH `YOU'VE GOT MAIL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would someone please tell director Nora Ephron that less is
invariably more?
</P>
<P>
   As she did in her 1993 hit ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and in the
John Travolta comedy ``Michael,'' Ephron denies audiences any
spontaneous emotional response to her movie's action. She unleashes
a torrent of song designed to trigger every impulse we're supposed
to feel at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   In a movie as well-cast as ``You've Got Mail,'' which is the
third screen pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, peripheral noise is
a detriment. They're more than capable of holding their own for a
couple of hours of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the play ``Parfumerie'' by Miklos Laszlo,
which was made into ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' a 1940 comedy
directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy
Stewart, and into a 1949 musical ``In the Good Old Summertime,''
with Judy Garland and Van Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shop Around the Corner'' was a deft romantic work rife
with pretense and ulterior motives and, of course, its two sparring
protagonists ultimately fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   Ephron pays homage to that clever film here: it's the name of
Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) children's bookstore in Manhattan's Upper
West Side. There is a tranquil, small-town appeal to this
neighborhood shop that is about to be obliterated by tycoon and
heir Joe Fox (Hanks), who is the brains behind a Barnes &AMP;
Noble-type enterprise called ``Fox &AMP; Sons Book-sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to build another of his discount super-retail
outlets _ where else? Just around the corner from Kathleen's barely
surviving business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joe and Kathleen have discovered the intimate
anonymity of e-mail. Since they met in a chat room, they've begun a
fast friendship that overwhelms their relationships with their
``significant others.'' Kathleen lives with Frank Navasky (Greg
Kinnear), a champion-of-the-underdog columnist for the New York
Observer, and Joe cohabitates with book editor Patricia Eden
(Parker Posey), who is so hyper ``she makes coffee nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair find tranquility and companionship online while waging
a war in public. And, naturally, neither knows the business rival
is the ideal ``other'' sending electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   As with all of Epron's films, the mystery of illusion and
wishful thinking is a huge component in the plot. And the film's
look suggests a yearning for better times gone by and almost
too-perfect values. This is a New York that is immaculate and
shiny; it's safe for a lone woman to walk down the street at
midnight and there is no whiff of industrial waste blowing in off
the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   It's a privileged fairy tale that's been updated with late
20th-century techno-wizardry to make it click. Despite the chaste
chemistry and easy familiarity that always makes watching Ryan and
Hanks a joy, there's a surprising lack of menace in Ephron's
prettified threats of buyouts and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She never lets us forget that this is only make-believe and,
worse, she belabors the point, letting the terminally cute charm of
the story push what's essentially a 90-minute date flick into a
thinly stretched two-hour therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe and Kathleen finally realize they're perfect for each
other despite different approaches to business ethics, Ephron
blasts swelling strains of ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' atop
their first chaste kiss. They may be over the rainbow, but we're
just about around the bend, dying to reach the theater exit.
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail. Directed by Nora Ephron. Written by Samson
Raphaelson. Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey.

 UNDATED: sets (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``LITTLE VOICE,'' starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan
McGregor and Michael Caine. Directed by Mark Herman (R, 99
minutes). The main attraction here is watching wispy Ms. Horrocks
put on a spectacular one-woman diva festival, with her phenomenal
mimicry of musical grande dames from Judy Garland to Marilyn
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   What works less well is the broad and stagy story built around
her. As the timid title character, she is harangued by her blowsy
mother (Ms. Blethyn), latched onto by the talent agent who is the
mother's boyfriend (Caine) and courted by a nice young man who
loves his pet pigeons. In that last role, McGregor makes a
telephone installer scintillating and once again shows that he can
do anything. Incidentally, the soundtrack is divine (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MEET JOE BLACK,'' starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and
Claire Forlani. Directed by Martin Brest (PG-13, 170 minutes).
Hopkins zestily plays a noble tycoon in this otherwise somnolent,
emotion-free, nearly three-hour (!) weepie. And Pitt appears
blankly as Death with blond highlights, serving as a kind of
personal afterlife trainer to the tycoon, whose number is up. Ms.
Forlani plays the big man's beautiful daughter in a story based on
``Death Takes a Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a suffocatingly lavish film that cries out for a trip to the
cutting room, virtually every character is allowed to overstay his
or her welcome, with Pitt especially diminished by the
watching-paint-dry pace. The story drags on so slowly that there's
room for a subplot about party planning, and several scenes
establish how much Death loves peanut butter (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``PSYCHO,'' starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. Directed by
Gus Van Sant (R, 100 minutes). It turns out that the apparent rocks
in Van Sant's head, as he contrived this near-exact color replica
of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic, were only pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   His remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) is artful
and good looking, faltering only when it tries to improve on the
brilliant original blueprint. The casting of Vaughn as Norman Bates
is the film's biggest Achilles' heel, since the performance
Hitchcock elicited from Anthony Perkins remains an impossible act
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Van Sant has tried an outlandish experiment and come up
with what are, especially for fans of the original, intriguing
variations on a theme (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R,
113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and
turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy also envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow
make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob
Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes).
This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the
sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``WAKING NED DEVINE,'' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly
and Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast
of hearty characters in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' prize-winning career directing television commercials
means that everyone here is an amusing eccentric with colorful
quirks, and that the septuagenarian stars' naked motorcycle-riding
scenes are played for all they're worth. This comedy doesn't have
the tart edge of ``The Full Monty,'' but it knows how to coax
laughs from making a spectacle of elderly gentlemen in the buff
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

PINOCHET WINS FIRST APPEAL IN EXTRADITION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a step that raised Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of
escaping extradition to Spain and returning home to Chile, the
House of Lords on Thursday set aside its decision denying him
immunity from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords scheduled a new hearing a month from now, and if the
83-year-old former Chilean dictator succeeds in convincing a new
five-judge panel of his claim to immunity he will be free to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decision Thursday, Pinochet faced an extended stay in
custody in England while his case proceeded through motions and
appeals that could stretch on for more than a year. Spain is
seeking to try him in Madrid on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture in the deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Thursday was the first time in the history of the
Law Lords, England's highest court, that a verdict had even been
reviewed, much less rejected. A five-judge panel set up for the
purpose heard arguments Tuesday and Wednesday, and Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, the chief Law Lord, announced their unanimous
verdict on the floor of the ornate upper chamber Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the judges had not had time to compose their
opinions and would make them public in January, there was no doubt
that they had accepted arguments from Pinochet's lawyers that the
3-2 verdict reached last month was tainted by bias.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' sole point in pressing the appeal was that Lord
Hoffmann, the judge who cast the decisive vote in the ruling that
denied Pinochet immunity, had erred in not declaring his
association with Amnesty International, which was an active
participant in the case. The group had been given permission to
make its own case against Pinochet alongside British prosecutors
during the six days of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Hoffmann, it emerged, has been a director and chairman of a
principal Amnesty International charity since 1990, and his wife,
Gillian, has worked in the press and publications office of the
human rights group since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Montgomery, Pinochet's lead trial lawyer, told the panel
of Law Lords on Tuesday that ``what judges must not do once they
have accepted a post with a charity is to hear a case touching on
the very subject matter that charity has sworn to abolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montgomery pointed out that Amnesty International considered
her client an enemy and associated him with the very crimes he is
charged with in the Spanish petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider how it appears,'' she said, ``there are
reasons to fear that Lord Hoffmann, as a director of a company
sworn to secure the end of torture and extra-judicial
disappearances, would be predisposed to find that no state immunity
would attach to such acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling Nov. 25, the Law Lords said that crimes like
torture and hostage-taking did not enjoy sovereign immunity because
they could not be considered functional acts of a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Browne-Wilkinson made his announcement in the
characteristically understated manner of the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a loose leaf notebook to largely vacant red
leather benches, he said: ``I am satisfied that the earlier
decision of this House cannot stand and must be set aside. It is
impossible in the time available to prepare and give full reasons
for that view _ on the other hand it is essential that the parties
should know where they stand as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling brought a sharp reversal in the reactions of
opponents of Pinochet, who have been cheered by a series of
unexpected turns in their favor, and for the general's supporters,
who have become increasingly angry at the government for not
setting him free.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case should now be brought to an end,'' said Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservatives' chief law enforcement representative,
hailing the ruling. ``This is a case which should be settled in
Chile, not here in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reyes, spokesman for Chile Democratico and Chileans in
Exile, said he was ``in total shock'' at the decision and feared
that this ``could be the way out for Pinochet.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy McEntee, the chairman of Amnesty International, said:
``Augusto Pinochet has very inventive lawyers. They are very good,
very effective. They will make this a long case, one that is hard
for him to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is being brought by Baltasar Garzon, a Spanish judge
investigating atrocities during the ``dirty wars'' in Latin America
in the 1970s and 1980s. The British police arrested Pinochet on
Oct. 16 while he was recuperating from back surgery in a London
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The general won the first legal round, winning a unanimous
decision from a three-judge panel of London's High Court on Oct. 28
upholding his claim to sovereign immunity. It was that decision
that the House of Lords overruled a month later in the verdict that
was laid aside Thursday.

ALAMO DIARY WINDS UP AT UT AFTER ALL _ BUT THEY CUDDA GOT IT
WHOLESALE

   Rafael Palmeiro. Brett Hull. Davy Crockett?
</P>
<P>
   Importing heroes to Texas has become second nature for Tom
Hicks, owner of baseball's Texas Rangers and hockey's Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hicks is making news with some big-time bidding that has
nothing to do with negotiations with millionaire professional
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hicks and partner Charles Tate gave their alma mater,
the University of Texas at Austin, the controversial firsthand
account of the Kentucky frontiersman's capture and summary
execution after the Battle of the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   They paid $350,000 at a November auction _ after unwittingly
topping UT's own best offer of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir by the Mexican officer, Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la
Pena, describes the capture and summary execution of Davy Crockett
after the 1836 battle, which runs counter to the myth that has
grown around the coonskin-capped frontiersman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rich a historical resource,'' said Don Carleton,
director of UT's Center of American History, who had bid $300,000
for the document, only to be beaten by a $350,000 counter offer
made by a New York agent, who wouldn't identify her clients at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best eyewitness accounts of the Texas
Revolution,'' Carleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tate is president of Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, a private
investment firm. Hicks, a member of the UT System Board of Regents,
is chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' recent deals as a sports franchise owner have included a
$45 million contract with Palmeiro, a power-hitting first baseman,
and a $17 million deal with Hull, the 15th leading scorer in
National Hockey League history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Crockett mention is brief, it has drawn much
attention to the papers, which diehard Crockett fans insist are
forged.
</P>
<P>
   While some amateur historians have described the de la Pena
papers as an elaborate hoax, most mainstream scholars of the period
say they believe the memoir is authentic. Some add, however, that a
full run of tests would make them feel more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton said tests on the paper arranged last summer by
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, the auction house, convinced him that
they're real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tests already have been done to our satisfaction _ a slam
dunk,'' he said, ruling out further examination. ``We do not
believe it's a forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoir indicates that Crockett and a handful of other Alamo
defenders were captured and executed, which is contrary to the
image of Crockett dying on the walls, at the end wielding his long
rifle, Betsy, like a club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is he was a hero, however he died,''
Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither UT nor Hicks and Tate had any idea each was aggressively
pursuing the document for the same end, to add it to the Eugene C.
Baker Texas History Collection at UT's Sid Richardson Hall.
Carleton said a public announcement of UT's participation might
have affected bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding lasted an intense four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bid came right back at me until $300,000, then I bid
350,000,'' Wendy Evans Hoff, the agent working on behalf of Hicks
and Tate, said at the time. ``I wanted to make it very clear to the
room that I wanted to buy this lot, that I would be the successful
bidder. And it worked. I sent that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the partners informed UT in advance of their intentions they
might have saved themselves $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irony, irony,'' Carleton said. ``Well, these things happen.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Thursday that air
strikes had reduced the ability of Iraq to attack its neighbors but
conceded that bombings probably could not accomplish the greater
goals of removing Saddam Hussein from power and eliminating his
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is,'' vowed Defense Secretary William Cohen,
``we're going to continue to contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while bombing can contain Saddam, such attacks also
complicate longer range strategies, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the air strikes could end any hopes of diplomatic
disarmament where Saddam would comply with inspections by the
United Nations Special Commission or UNSCOM. And the bombing could
actually strengthen his domestic standing as the beleaguered Iraqi
populace unites against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it is doubtful that bombing would get rid of
Saddam Hussein or make him comply with UNSCOM. In fact, it could
end UNSCOM's role,'' said Simona Sharoni, a professor of peace and
conflict resolution at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UNSCOM process is dead,'' agreed Scott Ridder, a former UN
arms inspector in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Several days of bombing is ``a campaign with no end games,''
Ridder said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``We've tried to crack this
wall of protection Saddam has built around himself for years now
and failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Thursday morning attacks, the warships in the Persian
Gulf fired more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B
attack planes struck Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier U.S.S. Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of
southern Iraq. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In a Pentagon briefing Thursday, Cohen admitted that air strikes
can meet only limited objectives. But he said those objectives are
being achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to destabilize (Saddam's) regime,'' he said.
``The goal is to decrease and diminish his capacity to threaten his
neighbors and to either deliver weapons of mass destruction and,
hopefully, be able to hit some of the facilities that would put him
in a position to be making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said UN inspectors had reported that Saddam Hussein had
``effectively emasculated UNSCOM'' anyway and ``they were on the
ground but not able to do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the bombing pushes Saddam to oust the inspectors
completely, Iraq would be able to resume its programs to build
biological, chemical or even nuclear weapons. Those developments,
of course, would likely compel the United States to bomb again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my hope that -- following this operation -- that
Saddam Hussein would see the wisdom of finally complying by
allowing UNSCOM to return and do its job,'' said Cohen. ``Failing
that, we intend to maintain our forces'' and ``to continue the
containment strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And should he either threaten his neighbors or try to
reconstitute his weapons-of-mass-destruction program, we are
prepared to take action again,'' Cohen warned.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bombing is also unlikely to either kill Saddam -- who is
relatively safe in underground bunkers -- or to inspire an
insurrection against him. Some analysts said that the Iraqi
dictator may even be empowered by Americans bombing during Ramadan,
the Islamic holy month that begins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Iraqis welcome bombing at this point,'' said
William Arkin, an MSNBC military analyst. He explained that the
attacks not only enhance Saddam's hold on power, but also drive a
wedge between the United States and Britain, who are conducting the
mission, and other U.N. countries who don't support it.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate briefing, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the bombing is only a limited solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term goal at the moment through this military
campaign is to degrade his ability to develop and deploy his
weapons of mass destruction,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than air strikes to meet the longer range
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A medium-term goal is in fact to have him comply with the
Security Council resolutions,'' Albright added. ``Longer term, we
have come to the determination that the Iraqi people would benefit
if they had a government that really represented them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we know that this is something that cannot be done
overnight, and we are working with the various opposition groups on
a longer range way of trying to help them help themselves to have a
regime that represents them,'' She said.
</P>
<P>
   And that would take more than even smart bombs.

SHORT NOTES ON WEEKEND TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an example of unvarnished courage, it would be hard to beat
Nargess Nateghi, 16, who has spent all her life fighting cystic
fibrosis. The drugs that have kept her alive have stolen her
hearing and damaged her kidneys. Now her only hope of survival is a
lung transplant. During an interview, this young woman seems to
understand the severity of her plight yet retains a remarkable
composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any reason to worry,'' she says quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nateghi is one of the patients encountered in the first
edition of ``Health Diary,'' a no-frills half-hour magazine program
produced for public television stations at KTCA in Minneapolis-St.
Paul. The series, which began this fall, reaches the New York
region Saturday on WLIW, Channel 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health Diary'' has production values somewhere between a
snippet of the 11 p.m. news and a 2 a.m. infomercial. But its
subjects exemplify human values that carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   The first program also has a report on glaucoma, including an
interview with Kirby Puckett, the former Minnesota Twins slugger
whose baseball career was abruptly ended by the disease. As a
professional athlete, he says, he had received so many physical
examinations that he never guessed there could be a common
condition for which he was not being screened.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors get their say in these reports, too, but the patients'
own words have a natural grace. Tears glisten but never fall. The
second program, on gastric bypass (or stomach stapling) introduces
45-year-old identical twins whose special bond was severely tested
when one had the operation, slimming down to a size 8 and leaving
her sister a size 26. (She, too, has now had the surgery.)
</P>
<P>
   In the third program, Scott Burton, a professional juggler whose
cancer was successfully stopped by a bone transplant in his leg,
must execute a tricky emotional maneuver. He has to give up his
dream of being a great juggler because he can no longer do the
flips and jumps that amazed the crowds. But he concludes, ``It
really wasn't all that bad, considering that I didn't die.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the carefully chosen patients, the series has another
big asset, its host, Sioban Cleary. Ms. Cleary comes from Ireland,
where she conducted a similar program. She projects a common-sense
warmth toward her interview subjects and the audience. And when she
closes each installment with ``Goodbye and take care,'' it sounds
like a heartfelt benediction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Momentous political shifts always breed unintended consequences,
and frequently the changes are cultural. So when the Soviet Union
collapsed a decade ago, it stood to reason that artistic ground
would begin to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the happier consequences of that nation's
disintegration has been the reappearance in the West of the Russian
singer.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this special breed of artist was largely absent from
European and American view, a casualty of Stalinism, World War II
and cold-war politics. True, exemplars like the contralto Zara
Dolukhanova, the mezzo-soprano Irina Arkhipova and the soprano
Galina Vishnevskaya achieved some popularity in the West, but they
were deployed both as political tools and as artistic ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not since the czarist era have Russian singers attained
the unfettered mainstream exposure they currently enjoy, once more
regularly appearing in Western opera houses and signing contracts
with major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most conspicuous example of their resurgence can be
found on the Philips label, on which the indefatigable conductor
Valery Gergiev spearheads a seemingly endless series of Russian
operas, including many obscure works.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a result of his efforts, several soloists have
emerged as stars in their own right, including the soprano Galina
Gorchakova, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina and, to a lesser
extent, the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Widely popular and critically acclaimed, these three singers
supplement their operatic work with successful recital tours and
have lately signed exclusive contracts with Philips, which is
practically cornering the market on Russian vocalists these days.
</P>
<P>
   And as three recent disks confirm, the label's confidence in
these performers is not misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   On her disk of Russian romances titled ``Memories of Love'' (446
720-2), Ms. Gorchakova, accompanied by a piano, sings bittersweet
works by Balakirev, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov,
Rachmaninoff and Aleksandr Dargomyzhsky, all of which perfectly
suit this soprano's sepulchral timbre.
</P>
<P>
   The Glinka songs make a particularly deep impression. With a
firm, darkly tinted voice, Ms. Gorchakova provides a pointed
melancholy to ``The Lark,'' delivering with the song's last phrase
_ ``Someone will remember me and sigh in secret'' _ with
devastating effect. For ``I Remember the Wonderful Moment,'' based
on a Pushkin text, she alternates between naivete and
worldweariness. And ``You Will Soon Forget Me'' is a study in rue.
But in the high-spirited ``Bolero,'' the soprano breaks with
restraint and opts for gripping abandon.
</P>
<P>
   In Tchaikovsky, too, Ms. Gorchakova impresses. Listeners may
recall the fine performance of the Letter Scene from ``Eugene
Onegin'' that appeared on a Philips disk two years ago. On this new
record, the soprano animates four of the composer's songs,
beginning with a hypnotic lullaby. The three love songs that follow
find a wistful Ms. Gorchakova highlighting the undercurrent of
loneliness pervading the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Dargomyzhsky's music may not be familiar outside Russia, but his
songs stir the soul as much any on this disk. Few listeners will be
able to resist the passionate pull of ``I Love Him Still,'' for
instance, in which Ms. Gorchakova spins a simple line with
eloquence and dignity. The sentimental ``Sixteen Years'' is no less
involving, recounting a timid girl's first romance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention lavished on his piano concertos, the
songs of Rachmaninoff remain little known. This is a pity, for
there is a mysterious beauty to these miniature dramas. Ms.
Gorchakova captures that sense of atmosphere completely, especially
in ``A Dream'' and ``Lilacs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Larissa Gergieva (a sister of Gergiev) proves an
imaginative accompanist, her painterly touch enhancing the spell
cast by Ms. Gorchakova. Unfortunately, neither artist is helped by
this CDs overly reverberant acoustics, which makes both singer and
pianist sound as if they're performing in a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borodina's album, ``Bolero'' (289 446 708-2), also with
piano accompaniment, is ostensibly a Spanish program rather than a
Russian one. But though the record features music by Falla and
Granados (and even Ravel's ``Spanish Song''), the bulk of the disk
is devoted to works by Shostakovich, Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Anton
Rubinstein and Mark Minkov, all of whom found inspiration in images
of sunny Iberia. &QL;

DEAD JOURNALIST WAS HOMICIDE VICTIM, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An American journalist whose body was found two
weeks after disappearing in a remote area of the Sierra Madre
mountains in western Mexico was strangled, a state coroner and
federal officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy performed on Philip True, the Mexico City-based
correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News, showed the cause of
death to be asphyxiation by strangulation, and that something had
been wrapped tightly around the victim's neck, said Mario Rivas
Souza, coroner for the state of Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a homicide, not an accident,'' Rivas told reporters in
Guadalajara, where True's body was being held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments contradicted initial reports that True,
50, had accidentally fallen to his death in a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Express-News editors said that Mexican offficials also told them
that True had been struck on the head with a blunt object.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members in San Antonio were told about True's death at a
meeting Wednesday _ hours before the company's holiday party _ by
Publisher W. Lawrence Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing remains unclear, although one
forensic official said True still had his watch and wedding ring,
signs suggesting that robbery was not the primary reason.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Simon, America's program coordinator for the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists, said there was ``compelling
evidence that this death was related to his work as a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo ordered federal and state authorities to investigate True's
death.
</P>
<P>
   True, an experienced hiker, left Mexico City on Nov. 29 on what
was supposed to be a fact-finding vacation. He planned to explore
the mountain regions of Jalisco and Narayit in search of the
Huichol Indians, an isolated tribe, for future articles.
</P>
<P>
   True was due back in Mexico City on Dec. 10, but never returned
and didn't return phone calls from worried relatives. On Tuesday,
dozens of Mexican soldiers began scouring the area in search of
True.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, there was hope. Searchers reported finding a lost
and hungry foreigner named Philip in the same area. The man turned
out to be Philip Truempler, a 25-year-old Swiss researcher.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was found Wednesday in the 300-foot-deep Chapangana
Canyon by army aircraft sweeping the area.
</P>
<P>
   A former union organizer and wallpaper hanger, True entered
journalism when he was in his mid-30s. Later, he joined the
Express-News as Laredo bureau chief and was the Mexico
correspondent since January 1996. He is survived by his wife,
Marta, and his sister, Bonnie Biggs, of Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always at home in Mexico,'' Walker said in a telephone
interview Thursday. ``He just blended in. There was nothing about
him you couldn't like.''

   UNDATED: sunny Iberia. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The record begins with a rarity, Shostakovich's colorful
``Spanish Songs,'' six ballads based on poems by two Russians. To
these evocative pieces, Ms. Borodina brings a plummy tone and
plenty of spunk. ``Farewell, Granada,'' finds a woman departing her
homeland after the death of her lover, and ``Little Stars'' tells
of a cheeky youth who trades guitar and astronomy lessons for
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronda'' is a call to make merry, and this mezzo's warm,
inviting tone makes the offer hard to resist. For the tender ``Eyes
of Ebony,'' Ms. Borodina becomes a girl driven to distraction by
unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the fire that pervades Ms. Gorchakova's account of
Glinka's ``Bolero,'' Ms. Borodina favors sultriness, and one can
practically see the mezzo shimmying up to some young gallant and
seducing him.
</P>
<P>
   Falla's ``Seven Popular Songs'' are a bold choice for a Russian
singer, but Ms. Borodina, adopting a Castilian lisp, fully steps up
to the challenge. Naturally, her diction is not as idiomatic as
Victoria de los Angeles's, yet the mezzo connects with these
passionate strains.
</P>
<P>
   Even tongue-twisters like ``Seguidilla From Murcia'' do not
defeat her. She brings poignancy to ``Asturian Song'' and a dreamy
calm to ``Lullaby.'' And she presents a searing account of
``Polo,'' one woman's curse on love itself.
</P>
<P>
   Semyon Skigin's assertive piano accompaniment suits Ms.
Borodina's bold approach. He is a gifted player with more than a
few ideas of his own. (Listen to the extra bounce he lends the
introduction to Falla's ``Jota,'' for example.) Yet Skigin proves
no stranger to nuance, either, as his playing on Minkov's bucolic
``Landscape'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky is the most famous singer to have emerged from the
former Soviet Union. In 1989, he won the BBC's Cardiff Singer of
the World Competition, beating Bryn Terfel for top honors. His
latest disk, ``Arie Antiche'' (289 456 543-2), with the Academy of
St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner, breaks new
ground by featuring the baritone in Italian arias of the 17th and
18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the popularity of these ardent works has declined over
the years, Beniamino Gigli, Ezio Pinza, Janet Baker and other
singers memorably recorded many of them, and the pieces _ by both
famous composers like Handel, Gluck and Vivaldi and neglected ones
like Durante, Caccini and Stradella _ have much to recommend them.
A few, like Gluck's ``Che faro senza Euridice?'' and Handel's
``Ombra mai fu,'' have retained their renown, but most will be
unfamiliar to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky begins on an exultant note, with Giacomo
Carissimi's ``Vittoria, mio core,'' in which a man heroically
proclaims his freedom from ``love's vile servitude.'' Here, the
plush-voiced baritone is at his swaggering best, dispatching
coloratura with ease. He's no less fine in Vivaldi's ``Se il cor
guerriero,'' where a martial antiwar cry is set against ``Four
Seasons''-like accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   In Giuseppe Giordani's ``Caro mio ben,'' the baritone delivers a
declaration of love in a resonant, fervent voice, easily displacing
Pinza's late-in-life recording of the song. Yet Hvorostovsky falls
short of the standard set by Gigli's incomparably sensitive
account, now sadly out-of-print.
</P>
<P>
   Vivaldi's ``Orribile lo scempio,'' yet another antiwar jeremiad,
affords the baritone an opportunity for vocal gymnastics, which he
gleefully seizes. Antonio Caldara's sublime ``Selve amiche,'' is
much gentler stuff, with the singer imploring the woods to grant
his aching heart refuge. But though the baritone feels Caldara's
music, he lacks Gigli's clutching desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Gigli also lingers in the memory when hearing Hvorostovsky in
Alessandro Scarlatti's hymn to the sun, ``Gia il sole dal Gange.''
The baritone takes the tune at an impressively speedy clip and
lends it bluff ardor, but he lacks Gigli's gay, celebratory sense.
</P>
<P>
   This CD concludes with Hvorostovsky's plaintive performance of
Alessandro Stradella's ``Pieta, Signore,'' the longest work on the
record. A plea to God's mercy, the piece benefits from the
baritone's supple treatment and exquisite diction. Actually,
Hvorostovsky's Italian is crisply idiomatic throughout the disk.
</P>
<P>
   For support, the baritone couldn't have done better. Marriner
conducted a similar album for Ms. Baker two decades ago, and his
appreciation for these scores seems only to have grown with time.
Under his keen baton, the academy plays in typically polished
fashion, its strings lissome, winds pellucid and brass glinting.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, circumstances would not have permitted Ms.
Gorchakova, Ms. Borodina and Hvorostovsky their international
careers. Now, Western ears regularly seek out the bold, viscous
sonorities of the Russian singer, and a rudely interrupted line
that began when the gramophone was young thrives yet again. How
lucky for music lovers that times have changed.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New
York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless
otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on
Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by
telephone. Gallery admission is free. X denotes a highly
recommended show.

<P>
   `BAULE: AFRICAN ART/WESTERN EYES,' Museum for African Art, 593
Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Jan.
3). Once again this exemplary museum proves that connoisseurship
and anthropology do not make strange bedfellows. These 135
breathtaking objects include elegant portrait masks, spirit spouse
figures, feared and fearful animal masks and items for everyday
use. Supplemented by an unorthodox but effective use of dioramas
and videotapes, they illuminate nearly every aspect of Baule life _
private and public, religious and secular _ and belief systems.
This rare, sharply delineated cultural portrait was organized by
Susan M. Vogel, the museum's founding director, who spent three
decades studying the Baule of the Ivory Coast. Tuesdays through
Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6
p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, children, students and the elderly.

<P>
   `CUBISM AND FASHION,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue
at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through March 14). After the
over-the-top high-priced kitsch of its entertaining Gianni Versace
survey, the Costume Institute's latest offering is so pure and
restrained that it seems almost penitential. It traces the
reverberations of modern art's most earthshaking movement through
the work of several generations of modern designers, from Callot
Soeurs to Geoffrey Beene. The star of the show is the 1920's
designer Madeleine Vionnet, still radical after all these years.
The show begins on a high note, with a vivid demonstration of the
emergence of modern dress and the female body from the stand-alone
upholstery of Edwardian ball gowns. Otherwise, the exhibition comes
to life only intermittently, and is marred by irrelevant
inclusions. One is left wondering if this is because Cubism was too
intellectual and austere for its effect on fashion to be easily
defined, or if more space was required to give the subject its due.
Hours and admission: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 a.m. to 8:45 p.m.;
Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.
Admission: $8; $4, students and the elderly. (Roberta Smith)

<P>
   X `INSIDE OUT: NEW CHINESE ART,' Asia Society, 725 Park Ave., at
70th Street, (212) 517-2742, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center,
22-25 Jackson Ave., Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084
(through Jan. 3). Art in China has changed dramatically in the last
few decades, and this big, stimulating show gives a sense of
vanguard developments on the post-Mao mainland and in Hong Kong and
Taiwan and among expatriate Chinese artists in the West. The work
ranges from video to Western-inspired Pop painting, from
spectacular, room-filling installations to ink scrolls. The
messages are complex and contradictory: myth, humor, pessimism and
nostalgia rub shoulders, often in a single work. There are ups and
downs in this tip-of-the-iceberg showcase, but it's a benchmark
event. Asia Society: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.;
Thursdays to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. P.S. 1: Wednesdays
through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $4 to Asia Society, $5
to P.S. 1; $2, students and the elderly, at both. (Holland Cotter)

<P>
   X `MIRO'S BLACK AND RED SERIES: A NEW ACQUISITION IN CONTEXT,'
Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd St., (212) 708-9400 (through
Feb. 2). An ogre-ish head of Franco dominates a powerful series of
eight small etchings produced in 1938 by the Spanish artist Joan
Miro (1893-1983). In stark black and bloody red on white grounds,
the etchings speak _ in Miro's eloquent language of signs and
symbols _ of the horror and mutilation occasioned by the Spanish
Civil War. Recently acquired by the museum, the prints are the
cornerstone of a show that includes some 150 prints, illustrated
books, drawings, posters, photographs, paintings and sculptures by
Miro and his Surrealist predecessors and contemporaries. It not
only documents Miro's intense preoccupation with etching at the
time but also shows the impact of Surrealism on his art and the
international reverberations of the Civil War. The all-star cast of
works demonstrates yet again the remarkable depth of the Modern's
resources. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30
a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:30 p.m. Admission; $9.50; $6.50
students and the elderly. Open, free, this Wednesday. (Grace
Glueck)

<P>
   X JACKSON POLLOCK, Museum of Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd St., (212)
708-9400 (through Feb. 2). A landmark. If you care about art, you
live for exhibitions like this, in which an artist, against the
heavy odds of his skewed talent and unhinged personality, pursued
something so wild, untested and mysterious that its full meaning
was unclear even to him, yet who briefly wrung from his peculiar
system of painting one variation after another. Pollock was a
quintessential American because of his aspiration to make something
from what seemed like nothing. Sometimes he botched the results,
but this was intrinsic to a process that consciously flirted with
incoherence: accidents, on which his art depended, had to be held
in tension with acts of extreme control, and the exhibition is
instructive for letting you see some of his failures, which by
contrast clarify his successes. His biggest triumphs, the classic
paintings from 1950, ``Autumn Rhythm,'' ``No. 32'' and ``One,'' are
hung together here so that you can scan them by swiveling your head
180 degrees. It's an amazing sight. Hours and admission: See above.

   X `RENDEZVOUS: MASTERPIECES FROM THE CENTRE GEORGES POMPIDOU AND
THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUMS,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth
Ave., at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 24). With its
landmark Paris home under renovation, the cream of the Pompidou
collection has hit the road, joining forces with the Guggenheim's
in an unusual, perhaps unprecedented exhibition that fills the
Fifth Avenue building to the brim. The familiar story of modernism
is told, but in contrasting voices and with a cornucopia of
unfamiliar works and telling juxtapositions. Not to be missed.
Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and
Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and the
elderly. (Roberta Smith)

   X `ROYAL PERSIAN PAINTINGS: THE QAJAR EPOCH, 1785-1925,'
Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,
(718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 24). Think ``Persian painting'' and
what comes to mind? Small illuminated miniatures with diminutive
landscapes and teensy figures. But the Qajar emperors thought big.
They liked their portraits life-size, their battle scenes
Cinemascopic. Even their collectibles _ lacquered boxes, gilded
enamels _ have a trumpeting, clear-the-way flair, like props in a
Handel opera. This extraordinary show is the first major Western
survey of a self-promotional dynastic art of almost hallucinatory
strangeness and brilliance. It holds many surprises, none more
mesmerizing than the power portraits of the ruler Fath Ali Shah:
with his dainty, high-heeled slippers, extravagant beard and
Napoleonic hauteur, he projects a preposterous, inimitable glamour.
Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of the month);
Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, children 12 and up;
$1.50, the elderly. (Holland Cotter)

<P>
   X `SACRED ARTS OF HAITIAN VODOU,' American Museum of Natural
History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through
Jan. 3). The 500 objects in this exhibition _ shimmering, sequined
flags, plaster Madonnas, medicine packets wrapped like Christmas
gifts, miniature coffins, carved wooden drums _ weave African,
European and indigenous New World influences together in an art of
visceral excitement and disquieting beauty. The installation is
expertly organized. It begins with paintings depicting the growth
of Vodou among African slaves in the Caribbean. (The show avoids
the Anglicized voodoo, with its history of racist associations, in
favor of the Creole Vodou.) And it concludes with three big,
glamorous assemblage-style altars that catch the essence of what
this religion is: a magnificent, spiritual tour de force. Hours:
Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and
Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the
elderly; $4.50, children. (Holland Cotter)

<P>
   `UFA FILM POSTERS, 1918-1943,' Museum of Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd
St., (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 5). Ufa was the German movie
studio that produced such films as Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis'' and
Josef von Sternberg's ``Blue Angel.'' The 50 mostly large posters
on view here, ranging in style from Expressionistic to Art Deco to
proto-Pop collage, don't have the esthetic quality of the best
early modern graphic design, but they are interesting as vintage
kitsch and, along with the informative catalog, should be
compelling for film buffs. Hours and admission: See above (Ken
Johnson). Galleries: Uptown.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL GEORGES, Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 E. 79th St., (212)
879-6606 (through Dec. 31). A fine, juicy painter who has for many
years retained his figurative approach through movements thick and
thin. The handful of canvases here sample his recent range of work,
from a fiery ``Dr. Faustus'' series to quiet views of his farm in
Normandy. His skill as a strong colorist and paint-handler
prevails. (GraceGlueck)
</P>
<P>
   X ARSHILE GORKY, ``Paintings and Drawings 1929-1942,'' Gagosian,
980 Madison Ave., at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Jan. 9).
This small museum-quality show makes an excellent companion to the
Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Here we see
Gorky still working mostly in Picasso's shadow but beginning to
discover _ in ``Garden in Sochi,'' for example, a delicate,
surrealistic mindscape from 1942 _ the gravitationally liberated
space and elegant line that characterize his great works of the
mid-1940's (Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   X SIGMAR POLKE, ``New Paintings, Printing Mistakes,'' Michael
Werner Gallery, 21 E. 67th St., (212) 988-1623 (through Jan. 16).
This German painter is a major artist who has never really taken
off in the United States. He's an antimastery master who produces a
post-epiphany, post-ego painting, an impure hybrid that mixes ideas
and formal ploys like so many chemical additives. His works
preserve a tradition, and they also turn it into something else.
That something else can be sampled in this show of two dozen
strange, beautiful, sort-of-abstract new paintings based partly on
newspaper misprints. (Holland Cotter)
</P>
<P>
   Galleries: 57th Street
</P>
<P>
   GUSTAVO LOPEZ ARMENTIA, Reece, 24 W. 57th St., (212) 333-5830
(through Dec. 30). Armentia represented Argentina in the 1997
Venice Biennale. He combines cartoon drawing, expressionistic
painting, found objects and relief modeling to create layered,
dreamy collage allegories of free-floating modernity. The best
piece here is a big, surrealistic table-top landscape with giant
cutlery. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   NELL BLAINE, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Ave., (212) 262-5050
(through Dec. 30). Paintings and watercolors from the '70s, '80s
and '90s by an artist who studied with Hans Hoffman and belonged to
a group of feisty modern traditionalists that included Fairfield
Porter and Jane Freilicher, who kept faith with representational
painting. The best works among the still lifes and landscapes here
are several table settings that have a Bonnardian intimacy and
radiance. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   LAURENT DE BRUNHOFF, ``Babar in Process,'' Mary Ryan Gallery, 24
W. 57th St., (212) 397-0669 (through Jan. 9). More than 70 studies
for various books about the lovable elephant Babar. Though aimed at
children, there is a visual magic, emotional resonance and epic
sweep to the Babar stories that is still engaging for grown-ups.
It's fascinating to see how de Brunhoff works through painterly
sketches, pencil drawings and finished watercolors toward final
images that seem effortlessly achieved. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   JOHN GILL, Kraushaar, 724 Fifth Ave., (212) 307-5730 (through
Dec. 31). Chunky ceramic works in which traditional, utilitarian
forms like vases, teapots, bowls and platters are animated by
Cubist distortions both sculptural and painterly. The exhibition
exudes a spirit of playful, continual metamorphosis (Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   X GABRIEL OROZCO, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 W. 57th St., (212)
977-7160 (through Jan. 9). This clear-eyed romantic is one of the
more ingenious artists to come along in years, and if you doubt it,
go to the show and play a little Ping-Pong. He has concocted an
X-shaped Ping-Pong table with a lily pond in its center _ Giverny
for the rumpus room _ which, besides being a lot of fun, is a sly
meditation on our interaction with the space he has created. He has
also made an elaborate, pitched-roof pavilion with pianos for
walls, a big installation that includes stuff he found by rummaging
through trash, and several deceptively casual videos. Orozco's work
consistently inclines us toward empathy, which is the ultimate goal
of good art; and it asks, What is the point of looking if your mind
isn't open to what you see? (Michael Kimmelman)
</P>
<P>
   X `JACKSON POLLOCK: THE PICASSO INFLUENCE,' Washburn, 20 W. 57th
St., (212) 397-6780 (through Dec. 30). This dense little show could
just about hold down one of the side galleries in the early end of
the Museum of Modern Art's landmark Pollock retrospective. It has
more than 20 drawings and small paintings, most of them from the
artist's estate and previously unexhibited, all made in the four or
five years after Pollock saw ``Guernica'' for the first time, in
1939. Filled with indelibly Picassoid motifs, but animated by
Pollock's nervous searching line and continual experimentation with
materials, the works vividly attest to a confrontation that left
the younger artist stirred but not shaken (Smith).
</P>
<P>
   X KEN PRICE, Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 W. 57th St., (212)
246-5360 (through Jan. 23). A Los Angeles artist who deserves to be
better known for the small, suggestive glazed or painted ceramic
sculptures he has been perfecting for nearly 40 years. Maybe his
latest efforts, among his most perfect, will do the trick. Their
rippling, bulging shapes are animated by a single all-purpose
orifice, and have exquisite surfaces dotted with thousands of tiny
starlike pores. They sum up a lifetime of interests and tap Price
as a precursor to the current pursuit of biomorphic abstraction in
painting and sculpture. Not many artists start out good, get better
and remain pertinent. Like Stuart Davis and Philip Guston, Price is
one of them. (Smith)
</P>
<P>
   Galleries: SoHo
</P>
<P>
   X KAHN/SELESNICK, ``The Circular River: Panoramic Photographs,
Siberian Expeditions, 1944-1946,'' Monique Knowlton, 568 Broadway,
at Prince Street, (212) 966-2625 (through Jan. 9). Nicholas Kahn
and Richard Selesnick produce elaborately staged faux antique
photographs. Each of the 59 pictures from their most recent project
is a sepia-toned, six-foot-long panoramic print that purports to
document an expedition to Siberia undertaken in the mid-1940's.
Together with its long journalistic text, it's a funny, Monty
Pythonesque parody of the generic scientific adventure narrative.
(Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   SUZANNE McCLELLAND, Paul Kasmin, 74 Grand St., (212) 219-3219
(through Dec. 31). Paintings mixing verbal graffitti and
expressionistic gesturalism. The best part of the show is a grid of
two dozen small gouaches based on phrases like ``Tit for Tat'' or
``Checkered Past'' that range freely from open and washy to densely
marked and layered. Ms. McClelland generates a lot of painterly
energy, but overall her work has an unfocused, distracted feeling.
(Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   `THE RISK OF EXISTENCE,' Phyllis Kind Gallery, 136 Greene St.,
(212) 925-1200 (through Dec. 31). A riveting group show of
paintings, drawings and prints that range from William Blake to
Lisa Yuskavage, with Myron Stout, Francis Bacon and Henry Darger in
between. Despite the existential title, form and color are as
important as subject, and the installation carefully links each
work to its neighbors in unexpected, illuminating ways. Best of
show is a hard call, but Jim Nutt's ``Pug,'' a quirky portrait with
the concentrated perfection of Northern Renaissance painting, is a
strong candidate. (Smith)
</P>
<P>
   ANDY WARHOL, ``Camouflage Paintings,'' Gagosian Gallery, 136
Wooster St., (212) 228-2828 (through Jan. 9). Full of optical
cheer, the 47 paintings in this double-hung exhibition come in all
shapes and sizes, but only one motif. They subject a modest swath
of United States Army regulation camouflage to countless changes in
color, scale and finally composition, reflecting the
approach-avoidance dance with abstraction that dominated Warhol's
final years. Their banal origins are never obscured as they move up
the scale of visual complexity, but move they do. (Smith)

   `COUNTER CULTURE: PARISIAN CABARETS AND THE AVANT-GARDE,
1875-1905,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington
Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Jan. 16).
For a clever young thing in turn-of-the-century Paris, the place to
hang out was Montmartre. In its avant-garde heyday, from 1875 to
1905, cabarets provided what today we'd call alternative spaces for
the Paris culturati, promoting poetry, art, performance and musical
entertainments, sowing the seeds of Dada, Surrealism and even
conceptual art. The more than 300 objects in this show celebrate
the famous quartier at its peak: displaying posters by
Toulouse-Lautrec and Jules Cheret, prints, drawings photographs,
illustrated books and ephemera. Among the livelier exhibits is a
functioning replica of the shadow theater developed by the artist
Henri Riviere, a popular entertainment that presaged the cartoon
film. (Grace Glueck)
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY CRANE, Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay St., lower Manhattan,
(212) 925-9424 (through Dec. 31). At his best, in magically real,
panoramic views of semirural Hudson Valley landscapes, Crane
creates the feeling of seeing the world through the eyes of someone
_ an Emerson or a Thoreau _ in a transcendentally (or
psychedelically) elevated consciousness. Color and paint are lush;
smoke plumes, rainbows and odd clouds animate the sky and a
visionary light transforms mundane reality. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   JANNIS KOUNELLIS, Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson St., near Spring
Street, West Village, (212) 255-5599 (through Feb. 6). New,
huge-scale work by the Italian Arte Povera master. Live starlings
flutter in cages hung by meat hooks in front of massive steel
plates; antique wooden armoires dangle absurdly by thick ropes from
overhead I-beams. His work is grandiose, but Kounellis' poetic
imagination can be charmingly capricious. (Johnson) Last Chance
</P>
<P>
   X JOHN BALDESSARI, ``The Commissioned Paintings,'' Sonnabend,
420 West Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 966-6160
(through Saturday). Vintage deadpan conceptualism. In 1969,
Baldesarri commissioned 12 painters he discovered in county fair
art exhibitions to copy a photograph of a hand pointing at
something utterly mundane, like a messy kitchen counter or a roll
of sheet metal. A professional sign painter captioned each painting
with the words ``A Painting by'' and the name of the copyist.
(Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   `BIOMORPHIC ABSTRACTION,' Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, near Prince
Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3200 (through Wednesday). This judiciously
selected five-artist show offers a useful occasion to ponder the
popularity of biomorphism in today's art. It includes a creepy
painting of something green by Max Ernest; a beautiful blue blob by
the ceramicist Ken Price; antic, erotic abstraction by Paul Henry
Ramirez; richly colored, near-abstract cartoon paintings by Carl
Ostendarp and a cerebral juxtaposition of a pink hourglass-shaped
chair and Vera scarves by Pae White. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   ROSS BLECKNER, Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene St., SoHo, (212)
965-0753 (through Saturday). The downtown segment of a two-gallery
exhibition includes big, beautiful grisaille abstractions whose
strikingly optical cell-like patterns (a result of careful use of
an airbrush) count as some of the most convincing images Bleckner
has made. The artist's political conscience has been relegated to a
series of high-minded photo appropriations that seem about 20 years
too late. (Smith).

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON or BAGHDAD _ U.S. military forces, joined
by those of Great Britain, launched missiles against Iraqi targets
for the second day in a campaign with no clear end in sight.
Defense officials, while lauding the efforts of the American
military at hitting their targets, refused to be pinned down on a
definite time period for the bombings _ despite the approach of the
high Muslim holy period of Ramadan. The officials also continued to
decline to specify Iraqi targets, but said assassinating Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was not a stated goal of the mission.
Meanwhile, Iraqi officials continued to try to paint the United
States and Britain as the bad guys to their own people. Developing.

 NEW YORK: late. (Smith)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSS BLECKNER, Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Ave., near 57th Street,
(212) 752-2929 (through Friday). The uptown segment of a
two-gallery exhibition shows the artist continuing to cultivate a
dazzling new painting technique that is responsible for the
relatively impressive paintings in the show's downtown half in
SoHo. Here, he seems to have shifted into overproduction, adding
pleasing color and a surface slickness that pushes the abstract
toward the Photo Realist. (Smith)
</P>
<P>
   JEFF BURTON, Casey Kaplan Gallery, 48 Greene St., SoHo, (212)
226-6131 (through Saturday). Sex, death and immortality, Hollywood
style, are the subjects of Burton's apparently ultra-casual, often
obliquely angled photographs. Adjacent knees from two bodies
suggest sexual coupling; a cemetery looms; a celebrity name is
enshrined in a sidewalk. This is the Los Angeles artist's best New
York show (Cotter).
</P>
<P>
   X `WILLEM DE KOONING: DRAWING SEEING/SEEING DRAWING,' the
Drawing Center, 35 Wooster St., SoHo, (212) 219-2166; ``Willem de
Kooning: Drawings and Sculpture,'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West
24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, and Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash,
1018 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 744-7400 (all through
Saturday). These three shows don't pretend to add up to a survey of
de Kooning's drawings, but they have fine stuff and lots of it:
high-spirited warm-ups for paintings, ultra-refined finished
pieces, all manner of glorious doodles. The Drawing Center show is
thematically the most coherent and includes a series of fascinating
Crucifixions. The other shows highlight links between drawings and
sculptures. It's great to have all this coincide with the Pollock
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. (Cotter)
</P>
<P>
   KIM DINGLE, Sperone Westwater, 142 Greene St., SoHo, (212)
431-3685 (through Saturday). This Los Angeles artist, known for
paintings and sculptures featuring malevolent schoolgirls and
toddlers called Prisses, is making her subjects behave themselves,
and the shift from truly nasty to just naughty indicates that her
work is formally pallid and unadventurous. Best is an installation
in which two Prisses break through a plaster wall like
Supergirl-cherubs, but even that wouldn't be out of place in a
Christmas store window on Fifth Avenue. (Smith)
</P>
<P>
   JACKIE FERRARA, ``Red Arches,'' Frederieke Taylor/TZ'Art
Gallery, 470 Broome St., SoHo, (212) 966-9059 (through Thursday).
Known for her site sculptures and large public commissions, Ms.
Ferrara uses an austere vocabulary of Minimalist forms to build
architectural structures. They can be useful or purely sculptural,
but are in any case admirable for their subtle geometries. She has
redone the gallery's walls in a design of large, repetitive arches
rounded off at the top by stepping back the plywood segments in
ziggurat fashion. Like the walls of a Moorish harem, they bestow a
soft, sensuous effect on the entire space. (Glueck)
</P>
<P>
   HAMISH FULTON, John Weber Gallery, 529 W. 20th St., Chelsea,
(212) 691-5711 (through Wednesday). Fulton, the British
Conceptualist, says walking is his main artistic activity. In the
gallery, the interest is in the unpredictable, abstract ways he
memorializes his walks, as in seven black sticks in a zigzag to
represent a seven-day hike, or, most impressively, a mural-scale
wall of words (sky, sea, tree) arranged into an abstract gray,
black and white landscape. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   DEWITT GODFREY, Sculpture Center, 167 E. 69th St., (212)
879-3500 (through Thursday). An impressive gallery-filling metal
sculpture in the form of a huge collapsed tube made of 300 sheets
of riveted Cor-ten steel. You can walk on it, which causes it to
squeak and squeal. It's accompanied by a mural-scale drawing of a
single, thick black line that repeatedly bifurcates as it
progresses from left to right, becoming a confusing mass of lines
at the end. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   ANTON HEYBOER, Baron/Boisante, 50 W. 57th St., (212) 581-9191
(through Saturday). Nine esoteric etchings and three drawings, from
1957 to 1980, by a famously eccentric Dutch artist who lives
reclusively on a farm with four wives. His works, based on a
personal mystical system represented by lines and numbers, are raw,
unintelligible amalgams of pattern, figures, diagrams, scribbling
and writing. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICK KIESLER/LEON POLK SMITH, Jason McCoy, 41 E. 57th St.,
(212) 319-1996 (through Thursday). Two under-known modernists. In
1954 Kiesler (1890-1965), a visionary architect, designed the
environmental construction ``Horse Galaxy,'' on view here. It is
mainly a multipanel abstract painting on the wall with additional
elements on the floor and ceiling. It suggests aerial views of
Southwestern landscapes. The hard-edged paintings from the 1950s,
mostly small works on paper by Smith (1906-1996), are flat,
deceptively simple compositions in vibrant colors. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   `MOUSE: AN AMERICAN ICON,' Alternative Museum, 594 Broadway, at
Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-4444 (through Saturday). This
selection of works by 24 artists, every one featuring a more or
less politicized image of Mickey Mouse, has a few good things in
it. In Luis Camnitzer's ``Reality Check,'' a real stuffed mouse has
been absurdly equipped with round Mickey ears; John Fawcett's drawn
and collaged mixes of pop culture and hallucinogenic Mickeys are
dizzyingly complicated; Jaune Quick-to-See Smith's ``McFlag,''
which sports big, round, earlike speakers at each upper corner, is
a strident takeoff on Jasper Johns' iconic ``Flag.'' (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   X DANICA PHELPS, ``Funny Money,'' Jack Tilton, 49 Greene St.,
SoHo, (212) 941-1775 (through Wednesday). Goofy systems by which
the artist, a young Brooklynite having her New York solo debut,
records the getting and spending of money. ``Providence'' is a
giant, messy, homemade calendar on which day-by-day activities are
recorded in words, cartoony drawings and little rolls of green
paper that Ms. Phelps glues on to represent earnings and tears off
to represent expenditures over three months. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   MONIQUE PRIETO, Pat Hearn Gallery, 530 W. 22nd St., Chelsea,
(212) 727-7366 (through Wednesday).With a computer, Ms. Prieto
generates shapes of blobby, biomorphic contour, then paints them
flatly in bright, toylike colors. They are smart and knowing, if
not particularly consequential. (Glueck)
</P>
<P>
   X LAWRENCE SEWARD, Andrew Kreps, 529 W. 20th St., Chelsea, (212)
741-8849 (through Saturday). A zany population of faceless little
plaster men, all in blue jeans, white T-shirts and sneakers, fill
this gallery. One lies face down in a pool of glue; another pulls
off his leg. Several different ones climb or embrace mounds of
amorphous black matter. Spinning variations on one dumb idea with
impressive ingenuity, Seward has produced a funny, touching theater
of human striving, frustration and folly. (Johnson)
</P>
<P>
   JAMES TURRELL, Barbara Gladstone, 515 W. 24th St., Chelsea,
(212) 206-9300 (through Wednesday). New work by the much-revered
light artist. In ``Cross-Cut,'' you behold a hazy scrim of light
and, some distance away, a glowing red wall slanted so that it
recedes in space, turning blue at its far edge; it's almost
beautiful, but too dim. In a couple of small works, barely
perceptible flickers are emitted from television-tube-shaped
apertures, an ironic conjunction of the sacred and the profane.
(Johnson)

   PARIS _ British planes joined U.S. forces bombing Iraq on
Thursday, but other European allies kept their distance.
</P>
<P>
   Most, including France, blamed President Saddam Hussein for
making military action inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But some regretted that the U.N. Security Council was not
consulted before U.S. missiles began flying on Wednesday, and they
expressed doubts that the bombing would achieve its main aim: to
keep Iraq from becoming a military menace to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany endorsed the military
action unequivocally. Spain, Poland and Portugal expressed approval
with varying degrees of reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   But Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, echoing the Vatican
and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said, ``Today is a sad day,
even for Italy.'' He asked Washington and London to call off
further attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who endorsed the first
U.S. missile attacks on Wednesday, sent British Tornado
fighter-bombers from Kuwait into action on Thursday. ``I have no
doubt at all that action is fully justified now,'' he told
Parliament in London on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the subtext of President Clinton's timing
vis-a-vis the impeachment process, Blair suddenly stood back from
the podium and stated strongly:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to deal with one thing straight on. There are
suggestions that the timing of military action is somehow linked to
the internal affairs of the U.S. I refute this entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hearty cheers, but he wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he acted differently out of regard to internal matters of
U.S. politics,'' Blair continued, ``that would have been a
dereliction of his duty as president. Instead, and not for the
first time, he has shown the courage to do the right thing, and he
has my full support.''
</P>
<P>
   The stirring expression met with no criticism in the Commons,
where even Conservative members with little sympathy for Clinton
have expressed puzzlement and dismay over the intrusion of U.S.
domestic politics into an international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   By committing British forces to join the United States in
bombing Iraq while other European governments stand aside, Blair
thus underlined his position as Clinton's key ally in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO defense ministers did not endorse the
attacks. But the alliance's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
blamed Saddam alone for, in Solana's words, ``the consequences that
his defiance of the will of the international community has
entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to two
earlier disputes with Iraq this year, did not hide its
disappointment that Saddam had chosen to go back on his word and
defy the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again it is the Iraqi people that are suffering and will
suffer, and they should be in our thoughts,'' President Jacques
Chirac said Thursday afternoon. ``Once again, the responsibility is
clearly the Iraqi president's.''
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, told Parliament
that he did not see how bombing could lead to a resumption of
effective long-term international controls over Iraq's ability to
make and store prohibited weapons. ``The sooner the strikes stop,
the better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by Schroeder, Germany's new center-left
chancellor, continued the pro-U.S. policies of his conservative
Christian Democratic predecessor, Helmut Kohl. But Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, whose Greens party has a strong pacifist streak,
said the air strikes were regrettable nevertheless.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schroeder said: ``The use of military force is the consequence
of the obstinate refusal of Saddam Hussein to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors who were looking for weapons of mass
destruction, in accordance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein had to know that the international community
could not tolerate his behavior. There is no question whatsoever
about our solidarity with the international community, and with our
alliance partners the United States and Great Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his British counterpart,
George Robertson, changed plans and did not go to Brussels for
Thursday's NATO meeting. Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, angrily
ordered his defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, to cancel a meeting
with his NATO counterparts that had been scheduled for Friday.

GHOST TOWN IN KOSOVO: FEARING REVENGE, ALBANIANS STAY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Ethnic Albanians abandoned the streets of this
western Kosovo town Thursday afternoon, fearing vengeance for the
killings of six Serbian youths in a cafe this week.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe shootings have enraged and galvanized Kosovo's
frightened Serb minority. Revenge killings of Albanians could
destroy not only the tenuous cease-fire in this southern Serbian
province, but also the nearly stalled U.S. efforts to negotiate
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police in camouflage uniforms, their faces covered by
masks or bandanas, surrounded a neighborhood here where they said
suspects in the cafe murders could be hiding. Thursday evening,
nervous police were hiding in darkened doorways and behind garden
walls, pointing assault rifles at ethnic Albanian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the neighborhood, the twisting cobblestone streets and
ancient houses gave the feeling of an abandoned village in the
Middle Ages. Residents stayed hidden in their homes with all lights
out. Not even a cat ventured outside.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the city, paramilitary police units equipped with
armored personnel carriers combed villages, they said, also in
search of suspects. Police mounted cannons and set up at least one
base in a village that, until Thursday, had been controlled by
ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo, whose
population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European observers who are supposed to monitor any
police or rebel movements were barred from the area where police
were advancing. The observers said they heard mortar fire which
they assumed was coming from police positions.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, with heavy machine gun fire less than a mile from
their new base, police said the rebels were starting a
counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme edginess in Pec stems from Monday's murders. Masked
men sprayed automatic weapons fire through a coffee shop frequented
by ethnic Serb high school students, killing six.
</P>
<P>
   Since the slayings, foreign diplomats and Serbian officials have
braced for revenge attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians, fearing
that the war _ largely fought in the countryside until an uneasy
truce negotiated by the Americans in October _ will now move to
Kosovo's cities, where Serbs and Albanians who live side by side
could become locked in an even more brutal cycle of killing.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities say their sweeps in and near this city
Thursday brought in three men who are tied to Monday's killings and
another 14 who may have been. They also say two guerrillas were
killed fighting the police.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, deny
involvement in Monday's murders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main suspect, according to the Serbian authorities, is
Ramush Haradinaj, the rebel commander for this part of western
Kosovo. Haradinaj is in his early 30s with a reputation for being
something of a dictator in areas under his control.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials say Thursday's police action is aimed at
trapping Haradinaj. But the methods may only add to Albanians'
hatred of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rushed into our house and grabbed all the men, eight of
us, and took us to the police station,'' said Jusuf Lataj, the
Muslim religious leader in a village near Pec. ``As soon as we got
to the police station they began beating people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those detained and questioned was Lataj's son, Jahja 21,
who after release had bright bruises across his back, a bruised and
immobile left elbow, a badly bruised and swollen right hand, and a
left ear blackened by what he said was a kick in the head from
police.

MICROSOFT LAWYERS RESPOND TO WITNESS' CHARGE OF INQUIRY SABOTAGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stung by a government witness' testimony that
Microsoft Corp. had sabotaged a program designed to gather evidence
against the company, lawyers for the software giant Thursday
offered the court an unusual written explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the issue are online updates, a feature introduced
with Windows 98 in June, whereby users who are connected to the
Internet receive a ``critical update'' message when they turn on
their computers whenever Microsoft has fixed some bug or made some
improvement to the operating system. By clicking on a button, the
user downloads the new code from a special Web site, and it is
instantly installed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the witness, Edward Felten, a computer-scientist from
Princeton University, testified that Microsoft had made changes to
its Windows 98 update site that seemed designed to thwart a
computer program he had written to demonstrate a central point in
the government's antitrust suit against the company _ that
Microsoft's browser could be removed from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Felten testified that soon after he gave Microsoft a copy of his
program in September as part of the pre-trial discovery rules, his
computer would no longer work with the update site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft modified some of the software that they distribute
as part of the Windows update feature in a way that made it
incompatible,'' he said. He added that his computer, though running
a competing Web browser, had worked perfectly on the site until
Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson gave Microsoft
permission to offer an explanation for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Thursday, Microsoft did not explain what had
caused the problem but denied doing anything that would have caused
it.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the site was updated regularly, roughly
every two weeks, adding that an update was first posted on Nov. 4
and modified slightly on Dec. 4 ``by a single developer working
under the supervision of another developer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these developers,'' the company said, ``had access
to Dr. Felten's program, and neither was involved in any way in
Microsoft's testing of his program. The Dec. 4 change had nothing
whatsoever to do with Dr. Felten or his program. Microsoft knows of
no reason why that change should have affected Dr. Felten's program
and believes it had no such effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft argues that Felten's removal program changes
Windows in such a way that the program cannot work with the update
site at all.
</P>
<P>
   Felten said he would not comment on Microsoft's submission.

EARTH'S AVERAGE SURFACE TEMPERATURE IN 1998 HIGHEST SINCE RECORDS
KEPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The earth's average surface temperature in 1998 is the highest
by far since people first began to measure it with thermometers in
the mid-19th century, the World Meteorological Organization
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, an agency of the United Nations, said 1998
will be the 20th year in a row that the globe's surface has been
warmer than its recent long-term average, which is the average for
1961 through 1990. Seven of the 10 warmest years on record have
occurred since 1990 and the other three occurred after 1983. Most
recently, new monthly high-temperature records were set in each of
the 18 consecutive months ending in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The results, based on data through mid-December and reported in
Geneva, will change slightly when final data is calculated. But
experts say it is certain that 1998 will turn out to be the warmest
year on record, and almost as certainly by an easy margin over the
the previous warmest, 1997
</P>
<P>
   According to the new figures, the average global temperature
this year will turn out to be about 58 degrees Fahrenheit, a full
degree Fahrenheit warmer than the 1961-1990 average. ``This
number's amazing,'' said Dr. Philip Jones, a climatologist at the
University of East Anglia in England, speaking of a field in which
records or normally set in fractions. Jones provided much of the
information on which Thursday's announcement was based.
</P>
<P>
   While there are dissenters who believe the warmer climate can be
explained by normal variation, the dominant view among climate
scientists is that at least some of the warming trend is a result
of emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon
dioxide, which is produced by the burning of coal, oil, natural gas
and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 1998 record, a number of scientists said they
believed the world is likely to be cooler in 1999 and possibly 2000
as well. The reason, they said, is that a fair measure of the
warming in 1998 can be attributed to the effects earlier in the
year of El Nino. This is the extensive pool of warm water that
develops from time to time in the tropical Pacific. It both warms
the global atmosphere and disrupts worldwide weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But even though a dissipating El Nino may allow some cooling
next year, several experts said they expected the underlying global
warming trend to continue and temperatures to remain above average
in the immediate future. The findings about 1998 were not a
surprise, since highly publicized analyses by federal scientists
had made it clear since mid-year that 1998 was shaping up as the
warmest year on record.
</P>
<P>
   Among other contributors to the United Nations' agency's
analysis were the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York, the British Meteorological Office, the National Climatic Data
Center in Asheville, N.C., the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center
and University of Alabama in Huntsville, Ala., the International
Research Institute in New York and the Climatic Prediction Center
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of indirect evidence like the annual rings of
trees, Jones has been saying for some time that he believes 1998 to
be not only the warmest year in the thermometer record, but also
the warmest year of the millennium now ending.
</P>
<P>
   As new global high-temperature records have been established in
the 1990s, they have usually exceeded old ones by mere hundredths
of a degree at a time. But if the new estimate holds up, 1998 will
top the 1997 record by about a quarter of a degree. The difference
may appear small, but the world is only 5 to 9 degrees warmer now
than in the depths of the last ice age. According to the numbers
announced Thursday, the globe is about 1.25 degrees warmer than at
the beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The actual average surface temperature of the earth this year
will come in at about 58 degrees, according to the British data
sets. Other data sets vary slightly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists project that the surface will warm by an
additional 2 to 6 degrees over the next century if carbon dioxide
emissions are not reduced, with the largest increases in temperate
and sub-arctic latitudes. Among other things, they say, this will
make hot weather, droughts and floods more likely while reducing
the number of extremely cold days, raise the level of the seas,
cause climatic zones to shift and produce widespread environmental
and economic dislocations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all regions of the world have warmed in recent years, and
each year there are some cool spots; in 1998, Eurasia was one of
these. One place that has often lagged in the warming trend is the
United States. But this year, according to an analysis by the
Goddard center in New York, North America led the warming trend,
experiencing its warmest year in the last four decades. El Nino was
said to be largely responsible, since its impact on North America
is stronger than in many other places.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures well above the surface, as measured from earth
satellites, have not usually shown the same rise as the surface
temperatures, though they do show a slight warming. This year,
however, temperatures from the surface to an altitude of about four
miles, were nearly a degree above average. The magnitude of this
rise has also been attributed largely to El Nino.

   WASHINGTON _ On a day when everyone in Washington seemed to have
a beef, Karen Dolan had two. Standing at a rally outside the
Capitol Thursday morning, Ms. Dolan held two signs aloft. ``Stop
the Impeachment!'' read one. ``Stop the Bombing!'' urged the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a supporter of Clinton. I'm an independent, though I
prefer Clinton over a Republican,'' said Ms. Dolan, a project
director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research
and advocacy organization in Washington. ``But what upsets me is
the way that the Constitution and the will of the people are being
disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same thing about the bombing of Iraq. It was done
unilaterally, without the mandate of the Security Council. So I
think both the bombing and the impeachment process are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 3,000 people rallied outside the Capitol
Thursday, demanding that the House halt its effort to impeach
President Clinton. But with the twin issues of war and impeachment
consuming Washington, many at this overwhelmingly liberal gathering
found themselves often criticizing the same man they were staunchly
defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify impeachment on what most people consider
kind of superfluous charges _ lying about a sexual relationship,''
said Omar Abdul of Washington as he stood near the speakers'
platform on the east side of the Capitol. ``But the bombing of a
country is a serious matter and generally the people who suffer are
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, other Democratic liberals were facing their
own clash of values and trying to figure out which was worse, war
or impeachment. While hundreds of people gathered in downtown San
Francisco Wednesday night for an anti-impeachment rally sponsored
by San Francisco's political and religious leaders, several hundred
others were gathering several blocks away for a rally against the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bombing sort of dampens our feelings, but we have
to concentrate on the impeachment,'' said Jane Morrison, a member
of a Democratic committee that conducts campaigns for various
nominees in local, state and national elections. ``We have to
concentrate on letting the Republicans know that they will pay if
they disregard the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Washington rally, organized by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and a coalition of trade unions, women's groups and other
liberal organizations, featured a host of speakers who sharply
criticized Republicans for moving toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clinical,'' Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said of the House
Republicans' desire to impeach the president. ``It's pathological
because they don't even care that they're going to pay a price in
2,000. Their hatred is complete and they are consumed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the gathering also pointed out Clinton's shaky relationship
with his own party's left wing. Having disagreed with the president
on issues like welfare reform, crime policy, the North American
Free Trade Agreement and military actions in the Persian Gulf, many
on the left of the party are now finding themselves in the
uncomfortable position of defending him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right looks at Clinton and they see us,'' said Robert
Borosage, a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies and an
adviser to Jackson during his 1988 presidential campaign. ``They
see anti-war, gay rights, pro-choice, civil rights. But when we
look at him, we don't see us at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Borosage added, ``we can't let the right wing win. He'
ain't much. But he's all we got.''

SHORT NOTES ON THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With holiday vacations looming, producers were wrapping up a
bundle of deals this week. The result is a clear picture of the
spring season. And it can be summed up in a single word: plays.
Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   The first comes from a rare creature on Broadway: a young
American playwright. The author? Tennessee Williams, whose ``Not
About Nightingales'' will land at the Circle in the Square in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wrote ``Nightingales,'' the story of a prison uprising,
in 1938 and 1939, well before his breakthrough with ``The Glass
Menagerie'' in 1945. Much to his chagrin, the script was never
produced and was essentially lost until 1991, when Vanessa Redgrave
discovered a copy among Williams' papers at the University of Texas
at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   It was written when he was in his early 20s when ``no one
believed in him,'' said Carole Shorenstein Hays, who is producing
the show with Stuart Thompson and Marsha Garces Williams. ``It's
just amazing to think this is where it all came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The play received its premiere under the direction of Trevor
Nunn at the Royal National Theater in London in March and was at
the Alley Theater in Houston in June, receiving good notices both
times. The New York production, set to open on Feb. 25, is expected
to have much the same cast as its previous incarnations, including
Corin Redgrave, Vanessa's brother, in a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Cort Theater, where ``The Blue Room'' reigns
supreme, another West End import, ``Marlene,'' by Pam Gems, will
begin performances on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Described by producers as a musical play, ``Marlene'' tells the
story of Marlene Dietrich, played by the Irish actress Sian
Phillips, during the hours before her final public performance in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Also confirming an opening was ``Amy's View,'' David Hare's new
play, arriving at the Barrymore Theater in April. Other straight
plays already booked for Broadway include another by Hare, ``Via
Dolorosa''; a new play by Patrick Marber, ``Closer,'' and two
acclaimed revivals, ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``The Iceman
Cometh.'' Also scheduled are revivals of ``Night Must Fall'' and
``Lion in Winter,'' and Conor McPherson's play, ``The Weir,'' is
expected in April.
</P>
<P>
   Add the news that ``Electra,'' the season's unlikeliest hit,
will extend until March 28, and you can expect some serious money
to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb has been: Broadway can support two straight
plays, one with a star and one with a Tony Award,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ``If there ends up being
five hit plays on Broadway this season, I'd be the most surprised
guy on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway, change has been the byword for the last several
weeks. Two long-running shows, ``Shakespeare's R &AMP; J'' and ``Power
Plays,'' announced their closings, and a promising newcomer,
``Duet!,'' failed to find an audience and is closing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most topsy-turvy case is that of ``This Is Our
Youth.'' The show, which opened to stellar reviews at Second Stage
in November, had been said to be on the verge of moving to a
commercial run at the Minetta Lane Theater in January.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Despite renegotiating the actors' contracts for more
money in the commercial run, its commercial producers, Fran and
Barry Weissler, announced to a bewildered cast after the show's
Sunday performance that the play would stay at Second Stage until
the end of February. Not moving seems to be a result of prudence or
procrastination, depending on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Weissler, producer of the Broadway hit ``Chicago,'' said on
Wednesday that he had decided to stay at Second Stage after he
became convinced that moving the show would be impossible without
the director, Mark Brokaw, who has left the city to direct another
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will find its eventual home,'' Weissler said, ``but I can't
move without my director.''
</P>
<P>
   Some associated with the drama grumbled that the Weisslers had
squandered the momentum of the reviews by negotiating contracts
slowly. And Alan Schuster, the Minetta Lane's owner, said there was
never a formal deal for the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Weissler defended his tactics, saying that January, usually a
bad box office month, was not a good time to move. He added that
the actors would still receive their raises now and and that he was
continuing to look at other Off Broadway houses. ``I haven't missed
the crest,'' he said. ``It's alive and kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hit has emerged Off Broadway: ``The Most Fabulous Story
Ever Told'' by Paul Rudnick, at the New York Theater Workshop. The
comedy, which received mostly positive reviews after opening on
Monday, sold about $26,000 in tickets in six hours on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the remainder of its eight-week run was about 90
percent sold out. By comparison, ``Rent,'' which also originated at
the workshop and moved on to Broadway, also sold about $29,000 in
the hours after its glowing notices.
</P>
<P>
   The sales have caught the attention of Scott Rudin, a frequent
producer of Rudnick's screenplays, who is looking to move the show
to a larger house: the Variety Arts or, you guessed it, the Minetta
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morton has had the kind of career most actors only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   His professional stage debut was on Broadway in ``Hair.'' His
resume is crammed with television and film credits, a sure sign of
some financial security. Still, the business is fickle, and
Morton's last effort, ``Mercy Point,'' a television series shot in
Vancouver, was short lived. ``I came back really upset,'' he said.
``And really depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morton has landed the plum role of Serge, the snobby
esthete, in the latest cast of ``Art.'' He begins performances on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was in several Broadway musicals, including a
Tony-nominated turn in ``Raisin,'' this is Morton's first straight
play on Broadway. It is also the first time a black actor has been
in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's refreshing that the black actor is not playing
the least intelligent character on stage,'' he said. ``And I think
there's a nice irony when a black man turns to a white canvas in
the play and says, `But it's not white.' ''

MINUS LAWYERS, 2 DISSIDENTS STAND TRIAL IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The separate trials of two prominent democracy
advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday
morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their
inability to hire defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32,
founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was
in session for just two hours and 10 minutes. It appears to be
finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say
when it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happens from here,'' said Wang's wife, Hu
Jiangxia, who was one of three relatives allowed to attend the
trial. ``I don't hold much hope,'' she added in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who spent two years in prison after the 1989 student
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was accused of organizing a
political party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and of
colluding with foreign enemies of the state. He could face five
years or more in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by
security agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense
Thursday morning after prosecutors laid out their case. But the
judge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half an
hour, saying he was not responding to the specific facts of the
case, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Wang argued that his activities were legal under China's
constitution and under an international covenant on political
rights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said.
</P>
<P>
   In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of
Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something
over two hours. It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father,
Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecution
presented its charges.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or
detained, family members said. The elderly father's request to the
court Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored, so he and
one of the defendant's brothers stayed outside the court building
in protest, leaving another brother inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the trial
because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then as far
as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless,'' the father
said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy asked to observe the trials. When an embassy
official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he was
told that there were no seats available and instead waited outside,
greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial.

CLINTON DENIES TIMING OF IRAQ ATTACK WAS TO THWART IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton denied Thursday that he timed
U.S. attacks on Iraq to sidetrack House impeachment proceedings,
emphasizing that the approach of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
dictated his timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted his only public remarks Thursday to countering
criticism that he had launched Operation Desert Fox in an effort to
divert attention from the threat of impeachment that imperils his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Clinton declared. ``What I did was the right
thing for the country. I don't think any serious person would
believe that any president would do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he ordered the attack Wednesday night to avoid
starting combat operations during Ramadan. His subordinates said
that the open-ended U.S. bombing campaign may be completed without
spilling over into the Muslim holy month that begins with the first
sight of the new moon late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan heralds the beginning of the ninth month of the Muslim
year when God revealed the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed before the
death of the father of Islam in the year 632. Muslims are called
upon to fast between dawn and dusk during the holy month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he ordered the attack to maximize ``the surprise
factor'' and ``to avoid initiating any military action during the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is slated to begin in just a
couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright also cited the start of Ramadan as a deadline for
initiating the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said U.S. forces ``will take whatever time is necessary to
carry out the operation, but we're sensitive to the Ramadan
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright used almost the same formulation, saying the
U.S.-British military campaign ``is going to continue,'' but
adding: ``We are sensitive to the beginnings of Ramadan, but this
campaign will continue to its completion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the United States was
eager to avoid aggravating U.S. relations with Muslim countries or
the more than 1 billion followers of Islam worldwide. Among the
personal telephone calls that Clinton made Thursday were calls to
Jordanian King Hussein and Egyptian President Honi Mubarak.
Albright also called top officials in more than 20 nations,
including some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders announced that lawmakers will begin
their debate Friday on whether to impeach Clinton, despite
Democratic complaints that U.S. military operations in the Persian
Gulf should delay the debate.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders had postponed House action scheduled Thursday on
four articles of impeachment against Clinton for perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power in connection with his
efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was rising
to the twin challenges of Iraqi military operations and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's been tested, but I think what you can see and
what he's demonstrated is he's up to the challenge,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton, Cabinet officers and senior
administration aides were resuming behind-the-scenes efforts to
persuade House members to reject impeachment in favor of censure.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said there were no plans for Clinton to appear on
Capitol Hill or to make a nationally televised address to try to
stem what aides describe as likely impeachment by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the White House believed impeachment was inevitable,
Lockhart invoked the words of resignation once offered by Yankee
catcher and sidewalk philosopher Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over 'til it's over,'' Lockhart said, adding that
Clinton's only hope was for lawmakers to cast their votes ``based
on the facts, the Constitution and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration signaled continued resolve _ and
potentially long duration operations _ by dispatching
reinforcements to the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   A second aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, joined the USS
Enterprise in the strategic waterway. Another 2,000 Army troops
were en route to the region to bolster 3,000 GIs already in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty five additional combat aircraft were dispatched, as well,
to join more than 200 warplanes already in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's spokesman declined to say whether
U.S. military operations would halt with the onset of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate on the duration or length of this
military operation,'' Lockhart said.

WITH IRAQI PRODUCTION UNTOUCHED, OIL PRICES PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the air strikes on Iraq causing no damage to its ability to
pump and ship oil, prices plunged Thursday, wiping out a large part
of the gains of the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil fell 91 cents, or 8 percent, to $10.45 a
barrel, on London's International Petroleum Exchange. It also
plunged to $11.03 a barrel, down $1.35, or 10.9 percent, in trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The decline also reflected disappointment with a meeting in
Madrid by the oil ministers of some of the world's largest oil
producers _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico _ which was called
to initiate further production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the three ministers said in a statement that they
had agreed to discuss ``further measures'' with other producers
that would help oil prices recover and that they planned to meet
with other producers to discuss such steps, it was not enough to
stem the plunge in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Vahan Zanoyan, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Finance
Co., a consulting group to the oil industry in Washington, said
that the meeting had raised expectations that there might be a
quick fix and that it had backfired by not producing one.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the three countries agreed to cut oil production, a
move that was followed by other producers, reducing daily output by
about 3.2 million barrels and propping up oil prices for a while.
The oil ministers said Thursday that they had agreed to keep those
cuts in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, they added, agreed to extend its production cuts of
525,000 barrels a day for another six months until the end of next
year, following the example of some of the other major oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The air attacks have so far not disrupted Iraq's ability to
export crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a miscalculation, there is no intention to hit
any oil installations,'' Zanoyan said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that even under the best of circumstances
tankers that normally load up at the port of Mina El-Bakr would not
go there while the attacks continued.
</P>
<P>
   He said that this could cause a two- to three-week delay in some
of the oil shipments from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is already an oversupply of crude oil in most of
the world's storage tanks, such a delay in shipments ``is not going
to make a dent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an exception to the economic sanctions imposed by the
United Nations after the defeat of Iraq in the Gulf War, the
country can sell $5.2 billion in oil every six months to pay for
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been able to increase its exports to about 1.8 million
barrels a day under the program, which has added to the oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, crude oil prices have fallen by about 40 percent
from levels last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic downturn and the mild winter in the United
States have cut demand and led to an increase of oil inventories to
supply world demand of 74 million barrels a day for about two and a
half months.

   &QL; 
CLINTON-CYNICS (Undated) - Even in the era of a crook like
President Nixon, there was no one except the wildest fringes who
would have suggested that he could manipulate the American military
to save his political hide. And yet, today, all of America is
questioning the timing of President Clinton's raid on Iraq. What is
it about society that has made us so jaded, and willing to believe
almost anything? We are trying to talk with some local veterans,
retirees, etc., but also some national experts. By MARTIN VAN DER
WERF. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - For a minute I felt frightened, a soul
chill that drew me back to boyhood, to the age of 10, 11, 12. To
nights when I regularly snapped out of sleep to a vision of
shadows, ashen blemishes cast on charred concrete. Nuclear
silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't felt such a fear in 20 years, maybe longer. Then I sat
at my desk staring at the television set Wednesday afternoon,
taking in the face of our president and the greenish glow of
Baghdad at night. These images made me feel young again but not
youthful; young, but at the same time, too old. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ.
Story will move in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Welcome back, Acura. All is forgiven. Well,
maybe not all. Some of the boneheaded mistakes that have blurred
Acura's image are still just a little hard to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Acura still manages to build excellent cars, noted
for comfort and reliability, just like its proletarian stablemate,
Honda. That's what keeps 'em coming to the showrooms and ensures
Acura's continued success. And for '99, there's the TL 3.2. By BOB
GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category. EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY,
DEC. 19 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Am I past my prime? Are the days of youth
behind me? Is there a little expiration stamp someplace on my body
that says ``Best if used by 10/31/95''? By LAURI NOTARO. Story
moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAIL-MOVIE (Undated) - You'll have to get over the idea that
they've made a sequel to ``Sleepless in Seattle.'' Yes, ``You've
Got Mail''
</P>
<P>
   does have the same two stars and the same writer/director, and
yes, it's a romantic comedy about people who haven't met - but it's
a different one. How should you approach ``You've Got Mail?'' Think
Hepburn and Tracy. That's the kind of easy comic grace that the
repairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks brings to the affair. 4 stars.
By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRINCE-MOVIE (Undated) - This is a spectacular animated Bible story
about Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), the Hebrew baby raised in the
</P>
<P>
   royal house of Egypt, who leads his people to freedom. The art
work, vastly aided by computer animation, is so gorgeous that you
often forget you're watching animation. Although the movie is more
sophisticated than the typical Disney animated fairy tale, young
kids will get caught up in the excitement of the action and the
music, and not mind what story subtleties they miss. 4 stars. By
BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GODS-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Gods and Monsters,'' an adaptation of
Christopher Bram's novel ``Father of Frankenstein,'' is a
fictionalized account of the last days of James Whale, one of the
most influential directors in Hollywood history. Whale set the
pattern for all horror films to come with the 1931 Universal
production of ``Frankenstein.'' By KYLE LAWSON. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - We've been duped. For years now, Saddam
Hussein has pretended to be a bloodthirsty dictator with a special
hatred for the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   He manufactured and stored weapons of mass destruction as part
of this clever deception. He defied U.N. weapons inspectors and
ignored international treaties. He rearmed his military and
brutally suppressed his own people.
</P>
<P>
   All with the sinister expectation that someday, when called
upon, he'd come to the aid of his good friend and fellow Democrat,
Bill Clinton. By E.J. MONTINI. Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRANT-MUSIC (Undated) - It was completely unplanned on her part.
But the way things are going, Amy Grant may just become the Perry
Como of her generation. Something about her warmly reassuring voice
and comfortable way around a Christmas tune have permanently linked
her with the holiday. And once she donned a wintery white gown and
sat down for a photographer, a new Christmas ambassador was born.
By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MESSINA-MUSIC (Undated) - You can tell a lot about country music
listeners by seeing how they react when certain names are evoked.
Mention Reba, for example, and rising singer Jo Dee Messina gives
the expected response: ``She's just great,'' Messina gushes,
speaking in her rapid, no-twang style. ``I love her so much.'' Then
the subject of Sylvia comes up, a one-name goddess from the
``Breakfast Club''
</P>
<P>
   decade who sported feathered hair and sang feathery songs ``Oh,
my God!'' Messina yells, before she starts singing: `` `Well, your
nobody called today, and she hung when I asked her name' _ I still
know every word!'' By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COLLINS-MUSIC (Undated) - Judy Collins has never been shy about
speaking her mind. She is of the Dylan-Baez-Seeger generation that
addressed the ills of 1960s America with protest songs and folk
music. Next year she will mark 40 years since she was first paid to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   She has not stopped since. By BARBARA YOST. Story will move in
the ``E'' category. &QL;

   &QL;  PENN. LAWMAKER SAYS DEMS THREATENED HIM FOR CALLING FOR PREZ
TO RESIGN By Lisa Fine
</P>

   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. -- Rep. Paul McHale said he received
threats of ``political retaliation'' from other Democrats since he
called on President Clinton earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is has been the most difficult period of my political
career - one that I would never want to relive again,'' Mchale,
D-Lehigh Valley, said. ``I have received sharp criticism in writing
and verbally -- some are what could only be described as threats to
my political future. There have been some heavy-handed tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, McHale he became the first Democrat in the House of
Representatives to publicly denounce Clinton amid the scandal
surrounding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, McHale and a Republican House lawmaker sent
Clinton a letter asking the president to resign. He also hit the
national television circuit condemning Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   He authored a censure resolution. He has not said whether he
will vote to impeach Clinton but has hinted he is strongly leaning
toward doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, McHale said he received phone calls
from former employees, constituents and fellow Democrats
criticizing and second-guessing his actions.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prepares to vote this weekend on whether to impeach
Clinton, McHale said his experience has been illustrative of ``the
heat of the partisan-driven process of this impeachment inquiry.''
McHale, who is retiring next month, said he doesn't plan to run for
office again. But Democrats told him in letters and comments that
they would remember his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was made clear to me by some of the more partisan members
of my party and defenders of the president that if I decide to
enter public life again or seek office that they have long
memories,'' McHale said.
</P>
<P>
   McHale would not say specifically who sent the letters or made
the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wyche, a spokesman for the Democratic National Comittee
said ``strong-arming'' tactics or threats of any kind are not
condoned or tolerated by the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we are definitely opposed to a member
doing,'' Wyche said. ``The impeachment vote is a vote of
conscience. Congressman McHale has talked about censure being a
better course and we agree with him on that. I would take offense
to anyone who is making threats to him like that.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said his criticisms of Clinton has stemmed from
Democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we Democrats can pass laws to help sexual
harassment lawsuits and then excuse Clinton's conduct in the Paula
Jones case,'' McHale said. ``How can you send the message that it
is okay for the president to act this way and then expect a CEO of
a company to take testimony seriously in a sexual harassment case
against him?''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said he feels badly that his critical comments of Clinton
were met with claims of disloyalty from members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret that what I have done and will do will hurt
the feelings of close friends and political supporters,'' McHale
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to have had the support of some in his
party, but acted in a way that was ``true `` to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a great deal of courage to go out there on your
own,'' McHale said. ``It's the most courageous thing I've done in
my 20 years of public life. I feel I have tried to make a
difference.'' -30-

   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a veiled
warning Thursday that Israel would hit back if attacked by
President Saddam Hussein in response to the wave of U.S. and
British air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right to self-defense,'' Netanyahu said in a
radio interview. ``Israel will know how to defend itself. I think
everyone knows what Israel's capabilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Israeli army announced that it was positioning
Patriot missiles to defend against a possible Iraqi missile attack,
Israeli officials said such an attack is highly unlikely. Saddam's
offensive abilities are limited, they said, and he would not want
to risk retaliation by Israel while under U.S. and British assault.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, chief of research for Israeli military
intelligence, said at a news conference, ``At the moment, Saddam
Hussein is preoccupied with defense against the United States, and
our assessment is that as long as there is no concrete threat to
his existence, he will not take steps to attack Israel that could
embroil him on another front.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the army's civil defense command, some Israelis
stocked up on gas masks and protective materials for their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians protested the air
strikes, burning American flags days after the same banners were
hoisted to welcome President Clinton to Bethlehem and the Gaza
Strip. Some protests turned into stone-throwing clashes with
Israeli troops, and a 20-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed
in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ordered the departure of some staff members
and their families from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, recommending that
other Americans should consider leaving. British travel companies
evacuated several hundred tourists from Eilat, a Red Sea resort,
while the Israeli Tourism Ministry announced that it had enough gas
masks for all visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, for his part, praised what he described as the
``composure'' of the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not involved in this conflict, and we have no intention
of being involved in this conflict,'' he said. ``But if someone
will want to involve us, we know that Israel has the full right to
self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Israel was hit by 39 Iraqi Scud
missiles but did not respond, because it wanted to prevent a
defection of Arab countries from the U.S.-led coalition. There is
no such coalition today, and the Israelis probably would feel freer
to respond to any attack.

   DOUBTS ABOUT CLINTON'S MOTIVES SUBTLY SHAPE HIS PRESIDENCY
   By BOB DEANS
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday found himself having
to defend his decision to attack Iraq from criticism that the raids
were timed to disrupt impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not true,'' Clinton told reporters as he began a
closed-door briefing on the strikes with his national security
team. ''I don't think any serious person would believe that any
president would do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While no previous Clinton initiative has generated the
skepticism of Clinton's order to strike Iraq, every major action
since the Monica Lewinsky affair erupted last January has been
scrutinized for scandal-related significance.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they are true or false, the allegations of ulterior
motives themselves
</P>
<P>
   affect Clinton's presidency in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, they complicate presidential decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has more than proven his ability to compartmentalize
issues over the past 12 months. But the administration's obsession
with public opinion and its intensive coordination with the
Congress makes clear that, at some level, considerations are made
about how any given statement, initiative or policy might be
perceived in light of the ongoing impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also make it difficult for Clinton to get across the
message behind his moves.
</P>
<P>
   At his most recent press conference in Jerusalem last Sunday,
Clinton's efforts to discuss the Mideast peace process were so
thwarted by repeated impeachment-related questions, from Israeli as
well as American reporters, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
was reduced at one point to asking that reporters stick to the
subject of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the current environment virtually assures that
Clinton's motives will be questioned, at least by his detractors,
no matter what he tries to do.
</P>
<P>
   With a lengthy Senate trial likely in the event that the House
votes in the days ahead to impeach the president, nagging questions
from the press and from Clinton's political foes about how White
House actions play into the impeachment process appear certain to
continue well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's in an extremely difficult position, where
people are naturally suspicious,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Impeachment isn't thought to be a normal, regular activity
certainly, it's extraordinary,'' said Mann. ''Now it's happening,
and so of course every member of the press is going to ask the
question. It comes with the territory. There's no avoiding it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraq attack makes the point.
</P>
<P>
   Every administration official Clinton sent out to try to explain
the purpose and goals of the air strikes _ White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton, national security adviser Samuel
Berger and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ has been forced
to deal with the question of whether the ongoing raids have
political purposes behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Each has stridently denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the facts as they are, given the fact that (Clinton)
makes
</P>
<P>
   decisions based on what's in the national security interest,''
said Lockhart, ''he
</P>
<P>
   believes that you can have a debate on the policy, but not a
real debate on the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   White House staffers can see no clear way out of their current
dilemma. Clinton himself has prescribed the only cure: simply keep
showing up for work and do the best job possible.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials adamantly reject, though, the view that
the scandal-poisoned environment undercuts Clinton's authority or
ability to perform his job as the nation's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president has demonstrated his ability to lead
both our country and lead within the international community,''
said Lockhart. ''I don't think the president has trouble separating
the vital national security interests of this country with some of
the domestic politics that are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the American public must make similar distinctions.
That, said Mann, won't necessarily hurt Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''My tentative political reading is that the Republicans have
greatly overplayed their hand,'' Mann said, by suggesting that the
Iraq raids were politically timed and by then rushing forward with
House impeachment debate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They run a risk of looking like zealots,'' said Mann,
''determined, at any price, to get their hated president.''

NO GLITZ, JUST SOLID GOLD IN `NAGANO '98'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bud Greenspan's films always induce a little deja vu because
there doesn't seem to be much difference from one to the other. For
some viewers, one athlete overcoming daunting obstacles to win gold
in the '60s will seem pretty much like another overcoming daunting
obstacles to win gold in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan, the dean of sports documentarians, has the heart
of a romantic storyteller. ``I'm pretty idealistic about the whole
philosophy of the Olympics,'' he told TV critics last summer.
``It's almost a religious concept to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Greenspan's latest effort for Showtime, premiering
Sunday at 8 p.m., is numbingly familiar in its Greenspan-ness, but
still good for a couple of lump-in-the-throat moments and a tingle
or two.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who began covering sports before the Dodgers left
Brooklyn, is that rare breed with an eye for arresting images and
an ear for well-chosen words. His filmmaking isn't precocious; it
isn't cute.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the occasional slow-motion clip for dramatic effect,
it is straightforward, almost archaic in an age of quick cuts and
jarring edits. And, even if narrator Will Lyman's deep drone is
reminiscent of a National Football League highlight reel, there is
a quiet dignity to Greenspan's work that is soothing, despite the
chaotic nature of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nagano '98 Olympics'' is similar to the features that NBC and
CBS used in their telecasts of the Games in '96 and '98. But where
the networks caught flak for ignoring the action in favor of the
inspirational warm-and-fuzzies, Greenspan's job is exactly that: to
find the human aspect of an athletic competition where the stated
goal is to celebrate ``the honor and glory of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is still more about the athlete _ and the single-minded
athletic quest _ than it is about the athlete at home. The networks
love to give us shots of athletes cooking breakfast or giving the
dog a bath, but Greenspan doesn't go in for that. Away from the
competition venue, the athlete may be seen on his or her home turf
_ for winter Olympians it's usually a mountain village _ but
there's not a lot of up-close-and-personal stuff going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Straight-ahead interviews, often with the voice of a translator
providing the athlete's words, are more Greenspan's style. Not
flashy, but starkly effective in an uncluttered, just-the-facts
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano film doesn't pretend to cover the entire spectrum of
Olympic events. No curling. No luge. No biathlon. Instead, it
focuses on the stories of 11 athletes. Some of them won gold last
February, some won much more than a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of ``Nagano '98 Olympics'' are alpine skiers
Jean-Luc Cretier of France and Brian Stemmle of Canada; figure
skater Lu Chen of China; cross-country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and
Thomas Alsgaard, both of Norway; speed skaters Kirstin Holum of the
United States and Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany; bobsled
drivers Guenther Huber of Italy and Pierre Lueders of Canada;
alpine skier Deborah Compagnoni of Italy; and ski jumper Masahiko
Harada of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread tying this group of uncommon athletes together
is a determination that most of us can only marvel at. Whether it's
one athlete's legendary effort to win an eighth Olympic gold medal
or the enormously satisfying tale of two rivals who end up tying
for the gold, or another athlete's emergence from a bout of
self-doubt, Greenspan is adept at showing that, while there's
nothing quite like the thrill of victory, there doesn't have to be
agony in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when we hear regularly about athletes being
suspended for drug use and, even more recently, about bribes being
made by some groups to secure rights to host the Olympic Games,
Greenspan concentrates solely on the basic concept of athletic
achievement. It may be naive to think that sports can exist in such
a vacuum. It's also most pleasant.

WOES ONLY STRENGTHEN JUDY COLLINS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Judy Collins was there, speaking in that lovely,
lilting voice we've been listening to for almost four decades.
</P>
<P>
   And then she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to cut this short,'' she was saying from her hotel
room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ``But I have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   She was gracious. She was polite. She thanked me for my time.
</P>
<P>
   But she was gone, barely 10 minutes into a telephone interview
that had twice been interrupted by calls waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of Collins' cheery hello, I was on hold,
consigned to the hotel's version of Muzak: Beethoven's ``Ode to
Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, she returned, sweet Judy blue eyes, happy
to answer questions about a president who admired her singing so
much he named his only-begotten daughter after one of her hits,
``Chelsea Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was at Bill Clinton's first triumphant inauguration
where it seemed all the promise of the future could be summed up in
a Fleetwood Mac song ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   She has seen both sides now of the man whose personal foibles
have alienated him from disenchanted people who once fawned. At 59,
her own life a series of ups and downs, marked by sensational
musical success and also by such tragedies as the suicide of her
only son, Collins has never wavered in her devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful president. He will go down as a great
president,'' she said with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   While confessing that ``I'm not thrilled with some of the things
he's done,'' Collins blames groups that she believes have raised
huge sums of money to discredit Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She does not use the term ``right-wing conspiracy.'' But it is
clear she sees forces at work hounding the president. Of Clinton
nemesis Ken Starr, she says bluntly, ``I don't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Collins has never been shy about speaking her mind. She is
of the Dylan-Baez-Seeger generation that addressed the ills of
1960s America with protest songs and folk music. Next year she will
mark 40 years since she was first paid to sing.
</P>
<P>
   She has not stopped since. All of the temptations of the
flower-child era (pills proffered at parties, alcoholism, affairs
with such notables as Stephen Stills, who wrote the exquisite
``Suite: Judy Blue Eyes'' to mark their breakup), bouts of illness
(childhood polio, tuberculosis, hepatitis, bulimia) and surgery on
her vocal cords only seem to have made the woman stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Even throat surgery could not daunt her. In 1977, a hemangioma
(swollen capillary) on the vibrating surface of her vocal cord
threatened to silence her gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid I would never sing again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after undergoing risky laser surgery, Collins recuperated
miraculously in just a few months and returned with a clear voice
and an even wider vocal range. She attributes her recovery to the
solid voice training she had as a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Today Collins is as amazing as ever. She is currently enjoying a
three-week Christmas tour that has taken her across the country to
serenade an audience that includes not only fans who still thrill
to ``Both Sides Now,'' ``Someday Soon,'' ``Send in the Clowns'' and
her rendition of ``Amazing Grace,'' but a new generation that
clamors for her CDs, including last year's ``Christmas at the
Biltmore Estate.''
</P>
<P>
   But true to the first cut on her Christmas album, Collins will
be home for Christmas in New York, where she enjoys a rich life
with second husband Louis Nelson, a close-knit circle of friends
and a voracious appetite for reading.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is as much a writer as a reader. With five books already
published, including a novel, she added a sixth this year,
``Singing Lessons.'' The book is part autobiography and part
exorcism of the pain that has plagued her since 1992 when her
beloved son Clark committed suicide at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   The hurt is palpable. So is the feeling of redemption evident in
the last lines: ``In the midst of winter,'' she quotes Albert
Camus, ``I discovered that in me there was an invincible summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderfully cathartic,'' Collins said of writing her
book.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's death inducted her into the sisterhood of celebrity
survivors of family suicides _ Mariette Hartley, Joan Rivers,
Gloria Vanderbilt _ who have spoken out about the despair and
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide is the last taboo,'' Collins said. ``People are afraid
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Collins. For her, there was no question her agony would be
vented in a book: ``I'm a writer. So I wrote. That's how I
process.''
</P>
<P>
   She will also launch a Web site (www.caretolive.com) in the next
few weeks on which she will share chapters from ``Singing
Lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing the book has changed her, she said, and she is better
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst has happened. Now I don't fear anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Her only fear, apparently, is running out of time. The lilting
voice politely dismissed me.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she had a sound check. Perhaps it was lunch time. Joan
Baez might have stopped by to protest the crack in the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Monica Lewinsky wants to record an album. Send in the
clowns.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas,'' Collins said breezily.
</P>
<P>
   And then she was gone. &QL;

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Soon after the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah
Ocalan, was captured last month in Italy, the leader of the legal
Kurdish political party said that this was ``an interesting
moment'' and might give the Turkish government a chance to consider
``a peaceful solution to the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, such a mild comment might have gone unnoticed.
But since Ocalan's capture emotions on the Kurdish issue have been
running higher than usual. The leader of the legal party, Murat
Bozlak, was arrested and is being held in a Turkish jail. The
authorities are deciding whether to charge him with subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and officials have waged an intense campaign to
convince the world that Ocalan is a terrorist whose crimes have no
political basis. Rights groups agree that he is guilty of what they
call ``crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless some prominent Europeans have suggested that Ocalan
might be considered a political figure. On Wednesday an Italian
court released him from house arrest, a move that heightened the
outrage many Turks are feeling toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage is no longer directed solely at Ocalan and members
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK. The fervor is
also aimed at people who are not involved in the war but have
expressed sympathy for Kurdish aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   This month a radio station here staged a music festival at which
a Kurdish musician had been scheduled to appear. The festival hall
was on the grounds of a military museum, and shortly before it
began an officer called the organizers and said the Kurdish concert
would have to be canceled ``in view of the present situation.''
</P>
<P>
   One organizer said later that if it had not been for the recent
capture of Ocalan and the debate that it has set off the concert
would have probably been allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole climate has undergone quite a change,'' the
organizer, Omer Madra, said. ``There is a feeling of vengeance,
especially among the families of people who have died in the
conflict. It's vengeance in a general sense against the PKK and its
sympathizers. But it could be turning into a wider sort of
anti-Kurdish feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims of the surge of emotion is Andrew Finkel, a
British-born journalist who has lived in Turkey for more than 10
years. Finkel is known in part for his work as a columnist in
Sabah, one of the largest newspapers in Turkey. In a column after
Ocalan's capture he suggested that the 14-year war on Kurdish
separatists was ``damaging Turkey's own conscience and democratic
sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People disappeared, torture was routine, villagers were forced
to leave their homes, and an entire newspaper office in Istanbul
was blown to smithereens,'' he wrote. ``Winning the war was not
easy. Sooner or later someone is going to have to win the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel was dismissed within hours after the column had appeared.
A columnist in another paper here, Hurriyet, then denounced him
under the headline ``Ignorant Finkel'' and said, ``It would be
better if Finkel did some research instead of speaking and writing
so stupidly.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kurdish member of Parliament, Hasim Hasimi, said he regretted
that free discussion of the Kurdish issue had become so difficult.
``In the whole world governments and media are talking about Ocalan
and the Kurdish problem, but we are not,'' Hasimi said. ``We can't
discuss our own situation. We have a problem and we should deal
with it in a democratic way. But tension is rising here. We are
ourselves doing what the PKK has not been able to do in 14 years,
which is to create conflict within our society.''

TEACHER GIVES THIEF A HARD LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our friend is a wonderful woman _ tender, but also no-nonsense
strong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She happens to be the daughter of the university athletic
director who, in 1911, came up with the idea of a homecoming
weekend for a football game and alumni reunion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband have raised three fine children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has battled cancer and won. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And she retired not long ago after a 30-year career as a teacher
in urban public schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The long and short of it is that the purse-snatcher picked the
wrong mark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our friend was in the grocery at midafternoon in the friendly,
safe neighborhood near home _ her purse in the basket beside her as
she made a selection from the shelf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, she noticed her purse
leaving the basket, and a woman in a red sweatshirt and jeans
headed out the door with it under her arm. Our friend ran after her
into the street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady, you have my purse!'' she cried. ``Do you want me to call
the police?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lady ran on, into a parking lot, where she momentarily
disappeared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seemed to notice the commotion. Our friend asked a man in
rough work clothes, standing nearby and smoking, if he'd seen the
woman in a red sweatshirt run by. The man shrugged his shoulders,
replied with a curt ``No,'' and bent aside to tie his shoe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appeared everything was lost _ the purse, the money it
contained, credit cards and, most important, pictures of the
children. But the victim of this heist didn't give up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She climbed up on the side of a trash container in the lot to
get a better vantage. She waited. And, sure enough, she spotted the
red shirt and the woman headed toward a rusty, dented old car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the thief got in, our friend put her foot in the door to
prevent it from being closed. Then she reached inside and seized
back her property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't do that!'' she told the woman sternly. ``Why did
you take my purse?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked to be 30 or 35 years old, with unkempt dyed or
bleached blonde hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need money?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman hung her head. ``Yes,'' she said tearfully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon our friend opened her recovered purse and took out a
$10 bill _ most of what she was carrying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take this,'' she said. ``If you need money, there are other
ways to get it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go,'' said the woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All right. (Begin ital) But don't you ever steal anybody's
purse again!'' (end italic) Spoken like someone whose life work has
been teaching _ not just academic subjects, but also in matters of
character and behavior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman backed the old car, picked up the man who'd been
approached for help, and the two of them rode away together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The obvious lesson is that a red shirt isn't an ideal thief's
choice. Whether the larger lesson will register can't be known. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What seems likely is that the urban school systems of this
country are peopled by a great many teachers with that blend of
courage and compassion. And if only bureaucrats and bickering
administrators would stand aside and let them teach, we'd be
hearing less about the shortcomings of public education. &QL;

NEW MEDICARE PROGRAM WILL LEAD TO CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you understand the following paragraph? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can return to your Medigap policy if you dropped it to
enroll in a Medicare health plan or a Medicare SELECT policy.
However: (1) this must be the first time that you enrolled in a
health plan or a SELECT policy; (2) you must leave the health plan
or SELECT policy within one year after joining; and (3) after
leaving your health plan or SELECT policy, you must choose a
Medigap policy within 63 days. If you meet these requirements, you
can return to your original Medigap policy, if it is still offered,
or policies A, B, C, or F.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would your 85-year-old mother understand it? asks Jerry Nebbia,
who heads the William M. Mercer health-care and group benefits
consulting practice in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quote is from ``Medicare &AMP; You,'' an enrollment handbook
from the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the agency
publicizing upcoming Medicare changes. Even if you're not a
Medicare recipient _ yet _ it pays to know what's ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reports about the status of Medicare and its new managed-care
option, Medicare (plus) Choice, published Monday in The Kansas City
Star, indicated confusion ahead. Nebbia says Medicare recipients
won't suffer alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Mercer survey found that more than half of all employers who
offer retiree medical benefits ``have not done anything specific to
prepare for the barrage of phone calls, letters and e-mails
expected when the Medicare (plus) Choice information reaches
recipients this month.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consulting company says 62 percent of mid-size and large
organizations offer retiree medical benefits. Yet only about half
have done anything to educate their benefits staff about Medicare
changes, much less provide information to their retirees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question barrage may not hit small businesses immediately.
Typically, larger businesses are the ones that extend health-care
benefits to retirees. But many small-business operators also
provide financial information to their retirees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question barrage may not hit the Kansas City area
immediately. Missouri and Kansas are not among the five states
(Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon and Washington) introducing
Medicare (plus) Choice in 1999. But beware the national rollout in
2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the options is complicated. Even persons familiar
with managed care and health maintenance organizations will wade
through dense Medicare (plus) Choice information. Retirees, many of
whom know only traditional indemnity plans for their health
insurance coverage, will have extra questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the minimum, company benefits offices need to let their
retirees know how their benefit plans will coordinate with
Medicare,'' Nebbia said. ``They need to be ready to help their
retirees choose options that make sense for them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order for busy benefits offices. Many businesses
have their hands full helping employees cope with annual enrollment
periods for multiple health-care plans. Many questions already
exist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why consulting companies are sounding the alert.
Somebody's going to have to provide a lot of answers soon. &QL;

 BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF KC hopes buy its St. Louis counterpart  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS KARASH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is prepared to make an
offer of $278 million to buy St. Louis-based Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Missouri, the head of the Kansas City company said
Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would amount to the biggest combination among
Missouri health insurers in recent memory, said Randy McConnell, a
spokesman for the Missouri Department of Insurance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John P. Mascotte, president and chief executive officer of Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, discussed the proposal at a
hearing in St. Louis by a special court master acting on behalf of
Cole County Circuit Judge Thomas Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The special master is reviewing a proposed settlement of
litigation involving an attempt a few years ago by Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Missouri to convert to a for-profit company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement calls for the assets of Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Missouri, including its 15 million shares of stock
in RightChoice Managed Care Inc., to endow a charitable health-care
foundation to be known as the Missouri Foundation for Health. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The foundation would fund health-care programs for uninsured and
under-insured residents throughout much of Missouri. The proposed
endowment was valued at $150 million earlier this year, McConnell
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mascotte said under his proposal a ``powerful statewide,
multisite, efficient operation would be created. Significant
economies would be realized.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is the leading health
insurer in the Kansas City area. It provides health insurance
services to 774,000 people in 30 counties in western Missouri and
Johnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas. The Kansas City insurer
and its affiliates have more than 1,300 employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri has more than 2 million
members, including members of RightChoice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense competition from big, national managed-care
companies that have entered the Kansas City market, Mascotte said
the proposed merger was not a make-or-break situation for the
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an opportunity to achieve greater efficiency
and more effectiveness in the marketplace as a result of the
combination,'' Mascotte said. ``We believe that a statewide Blue
Cross and Blue Shield organization would allow us the opportunity
to write more business and do it more efficiently than would be the
case if the two plans remained separate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mascotte said ``retaining the non-profit status of
Blue Cross on a statewide basis is the best way of maintaining the
health insurance capacity that Missourians need.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mascotte said the headquarters of the combined entity would be
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Mascotte's proposal drew a chilly response in St. Louis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John O'Rourke, the head of RightChoice and Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Missouri, said his companies earlier had declined to
enter such talks with the Kansas City insurer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke said the proposed settlement with the state ``is an
integral part of our long-range strategic plan and offers a
superior alternative.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After implementation of our settlement agreement as agreed to
with the state, RightChoice will be better positioned to consider
combinations with other entities to ensure that value to all
shareholders is maximized,'' O'Rourke said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mascotte said his proposal was discussed in September and
October among officials of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas
City, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri and RightChoice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``While Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri and RightChoice
management informed us, after a preliminary discussion, they had
determined not to enter into further discussions with us, we
continue to believe the alternative we are proposing actually
builds on the proposed settlement agreement and offers greater
benefits,'' Mascotte said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Kansas City insurer denied it was in merger
talks with the St. Louis company but left the door open to such
talks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, with the Missouri Department of Insurance, said the
department had been aware for some time that the Kansas City
insurer wanted to acquire its St. Louis counterpart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such a sale would be subject to approval by Cole County Circuit
Judge Thomas Brown and the department of insurance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deal would include payment to RightChoice shareholders of
$13.50 per share in cash. &QL;

<P>
   Scientists say they have shut down the symptoms of asthma in
mice by blocking a single chemical messenger in the immune system,
raising the prospect of new, finely tuned drugs to treat the
disease that afflicts 15 million Americans and annually kills
several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the current journal Science, researchers say they
have shown that a chemical messenger known as interleukin-13, or
IL-13, can by itself trigger the abnormal immune response that
causes breathing passages to become ``twitchy'' _ oversensitive to
irritants _ and narrowed, plugged with mucus and inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   And when the scientists used a laboratory-made protein to sop up
excess IL-13 in the lungs of mice in which asthma attacks had been
triggered, it dramatically reduced the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no single part of the complex immune system had been
identified as both necessary and sufficient to set off the entire
cascade of reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step forward,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, chief
of the pulmonary medicine division at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've recognized for quite a while that asthma is an
inflammatory disease, and we've been looking for something that
could be at the root of it,'' said Drazen, who was not involved in
the study. ``If IL-13 is at the root of it,'' as the new findings
suggest, ``you would think you could get rid of that inflammation
and make the patient better'' if a drug could be found that blocks
the action of IL-13.
</P>
<P>
   A narrowly targeted asthma treatment would be welcome news for
patients who currently rely on a mixture of lung-clearing
inhalants, steroids, and anti-inflammatory and other drugs to
control the wheezing and shortness of breath caused by asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the leading cause of school days missed by US
children, is a major cause of work absenteeism, and causes about
5,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse studies were carried out by Marsha Wills-Karp and
colleagues at Johns Hopkins University, using a protein developed
by Debra D. Donaldson of Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge to
block IL-13.
</P>
<P>
   That protein is being investigated as a potential asthma drug,
said L. Patrick Gage, former president of Genetics Institute and
currently president of Wyeth-Ayerst Research in Radnor, Pa.
Wyeth-Ayerst and Genetics Institute are owned by American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty promising, but we have a lot more work to do,''
said Gage in a telephone interview. Among other things, any side
effects of blocking IL-13 in human patients must be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be 18 months or more at the earliest before
clinical trials could begin, said Gage.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion study in Science, researchers at the University
of California in San Francisco led by Gabriele G. Grunig and Dr.
David B. Corry report similar findings. They also showed that
applying IL-13 directly to mouse nasal passages brought on the
symptoms, and did so more potently than another form of
interleukin, IL-4, which had previously been implicated in asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the result of an overreaction by the immune system to
substances in the environment that in themselves are not
particularly harmful. The mistaken reaction occurs when, in
response to inhaled substances such as pollen, insect droppings, or
smoke, immune cells called CD4 cells rapidly multiply and release a
variety of messenger chemicals called cytokines.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the cytokines produce antibodies and activate so-called
mast cells, which release histamines and other substances that
constrict the breathing passages, stimulate the production of
mucus, and attract inflammatory cells called eosinophils.
</P>
<P>
   It had been thought that the cytokine known as IL-4 was the most
important player in this cascade. But the new studies show that
IL-13 is the single most important immune system element _ it can
cause the asthma symptoms by itself, and when it is blocked, the
manifestations subside.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists used mice that have a tendency to develop
asthmatic symptoms. When the mice were given the protein that
blocks IL-13 in an aerosol form and then were exposed to a foreign
substance known to trigger asthma, they did not develop narrowed
and clogged airways and other symptoms, said the researchers.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House will proceed Friday
with a debate on impeaching President Clinton despite strong
Democratic objections to taking up the issue while American forces
attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we engage in conflict, democracy does not stop,'' said
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey of Texas, who was among the
leading Republicans who defended the decision to move ahead with
the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   The precise rules governing the debate and the length of
deliberations were still being hashed out late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats bristled at taking up the issue so soon after
Clinton ordered the airborne attacks, saying a vote on removing the
president from office should not be taken in a time of military
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan accused the Republican leaders
of showing ``a lack of judgment ... a lack of common sense'' in
proceeding with the impeachment issue while military forces are
engaged in a conflict with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must think of not only how this act will be received by
Americans,'' said Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt of
Missouri. ``We also have to look at how Saddam Hussein will
perceive the idea and information that while he is under physical
attack ... we are having a debate to remove the commander in
chief.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Nancy Pelosi said it was ``disrespectful of the
troops'' to seek to impeach the president. ``We're going to weaken
the U.S. by impeaching the commander in chief and Saddam Hussein is
going to have a big chuckle about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and other Republicans insisted that the debate and a
likely vote to impeach Clinton must proceed. The debate, scheduled
to start Thursday, was postponed when American and British forces
began bombing Iraq Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In one break from the partisanship that has dominated the
impeachment issue, the House Thursday overwhelmingly approved a
resolution supporting American troops in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The House will consider charges that Clinton committed perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power in connection with the
cover-up of his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a 228-207 majority in the House, where a
majority vote in favor of one or more articles of impeachment would
trigger a Senate trial. If convicted by a two-thirds majority in
the Senate, Clinton would automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of Republican lawmakers sought to separate impeachment
from the Gulf crisis, saying domestic business must go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a day of thoughtful stepping back, and then you
move on,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Rules Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., said the
president should have ordered the airstrikes on Iraq three months
ago, on another occasion when Saddam defied international weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want this done and over with and the only
way to get it done is to start (Friday) morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move this legislation,'' said Solomon, who is
retiring from Congress at the end of this year. ``We want to move
it because so that Congress can get back to its work.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon dismissed arguments that troops in the Persian Gulf
would be demoralized if the impeachment debate goes on while they
are in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, as House members prepared to vote on a
resolution to support the use of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf,
some lawmakers appeared to be taking pot shots at Solomon, who had
accused Clinton of launching airstrikes to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the resolution was 417 to 5 with Elizabeth Furse,
D-Ore., voting ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the resolution were Barbara Lee, D-Calif.,
Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., Mark Sanford,
R-S.C., and Ron Paul, R-Texas.

</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., who was impeached as a federal
judge before coming to Congress, said it was ``crass'' to question
Clinton's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``To question the integrity of his decision is insidious and
dangerous and can be destabilizing to our troops,'' Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon said he spoke to several representatives of major
veterans organizations who assured him it would not harm U.S.
troops if Congress proceeded with its impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., also appeared to be aiming his
comments at Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate partisan whose lust for the
president's blood will cause him to make statements that will give
aid and comfort to the enemy,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., also sharply criticized those who
questioned Clinton's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our colleagues who have questioned the president motives,
shame on you,'' Meehan said. ``Shame on you for ending the
tradition of setting aside partisanship at the water's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said suggestions that Clinton's
decision on Iraq was an attempt to avoid impeachment should be
dismissed because the Defense Department supports the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any reason to doubt, you'd hear all kinds of
squawks out of the Pentagon,'' Frank said.

   KUWAIT _ Even Arab governments that joined with the United
States against Baghdad in early 1991 have offered almost no public
support for the attack under way on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions from countries like Egypt, Qatar and Syria have
ranged instead from regret to concern to outright condemnation.
Even Kuwait, which was liberated from Iraqi occupation by the
Persian Gulf war, has stopped short of endorsing the latest
U.S.-led military action.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait did lend support Thursday night by permitting U.S. and
British fighter planes to launch raids from bases here. But the
lack of clear endorsement for the strikes left the United States
and Britain exposed to an outpouring of anger that echoed from
other quarters of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Syrian Parliament, Abdulqad Qaddoura,
denounced the attacks in bitter terms, saying they had ``harmed our
people, especially the children and civilians, and increased their
suffering and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt also expressed regret and called for ``effective action
from all concerned parties to contain the situation and stop it
from deteriorating further.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the staging area for the Persian Gulf war and
still a crucial U.S. ally, issued no official comment. Newspapers
there expressed sympathy for the Iraqi people but blamed President
Saddam Hussein for dragging his country into another conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And Qatar, another U.S. ally in the gulf, said it was ``deeply
concerned'' over the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, even as anti-U.S. demonstrations broke out on the
West Bank and other Palestinians joined in denunciations of the
U.S.-led attack, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat took pains to
avoid public comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel,
called on the United States and Britain to halt the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This region doesn't need Desert Shields and Storms and
Foxes,'' Erakat said, using the military names for the current
campaign against Iraq and its predecessors. ``We demand an
immediate end to these strikes and to the siege against 23 million
Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other anti-U.S. protests in the Arab world, Jordanian
women demonstrated outside a U.N. building in Amman, and in Cairo
hundreds of students marched from a hostel to a public square,
where the police asked them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the United States' most persistent critics in the region
made no effort to pull their punches. Lebanon's new prime minister
and foreign minister, Selim al-Hoss, demanded that the United
States not only ``stop this aggression'' but also end the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which said a stray cruise missile struck one of its
southern cities, causing damage but no casualties, called the
strikes unacceptable. ``Such unilateral attacks against Iraq will
worsen the suffering of the Iraqi people and increase instability
in the region,'' the Tehran radio said.

   Tobacco industry to offer ways to protect growers during N.C.
meeting
   By Peter Mantius
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Zell Miller and Gov.-elect Roy Barnes will lead a
contingent of Georgia officials to Raleigh-Durham, N.C., Friday to
listen to the tobacco industry's pitch on how best to protect
tobacco growers from being hurt by the recent $206 billion
liability settlement between the industry and more than 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Thurbert Baker and State Agriculture
Tommy Irvin will also attend the gathering of political leaders
from the six leading tobacco-producing states.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said the industry appears to be divided over how to deal
with the expected decline in demand for domestic tobacco resulting
from the liability settlement, which has driven cigarette prices up
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leader Phillip Morris favors compensating tobacco quota
holders for the anticipated decline in value of their holdings. But
No. 2 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco wants to try to prop up the value of
the quotas by committing to boost its domestic tobacco purchases
over the next 10 years, thereby guaranteeing a predictable market
for the product.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said he supports RJR's approach, and most growers like it,
too. However, many quota holders who lease their right to grow
tobacco lean toward Phillip Morris' cash compensation approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can come away (from today's meeting) with assurance
that they'll commit to continue buying tobacco,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the nation's fourth largest producer of tobacco. The
state has roughly 9,000 tobacco quota holders and somewhat fewer
growers, Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The system of quotas or allotments was created by Congress in
the 1930s and limits the amount of tobacco individual farmers can
grow. The system all but assures quota holders of turning a profit
on their crops.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is attending the meeting in case the state is called on
to make an immediate commitment, while Barnes is going as an
observer, according to Barnes spokesman, Gary Horlacher.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is attending because he was the state's point man in
agreeing to the liability settlement, which included a provision
requiring the industry to develop a plan to assist tobacco growers.

   Jungle of predictions make it hard to map course of Amazon.com
   By Mark Clothier
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Trying to predict the value of an Internet stock is a
little like trying to nail a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, analysts from two separate investment houses priced
one stock, Amazon.com, $350 apart.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC Oppenheimer's Henry Blodget's $400 target price came
Wednesday. It shot Amazon.com's stock higher still. The stock was
already inflated by a pending split and online holiday shopping
expectations. Amazon.com rose to $301.75, before closing Wednesday
at $289, up 19 percent, or $46.25.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Jonathan Cohen, of Merrill Lynch Global Securities,
set Amazon.com's 12-to- 18-month target price at $50. In reaction,
the market ran real fast the other way. Amazon.com dropped as low
as $260.56 1/4 before closing Thursday at $276.75, down $12.25.
</P>
<P>
   The online retailer lost $78.1 million on sales of $357.1
million for the first nine months of 1998. And the Seattle-based
Amazon.com lost $20 million on $81.7 million in sales over the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Horen, an analyst for NationsBanc Montgomery Securities,
has his Amazon.com 12- to 18-month target price set at between $150
and $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is overvalued,'' Horen said. ``I also think that,
when you get into these sorts of bubbles, that it just doesn't make
sense to be constantly changing ratings. You could, but it's not a
thing to do. The price level, when you get a bubble like this, I
think is driven by people trading electronically, running
valuations up very high,'' he said. ``My experience is that the
prices don't really sustain.''

LOTT SAYS HIS ACCUSATIONS WERE MISUNDERSTOOD

 (ATTN: Ariz., Del., Neb., Texas, Utah)   (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-IRAQ-REPUBS, IMPEACH-PROTEST,

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although a statement he issued Wednesday was
universally interpreted as accusing President Clinton of ordering
air strikes in Iraq to divert attention from impeachment, Sen.
Trent Lott, the Republican leader, insisted Thursday that was not
what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the decision is made and the action is under way, you
support it,'' he declared on television Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the bombing was beginning on Wednesday, a statement was
released by Lott's office that began: ``While I have been assured
by administration officials that there is no connection with the
impeachment process in the House of Representatives, I cannot
support this military action in the Persian Gulf at this time. Both
the timing and the policy are subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was furious. Democrats in Congress accused Lott
of violating the age-old political precept of not criticizing the
president publicly when troops were in danger. And many of Lott's
Republican colleagues held news conferences at which they said that
while they supported the military strikes, they understood Lott's
skepticism about the president's motives.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from Mississippi on CNN, Lott said Thursday that
his qualms about the timing were ``that we should have acted in
February, that we should have gone forward with the bombing effort
in November and that my concern now was one of policy in terms of
what is our strategic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   As for impeachment, Lott said, ``I believe there is no
relationship, but the fact that people ask that question is, in and
of itself, a question.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the administration had not told him the truth in
August about air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan, and added:
``Once you sort of feel like you've been burned, the next time it
comes around, then you're inclined to be a little more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott maintained that in 1991 ``when we had the vote in the House
and in the Senate'' authorizing President George Bush to use force
against Iraq, ``I don't believe there was a single Democrat that
voted for that.``
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 86 Democrats in the House and 10 in the Senate,
including Al Gore, voted for the authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Lott meant on Wednesday, nearly everybody in the
Capitol was talking about the connection between Iraq and
impeachment. The question on many minds Thursday involved not
whether the majority leader had raised the connection but whether
he had been right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republican senators who support the air strikes made a
point of defending Lott on the early morning television shows. For
instance, Sen. John McCain of Arizona said on ABC, ``Senator Lott
and I have some disagreement here as to the degree of support, but
I believe that it's understandable that people would have some
skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, many other Republicans also supported their
leader. For example, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, often seen as a
rival to Lott within the party, said, ``I think it's almost
astounding that so few others are questioning the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed, some Republican senators said that Lott may
have stepped out of bounds. Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah said, ``My
first reaction to Trent was, `Right on! I'm glad someone is saying
this,' but under the circumstances, he probably went a little
further than he should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said: ``It's not the way I would have done it. You have
to be very careful on these kinds of things because the air is
thick with raw partisanship in this town. Something this serious,
it seems to me, should overtake partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were more pointed, suggesting that Lott was not the
most adept of senators on complicated policy issues. ``Trent Lott
does not do foreign policy,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. of
Delaware, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said
in response to the Wednesday statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they could not afford to criticize their leader
publicly. But when promised anonymity, several said that Lott's
strengths lay in handling political matters and keeping the Senate
operating on schedule and not in making policy.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that his statement on Iraq was an example of his
tendency to blurt things out when he had not thought them through
completely.

   WORLD SPLITS IN REACTION TO U.S.-LED RAIDS ON IRAQ
   665 words
   By ANDREW MOLLISON
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While powerful Security Council members wrangled
fruitlessly behind closed doors Thursday at the United Nations
headquarters in New York, officials and opinion-shapers began
choosing up sides in the worldwide debate over the British-aided
U.S. attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathizers offered tolerant regrets and rather quiet support
for the bombings. Frustrated critics of the military strikes
condemned the United States and Britain with harsh words. However,
because both countries possess veto power at the Security Council,
they could block all efforts by Russia and China to arrange for an
immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, American use of refueling facilities in Spain and
some Middle Eastern countries where verbal support was tepid or
nonexistent apparently continued undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest endorsement came from Israel, where Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the actions as ``the only way
to dispossess Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   China was one of the first nations to object to the strikes. But
the strongest condemnations came from Russia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities constitute international terrorism,'' said a
resolution passed by the lower house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the strikes ``crudely
violated'' the U.N. charter. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primaklov said
it was ``outrageous'' to launch a strike without explicit
permission of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's Senate overwhelmingly approved a resolution stating,
``This house condemns the U.S. military strike on Iraq and
considers it as an affront to the entire Moslem Umma (nation).''
</P>
<P>
   However, other predominantly Moslem nations were more
circumspect. Tunisia confined itself to expressing ``dismay and
deep concern.''
</P>
<P>
   While Iran described the strikes as ``quite unacceptable,'' the
foreign ministry's spokesman, Hamid Reza Assefi, also called on
Iraq ``to cooperate with the United Nations and comply with the
Security Council resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong supporters of the air strikes as listed by the Associated
Press include such English-speaking countries as Canada, Australia
and New Zealand, and also South Korea, the Netherlands, Austria,
Spain and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing of mass-destruction weapons is a threat against
stability and security in the whole region,'' Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek said.
</P>
<P>
   France offered even-handed criticism of both sides _ deploring
``the grave human consequences'' of the strikes, but regretting the
failure of the Iraqi leaders ``to show proof of the spirit of
complete cooperation'' with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Japan was an outspoken defender of the raids, and India
a severe critic. Cambodia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam
expressed regrets.
</P>
<P>
   In Mauritania in west Africa, police broke up student
demonstrations against the U.S. and British strikes, but the
government itself took no public stance.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Operation Desert Fox, known in Spanish as
``Zorro del desierto,'' was condemned by Communist Cuba as an
``imperialist abuse.'' But President Carlos Menem of Argentina said
the strikes were ``the direct result of the Iraqi government's
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of force, rather than diplomacy, was criticized by
Venezuela and Costa Rica and regretted by other Latin countries
such as Brazil. Mexico expressed sorrow that ``''it was not
possible to find space for a diplomatic solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unexpected reaction came from Cyprus, the
island nation in the Mediterranean uncomfortably divided between
Greek-held and Turkish-held territories.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's press service, the Islamic Republic News Agency, reported
that Yiannakis Omirou, defense minister of the pro-Greek Republic
of Cyprus, asked, ``Why didn't they use the same measures towards
Turkey?''
</P>
<P>

this report.

   Coffee and buns to go: AFC to franchise in Middle East
   By Shelia M. Poole
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises announced Thursday it
has signed an agreement to develop 65 Seattle's Best Coffee cafes
and 65 Cinnabon bakeries in six Middle Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, with Ali Java Cinnamon, represents the first
franchising venture outside North America for Seattle's Best Coffee
and the first franchising deal since 1992 for Cinnabon.
</P>
<P>
   Both brands were acquired by AFC earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabian-based Ali Java Cinnamon will open the bakeries and
cafes in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab
Emirates and Oman. The franchise is owned and operated by Fahad Al
Rashoodi, a prominent Saudi businessman, and Prince Mishari Bin
Abdullahl Al Saud, a member of the Saudi royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Java will complete development over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee consumption is very high in the region as well as the
use of cinnamon in cooking,'' said Bill Van Epps, president of
AFC's International Division, who expects both brands to do well in
the Middle East. When all units are completed, the deal will bring
AFC $5 million in revenue annually.
</P>
<P>
   Epps said when Cinnabon was acquired last October, the database
included more than 600 inquiries from outside the United States
about possible franchise deals. Part of the reason for the
high-level of interest, he said, is because Cinnabon bakeries
usually are located in airports and shopping malls, sites that see
a lot of international traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Java already operates bakery cafe concepts in mall areas in
the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh, Jubail and Jeddah. Those sites
will be converted to SBC cafes and Cinnabon bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, coffee in that region is stronger than coffee in the
West, said Gary Goldstein, spokesman for the National Coffee
Association, a trade group based in New York. But an AFC
spokeswoman said the coffee will be among the same flavors sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a broad variety of roasts and blends to meet the
palates and tastes of the people of the Middle East,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AFC also plans to continue to expand abroad. Remaining
international markets available include Asia, Korean, The
Netherlands, Japan, South Africa, the Caribbean and Singapore, the
company said. AFC said it hopes to develop company-owned stores in
the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   AFC is the parent company of Church's Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP;
Biscuits and Chesapeake Bagels, Bakery &AMP; Cafe.

   MADRID, Spain _ The Spanish judge who issued the arrest warrant
for Gen. Augusto Pinochet in October expects to present an even
stronger case against the former Chilean dictator when England's
Law Lords reconsider his immunity from arrest, a Madrid court
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
285-page indictment provides more specifics than the arrest warrant
and extradition request filed earlier by the judge, Baltasar
Garzon, who indicted Pinochet on Dec. 10, after the Law Lords ruled
on Nov. 25 that he had no immunity from prosecution. On Thursday
they rejected their earlier ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment lays out the most detailed case to date against
Pinochet for the crimes of ``genocide, terrorism and torture,'' the
official said.

   No truce expected in 3-state water war
   By Charles Seabrook
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plans to build two key reservoirs in Georgia may be
delayed for at least a year as Georgia, Florida and Alabama
governors are expected today to extend the deadline for reaching a
settlement in the interstate water war.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, meeting in Montgomery, are expected to push the
deadline back to Dec. 31, 1999. Under two interstate water compacts
adopted by Congress last year, the three states were supposed to
develop by the end of this year allocation formulas to share the
waters of two river basins: the Apalachichola-Chattahoochee-Flint
(ACF) basin, and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) basin. The
headwaters of both basins are in Georgia. The ACF's waters are
shared by all the three states; Alabama and Georgia share the
waters of the ACT basin.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators appointed by the governors are attempting to produce
a regional water-use plan that would guarantee each state a
specific amount of water from the rivers. At stake for Georgia is
enough water to sustain growth in metro Atlanta and most of North
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those guarantees of enough water for growth
during the next 30 to 50 years, Georgians may have to pay higher
electricticty rates as hydropower production is reduced. Strict
limits on water for irrigation may be imposed on southwest Georgia
farmers. In metro Atlanta, permanent restrictions on outdoor
watering and other stern conservation measures may be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   With the three states still in wide disagreement over the terms
of the settlement, there is little chance the water-sharing
formulas will be agreed on by the date set by Congress. The
governors of the three states have the authority to extend the
deadine.
</P>
<P>
   If the governors don't agree to push back the deadlines, the
compacts, under terms set by Congress, will dissolve and the
decade-old water war will be thrown into the Supreme Court for
settlement. If that happens, the states could face a bitter,
protracted legal battle and no state may get what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how and when the water war is settled, Alabama
officials are demanding that plans for building a 3,500-acre
reservoir on the Tallapoosa River in west Georgia and a 476-acre
reservoir on the Flint in Pike County be put on hold until a
water-sharing formula is reached. Until then, say the officials,
none of the states knows for sure what its share will be. Also in
possible jeopardy are plans to add 1 billion gallon storage
capacity to Douglas County's reservoir on the Dog River.
</P>
<P>
   Alabamians are fearful that Georgia will stockpile water
upstream that Alabama needs for growth downstream if Georgia
proceeds with the dam-building before a water formula is worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Zell Miller, however, has put Alabama and Florida
on notice that Georgia will not put all of its development plans on
hold until a water-sharing agreement is devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia cannot place its entire future on hold,'' Miller told
negotiators for the three states in October. ``It must, as a part
of its own sovereign responsibility, move forward with its own
water development and its own internal solutions that protect its
muncipal, industrial, agricultural and environmental interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials say a ``live and let-live'' clause in the
interstate water compacts would allow them to proceed with plans
for the reservoirs absent a water-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   A squabble over the reservoir proposals may add more strife to
the already contentious water war negotiations among the three
states, and could even wreck the process, officials say. In
particular, says Walter Stevenson, chief of Alabama's Office of
Water Resources, ``the State of Georgia will be in violation of the
spirit, if not the letter, of the (ACF) compact'' if plans for the
Pike County reservoir proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has serious
concerns. ``EPA finds this project could have significant impact on
the current negotiations'' to settle the interstate water squabble,
said John Hankinson, the agency's regional adminsitrator in
Atlanta, in another letter to the corps.
</P>
<P>
   While the lake would be in Pike County, it is being pushed by
city of Griffin and Spalding County officials, who say the
reservoir is vital for fueling growth in their area and satisfying
ever-increasing demands for water. While population growth in
Spalding, which now has 55,000 residents, has been slow but steady,
officials there believe the county is poised for an explosion in
new large scale subdivisions because of changes in zoning
ordinances. ``This reservoir is a top priority for us,'' says
Rodney McCord, the mayor of Griffin, Spalding's county seat.
</P>
<P>
   In west Georgia, a similar battle may be shaping up. The West
Georgia Regional Water Authority, which serves Haralson, Paulding
and Carroll counties, has been been trying to build the 3,500-acre
reservoir on the Tallapoosa for more than a decade. ``We've waited
long enough,'' says Haralson commissioner Amos Sparks. ``We need
this reservoir, and we need to get it built.''
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir would provide drinking water, recreation and flood
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama officials, however, are vehemently opposed to the
reservoir until the water war is settled. In fact, the announcement
of plans in 1990 to build the reservoir in Haralson only a few
miles from the Alabama line helped trigger the water war. A
memorandum of agreement signed in 1992 by the governors of the
three states put plans to build the lake on hold until the states
could agree on a solution to their interstate water woes. The
governors' agreement also will expire on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   West Georgia officials have remained frustrated. When they
announced a year ago that they would seek a permit to build the
reservoir despite the lack of a water war settlement, it was enough
to bring more than 10 busloads of Alabamians to a hearing in
Buchanan, Ga., to protest the plan. The Georgia officials withdrew
their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amos and other west Georgia officials say they once again
will apply for state and federal permits in January to build the
reservoir. They contend that the 1992 memorandum of agreement that
delayed the project expires at the end of the year, and they are
not bound by the interstate water compacts that Congress passed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   State officials acknowledge that they are confused whether the
plans for the project can proceed while the water war negotiations
are still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something we're going to be talking about in the next
few days,'' says Bob Kerr, Georgia's chief neogotiator.

AMERICAN REPORTER IN MEXICO WAS MURDERED, FORENSIC REPORT SHOWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ American reporter Philip True, who disappeared
while hiking through rugged mountains in western Mexico, was killed
by being hit over the head and choked, Mexican forensic examiners
said Thursday. Earlier reports said he had died in an accidental
fall.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo ordered federal and state authorities
to ``spare no resources'' in investigating the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Mexican and U.S. officials on Wednesday suggested
that True, 50, the Mexico-based correspondent for The San Antonio
Express-News, had fallen to his death from a cliff in the Sierra
Madre.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Rivas Souza, the coroner of the state of Jalisco,
where True was killed, said after studying the autopsy results,
``It is a homicide. It is not an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy, which was performed in Guadalajara, also showed
that True had been sexually brutalized, forensic experts told
Mexican and U.S. officials. Justice officials said they were flying
the body to Mexico City Thursday to perform a second autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   True's decomposed remains were discovered early Wednesday at the
bottom of a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   A Huichol Indian resident of the barren area led a search party
to where he had seen True's body days before, by a cliff. The body
was no longer there, but a trail of blood, apparently from a head
wound, and feathers from True's sleeping bag, led the searchers to
a two-foot-deep grave concealed with brush where True was buried.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his possessions were missing, but he was still wearing
his good-quality watch. The autopsy results showed True had been
dead for about eight days.
</P>
<P>
   True, who had been a solo hiker since he was a teen-ager, set
out on Nov. 28 for a two-week trek through the Sierra de los
Huicholes, a sparsely populated and nearly inaccessible region.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy showed that True was strangled with a rope or
bandana. The coroner said other bruises were not consistent with a
fall.
</P>
<P>
   True became The Express-News correspondent in Mexico City in
1996. Colleagues remembered him as an affable, hard-working
reporter who reveled in covering the complexities of Mexico. His
wife, Marta, is five months' pregnant.

   Gingrich cautions Clinton critics, backs military action
   By Mark Sherman
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich on Thursday cautioned critics
of President Clinton's decision to attack Iraq that ``there is no
alternative'' to U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In what was probably the final floor speech of his 20-year
career in the House, Gingrich took issue with fellow Republicans
who have accused Clinton of ordering military strikes to divert
attention from pending impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said congressional leaders had been consulted on an
ongoing basis. ``There were conversations of substance,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the first speaker in a two-hour debate about a congressional
resolution of support for U.S. armed forces, Gingrich sounded
familiar themes about the projection of U.S. power and the nation's
ability to separate political squabbles from national security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must carry the burden of leading the world,'' Gingrich
said. ``It does not suspend for elections. It does not suspend for
Christmas. It does not suspend under any circumstances. The U.S.
has to lead. There is no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   He made only oblique references to impeachment proceedings,
which the House delayed Wednesday because of the air attacks on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. can both govern itself and lead the world
simultaneously,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his five-minute talk, the speaker said, ``No
matter the temporary arguments or temporary issues ... no one on
the planet should doubt the will of the American people to support
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points during the year, Gingrich has expressed
similar sentiments when the U.S. has been on the brink of using
military force or in the aftermath of military action.
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker also called on Clinton to articulate a plan to
bring about Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a parallel to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler in the
1930s, Gingrich said that the nation would one day regret its
reluctance to get rid of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Gingrich said, ``He'll get weapons of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the president also should bring Congress proposals
to increase the defense and intelligence budgets when he delivers
the State of the Union address in January. ``We cannot lead the
world on the cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made no mention of his imminent departure from
Congress, or the fact that he will no longer be a member of the
House when Clinton addresses a joint session of Congress on Jan.
19.
</P>
<P>
   He opened Thursday's session as presiding officer, again
probably for the final time. He left the chamber soon after making
his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the speech as he headed to an intelligence briefing,
Gingrich said: ``It was an easy speech. It was from the heart.''

BRITONS DIVIDED ON WISDOM OF ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While Britain is America's staunchest ally in bombing
Iraq, Britons themselves are divided on the wisdom and morality of
using force to punish Saddam Hussein for thumbing his nose at UN
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   British people are overwhelmingly opposed to Hussein, viewing
the Iraqi leader as a brutal tyrant, and most wish that he would be
toppled, if not killed. But they are torn over the US-British
attacks because many Britons see innocent civilians, not Hussein,
bearing the brunt of the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could convince me they would take Saddam out, I'd be
all for it. But the reality is that ordinary Iraqis, including
children, are going to die, not Saddam,'' said Brian Jones, 23, a
social worker, standing in Piccadilly Circus and voicing
reservations that are common here.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is the most popular prime minister in recent memory,
with the biggest parliamentary majority in nearly two centuries.
But his unflagging support of the Clinton administration and
decision to join in the bombing of Iraq has revealed fissures in
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cenotaph, the London monument to Britain's war dead,
someone sprayed graffiti that captured the opposition to the
bombings by some Britons: ``Tony not in my name.'' Early Thursday,
a group of Islamic protesters gathered outside the Downing Street
gates that lead to the prime minister's residence, shouting, ``Kill
Tony Blair!''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday in the House of Commons, Blair defended the
US-British attacks, and said they were trying to minimize civilian
casualties. Blair rejected suggestions that the timing was aimed at
diverting attention from President Clinton's domestic problems. In
a country where Muslims make up a sizable minority, he further
stressed that the timing of the attacks took into account Muslim
sensitivities ahead of the weekend start of the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Hussein was ``blind to reason,'' and that ``reason,
not vengeance, motivated us.'' He acknowledged there will be
civilian casualties but said the bombings were aimed at preventing
more deaths by depriving Hussein of the means to build weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat from Saddam is not theoretical, it's real,'' Blair
told a packed House of Commons, where the hush was broken only by
occasional bursts of ``hear, hear'' as parliamentarians voiced
support.
</P>
<P>
   Blair solemnly informed Parliament that, ``As I speak, British
Tornado aircraft are engaged in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Rare bipartisan support greeted Blair's decision to commit
British air power. The opposition leader, Conservative Party chief
William Hague, who rarely misses an opportunity to attack Blair,
was effusive in his support.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Blair's Labor Party were more skeptical, if not
outright cynical about the wisdom and timing of the attacks. Labor
backbencher George Galloway opposed the bombing and said Britain
and the United States were alone among the five permanent members
of the UN Security Council in supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Benn, dean of the Labor Party's left wing, said Clinton was
deliberately using the attacks to try to save himself from
impeachment, and that Blair was Clinton's lapdog. Speaking on the
BBC as the attacks began, Benn lamented that people were ``being
killed for the entertainment of viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's press mirrors the differences among its people. The
Daily Telegraph, which is the voice of the conservative
establishment, voiced unqualified support for the attacks in an
editorial entitled, ``Now see it through.'' The Guardian, Britain's
biggest liberal newspaper, captured the ambivalence of many people
in an editorial which said, ``The Americans and the British show a
readiness to deal with Saddam militarily, but this masks doubts
about where such action might lead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the BBC, telephone calls were running about even between
those who think London and Washington had no alternative but to
bomb and those who think the attacks will only kill innocents and
leave Hussein more entrenched and more popular with his frightened,
angry subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Several people interviewed in central London voiced fears that
the bombing runs will trigger retaliatory terrorist attacks. Still,
many Londoners take comfort from the fact that London has a large
Arab population, believing that will deter an indiscriminate
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the threat of terrorism is never far below the surface of
this great city, which defiantly endured the Blitz during World War
II and a sporadic Irish Republican Army bombing campaign over the
last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the 15th anniversary of an IRA car bomb that
exploded outside Harrod's, London's most famous department store,
killing five Christmas shoppers. Monday marks the 10th anniversary
of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
what authorities say was retaliation for US attacks on Libya that
were supported by Britain.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ At the crowning moment in Thursday's
balloons-and-marching-band ceremony to roll out the first Buick
made in China, John F. Smith Jr., chairman of General Motors Corp.,
got behind the wheel of a shiny white 1999 sedan, strapped on his
seat belt, and was unable to make the car move.
</P>
<P>
   Smith reached down to release the emergency brake, but could not
find it. Instead, he popped the hood open. Only after engineers
rushed frantically to Smith's side was he reminded that the Buick's
brake release was a foot pedal. Finally on his way, he drove the
Buick up a red carpet onto a broad stage, to cheers from a crowd of
more than 2,000 staff members and guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't use that brake in America,'' Smith said later,
chuckling at himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small fumble on a day that signified a start for
General Motors' grand plans to break into the car market here. But
it hinted at the steep challenges facing the company in China,
where oversupply and a heavily politicized bureaucracy have to be
mixed with the ample difficulty in weaving a merger of two vastly
different car cultures.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is making a big bet on China, sinking $2 billion
into 16 ventures here, mostly for auto components. The Shanghai
General Motors plant is the biggest of them all, with 1,700
employees and plans to build 100,000 Buick sedans a year. The
automaker's $750 million investment in the factory represents the
single biggest American investment in China.
</P>
<P>
   The main question is who will buy the cars. Priced at roughly
$40,000 each, the large-engine Buick is not obviously well suited
to a poor country with crowded city streets and bumpy country
roads. Demand is falling, and the best-selling car in China so far
is an unadorned Volkswagen that costs about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next question is whether an experienced car manufacturer
like GM will have the control it needs to make operations work in
areas more complex than the simple use of an emergency brake.
</P>
<P>
   China's clunky bureaucracy still wields tremendous influence
over the car industry. Although being in a 50-50 joint venture
theoretically means that decisions are shared with its Chinese
partner, Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corp., having the plant in
China inevitably favors the local partner.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the ceremony was held Thursday is an example.
Shanghai General Motors will not actually begin regular production
of the car until next April, but the Chinese partner insisted on
rolling out the first Buick before the end of 1998, in order to
keep to its original state-mandated schedule, so out it came.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and other GM executives insist that they are happy with
the arrangement and enjoy strong support from China's government.
They also maintain that they will find a market for an expensive
American sedan among the Chinese elite, who have in the past relied
largely on imports of 100,000 vehicles a year from Japan and
Germany, most of them smuggled to avoid sky-high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we'll meet our sales targets,'' Smith
said in an interview. He also predicted that the Shanghai operation
would start turning a modest profit once it passed a break-even
mark of 40,000 to 50,000 cars, perhaps in the third or fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Many auto-industry analysts argue that General Motors is making
the Buick here, and cooperating with China's demands that it bring
up-to-date auto technology for a luxury car, because it was the
only way to get into China's car-assembly market. Demand may
balloon one day in the distant future, but right now the China
market does not show a hunger for a high volume of high-end cars
like Buicks.
</P>
<P>
   Smith contended that General Motors is fully committed to making
the Buick project a success, but conceded that timing was a factor.
``I think it is extremely important to be in early,'' he said.
``This is going to be a huge market.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility built into the new plant, Smith also said, means
that it may be able to shift to making other vehicles in the
future. But he denied reports that there are already plans to make
a smaller car, like the Opel, if the Buick falters.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Maoyuan, president of Shanghai General Motors, put it another
way when asked whether a smaller car would emerge from the Shanghai
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting market demand is our aim,'' Hu said. ``Wherever we are
able to meet consumer demands, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai is not General Motors' first stop in China. In the
early 1990s, bureaucrats in Beijing steered the company into a
light-truck venture with a Chinese partner in the northeastern city
of Shenyang. The trucks did not sell well and the venture was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded that passenger cars represented the future in China,
where a fast-growing economy seemed to point toward budding
consumer demand, General Motors bid aggressively for a partnership
with Shanghai Automotive, which is generally seen as the best in a
bunch of old-fashioned, state-owned automakers.
</P>
<P>
   However, after it was selected as a partner in 1995, beating out
Ford Motor Co. and Toyota, GM had to endure two years of
feasibility studies and other bureaucratic hurdles before it could
sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the sheen on China's car-market projections
began to fade. Other foreign car ventures went south: Peugeot
abandoned its plant in Guangzhou; Chrysler cut its production of a
Beijing Jeep Cherokee by nearly two-thirds, to 8,972 this year from
25,127 in 1995, and Citroen struggled at its plant in Wuhan,
sinking to a low of 3,797 cars in 1995 before rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   The only foreign car venture that has thrived is Shanghai
Volkswagen. Although the company will not discuss its profits, or
the trouble it has in getting them back to Germany, Shanghai
Volkswagen's Santana has won nearly 50 percent of China's
passenger-car market, making 235,295 sedans in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors executives say that much of Volkswagen's success
has to do with its partner, Shanghai Automotive, which is now a GM
partner, as well. As to whether Shanghai Automotive can
simultaneously share partnerships with VW and General Motors
without dividing its loyalty, Smith said he was not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he praised the can-do spirit and bottom-line
orientation at Shanghai Automotive. The new plant in the Pudong
section of Shanghai, he noted, was built in just 18 months, and is
as modern as any in the world. Other car experts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plant is spectacular,'' said Michael Dunne,
president of Automotive Resources Asia, a consultant on the Asian
auto market. ``They put a lot of money into it; they did not cut
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' plans to produce nearly 20,000 cars in 1999,
Dunne said, will make it the most productive start-up car operation
ever in China. At the outset, only 40 percent of each Buick will be
made with Chinese parts, but that is projected to rise to 80
percent in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   If making Buicks is not an insurmountable challenge, selling
them here may be. A big chunk of Shanghai General Motors' intended
market is bureaucrats in China's government and in its large
state-owned industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last year Beijing issued a directive barring officials below
the rank of minister from buying cars with engines exceeding 2.5
liters in cylinder volume. The Buick uses a 2.98-liter engine, and
GM executives say they are hoping that government support will mean
an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Worse perhaps for the American producer, China is mulling over
plans to reduce vast state spending on cars, in favor of
compensating officials with a monthly subsidy in place of the
existing practice of simply buying cars for officials. Large or
small, a subsidy would not likely be spent on luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be difficulties along the road,'' Smith
said. ``But we want to be here.''

   BOMBING WILL HELP BUT NOT END PROBLEMS WITH SADDAM
   With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.

   With US-IRAQ-1218.
   By BOB DART

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Thursday that air
strikes had reduced the ability of Iraq to attack its neighbors but
conceded that bombings probably could not accomplish the greater
goals of removing Saddam Hussein from power and eliminating his
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is,'' vowed Defense Secretary William Cohen,
``we're going to continue to contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while bombing can contain Saddam, such attacks also
complicate longer range strategies, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the air strikes could end any hopes of diplomatic
disarmament where Saddam would comply with inspections by the
United Nations Special Commission or UNSCOM. And the bombing could
actually strengthen his domestic standing as the beleaguered Iraqi
populace unites against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it is doubtful that bombing would get rid of
Saddam Hussein or make him comply with UNSCOM. In fact, it could
end UNSCOM's role,'' said Simona Sharoni, a professor of peace and
conflict resolution at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UNSCOM process is dead,'' agreed Scott Ridder, a former UN
arms inspector in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Several days of bombing is ``a campaign with no end games,''
Ridder said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``We've tried to crack this
wall of protection Saddam has built around himself for years now
and failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Thursday morning attacks, the warships in the Persian
Gulf fired more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Navy EA-6B
attack planes struck Iraqi air defense radars, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier U.S.S. Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of
southern Iraq. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In a Pentagon briefing Thursday, Cohen admitted that air strikes
can meet only limited objectives. But he said those objectives are
being achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to destabilize (Saddam's) regime,'' he said.
``The goal is to decrease and diminish his capacity to threaten his
neighbors and to either deliver weapons of mass destruction and,
hopefully, be able to hit some of the facilities that would put him
in a position to be making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said UN inspectors had reported that Saddam Hussein had
``effectively emasculated UNSCOM'' anyway and ``they were on the
ground but not able to do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the bombing pushes Saddam to oust the inspectors
completely, Iraq would be able to resume its programs to build
biological, chemical or even nuclear weapons. Those developments,
of course, would likely compel the United States to bomb again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my hope that -- following this operation -- that
Saddam Hussein would see the wisdom of finally complying by
allowing UNSCOM to return and do its job,'' said Cohen. ``Failing
that, we intend to maintain our forces'' and ``to continue the
containment strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And should he either threaten his neighbors or try to
reconstitute his weapons-of-mass-destruction program, we are
prepared to take action again,'' Cohen warned.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bombing is also unlikely to either kill Saddam -- who is
relatively safe in underground bunkers -- or to inspire an
insurrection against him. Some analysts said that the Iraqi
dictator may even be empowered by Americans bombing during Ramadan,
the Islamic holy month that begins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Iraqis welcome bombing at this point,'' said
William Arkin, an MSNBC military analyst. He explained that the
attacks not only enhance Saddam's hold on power, but also drive a
wedge between the United States and Britain, who are conducting the
mission, and other U.N. countries who don't support it.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate briefing, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the bombing is only a limited solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term goal at the moment through this military
campaign is to degrade his ability to develop and deploy his
weapons of mass destruction,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than air strikes to meet the longer range
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A medium-term goal is in fact to have him comply with the
Security Council resolutions,'' Albright added. ``Longer term, we
have come to the determination that the Iraqi people would benefit
if they had a government that really represented them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we know that this is something that cannot be done
overnight, and we are working with the various opposition groups on
a longer range way of trying to help them help themselves to have a
regime that represents them,'' She said.
</P>
<P>
   And that would take more than even smart bombs.

   AMIDST FALLING MISSILES, MOST IRAQIS SAY 'LIFE GOES ON'
   With US-IRAQ-1218.
   By LARRY KAPLOW 
   c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ When the first blast thudded against the windows of
kabob restaurant at about 10 p.m. (Iraq time) Thursday, a young
bow-tied waiter ran to open the front door, just what Iraqis
recommend to protect a building against shockwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Diners at the Al Meelad (means ``The Birthday'') walked out to
view a fireworks show of anti-aircraft fire and a plume of smoke
from a nearby high-rise. But they soon returned to their meals, and
the waiter hurried back to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, U.S. missiles and Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries periodically lit up the sky above this
battered capital. But Iraqis, in a mixture of defiance and
helplessness, kept to their routines. They took walks with their
families and celebrated weddings.
</P>
<P>
   During the first visible exchange of fire Thursday, a fry cook
came out from behind his counter to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become very normal to us,'' said Ali Al Dhahab, a
26-year-old who stood on the sidewalk in his yellow paper hat and
fry-cook uniform. ``We wish it would end soon. Sometimes we feel
afraid for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he would work several more hours anyway. ``Whether I go
home or stay here, it's the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 a.m. here, the firing was still sporadic, though air-raid
sirens sounded off frequently. This would be another sleepless
night for the six million residents of Baghdad, but it was unclear
if the barrage would be as bad as the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic moment had been a strike on what were said to
be offices of Iraq's military industries. A direct hit sent a ball
of flame shooting from the top of the downtown building. Somehow,
the electricity stayed on, but the blast blew out several
ground-floor windows of the Al Rashid Hotel a few hundred yards
away, home to most of the foreign journalists in town.
</P>
<P>
   The quick air strikes were followed by excruciatingly long
periods of quiet. And the evening was filled with incongruous
images of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The city is flat and dotted with palm trees, somewhat
reminiscent of coastal South Florida but with scores of billboards
and murals glorifying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. It could be a
pretty city, but eight years of crippling economic sanctions have
left its buildings and cars rundown. And anti-aircraft guns can
occasionally be seen on rooftops or trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night there were fewer cars than usual on the wide
avenues, where diners ate seafood at restaurants along the banks of
the Tigress River, or bellied up to counters for ice cream, the
favorite Iraqi treat.
</P>
<P>
   People carried on with an almost eerie disinterest to the
explosive events around them. When asked to explain, they cited the
bloody eight-year war against Iran and the 45-day assault in the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iraqis have faced U.S. air strikes in September 1996
and twice in 1993. They have also endured several threatening U.S.
military build-ups aimed at containing the weapons-making ability
of renegade leader Saddam Hussein. Iraqis tell their stories with a
mix of resignation and defiance -- a sort of
you-can't-scare-me-anymore tone.
</P>
<P>
   Even as more air strikes were expected, people stopped to gaze
at a 4-foot-deep, 10-yard-wide crater in a road in a busy shopping
district, the result of a missile that landed the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The blast cut a major water line, disrupting service to more
than 2 million residents, according to Faris Alasam,
director-general of the city water department.
</P>
<P>
   An earth mover worked in the dark to fill the hole while about
50 people looked on from the muddied street. Iraqi Health Minister
Omed Medhat Mubarak said as amany as 30 people were killed, and 75
injured from the two rounds of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Postal worker Abdul Kareem said his six-year-old daughter, Asra,
woke up when the missile landed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked, 'Why does the United States attack us,' `` said the
40-year-old father, ``I told her that they hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hate was the subject on this street corner, it was
love that was in the air in the posh Mansour Hotel, where couples
arrived in suits and bridal gowns for wedding celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   One couple, in particular, said their separate men's and women's
parties Wednesday night, traditional in Muslim weddings, were
played out to the noise of missile explosions. But, they were not
about to reschedule their nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy tonight, and we hope that all the Iraqi youth
will marry and challenge the United States,'' said 29-year-old
groom Ahyee Khazal.

   No mass deployment to Persian Gulf underway
   By Jack Warner
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Specialized units from Georgia bases, including the
Air Force's only all-weather airborne ground target tracker, are
being ordered to the Persian Gulf, but so far there has been no
mass deployment of troops.
</P>
<P>
   The only deployments ordered as a result of the new attacks on
Iraq involve Air Force personnel from Robins Air Force Base in
Middle Georgia and Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, and military
intelligence personnel from Fort Gordon near Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Stewart at Hinesville, which supplied key troops for Desert
Storm, is deploying 1,500 soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division
this week, but their departure for Kuwait was a rotation placed on
the calendar a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Public Affairs Sgt. David Schad said the departing troops were
originally intended to replace 1,500 3rd Division personnel due to
return home. Schad said there had been no word on whether those
troops would return as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant deployment from Georgia involved
150 members of the 93rd Air Control Wing from Robins. They will be
taking big E8-C jets from which they operate the JSTARS, or Joint
Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, which can locate and track
enemy ground units under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Banks, a civilian public affairs official at Robins, said
the 19th Air Refueling Group got its orders for Southwest Asia _
where the military locates the Persian Gulf _ on Wednesday. There
are already 165 personnel from Robins in the area, she said, 140
from the 5th Combat Communications Group and 15 from the 78th
Security Forces Squadron.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to carry on with what's going on here, even though
your thoughts and prayers are with those folks over there,'' said
Staff Sgt. Bob Pullen at Robins. ``This is a tough time of year for
people to deal with something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 347th Fighter Wing based at Moody is deploying a combat
search-and-rescue unit consisting of three HH-60G helicopters,
three HC-130 aircraft and about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Air Force troops specially deployed from Georgia so
far are 20 members of the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade at
Fort Gordon near Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence unit left Wednesday. The 3rd Division
deployment will go on for about a week, Chad said, and other
departures will take place over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   No troops had been alerted yet at Fort Benning, Georgia's other
large infantry installation.

GORE TAKES PROMINENT ROLE IN DEFENDING U.S. POSITION AND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With bombs falling on Iraq and an impeachment vote
nearing in the House, Vice President Al Gore has taken an unusually
visible role in defending President Clinton and the military
actions that have spurred deep skepticism from many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Clinton's 15-minute address to the American public on
Wednesday night, Gore appeared on five television networks.
Thursday night, aides said, he was preparing to appear on several
regional networks as well as British television.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as one of Clinton's senior advisors on matters of
national security, the vice president has spent a considerable part
of the last few days, informing other senior administration
officials, as well as lawmakers, former Presidents Carter, Ford and
Bush and foreign leaders of the United States' plans to attack.
</P>
<P>
   As one example, Gore was directed by the president to convey the
U.S. position to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. Aides
to Gore said their 20-minute conversation Thursday was the highest
level of contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Clinton as ``determined and focused on winning this
confrontation with Iraq,'' the vice president said in an interview
Thursday in his office in the west wing of the White House that he
continues to be amazed that some political leaders would suggest
the administration planned the attack to delay actions against the
president in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the secretary of defense and the chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff, Gore said: ``Anybody who thinks for one
minute that Bill Cohen, a former member of the Senate Republican
caucus, or Hugh Shelton, a four-star general out of the Green Beret
special forces branch of the Army would sit in these meetings and
be a party to some politically motivated plan is just crazy. No
serious person can really look at the facts and come to that
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the week, when all hands in Washington expected
the House to spend Thursday voting on articles of impeachment
against the president, Gore was scheduled spend the day in New
Hampshire, appearing on behalf of the administration and his own
presidential aspirations for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore scuttled the trip on Tuesday when he said it became
apparent that plans for military action against Iraq were adding to
the building gravity of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious to me that Thursday was going to be a day when
I was needed here at the White House to help the president, first
of all, to try to help persuade the Congress to take a bipartisan
approach to the impeachment controversy,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But also, although I did not discuss this with my
advisors, I knew from national security meetings there would be
other matters to help the president with this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he continued to hope the House would reach a
``bipartisan compromise solution to forestall an impeachment. But
he declined to predict how an impeachment vote might carry in the
House nor how the president might fare in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to engage in a hypothetical discussion that
assumes the House will make the mistake of voting for an
impeachment resolution,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spent Thursday in conversation
with security advisers, congressmen and foreign leaders about the
progress of the assault on Iraq, as an air of unreality settled
over the White House about the mix of power politics,
constitutional duties and military might playing out here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also held a lengthy meeting Thursday evening with his
top economic advisers to discuss his proposed budget for next year,
before attending a gala at the White House in honor of the Special
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The White House remained officially neutral over the
announcement Thursday that the House would proceed Friday with an
impeachment debate, while the military operation is under way.
``That is clearly an issue for Congress to decide,'' said Joseph
Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the air strikes, Clinton's four-day trip to the
Middle East, and his efforts to fend off impeachment, Lockhart
said, ``It would be an understatement to say that the president has
been tested over the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, advisers to Clinton
expressed amazement over the prospective impeachment vote and
Republican criticism of the attack as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years from now, we're going to look back at this, and
people are going to be astonished,'' said one aide. ``It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday how he would fight a ``Republican drive'' to push
him from office, Clinton said only, ``Well, the Constitution has a
procedure for that and we will follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that if the
House impeaches Clinton, the Senate will hold a trial rather than
quickly settle on a punishment with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet Friday morning to discuss the impeachment
vote with Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also placed calls to at least two House Democrats on
Thursday who appeared to be wavering in their opposition to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke briefly with reporters before receiving an
update on the military operation from his national security team.
He began the day with a 7 a.m. briefing in the White House
residence from Sandy Berger, his national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a round of calls to foreign leaders, including
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France; President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel; and King
Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president made the case that it was Saddam Hussein
that precipitated this action,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried without success to reach Russian President
Boris Yeltsin. Vice President Al Gore spoke to Yevgeny Primakov,
the Russian prime minister. Primakov asked that the operation be
suspended, but Gore repeated the United States' position that the
attack would continue until it achieved its objectives,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called House and Senate leaders, including Lott, a
critic of the attack, to update them on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Although White House aides resumed contacting congressmen about
impeachment Thursday, they now regard a vote against the president
as all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   One made a joke that reflected Clinton aides' gallows humor and
their criticism of the tactics of conservative Republicans.``How
can you tell a moderate Republican in Congress?'' he asked.
``Broken kneecaps.''

RENO ANNOUNCES STING OPERATION TO CATCH TELEPHONE SCAM ARTISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno warned telephone scam
artists Thursday that the person they are trying to bilk just might
be an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Justice Department is 2 1/2 years into Operation
Double Barrel, a massive federal and state sting operation to catch
telemarketers who fraudulently promise people prizes or other
special items in return for a fee. The victims, mostly elderly, pay
by credit card, but the prizes never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   To stop this illegal activity, the FBI and 35 state attorneys
general have used police and elderly volunteers recruited by the
American Association of Retired Persons to field phone calls from
unsuspecting, dishonest telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people have been charged with violating federal or
state fraud laws and 150 have been convicted since Reno announced
the operation about 30 months ago, the Justice Department reported.
Those found guilty have been sentenced to up to 14 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time (dishonest) telemarketers pick up a phone they are
taking a risk,'' Reno said. The FBI will keep trying to ``con the
con artist'' in its effort to stop illegal telemarketing, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Double Barrel is the latest and broadest of three
Justice Department efforts since 1990 to catch illegal
telemarketers. The current effort relies most heavily on state and
private-sector involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have been victimized by this crime,'' said
Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, who joined Reno in
announcing the operation. ``We're going to be very aggressive in
prosecuting these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The first federal effort to catch illegal telemarketers was
Operation Disconnect during George Bush's presidency. The
three-year FBI operation resulted in the conviction of 402 people
and the recovery of $7 million in ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Operation Senior Sentinel, the FBI first used private
citizens in its effort to uncover telemarketing fraud. AARP helped
the FBI recruit the volunteers, and the operation led to the
conviction of 598 people between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate telemarketing industry employs more than 3.4
million people and enjoys revenues of more than $500 billion
annually. Meanwhile, telephone scams cost the public $40 billion
per year, the Justice Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, consumers must be cautious when they receive
unsolicited calls from people making enticing, seemingly
inexpensive offers. ``If it sounds too good to be true, it probably
is,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Dishonest telemarketers usually target the elderly and use
brazen tactics to trap their victims, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   In one scam, telemarketers call people who have already been
victimized and, posing as law enforcement agents, offer to recover
the lost money in return for an up-front payment, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who calls you, tells you they're from the FBI and asks
you to pay a fee so they can get your money back is lying,'' Reno
said. ``No federal law enforcement agency will ever charge fraud
victims a dime when they try to get money back.''

   Parishoners find `Peace on Earth' elusive during crisis,
Christmastime
   By Gayle White
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During a cosmic convergence of religious celebrations,
Atlanta clergy and their congregations are attempting to sort out
the meaning of the U.S. bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as Jews celebrate Hanukkah, Muslims prepare for Ramadan
and Christians are in the midst of pre-Christmas activities, the
bombing ``does not speak of peace on Earth, good will to men'' said
the Rev. Gerald Harris, pastor of Eastside Baptist Church in
Marietta and president of the Georgia Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we have a responsibility to protect national
security, and I believe we have responsibility to other nations of
the world to protect them from weapons capable of mass
destruction,'' he said. ``But I must say the timing of this if not
ill advised is suspicious at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he applauds the heroism and response to the call to
service of the military people who are involved in the exercise. As
for President Clinton, ``Even though he is in a personal crisis, I
feel like we're partly to blame because of our failure to pray for
him,'' Harris said. ``Prayerlessness is a sin as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Lebow of Temple Kol Emeth in suburban Atlanta says
he'll probably mention what's happening in the Mideast during
sabbath services on Saturday
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of servicemen in our congregation and our
number one need right now is to support our servicemen,'' he said,
adding that Iraq has been an ``aggressor'' and he certainly ``would
have to support containing Iraq . . . and the danger they pose in
that part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he adds, this is all coming at an inopportune time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this is happening during a time of year when
all of us are thinking of 'peace on Earth' and how precious peace
is,'' he says. ``But peace doesn't come unless you're willing to
stand up to bullies, which is what Iraq is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Agnes Norfleet, pastor of North Decatur Presbyterian
Church, said as a Christian she also finds it ironic that ``when
we're awaiting the Prince of Peace, we've gone to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Her church will have a presentation of Handel's ``Messiah'' on
Sunday, but Norfleet said she will deal with the crisis in Iraq
during prayers.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, she plans to incorporate a personal story
about rounding a corner in Wiesbaden, Germany, at Christmastime
while studying abroad. Suddenly, she heard familiar Christmas
carols coming from an American military brass band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was away from my family, that made me feel at
home,'' she said. ``We will remember our troops especially this
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she is also thinking about ``those Iraqi children
Saddam has used as pawns in his reign of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal Bishop Frank K. Allan said he always has concerns when
the United States resorts to military action. ``The question I have
is what follows the bombing?'' he said, ``Do we bomb them and then
everything's back to normal? What does it accomplish? How many
civilian lives are lost and children killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Allan said the U.S. has a ``legal right'' to bomb Iraq, but he
has concerns about the moral justification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be one who does not believe in the idea of
redemptive violence,'' he said. ``We say we do evil that good might
come, and in fact the good doesn't come. Rarely do you see good
coming out of the use of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tim McDonald, president of Atlanta's Concerned Black
Clergy, said the Iraq bombing has put a damper on the holiday
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're striving to enter the Yuletide season and would not want
to be in this tense period in history,'' McDonald said. ``However,
based on what we have heard from those who were charged with the
investigation over there, it seems like we did not have any
options.''

FEDERAL RESERVE EXPECTED TO STAY `ON HOLD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political crisis is unfolding at home and a
military action is under way abroad. But when the Federal Reserve
meets to consider interest rate policy on Tuesday, it will face an
economic outlook that, while complex and a bit confusing, is more
stable than it has been for months.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that had threatened to paralyze the bond market earlier
this fall has ebbed, though it has not disappeared. The stock
market is robust again, bolstering spending by consumers, who are
also benefiting from the strongest growth in real income in years.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and farmers continue to be hit hard by the global
financial crisis, but even they got good news Wednesday when the
Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit in October was
$14.2 billion, much lower than expected, and that exports grew 2.8
percent. Asia is showing signs of stabilizing, and Brazil has
managed to avoid a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a recession in the United States in 1999 has evaporated.
And not only do analysts expect that the Fed will leave rates
unchanged on Tuesday after cutting rates three times in the last
three months, but chances are increasing that the central bank will
remain on hold for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has proven stronger than they thought when they
were easing, and the prospects for slowing ahead are much
diminished, both on account of the consumer and the reopening of
the fixed income markets to new issues,'' said Rosanne Cahn, an
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into 1999, Ms. Cahn said, ``the Fed will be on hold
unless there is another financial market disturbance.''
</P>
<P>
   Following its last rate cut, on Nov. 17, the Fed's policy-making
Federal Open Market Committee signaled that it might hold off on
further reductions, saying that financial conditions ``can
reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained
economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and a number of other
Fed officials have remained concerned that financial market strains
could put the nation's long expansion at risk if not reversed. By
some measures, those strains have eased considerably; companies are
finding it easier to issue new debt, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But by others, the problems remain significant. In particular,
the spread between the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds and riskier
forms of debt remains abnormally high, suggesting continued risk
aversion on the part of investors and a lack of demand from hedge
funds, banks and securities firms that suffered big losses in the
spasms that gripped the markets in late summer and early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fed officials are closely studying the real economy as well
as financial conditions. They see an economy that is slowing
somewhat, tugged between the strength of consumer demand and weak
and still fragile conditions in the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a marked slowdown in growth appears greater to them
than the risk of a rapid acceleration in growth, they said. The
strength of consumer demand will be driven to a large degree by the
stock market. While another big surge on Wall Street is by no means
out of the question, they said, anything short of significant
increases in paper wealth is likely to bring some slowdown in the
growth of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   On the industrial side of the economy, much will depend on the
recovery of export markets. Wednesday's trade figures were a
hopeful sign, showing a rebound in exports of food, semiconductors
and computer accessories and manufactured goods. Most big export
markets, though, seem more likely to be flat or weaker in 1999 than
to be stronger, Fed officials and analysts said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan has shown few signs of pulling out of its economic swoon.
South Korea has shown some signs of recovery but remains fragile,
as do most other Asian nations and Latin America. Europe appears to
be facing a slowdown, a forecast that helped push most of the
continent's central banks to cut interest rates earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's trade report ``does not necessarily indicate a
turning of the tide'' for American exporters, said Howard Lewis
III, vice president for economic policy at the National Association
of Manufacturers, which is pressing for further rate cuts by the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looser monetary policy will help provide liquidity to
cash-strapped nations in the Far East,'' Lewis said. ``This will
increase the demand for U.S. exports as the Asian economies get
back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been concerned in recent months that growth next
year would dip to below 2.25 percent or 2.5 percent, which many
economists consider the level at which the economy can grow over
the long run without igniting inflation. But some Fed officials
have been raising their growth estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Growth over the first three quarters this year has averaged 3.7
percent, and data in recent weeks suggest this quarter will be
equally strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for the fourth quarter of this year and for next
year has strengthened considerably over the past six to eight
weeks,'' Jack Beebe, the director of research at the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a report last week. He
raised his forecast for growth in 1999 to 2.75 percent from 1.5
percent, though he warned that the outlook is subject to ``enormous
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing and perhaps even outweighing the concern about growth
slowing too rapidly is concern among one camp within the Fed that
inflationary pressures will continue to build. That camp sees the
prospect of a period of below-trend growth as healthy, suggesting
at a minimum that they will be unwilling to support further easing
as long as unemployment remains low and the stock market remains
buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Although inflation is dormant by most measures, it is not dead,
economists said. Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency
Economics, a consulting firm, said the core Producer Price Index
has risen at an annual pace of 2.2 percent over the last three
months, its fastest rate of increase since January 1996.

LOTT SAYS SENATE MUST HOLD TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate majority leader Trent Lott dismissed
suggestions Thursday that a deal on censure could be reached to
prevent an impeachment trial, saying the Constitution requires that
a trial must begin if the House approves articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an effort to stop a Senate impeachment trial by
obtaining promises of acquittal from 34 Democrats has been dropped
because Senate rules require every senator to sit as a juror with
an open mind, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, may go ahead with plans to introduce a
motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment after the trial
begins. It would take 51 votes to dismiss the articles, meaning
that six Republicans would have to join the 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, in an interview on CNN, ruled out any possibility that a
deal might be made for a censure resolution before a trial begins.
That appeared to end discussion of a deal proposed by Lott's
predecessor, former Senate majority leader Bob Dole, that the House
and Senate pass a joint resolution censuring Clinton before Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go to a trial and there won't be any deal-making,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's comment came after Democrats put aside a separate idea
that they had hoped would lead to the cancellation of the Senate
trial. Some Democrats had suggested they could obtain signatures of
34 members who promised to acquit the president, which they hoped
would lead to the abandonment of a trial. It would take 34 votes
out of 100 to acquit the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea fizzled when senators realized they are required
under the rules of an impeachment trial to sit as a juror with an
open mind _ something that would be impossible if they had said
beforehand they planned to vote to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter idea was floated, but it is dead,'' said Senator
John F. Kerry. ``I have got to reserve judgment until I review what
they have sent to the Senate,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kerry said he or another senator might make a motion to
dismiss the case shortly after the trial begins. But it is far from
clear whether Lott would agree to such a motion.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, suggested that
Democrats still have options to avoid or adjourn a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate, by unanimous consent, we can do almost
anything,'' Dodd said, referring to a motion that requires approval
of all senators. ``I would anticipate that consideration would be
given to alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats came up with the idea of obtaining a letter promising
acquittal signed by 34 senators after studying the history of
Louisiana Governor Huey P. Long. Long was impeached in 1929 and
avoided conviction by obtaining the necessary promises of acquittal
from his backers in the state Senate.

MARCHERS BRING `VOTE NO' MESSAGE TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Above the sea of signs reading ``Just Vote No,''
``Impeach Congress,'' and ``Judge Not,'' one stood out for its
attempt at levity in a capital roiled by bitter accusations and
dire predictions amid a bombing campaign and a vote to impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr,'' it read, ``Your Mother Had Sex Too ... (Big
Mistake).''
</P>
<P>
   Holding up the sign was Maryland resident Jon Inskeep, one
several thousand East Coast residents who traveled here to voice
support for President Clinton Thursday on the back steps of the
Capitol Building under a dark sky threatening a cold morning rain.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
coalition and promoted by the internet site, moveon.org, was
addressed by members of Congress, labor, feminist and religious
leaders angrily condemning a Republican Congress they said was bent
on damaging their man, overturning their votes, and subverting
their will.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs rained down on Iraq and House members fought over
the wording of a resolution supporting American troops, the
speakers asked members of Congress to exercise compassion in
dealing with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the invocation prayer was Rabbi Donna Berman, chaplain
of Mt. Holyoke College, who said, to a crowd roaring ``Yes'' at the
end of each sentence, ``Law without mercy leads to cruelty and
injustice. To ignore the will of the people is to dismantle
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson in his prayer emphasized hope and healing at a time
when, he said, the lives of American men and women were on the
line, the presidency imperiled, and the votes and voices of average
people ignored:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's dark but the morning cometh,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Jackson said, has ``done wrong,'' and ``fallen short of
the glory of God.'' But, he added, a reprimand, not impeachment,
was a fit punishment that would not divide the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scab was developing over the wound and we thought it was
healing,'' said Jackson. ``Now Hyde and the Republican majority has
taken the scab off and there is blood everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Rev. Al Sharpton of New York also reflected the
sentiment expressed on a sign that read: ``Forgiveness can cross
party lines,'' and echoed Jackson's comments on punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take a sledge hammer to kill a cockroach,'' he
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   And although the majority of attendees were African American,
there were people of all races and ages present.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Carrie Chafin of Crofton, Md., said she
received permission from her teachers to miss school. She came, she
said, because, ``I like nothing less than hypocrites, which is what
Clinton's opponents are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the age spectrum were two New Yorkers in
their seventies dressed in black coats, black handbags, black
glasses and black hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incensed,'' said Florence Aron, who drove down with her
friend Martha Friedman, a psychotherapist. ``This is a farce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political coup d'etat,'' interrupted Friedman. ``I
don't know one single person who wants impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   There were strong racial overtones in many of the speeches,
highlighting the sense already expressed by some members of the
Black Congressional Caucus that Republicans don't hate Clinton,
they hate ``us,'' and ``they hate what he is doing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lowery, a 51-year-old African-American Republican who
grew up in the South, said the Judiciary Committee reminded her of
the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself lying awake at night feeling that hatred, the
kind that blacks felt in the old days from the KKK just because
they were black,'' said Lowery, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, was one of
only a few white members of Congress to address the crowd. It was,
he said in an interview before speaking, part of his continuing
effort to rouse the public in support of the president and the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, the Republicans came to Congress saying they wanted a
contract with America,'' he said. ``In 1999, they want a contract
to shut down the executive branch, the Supreme Court and the White
House.''

RAIDS OUTRAGE RUSSIA, BUT FEW CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ What if the world's second-most powerful nuclear nation
screamed and shook and threatened reprisals _ and nobody cared?
</P>
<P>
   Angered over air attacks against Iraq by the United States and
Britain, Russia's quarreling leaders responded Thursday with a
united condemnation of America of a kind not heard here since the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   From the Kremlin to breakaway Chechnya, Russian leaders
denounced the United States as a rogue superpower and demanded that
Washington halt the strikes or face unspecified ``serious
consequences.'' Thursday night Russia recalled its ambassador to
Washington in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But the fierce barrage of criticism could not overshadow two
larger realities that are hard for Moscow to accept. The attack
against Iraq served as a humiliating setback to Russia's efforts to
end the crisis by diplomatic means. The other is that cash-strapped
Russia is too weak to mount any viable response beyond rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of that in Moscow Thursday, and in a rare
departure from Russia's post-Soviet politics, it came in a united
front from all ends of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities constitute international terrorism,'' the
State Duma, the usually divisive lower house of Parliament,
declared in a resolution. The house voted 394-1 after it learned
that one of its members had been wounded in the bombing. It also
paused for a moment of silence to honor the Iraqi victims of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomahawk missiles are the best method for bringing Russian
politicians together,'' commented NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who in his past role as
foreign minister helped avert US-led military strikes against Iraq,
said it was ``outrageous'' that the current attacks circumvented
the United Nations Security Council. President Boris N. Yeltsin
said the strikes ``crudely violated'' the United Nations charter.
Television showed the two men in the Kremlin with military leaders,
poring over maps of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was especially angry that President Clinton, who in the
past has consulted with the Russian leader on such things, did not
notify Moscow that the strikes were under way. The Kremlin said
Yeltsin, who found out from French President Jacques Chirac, saw
``no need to call Clinton at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing possible tension with the Western military
alliance, Yeltsin recalled his defense minister from a planned
meeting with NATO leaders in Brussels. Yeltsin also made a point of
issuing a message to Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, saying they
and the 7,000 nuclear warheads at their disposal give the country
the status of a ``great nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has made it clear it does not see Russia's
military power as a deterrent to punishing Iraq for failing to
comply with United Nations resolutions on destroying its weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been trying to lift UN sanctions against Iraq, not
just because it wants to collect Baghdad's $7 billion Soviet-era
debt. To halt the crisis would have reasserted Moscow's role as a
major world player, which has become increasingly difficult after
the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Instead, Russian officials were
left to claim a moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has become the clear leader of all sensible forces in
the world which favor the rule of law,'' Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians observed that Moscow had to accept a lesser role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing Russia can do now is to try to act out a role
it cannot play,'' the influential Russian financier Boris
Berezovsky told the Interfax news agency. ``That would only
humiliate Russia more. We can be a great and powerful state only
when we learn to solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov agreed, saying that Russia's
hands were tied by its economic crisis, which has forced the
government to seek urgent loans from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a Russian delegation was on its way to London to
seek restructuring of billions of dollars in overdue loans to
private Western creditors that Moscow has no hope of paying back
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma heard calls to increase Russia's defense budget, but
that would wreck any chance of an IMF loan. Angry Communist leaders
vowed the Duma would never ratify the 1993 Start-2 treaty reducing
nuclear weapons in Russia and the United States. But that, too, is
probably more harmful to Russia. Yeltsin's own government has been
arguing that the treaty made financial sense for Russia, which
cannot cope with the cost of maintaining its Soviet-era arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most sinister and credible threat Thursday came from
Chechnya, the Muslim Caucasus republic where last week four
hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander, were found beheaded
after a failed raid to free them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right to launch a no-less-significant strike
against the interests of the USA and Great Britain in the Caucasus
region, in Russia, and in the Middle East,'' Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in a statement. ``Chechnya will start
preparations for a series of specific actions, directed against the
USA and Great Britain.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
propelled the nation down the superhighway toward impeachment, they
sped past a number of exits, places where history, tradition or a
different understanding of the Constitution offered a path to
another outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the discussion on what to do about President
Clinton's failings ran an argument _ joined perhaps with more
rhetorical flourish than candor and sometimes not joined at all _
over what standards to apply in deciding whether to impeach a
president. As the impeachment debate moves to the full House, that
argument resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Distilled from the weeks of hearings and the days of committee
debate that produced four articles of impeachment, here are some of
the pivotal legal and constitutional issues that confront House
members. Implicit in each issue is a kind of theoretical offramp
from the impeachment highway, beckoning to members who choose not
to follow the Republican leadership to its chosen destination.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before and during the committee vote, there was much discussion
of what the Constitution's framers meant when they provided for
removing the president, and other officials, from office ``on
impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, along with the scholars and lawyers they called to
the witness table, insisted that the president's behavior, which
many described as deplorable or worse, fell short of the
constitutional definition, while Republicans maintained that the
president's misdeeds fell comfortably within it.
</P>
<P>
   At this level of generality, the debate proved unenlightening
and essentially circular; no matter how high the Democrats set the
rhetorical bar _ ``The great weight of the historical and scholarly
evidence leads to the conclusion that in order to have committed an
impeachable offense the president must have acted to subvert our
system of government,'' as Charles Ruff, the White House counsel,
put it _ the Republicans responded that the president's behavior
met the test. No real exit ramp there. But under this general
heading were several more specifically formulated questions about
what qualified as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and their witnesses argued vigorously that no
president should be impeached for private wrongdoing, for ``the
sins of Clinton the man, not Clinton the president,'' as the
committee's junior member, Rep. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis., described
it.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic counsel,
argued that this impeachment process, stripped of Whitewater,
campaign finance and other aspects of the public's business, was
fundamentally only about sex. ``Bill Clinton's alleged crimes are
not those of an errant president, but that of an unfaithful
husband,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said: ``When I look at the
totality of this case, I am left with one undeniable conclusion:
The president betrayed his wife. He did not betray his country.''
</P>
<P>
   This was perhaps the first and most obvious offramp from the
road to impeachment. But the Republicans barely slowed down. They
did not dispute the premise so much as the facts: What might have
begun as private had become public, they said. ``The conduct
obstructed our judicial system and at that point became an issue,
not of personal concern, but of national consequence,'' Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury is not sex, obstruction is not sex, abuse of power is
not about sex,'' declared the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill. ``Lies about sex are one thing,'' he added. ``Lies
under oath by the nation's chief law enforcement officer are
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to make the case that even if they transcended
the realm of private misbehavior, the president's misdeeds did not
rise to the level of ``acts to undermine or subvert the
government,'' as Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, described her
understanding of impeachable offenses. But such assertions only led
the Republicans to invoke the concept of ``the rule of law,'' which
they said Clinton had placed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ONE STRIKE, YOU'RE OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans by and large took the position that a lie is a
lie is an impeachable offense, no explanation needed or permitted.
``To me, making a false statement under oath to a criminal grand
jury is an impeachable offense, period,'' said Rep. James
Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that context could make a difference, that not all
perjury was equivalent, represented another potential exit from the
impeachment highway that attracted only Democrats. Rep. Charles
Schumer of New York said that while he believed the president did
lie, ``he did so about a sexual relationship, not about matters of
government.'' And Wexler cautioned against one-size-fits-all
judgments. ``I believe in my heart that morality is a complex
equation,'' he said, ``that good people sometimes do bad things,
that moral people sometimes commit immoral acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this had once been Hyde's view. ``It just seems
to me too simplistic to condemn all lying,'' he said in 1987, when
President Reagan and members of his administration were on the
defensive in the Iran-Contra investigation.
</P>
<P>
   CRIMINAL LAW STANDARDS
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement that impeachment is a political
judgment that does not demand proof of criminal wrongdoing beyond a
reasonable doubt. But Democrats maintained that the evidence fell
short even of the lesser ``clear and convincing'' standard of proof
that the Judiciary Committee applied when it voted in 1974 to
impeach Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Democrat, Steven Rothman, asked: ``When you have
equally intelligent lawyers refuting one another on inferences and
conclusions from the same fact, what's this committee left with?''
In the absence of witnesses, he said, ``I believe the score is
zero-zero, and the accused is not convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that the first two articles of
impeachment, dealing with perjury, failed to specify the statements
deemed perjurious. Hutchinson replied that ``we're not going on
technical legal definition, technical criminal statutes.'' He said
it was sufficient for the articles to allege behavior ``in the
nature of perjury'' or ``in the nature of false statements.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE'S ROLE
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is but a partial role in the drama of impeachment,'' Hyde
said, on one level a simple statement of the obvious fact that only
the Senate has the power to convict and remove a president. But the
committee engaged in a spirited debate over whether members should
vote to impeach only if they were personally persuaded that
conviction and removal were ultimately the proper course.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tended to describe impeachment as a kind of warning
shot across the bow, one that did not imply commitment to an
eventual result. ``The House does not convict; it merely accuses,''
said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected that the Constitution gave the House a
judgment to make, an independent role the leadership's approach
threatened to trivialize. ``This is not sending to the Senate a
questionnaire,'' said Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, ``this is
a statement the president should be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this view, any member who travels the whole impeachment
road in the House and remains unpersuaded that the Senate should
convict is obliged to get off at the last exit.

<P>
   Dozens of Southerners interviewed in six states voiced nearly
unanimous support for the military strike on Iraq, even as many
parroted the Republican line that the timing of Clinton's order
seemed more than coincidental. And many showed a striking
willingness to take Clinton at his word, even as they acknowledged
that his word was not worth much these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to me,'' said Les Gardner, 52, the manager of a
personnel staffing agency in Greenville, S.C. But Gardner also said
he believed the White House's assertion that the president's
decision to order air strikes on Wednesday was unrelated to the
impeachment vote that had been scheduled for Thursday. ``Despite
his peccadilloes, he has got the good of the nation and the world
at heart,'' Gardner said. ``He saw this as what was best for the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Anderson, a hypnotherapist from Atlanta, said he
supported the attack, although he questioned whether it ultimately
would be decisive enough to force change in Iraq. He, too, gave
Clinton the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He undoubtedly was aware of the political advantages of timing
the bombing as he did,'' Anderson said. ``He could have waited a
day, allowing the impeachment vote to proceed before the attack
began. But did he decide to bomb Iraq cynically and only because he
wanted to disrupt the impeachment vote? No. He used the timing to
his advantage but such an operation takes much advance planning and
must have been in the works long before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some committed Republicans dismissed the timing of the
attack as a coincidence, despite strong statements to the contrary
from some of the party's leaders in Washington. ``It came at a bad
time, but I don't think impeachment had anything to do with it,''
said Bill Bowling, a truck driver in Little Rock, Ark., who said he
voted Republican in both of the last two presidential elections.
``They just collided, it seems like.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, of course, were less generous, and pointed out that
Clinton had long ago tapped his reserves of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of odd that you're about to have an
impeachment vote and all of a sudden he pulls this,'' said Jace
Plaisance, a 21-year-old student at the University of New Orleans.
``He also did it when the Starr report came out. Just because I'm a
Republican doesn't mean I hate Clinton, but I'm just not in favor
of what he's doing. It is wrong for a president to use powers
granted him by Congress to take the heat off of some presidential
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   John Trivette, a 44-year-old Christmas tree farmer from Deep
Gap, N.C., said he is a registered Democrat who voted for Clinton
in both 1992 and 1996. But he said he does not fully trust
Clinton's motives in Iraq. ``I think Iraq is a little bit of a
thing to take away from the mess he's in,'' Trivette said. ``I
think he's delaying it. He's a sly dog.''
</P>
<P>
   If a common thread ran through the interviews Thursday, it was a
sense of amazement at the surreality of this week's events. Some
simply seemed stunned by the speed and magnitude of developments,
saying that nothing in the country's postwar experience equipped
them to make sense of it all. Many shook their heads at Clinton's
capacity for stretching the boundaries of his already tumultuous
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think he can't amaze you anymore, he does it
again,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster based in
the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Given its close ties to the armed forces and its innate
patriotism, the South has long been quick to support military
action. Forty-two percent of the country's military and civilian
personnel are stationed in the 11 states of the Old Confederacy,
according to the Pentagon, and a number of large defense
contractors are located in the region as well.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the six Navy destroyers that fired the first Tomahawk
cruise missiles at Iraq on Wednesday were built at Ingalls
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., the hometown of Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader. Lott, who criticized the timing of the attack
not long after the bombs began flying, has worked assiduously to
procure contracts for the shipyard, the largest private employer in
his state.
</P>
<P>
   Several authorities on the South said Thursday that the bonds
between the South and the military have produced an almost
instinctive support that is transferable to the commander in chief
at times of combat. But the region is also deeply conservative, and
contains pockets of fervent support for the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the president benefited Thursday from the firmness of
American opinion that the target of the attack, President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, has proven himself to be even less trustworthy
than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam has been making these chemical warheads and he's been
warned several times to let the U.N. inspectors go and do their
jobs,'' said Clark Wagner, 29, of Greenville, S.C. ``Three strikes,
he's out, so to speak. Saddam drew the line. Hey, this is as good a
time as any.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell Guillory, director of the program on Southern politics,
media and public life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, said that Americans have been conditioned for nearly a decade
to view President Hussein as a serious threat. ``It's not only that
Clinton has defined him,'' he said. ``Bush defined him too. So I'm
not terribly surprised that there's this lack of cynicism.''

BUTLER GIVEN PROTECTION AMID FLURRY OF ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two days after Richard Butler gave the United
States a green light for military force in Iraq, the chief UN
weapons inspectors has himself come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia Thursday called for the Australian diplomat's
resignation. China called him ``dishonorable.'' UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan's closest aides say they believe that Butler
intentionally sought to provoke a confrontation with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The political threat to his future was matched by a more
physical danger. Concerned about a personal attack, the United
Nations placed Butler under protective guard with five bodyguards,
two marked police cars and a bulletproof vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to allegations that he was acting on behalf of the
United States, Butler defended a highly critical report of
Baghdad's efforts to block UN inspections of its chemical and
biological weapons program. He said the report, which President
Clinton cited as the justification for the air war, was based
strictly on the experiences of UN Special Commission arms
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It danced to no one's tune,'' Butler said. ``It was not
written to anyone's purposes, including as some of you have
suggested for the purposes of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday that Butler
had presented a distorted version of Iraq's cooperation with the
United Nations. Russia contends that Baghdad's overall record of
cooperation with the United Nations has been good _ more than 300
inspections with only five incidents. And he called for the
replacement of Butler and the re-establishment of the UN team not
dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China also made it clear that it would like to see Butler go.
</P>
<P>
   And other Security Council members privately suggested that a
future UNSCOM would be more effective without Butler at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand their concerns,'' he said. ``I would prefer they
understand better my concern, which is to enable us to . . . which
is to have Iraq cooperate to enable us to do our job.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would quit, Butler told a group of reporters
Thursday: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insisted that the problem is Saddam
Hussein's evasions not Butler's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting the messenger is not the way to go about this,'' said
US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. ``He is an outstanding
individual and he deserves the support of the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM officials say that they have been dealt a raw deal by the
Council. They say that Butler has been maligned for simply carrying
out the council's own mandate _ the destruction of Iraq's nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons. And they say that Iraq has
consistently sought to prevent them from carrying out their
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that we haven't made some mistakes in
presentation,'' said Charles Duelfer. ``But we have a divided
council, and when you have a boss with multiple personalities it
makes working for them very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's blunt public diplomacy has poisoned his relationship
with the cautious UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In recent weeks,
Annan has repeatedly cited Butler's lack of diplomacy, what he
calls ``megaphone diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   UN sources say the UN chief has been irritated by what he views
as Butler's provocative approach to the inspections and by his
refusal to consult with him and with other key council members on
significant issues, including his decision to withdraw the UN
inspectors hours before an American strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler's objective over the past several weeks appeared to be
not so much continuing inspections but collecting compelling
evidence of Iraqi noncompliance, which is what the Americans
wanted,'' the source said.

MARKETS SHRUG OFF AIRSTRIKES AND IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financial markets around the world shrugged off the
uncertainty posed by the U.S. military strikes on Iraq and the
looming impeachment vote in the House of Representatives, as
investors viewed both events as potentially serious but had little
doubt about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, markets reversed the course they set on
Wednesday as events unfolded. Stock prices rose in Asia, Europe and
the United States, crude oil slumped nearly 11 percent in New York
trading, to about $11 a barrel, the dollar fell and bond prices
slipped lower.
</P>
<P>
   By the time stocks started trading in the United States,
investors had more pressing things on their minds than bombs or
impeachment. Shares of Amazon.com opened down $25 _ a drop of
nearly 10 percent _ presenting Internet-mad stock traders with one
of their best buying opportunities in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and financial analysts said several factors accounted
for the relative calm on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in 1990, when Iraq suddenly invaded Kuwait, or even more
recently, when the United States had unleashed reprisals on Baghdad
or terrorist hideouts in Sudan, Wednesday's assault evoked little
real surprise. President Clinton had backed off a similar attack
weeks ago when it appeared that Iraq might cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   And while oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday in anticipation
of the bombing strike, their larger retreat on Thursday signaled
that the economy was probably in little danger of feeling the jolt
that was produced by a sharper and ultimately longer-lasting rise
in oil prices after Iraq's aggression in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the impeachment of President Clinton by the House of
Representatives is viewed by many on Wall Street as all but
certain, and only mild anxiety so far surrounds a possible Senate
trial next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, said Edward Collins, head of trading at Daiwa
Securities America, the financial markets have other events in
view, namely the release of fourth-quarter corporate earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably sacrilegious to say it, but I don't think
whoever is in the White House has as much to do with what goes on
in the business world or the market as the fact that right now the
Federal Reserve is being extremely friendly,'' Collins said. By
keeping interest rates low and the supply of money flowing, the
Federal Reserve Board has most investors feeling they have little
reason to worry about a quick downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Those generally positive views caused investors to push stock
prices higher across the board on Thursday. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 85.22 points, or nearly 1 percent, to
8,875.82, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 18.04
points, or 1.55 percent, to 1,179.98.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stock market's midsummer slump, both of those
benchmarks have lagged behind the Nasdaq composite index, which is
heavily laden with the technology stocks that have been the hottest
performers this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Nasdaq index jumped 34.52 points, or 1.7
percent, to 2,043.88, finishing the day more than 30 percent above
where it started the year. That is more than double the 12 percent
rise in the Dow industrials and well ahead of the 22 percent gain
in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, Treasury prices fell as reports on trade,
jobs and manufacturing signaled that the economy was stronger than
some investors had expected. The price of the benchmark 30-year
issue fell 11/32, to 103 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.01 percent from 4.99
percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly events could turn darker for the markets and the
economy generally, and investors could even see the return of a bit
more volatility to the market on Friday, traders said. Friday's
session marks the quarterly occurrence known as ``triple
witching,'' when options, futures contracts and options on futures
all expire, sometimes accompanied by more frenetic trading.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest activity on Thursday could be found among financial
and technology stocks, as investors reacted positively to Chase
Manhattan Bank's announcement on Wednesday that its fourth-quarter
profits would be better than expected. Chase shares gained 6 3/8,
to 69 7/8, their highest level since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, shares of the semiconductor manufacturer Micron
Technology rose 6, to 52 7/8, as some financial analysts sensed
improving demand for computer-memory chips. Abby Joseph Cohen, the
widely followed investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., told
clients in a recent report that many semiconductor-related
companies might be well situated to generate earnings gains.
</P>
<P>
   That view helped to pull technology stocks generally higher, and
as they are wont to do, investors used any hint of good news as an
excuse to buy shares of Internet-related companies like Yahoo and
America Online. Even Amazon.com, which opened the day at 264 after
trading above 300 for the first time on Wednesday, cut its losses
in half by the end of the day, finishing down 12\, at 276}.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As investors look ahead to the beginning of the year, there are
several things that are likely to weigh more heavily on their
minds, if they have not begun to do so already.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the market's October reprise of its August
decline, mutual funds have been a bit slower than usual to put new
cash to work, financial analysts say. In addition, there is every
reason to expect that January will bring a flood of new money into
those portfolios as a new cycle of payments into retirement plans
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, institutional investors ``are feeling the need to put
money to work beforehand,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors could begin to temper the optimism of
investors as the year progresses. Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S.
strategist at Lehman Brothers, said that the new year would only
bring more discussion and confusion about the possible effect of
the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how Y2K isn't going to create some
distortions in market and economic activity,'' Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the preference for just-in-time inventory could
turn into just-in-case, and we could see an inventory buildup,'' he
said. In addition, he said, ``there are likely to be a whole lot of
little credit crunches going on, even before the year 2000 gets
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen, of Goldman, Sachs, released a report to clients late
Wednesday in which she said that stock prices could still gain but
at slower rates than in recent years. And stock picking would
become more important than simply buying a market index, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the S&AMP;P 500 is roughly at fair value based on
our views for the coming year,'' she wrote. ``But several sectors
appear to offer more attractive value opportunities,'' among them
semiconductor-related companies and energy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, too, has indicated that gains in the market next year
should be more in line with long-term trends _ and far below the
returns of 25 percent or more experienced over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate said his 1999 price target for the S&AMP;P 500 was 1,250,
less than 6 percent above Thursday's close. Ms. Cohen, meanwhile,
said her year-end price target was 1,275, or 8 percent above the
index's current level. That is roughly equivalent to 9,850 for the
Dow industrials, she added, or about 10 percent above the gauge's
current price.

   Globes like `Truman,' `Shakespeare'
   By Steve Murray
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's been a good morning,'' actress Lynn Redgrave says from
her Los Angeles home Thursday, shortly after learning she'd gotten
a Golden Globe nomination for her supporting role as the frumpy
housekeeper in ``Gods and Monsters,'' the story of ``Frankenstein''
director James Whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect it,'' she says. ``Of course, you get these
hopeful moments, but you know, there are so many people for them to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable mainly for its lack of big surprises, the list of
nominees include a couple of films and performances from earlier
this year that could have been forgotten in the traditional
December glut of trophy-seeking releases. To that extent, the
nominations are less about ``Saving Private Ryan'' than about
resurrecting ``Truman.'' An early June release, ``The Truman
Show,'' starring Jim Carrey as an unwitting TV star, earned six
slots on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the more recent movies weren't overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Dec. 25 in Atlanta, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' in which
Gwyneth Paltrow plays muse to Joseph Fiennes' bard, tied ``Truman''
with six nominations. ``Gods and Monsters,'' which opens here today
and whose star, Ian McKellen, has been already dubbed best actor by
several national critics groups, got three nods: picture, actor and
supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   Checking out the nominees, IMAGE Film and Video Center's
executive director Anne Hubbell found few surprises, except Todd
Solondz's screenplay citation for ``Happiness,'' the controversial
indie fave that features pedophilia as one of its themes. ``That
was one of my favorite films of 1998,'' she says. ``I hope this
acknowledgment increases his chances for the Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   So who votes on the Golden Globes, and why do we care?
</P>
<P>
   Good questions. The awards are bestowed by the 92 members of the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association, an amorphous membership
ranging from full-time writers to people who once upon a time did
report on the entertainment industry. So while the Academy Awards
are chosen by members of the industry (directors, writers, actors,
etc.), the Globes are chosen by a bunch of ink-stained outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tinge of tawdriness to the setup, the Golden Globes
are seen as a fairly accurate predictor for the choices academy
voters will make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's looked on as a sort of beacon,'' Redgrave says.
``It makes people notice things, and then it seems to mold choices
for other awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's no big surprise that Globe nominees often turn up
on Oscar's list. After all, the Globes divide films into two
categories: drama and comedy/musical. That means they nominate 10
or more movies, not just five, and the acting slots are also
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   So sure, last year's best picture nominees included the
academy's choices. But the Foreign Press also nominated ``The
Boxer,'' ``Amistad,'' ``Men in Black,'' ``Wag the Dog'' and ``My
Best Friend's Wedding,'' none of which were Oscar's big favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, if you watch a lot of movies, you could list 10 of your
own favorites of '98 and probably predict the Oscars. There aren't
that many great flicks per annum.
</P>
<P>
   The nominated films are a good mix of studio titles (Robert
Redford's ``The Horse Whisperer'') and smaller, independent works
(``Elizabeth,'' based on the life of England's ``Virgin Queen'').
While the nominee list doesn't include any left-field surprises, it
has its peculiarities. One is the nomination of Carrey for
``Truman.'' Sure, it was an OK performance, but didn't approach the
skill of Tom Hanks' transition, years ago, from comedy to drama.
Another oddity: the complete snub of the highly anticipated
Terrence Malick-directed war film ``The Thin Red Line,'' due here
in January.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard not to suspect that Sharon Stone got a supporting
actress nod for her role in ``The Mighty'' because the Foreign
Press members really, really want to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the acclaimed Italian film about the Holocaust,
``Life Is Beautiful,'' looks like a gross oversight, but there's a
reason. According to the Foreign Press rules, it was ineligible,
having been released in Italy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy,'' one the flicks nominated for best picture, is a
low-profile British comedy that only the voters seem to have seen.
(It opened last Friday in Los Angeles and is slated for a limited
run elsewhere in January, though Atlanta is not a confirmed city
for distribution.)
</P>
<P>
   To find out who wins or loses, you'll have to wait for the
Golden Globes ceremony Jan. 24. On Feb. 9, the Academy Award
nominees will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Redgrave has a big issue to ponder. What will
she wear?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she says with a laugh. ``Everybody seems to
borrow a frock these days. Maybe I'll borrow a frock.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: FIRST MADE MAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hellbent'' is the word for Republicans at this eerie moment,
and what they are hellbent on is the destruction of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This passion does not present them in an ennobling light despite
efforts to portray themselves as the Lord's righteous army wielding
its terrible, swift sword (Republican majorities in the Congress)
to stamp out immorality and mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   It is never easy to feel comfortable with politicians who claim
to hold the high moral ground, as the Republicans now do. Few
spectacles are more grotesque. A politician holding the high moral
ground is like a hog in a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is the situation in which Republicans find themselves
in their desperation to cleanse the Republic of a president they
portray as abominable and loathsome, and quite possibly Satanic.
</P>
<P>
   The single-minded partisan intensity of their campaign for
impeachment has the smell of fanaticism on it, and possibly a touch
of madness. One can understand why, and even sympathize.
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than the White House lawyer has conceded
that the president's behavior is maddening. Still, maddened rage is
not the best frame of mind in which to make great decisions of
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad'' may be
nothing more than high-flown literature. Still, the Republicans
suddenly seem ready to stampede over the cliff if that's what it
takes to rid themselves of the insufferable Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Wednesday's military strikes against Iraq were immediately
hauled into the all-absorbing impeachment melodrama, with
Republicans suggesting that war was the last maneuver in a
malevolent presidential scheme to escape his just deserts. Trent
Lott, the Republicans' Senate leader, came out against the raids
even before CNN showed the first pictures of lights in Baghdad's
night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Instant TV analysts found Lott's position shocking. When the
guns begin to speak and Americans go into battle, Senate leaders,
whatever their politics, have always ``closed ranks'' behind the
president. Or so it was said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, to do otherwise is to risk being judged
unpatriotic. It seemed a dangerous risk for Lott to take,
particularly since Republicans have traditionally compared
themselves favorably to Democrats in the patriotism department.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, between TV pictures of explosions in
Baghdad, Gerald Solomon, Republican chairman of the House Rules
Committee, appeared in American parlors venting his conviction that
the whole thing was a Clinton maneuver to prevent impeachment. It
was ``the lowest thing'' he'd ever heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lott nor Solomon is famous for mental acuity, and the
mass of Republicans quickly tried to recover from their lapses by
announcing total support for American soldiers, sailors and
airpersons, omitting only the president.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, however, the TV screen filled with
Republicans obviously boiling about the attacks on Saddam Hussein
and seething with poisonous imputations that the president was
risking American lives to save his own skin.
</P>
<P>
   Has there ever been a nastier day in politics? Probably. No
congressman has yet clubbed another insensible, as one did during
the preliminaries to the Civil War, but partisan hatreds are such
that it might be wise to require all members to go through metal
detectors before entering the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   What we are seeing, as Geneva Overholser notes in The Washington
Post, is the death of the political middle. Extremists are in
charge. They are always plentiful in Congress, but they rarely
rule.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyndon Johnson was majority leader he used to call them
``the red hots.'' They were dominantly liberals then, and had no
muscle. Now they are conservatives for whom accommodation and
compromise amount to betrayal of faith.
</P>
<P>
   For six years they have tried to persuade the public to get rid
of Clinton for general vileness. Maddened by the public's refusal
to see the light, they have talked themselves into a frothing
lather. They are hellbent on putting a stake through his heart, and
public sentiment be damned.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale of mythic grandeur, produced by those three modern
Fates: Paula Jones, Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky. Like Abraham
Lincoln and Betsy Ross, their names will long endure.

   Uhry's take on Atlanta lynching is a musical with nerve
   By Dan Hulbert
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Parade,'' the deeply moving new musical by
Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown, which opened Thursday night,
there is an enormous living presence that never leaves the stage:
the lynching tree.
</P>
<P>
   As designed by Riccardo Hernandez, the tree has a huge swollen
trunk and gnarled, leafless limbs that appear to writhe in the
shadows, as if at any point they might reach down and seize Leo
Frank (Brent Carver) before his appointed time on the rope. Like a
rooted evil invisible to the players, or a wrathful god in Greek
tragedy whose victory is preordained, the tree waits. It fills the
high spaces of the Atlanta pencil factory where 13-year-old Mary
Phagan (Christy Carlson Romano) is murdered in 1913; it looms over
the courtroom where Frank, her Jewish foreman, is railroaded to a
conviction on the tainted testimony of a janitor, Jim Conley (Rufus
Bonds, Jr.), desperate to save his own hide.
</P>
<P>
   And at the climax of this semi-documented, semi-fictional
account of the Frank case, the tree stands alone on a country lane
(the actual site was at Roswell and Frey's Gin roads,
Marietta(Ga.)) when the vigilantes slip the noose around Frank's
neck and seal one of America's most controversial martyrdoms.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking ``The Sound of Music'' here. In fact, Hal
Prince's production of ``Parade'' is not even much like the other
dark works _ ``Titanic'' or Prince's ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Evita''
_ that have expanded the canvas of what mainstream musicals can do,
for all of those shows used glamour, ghoulish fun or feel-good
heroics to perk up the somber subject matter. ``Parade'' stoops to
none of those tricks. Whatever criticisms can be leveled at it _
and audience are sure to have many _ it is a musical that never
loses its nerve.
</P>
<P>
   At its center is the love story of Frank and his wife, Lucille
(Carolee Carmello), who at first flees Atlanta to escape the shame
of Leo's arrest but then discovers a strength she never knew she
had, persuading Governor Slaton to commute Leo's sentence and order
a retrial. The Franks' love is doubly heartbreaking because they
discover it too late to enjoy it. Leo's only triumph in suffering _
again, in the tradition of the Greeks _ is self-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade,'' then, may be the saddest musical ever, but it is no
more ``depressing'' than a finely composed funeral Mass. Its
sadness is of the elegaic kind that awakens, not burdens, the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is not without flaws, especially in slow-to-ignite
Act I. One wonders whether Hernandez has ever seen the real
Georgia, since the ``red hills'' he so literally depicts on the
backdrop look as sun-scorched as Southern California's.
</P>
<P>
   Composer-lyricist Brown makes an impressive Broadway debut with
some achingly beautiful songs _ ``Old Red Hills of Home,'' a
stirring anthem of Southern pride; and ``You Don't Know This Man,''
Lucille's defiant defense of her husband. But he still leaves us a
bit hungry for melodic hooks, and his attempts at an early 1900s
musical styles don't even sound as authentic as those of
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of stereotypes, which is bound to get
different responses depending on the Southerner who sees the show.
Uhry, who tells the story masterfully, with flashes of bitter humor
and ironic foreshadowing, and Prince (``Phantom of the Opera''),
who brings his familiar flair for stage pictures, clearly wrestle
with the problem of cliches. Their Frank is not a Perfect Martyr
but an arrogant Atlanta newcomer who yearns for the ``real people''
of his Brooklyn youth. Another bold choice is to begin the evening
with a noble young rebel soldier going off to war _ then magically
transform him into a bitter, grizzled, one-legged veteran in the
Confederate Memorial Day Parade (hence the show's title) 35 years
later. In this single brilliant stroke Uhry and Prince provide a
sympathetic insight into the men who shouted for the head of the
Yankee foreman who paid their children pennies an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Uhry shifts the blame off the common man and onto Tom
Watson, the publisher of ``The Jeffersonian,'' who incites him with
such verbatim phrases as ``perverted sodomite Jew.'' Uhry also
includes a stereotypically clownish defense lawyer, a sort of Big
Daddy without the brains. His least credible characters are lesser
villains: prosecutor Hugh Dorsey, who exploits the Frank case with
naked political ambition; and Britt Craig, reporter for the
now-defunct Atlanta Georgian, a generic figure of journalistic
sleaze who seems to arise from a 1990s peeve rather than a sense of
deep historical outrage.
</P>
<P>
   None of these glitches derails the story for long. It's simply
too riveting in its authentic horrors and too intelligently told.
Uhry's book has an uncanny ability to weave in and out of
characters' heads, making fantasy co-exist with reality; even the
choreography, by Patricia Birch, enhances this effect. In the
evening's most daring sequence, as factory girls give coached
testimony about Frank's alleged lasciviousness, the repressed
foreman dances with them with a mad, suggestive abandon, even
leaping up to strut across courtroom desks.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's transcendant moment has nothing to do with
tragedy _ it's about fleeting, quiet joy, as Leo and Lucille enjoy
their long-awaited ``picnic'' on the floor of his cell. In Brown's
most soaring notes and inspired lyrics (fully realized by the
voices of the superb Carver and Carmello), the Franks come to terms
with ``All the Wasted Time'' that they neglected to enjoy each
other, just hours before the vigilantes seize him.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Peachtree Street, the rebel flags are again unfurled and
the parade again floats by in ghostly slow motion. A sadder but
stronger Lucille goes on alone.
</P>

INDIFFERENCE SETS IN AS MISSILES EXPLODE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD - As night descended and more punishing missile attacks
approached Thursday, this city shrugged its shoulders with weary
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The streaking red tracers and the wailing sirens that erupted
moments before incoming missiles were barely noticed at the Al
Meeland Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A young, bow-tied waiter reflexively opened the door so the air
pressure from the impending blast would not shatter the windows.
Then he quickly returned to serve lamb kebabs.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped from the door, what was reported to be a
1,000-pound cruise missile slammed into a seven-story government
building several blocks away, in the heart of Baghdad. Thick black
smoke poured from its windows. Then a second missile plunged down
the middle of the building, igniting a plume of fire that engulfed
the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shook the restaurant. Diners casually looked out the
window at the damage and the acrid smoke that filled the sky.
Standing on the street outside, a chef named Ali Al Dahab, said,
``We've gotten used to it. Nothing new. We just hope it finishes
soon. Sometimes we feel scared for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dahab said he did not expect to get the night off: ``I'll go
on working. If I go home or stay here it is still the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership was not so complacent.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
Al-Sahhaf issued a blistering attack on President Clinton's
rationale for the bombing, dismissing it as ``cheap lies to deceive
the world for a pretext to carry out an agression.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahhaf maintained that Iraq has acted in good faith. He claimed
that since the Nov. 17 resumption of United Nations weapons
inspections, eight inspection teams had carried out 427 inspections
at as many sites. He listed all of the targets attacked Thursday
night and claimed that each of them had been either inspected or
placed under the surveillance of monitoring cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The total damage from Wednesday night and Thursday morning
attacks was difficult to assess. Foreign reporters, permitted to
travel around the city only with a government ``minder,'' were
given only limited access.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi radio reported that President Saddam Hussein visited some
of the targeted areas, including the house of his daughter, Hala.
The house of the youngest of her three daughters was demolished,
but she was reported safe.
</P>
<P>
   Another missile reportedly fell in an area near one of Saddam's
sprawling presidential palaces in Baghdad. Still another attack was
reported to have caused damage in the area of al-Adil, where a vast
military camp and a series of radio relay stations are located.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Iraqis seem acutely aware of the term ``wag the dog.'' On
one street a group of young Iraqi men, when asked why they thought
the US was bombing, replied with ``Ms. Monica'' in a thick Arabic
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Sahhaf also referred to the perjury allegations and sex scandal
that has left Clinton facing possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate liars can commit dirty crimes. We are the victims of
crime in Washington. There's no crisis in Iraq. There's a crisis of
corrupt politicians in Washington trying to divert attention from
their dirty life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us see their crimes tonight,'' he added, at the end of the
press conference, as warning sirens began to wail for an impending
attack.
</P>
<P>
   There was a perverse quality to the night of bombing. One
military analyst on CNN referred to ``the beauty of B52 bombers,''
while the air strikes occurred amid a complacency that bordered on
nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, a shopping boulevard called Karada was
crowded with Iraqi families. Young couples and mothers pushing baby
strollers sauntered past a 20-foot-wide and four-foot deep crater
left by an American cruise missile the night before. None seemed in
a hurry to get home before nightfall and the promise of more
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting that's all. We endure. We lasted through 41
days of bombing in 1991, so two or three days of this is not bad,''
said Abdel Karem.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Kader, dressed in blue pajamas, looked up at the sky as
his father spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old postal worker sat with his five year-old son on
his knee. They had come to watch a bulldozer grind away at the
crater in an attempt to repair a water main that had been ruptured
during the attack, leaving more than 20 percent of Baghdad's 6
million people without water. The bright yellow bulldozer, Karem
said, kept his son's mind off the idea of another night of
thundering attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday night my daughter asked me, `What is it?' when the
bombs started,'' said Kader, describing how his three children
cowered in fear and cried next to him in bed as the missiles rained
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her it was America. She asked me `Why does America do
this to us?' And I told her it is because they have hatred for the
Iraqi people... There is no factory, no presidential palace, no
weapons site here. There are only people. So why do you bomb us?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he was sitting in the street if he knew the
attacks were coming, he replied, ``Where am I to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Around him, couples shopped in sparsely stocked stores, some of
which had windows blown out. Young boys climbed through the rubble
of a three-story house demolished by the missiles that landed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   People seemed indifferent to the fact that American battleships
and aircraft carriers were poised in the Persian Gulf to unleash a
second night of pounding Cruise and Tomahawk missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is wedding night in Baghdad. And like any other
Thursday, there was the sound of wedding parades across the city.
Led by drummers and trumpeters, wedding parties marched along side
brides in cream-white gowns and grooms in neatly pressed suits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Al Mansour Hotel, a 31-year-old groom named Saad Atiyah,
sat beside his new bride as the first warning sirens of the evening
began to sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown used to it,'' he said, of the impending bombing.
``We're not going to let it interfere with our night.''
</P>
<P>
   Another wedding couple celebrating at the hotel had a similarly
defiant tone that captured the child-like loyalty among many Iraqis
to their president.
</P>
<P>
   If the US intends to destabilize the regime through this
bombing, discussions with Iraqis Thursday suggested it would have
precisely the opposite effect. The more the US targets Saddam, the
more he paints himself as the embattled defender of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bravery comes from the bravery of our leader, Saddam,''
said Entivar Jamil, 21, in a sequined wedding dress. ``He stands
with us through this American agression.''

   In Alford, there's no great urge to make anything `run'
   By Celestine Sibley
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you live in Alford, Fla., you could probably get along fine
without a car. My mother lived there for 38 years and managed.
</P>
<P>
   But my son loves his wheels and is bereft when they don't turn.
Recently, he had call to make a trip _ 13 miles away to the county
seat _ and the engine turned over and ran, but the wheels did not.
I followed the car vicissitudes with daily telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be all right,'' he assured me. ``I have
ordered a part somebody told me it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later he told me the part had come, costing a good bit
more than the $50 price his friend had quoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you install it yourself?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was trying, but it was complicated. He had spent some
time studying the vitals of his car and trying to figure where the
new part would fit in. If he has a book to go by, he will tackle
any job by following directions. Unfortunately, no directions came
with the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you ask your friend who suggested the part to show
you how to install it?'' I asked
</P>
<P>
   He was shocked. ``Oh, I couldn't do that! I wouldn't want to
impose on him. He used to be a good mechanic, but he has progressed
beyond that now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has?'' I can't conceive of getting beyond being a good
mechanic. Everybody needs that kind of skill from time to time, and
it must be very comforting to know that you can fix anything in
time of breakdown. ``What does he do now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's the city engineer,'' he said. ``Has a nice home _
brick. ''
</P>
<P>
   Was it up to my mother's standard of excellence and taste? ``Oh,
she married well,'' she would say of a neighbor. ``She has a nice
brick home with hardwood floors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have hardwood floors?'' I asked of the now-affluent
ex-mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I've never visited him at home. But
I see him at the City Hall. You know, the city engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   We-ell! I took a deep breath. It did sound affluent until I
remembered the size of the city _ perhaps a dozen blocks where
streets with names such as Park Avenue have residents who still
plow mules. Total population is 500 souls, if you count environs. I
mulled over the problem for long long-distance minutes, and then I
said, ``What does the city engineer do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he drives the garbage truck,'' my son said airily.
</P>
<P>
   You can see there's no way of asking a man of such eminence to
come down off that high seat in the big truck and give expert
counsel on the subject of the nonmoving car and the new part.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the car sits there under the big live oak tree going
nowhere. It's not urgent so far. If anybody gets sick, the nearest
doctor is 12 or 15 miles. But otherwise, everything is in walking
distance _ the grocery store, the City Hall, even the barbershop.
If I had not entertained notions of having my son and his wife
drive to Atlanta for the holidays, I wouldn't keep calling down
there and asking, ``How's your car? Running yet?''
</P>
<P>
   My son is philosophical. He figures in all good time he will
dope out the place for that part and mayhap get it installed. If
not, he won't fret unless some disaster involving travel strikes.
It's a good country town attitude. People who live there will never
jam expressways with their cars, making life hazardous for
themselves and other people. They will pick up a book, and take a
rocking chair on the porch, and possess themselves with patience
until life takes a more urgent turn.

STAPLES BUYING CLARICOM HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Staples-Charge)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   The same mid-sized business that buys paper clips and legal pads
is also in need of such telecommunications services as voice
messaging and video conferencing, and that may largely explain why
office-supply giant Staples Inc. said Thursday it plans to buy
Claricom Holdings Inc. for $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Staples sees it, Staples and Claricom, a Connecticut
telecommunications firm, offer different services and supplies to
the same customer _ businesses with 10 employees or more.
</P>
<P>
   By combining forces, Staples now believes it can offer a broader
range of products and services to those core customers and provide
them with one-stop shopping, something that none of its big
office-supply rivals can do at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Staples, we can sell you a two-line phone,'' said Staples
chairman and chief executive Thomas G. Stemberg, adding, ``but we
don't sell phone systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And phone systems, as well as Internet services, are something
the Staples business customer is clamoring for, he said. With the
Claricom acquisition, Staples would have the capacity to provide
such services and products at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   To further target those Internet services, the company Thursday
said it would establish its newly launched World Wide Web business,
Staples.com, as a separate business unit under Jeff Levitan, who
had been the company's senior vice president for strategic
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The site has ``come out of the box so strongly'' that Staples
plans to nearly double its investment in electronic commerce to
about $23 million next year, Stemberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to plans to acquire Claricom, which counts Bain
Capital Inc. of Boston as one of its owners, the Westborough-based
chain of roughly 900 office-supply superstores said it would take a
$57 million charge to move 58 ``outdated stores,'' mostly in the
Northeast and California, to larger sites near their current
locations.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street's standpoint, the proposed acquisition of
Claricom elicited the most comment.
</P>
<P>
   At Salomon Smith Barney, analyst James Stoeffel sees Staples and
Office Depot Inc. as rapidly pulling away from the office-supply
competition and in need of new worlds to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next trend in this industry is, `How do we expand our
market share?' '' and the Claricom acquisition offers Staples a
vehicle to do that by offering ``new products and value-added
services to its core customer base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Claricom acquisition may provide Staples with a ``major
growth opportunity,'' agreed A.G. Edwards analyst Donald T.
Spindel. With telecommunications, Staples can set itself apart from
Office Depot and OfficeMax Inc., the player that seems to be
falling behind in the office-supply superstore industry.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Office Depot nor OfficeMax can now offer such an array
of telecommunications products, Spindel said. So customers have a
big reason to choose Staples over the other two.
</P>
<P>
   It had been rumored that Staples might acquire Corporate Express
Inc., a Colorado office-supply company.
</P>
<P>
   But why buy a struggling firm in an industry in which Staples is
already one of the giants? said Stoeffel, who added, ``you could
get it cheap but then you'd still have to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Stemberg, Staples was mulling over strategic
opportunities when it decided to check out fast-growing
telecommunications companies. Claricom, he said, was one of the few
independent companies with a national network.
</P>
<P>
   ``And guess who owned it? A guy sitting on our board of
directors,'' Stemberg said, referring to Mitt Romney, a managing
director of Bain Capital, an early Staples investor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bain, Claricom is also partly owned by its senior
management team and by Triumph Capital, an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the e-commerce front, Stoeffel thinks there are big
opportunities for Staples and Office Depot. Many products, such as
paper and pens, are not ones an office manager needs to see before
he or she is willing to place an order.
</P>
<P>
   And both Staples and Office Depot already have efficient
delivery systems to get these products to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed to shrug off the $57 million fourth-quarter
charge Staples plans to take to close old stores, the first charge
Staples has taken in five years.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, shares reached an all-time high of 41 7/8 Thursday
before closing at 39 13/16, up 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Staples seems to be rolling along. Earlier this week, it
formally opened its new headquarters, and last month, it reported
third-quarter earnings had jumped 33 percent.

PALESTINIANS WHO CHEERED FOR CLINTON NOW BURN U.S. FLAGS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Yards from a banner welcoming President
Clinton to town, Palestinians angry about U.S. strikes against Iraq
burned the American flags they had waved just days earlier to greet
the president on his first visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, meanwhile, opened gas mask distribution centers and
deployed Patriot anti-missile batteries in the Negev Desert,
central Israel and Haifa in the north as precautionary measures,
but downplayed the chance of attack by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for every eventuality,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, about 500 teen-agers and their teachers marched to
protest the bombing, lobbing rocks at Israeli soldiers and filling
the brisk winter air with smoke from burning U.S. flags. Two
protesters were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Similar protests took place near Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron as
Palestinians vented anger at a U.S. president who had impressed
many here with talk of peacemaking during his first visit to
Palestinian-ruled territory earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to make peace, to be a man of peace,'' said Ehab
Hawari, a 16-year-old Palestinian student who joined in the
demonstrations. ``So if he wants peace, why is he making war with
Iraq?''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who sided with Saddam
Hussein during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, has since refrained from
comment on the repeated crises with the Iraqi leader over United
Nations inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But one of his senior negotiators spoke out, calling on the
United States and Britain to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand an immediate end of the attacks against Iraq,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. ``We believe only through
peaceful means that problems can be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   With each mini-crisis with Iraq, Palestinians have responded
with fewer demonstrations, in part because the Palestinian
government, which doesn't want to jeopardize growing ties with the
United States, has prevented public protests. But most still
sympathize with the suffering Iraqi people, even if they don't
support Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is hitting Iraqi children. They are bombing
families,'' said Nadir Shweiky, a Palestinian restaurant owner in
Bethlehem. ``If they want to do something, why don't they do it
against Saddam?''
</P>
<P>
   This time, with so many U.S. flags handy, the demonstrations
were larger than before. But they were still small in comparison to
demonstrations in support of Palestinian prisoners locked in
Israeli jails, an emotional issue that easily brings thousands out
into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians credited Clinton for the low turnout. ``When
Clinton came here, he made a good impression, he was like one of
us,'' said Shweiky. ``We felt he was respecting our people, but we
don't like what he's doing in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   But many said they didn't expect the bombing to last long,
particularly with the onset of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan on
Saturday and Christmas next week. Few believe Saddam will strike
Israel. And the repetitiveness of the crisis has blunted the sense
of urgency here.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, 65 gas mask distribution centers opened across the
country, but most were empty most of the time. Streets were filled
with lights for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and Israelis went
about their day as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli intelligence officers said that despite Saddam's
denials, Iraq still possesses a few missile launchers, several
dozen missiles and chemical warfare capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But they predicted there was little chance Saddam would repeat
the missile strikes of 1991, when the Iraqi leader launched 39
Scuds at Israel, except as an act of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is on the brink of extinction, he certainly may take
suicidal steps involving the launching of a few missiles against
Israel,'' said Gen. Amos Gilad, head of research in Israel's
military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Israel is better prepared this time to deal with an
Iraqi missile attack than it was in 1991. Patriot missiles then
provided by the United States proved ineffectual against the Iraqi
Scuds.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he first learned that a strike against Iraq was
imminent from Clinton during his trip to Israel and the Palestinian
Authority and stressed that his country was not part of the
confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is outside the dispute,'' Netanyahu said, but added
that Israel would prepare for the worst, just in case Saddam
attacked. ``Who knows what is going on in that man's brain?'' he
said.

BUTLER GIVEN PROTECTION AMID FLURRY OF ALLEGATIONS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two days after Richard Butler gave the United
States a green light for military force in Iraq, the chief UN
weapons inspectors has himself come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia Thursday called for the Australian diplomat's
resignation. China called him ``dishonorable.'' UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan's closest aides say they believe that Butler
intentionally sought to provoke a confrontation with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The political threat to his future was matched by a more
physical danger. Concerned about a personal attack, the United
Nations placed Butler under protective guard with five bodyguards,
two marked police cars and a bulletproof vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to allegations that he was acting on behalf of the
United States, Butler defended a highly critical report of
Baghdad's efforts to block UN inspections of its chemical and
biological weapons program. He said the report, which President
Clinton cited as the justification for the air war, was based
strictly on the experiences of UN Special Commission arms
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It danced to no one's tune,'' Butler said. ``It was not
written to anyone's purposes, including as some of you have
suggested for the purposes of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday that Butler
had presented a distorted version of Iraq's cooperation with the
United Nations. Russia contends that Baghdad's overall record of
cooperation with the United Nations has been good _ more than 300
inspections with only five incidents. And he called for the
replacement of Butler and the re-establishment of the UN team not
dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China also made it clear that it would like to see Butler go.
</P>
<P>
   And other Security Council members privately suggested that a
future UNSCOM would be more effective without Butler at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand their concerns,'' he said. ``I would prefer they
understand better my concern, which is to enable us to . . . which
is to have Iraq cooperate to enable us to do our job.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would quit, Butler told a group of reporters
Thursday: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insisted that the problem is Saddam
Hussein's evasions not Butler's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting the messenger is not the way to go about this,'' said
US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. ``He is an outstanding
individual and he deserves the support of the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM officials say that they have been dealt a raw deal by the
Council. They say that Butler has been maligned for simply carrying
out the council's own mandate _ the destruction of Iraq's nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons. And they say that Iraq has
consistently sought to prevent them from carrying out their
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that we haven't made some mistakes in
presentation,'' said Charles Duelfer. ``But we have a divided
council, and when you have a boss with multiple personalities it
makes working for them very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's blunt public diplomacy has poisoned his relationship
with the cautious UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In recent weeks,
Annan has repeatedly cited Butler's lack of diplomacy, what he
calls ``megaphone diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   UN sources say the UN chief has been irritated by what he views
as Butler's provocative approach to the inspections and by his
refusal to consult with him and with other key council members on
significant issues, including his decision to withdraw the UN
inspectors hours before an American strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler's objective over the past several weeks appeared to be
not so much continuing inspections but collecting compelling
evidence of Iraqi noncompliance, which is what the Americans
wanted,'' the source said.

TENDER MOMENT FOR SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First things first. Before the Red Sox make plans for a
run at the 1999 American League East pennant, they will set the
stage friday by sending contracts to the eligible players they wish
to retain from the 1998 club.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Sunday's deadline, they will formally tender
contracts to players without multiyear deals. Players who don't get
such offers by Sunday become free agents, but that's highly
unlikely in Boston's case.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean new life for veterans like Darren Bragg, Damon
Buford, Midre Cummings, John Wasdin, Scott Hatteberg, and Ron
Mahay, all of whom have value on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent winter meetings at Nashville, general manager
Dan Duquette indicated that the Red Sox would likely keep all their
key players from last season and that there would be no surprises.
But given Boston's poor record on the free agent market, Duquette
will no doubt be scanning the lists of castoffs from other clubs
for a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a major hit in free agency, losing slugger Mo Vaughn
to Anaheim. In addition, five pitchers who at some point worked for
the Sox last season are gone. Pete Schourek became the latest,
signing Thursday with the Pittsburgh Pirates for $4 million over
two years. Schourek, 29, went 8-9 in 25 games with Houston and
Boston in 1998 and became part of Red Sox lore when he was selected
over ace Pedro Martinez to start the do-or-die fourth game of the
American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians.
Schourek pitched superbly but got a no-decision as the Sox were
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the lefthander can earn up to $5.3 million on his
new contract if he reaches incentives based on appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the Sox lost lefthander Greg Swindell, who signed
with the Arizona Diamondbacks for $5.7 million over three years.
They did not offer arbitration to Steve Avery, who wound up with
the Cincinnati Reds (one year, $1.5 million), and Butch Henry, who
has agreed to terms with the Seattle Mariners, pending a physical
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone are retired reliever Dennis Eckersley and infielders
Tim Naehring and Mark Lemke, and pitcher Robinson Checo was
designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox signed two free agents for 1999, second baseman Jose
Offerman (four years, $26 million) from the Kansas City Royals and
pitcher Mark Portugal (one year, $3 million) with the Pittsburgh
Pirates. Rumors persist that Boston has an interest in the Chicago
White Sox' Frank Thomas. But White Sox general manager Ron Schueler
continues to tell sources the two teams don't have a match. Owner
Jerry Reinsdorf acknowledged in a Chicago television interview that
Thomas might be available, but the offer from any club seeking his
services would have to be ``overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette is still checking out possible free agents. Club
spokesman Kevin Shea confirmed Thursday that free agent first
baseman John Jaha, a Milwaukee Brewers last season, underwent a
day-long examination at the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center in Worcester.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On another day of surreal split-screen frenzy in
the capital, the Republicans in the House of Representatives
decided Thursday to begin debate on the impeachment of President
Clinton on Friday, when American warplanes will presumably be
preparing for further raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An uproar over the timing of the impeachment debate broke out on
the House floor Thursday afternoon while television screens outside
were aglow with ghostly green images of bombs and missiles
exploding in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no sign that any House Republicans were wavering
on impeachment _ indeed, several more undecided Republicans said
they would vote for impeachment _ it was evident that the party
leadership had been thrown off stride by the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's strategists conceded that the struggle in the
House had been lost and turned grimly to the task of preparing for
a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also faced bitter criticism on the diplomatic front from
a handful of foreign countries, notably Russia and China, for
resorting to force. The Russians recalled their ambassador from
Washington in protest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected strenuously to moving ahead with impeachment
while the bombing campaign was under way. It is expected to end by
this weekend, a White House official said, when the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan starts.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said debate
would begin at 9 a.m. Friday, with voting on the four articles of
impeachment running into Saturday. No change was conceded by the
Republicans, but discussions about the timetable and the rules,
especially the one governing the time to be allotted for debate,
continued deep into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some significant change, the stage was set for the
spectacle of a House vote on impeachment, only the second in 130
years, taking place while American military planes were flying over
hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to complete this mission,'' Clinton vowed as allied
bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and other parts of Iraq
with a second wave of punishing airstrikes. Reports from the scene
said that explosions in the capital were louder and more percussive
than those in the first wave on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of casualties among American pilots, but
Clinton acknowledged that Iraqi civilian casualties were
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes red and puffy with fatigue, the president forcefully
but without visible rancor rejected suggestions from senior
Republicans that he had ordered the strikes to dissipate momentum
towards impeachment. ``I don't think any serious person would
believe that any president would do such a thing,'' Clinton
commented just before a briefing in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The president was told at the briefing, and reporters were later
informed, that the first volley of more than 200 unmanned cruise
missiles, launched from ships in the Persian Gulf at some 50
targets, had leveled President Saddam Hussein's military
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks of security guards at
weapons sites. But Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, conceded that other strikes were ``not as
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at an aerial photo of one of Iraq's special security
brigade headquarters, Shelton said, ``You don't see anything but
rubble in what was formerly this building.''
</P>
<P>
   The second wave on Thursday, which included British Tornado
bombers for the first time, sent more cruise missiles deep into
Iraq while navy planes with laser-guided bombs went after Iraqi
air-defense sites along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, China and Russia all called for an immediate end to the
attacks, but a divided U.N. Security Council took no further
action. France, whose initial reaction was rather negative, seemed
to be softening somewhat after President Jacques Chirac had what
his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, called ``a good conversation''
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, responsibility lies clearly with the Iraqi
president,'' Chirac said in a subsequent statement. ``The main
point is to settle problems that, without a doubt, will not be
settled by airstrikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four national polls taken Wednesday evening after the bombing
began indicated that the American public overwhelmingly supports
the military action in Iraq and accepts Clinton's explanations of
its timing and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   However, a significant fraction of those who support
impeachment, a relatively small minority of the population in
itself, believes that the imminence of a House vote may have
affected the timing of the raids in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans who sharply questioned the honesty of
Clinton's justification of the raids on Wednesday pulled back on
Thursday, though none apologized. Notable in this group was former
Secretary of State Lawrence F. Eagleburger, who said after a
meeting with the present holder of that job, Madeleine Albright,
that he would mute his language in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism from both parties, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, backed away from his charge that the strikes were
linked to impeachment. After overnight reflection, he said, ``I am
satisfied this was a military decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN, Lott also confirmed that the Senate
would open a trial of the president if any of the articles of
impeachment were approved, and he said there would be no deals to
cut it short, as a number of Democrats have proposed recently.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of Republican senators, including John McCain of
Arizona, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, John W. Warner of Virginia
and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, voiced support of the
president's decision to strike now. All are prominent party
spokesmen on defense and foreign policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the party worried that proceeding with the impeachment
debate and vote might backfire on the speaker-elect, Rep. Robert L.
Livingston of Louisiana, just as closing down the federal
government a few years ago came to haunt the outgoing speaker, Newt
Gingrich. A Republican senator deeply involved with foreign policy
said, ``It is Bob's call, of course, but he had better watch
carefully where he treads.''
</P>
<P>
   The political future of Livingston himself was called into
question on Thursday when, after being informed that a disclosure
was imminent, he admitted to extramarital indiscretions and offered
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in what may have been his last speech as speaker, told
the House: ``No matter what our debates at home, we are as a nation
prepared to lead the world.'' Later, the House voted 417-5 in favor
of a resolution expressing support for U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against an impeachment debate now, Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., the House minority leader, said it could be ``misperceived
as a sign of disunity'' by Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Lee Hamilton, a widely respected Indiana Democrat,
said it was ``unwise to weaken the president'' at a time when a new
invasion of Kuwait, a missile assault on Israel or a peace
initiative might be triggered by the allied air raids.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey quoted the president himself in rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the White House Thursday morning whether his authority
would be undercut by an impeachment vote, Clinton said: ``No. I'm
going to complete this mission, we're going to complete this
mission. The Republican leadership have to decide how to do their
job. That's not for me to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote of support for Clinton came from former President Jimmy
Carter. Though a Democrat, he has never been particularly close to
Clinton, and he has said little about the prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, he said in a statement issued in Atlanta
that charges that the president had launched the attacks ``for
political purposes are both unjust and ill-advised.''
</P>
<P>
   As Saddam visited sites struck by allied missiles, including the
home of the youngest of his three daughters, Clinton talked by
telephone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of
Jordan and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as well as
Chirac, searching for support.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she had called officials in more than 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Russians and the Chinese demanded the
resignation of Richard Butler, the head of the U.N. inspection team
in Iraq, whose report triggered the American attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said the United States would ``fight for him,'' and
Butler defended his report as ``factual, clear, objective and
honest.'' No one had orchestrated it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sought to squelch any
suggestions that Saddam or any members of his family were the
targets of American weapons. ``We are targeting military or
militarily related targets, period,'' the secretary declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that it was sending reinforcements to the
gulf, including 10 F-117 Stealth fighters, Patriot antimissile
units and troops. Military police, communications specialists and
Special Forces are among those to be rushed to the area. More than
3,000 other troops are already on hand in Kuwait in case Saddam
should decide to strike back there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, meanwhile, security was tightened at airports, the
Capitol and other federal buildings, to guard against any
retaliatory terrorist attacks. Up to 40 U.S. embassies were closed
by the State department for two days for the same reason, officials
said.

COMMENTARY: WHAT CLINTON CAN DO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has one great service he can offer to his country,
only one now _ swift resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, and his true friends out of government, owe
it to him to urge him to resign, in the critical interest of all
Americans, particularly those he is sending into action.
</P>
<P>
   The loss in credibility he earned with his quick decision to
attack Iraq, although his impeachment was likely the next day, will
dilute the chances of lasting victory over Saddam Hussein. He
created two obstacles to eliminating Saddam _ a mountain of
cynicism, and another of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of a war that fails to eliminate Saddam will be not
only Iraqis and Americans, but all who will be slaughtered one day
by Iraq's chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Resignation should come as soon as the current few days of
bombing end. History, not Congress, would pass judgment on the
White House scandal. But Clinton would have made the honest
judgment that his presence had become a weight on his country.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think the president has the courage to resign. But we
must say aloud what we think our leaders should do, not duck behind
platitudes _ like when war starts we all must kowtow to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   If he stays on, the reputation for lying, deviousness and sick
risk-taking that led him to the cusp of impeachment will eat
further at trust in the motives of the man who commands troops
fighting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday Democratic leaders began literally screaming that
he should not be impeached or tried while the United States is
taking military action against Iraq _ which could be for a long
time. Many Americans will believe these Democrats echo the
president's own hopes for immunity from congressional punishment
while he commands troops at combat. I am one of those Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Attack against Saddam for blocking U.N. inspection of Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction was a step he should and could have
taken any time during the six years of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Clinton watch, Saddam blocked inspection ever more
openly, creating almost monthly crises.
</P>
<P>
   The report of Richard Butler, head of the U.N. inspection
commission, could justify an attack, but there had been no
expectation at the United Nations of an instant bombing. Yet
theoretically with only a few hours of deliberation, the president
used the report to order immediate bombing, without saying what
would come next.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he ordered the attack Wednesday, Clinton's impulse to
monkey with reality overcame him. He read aloud the offenses that
Butler charged Saddam committed in the past three weeks of testing
Iraq's intention of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The offenses were: cutting off entry to suspicious sites,
blocking access to evidence, refusing to hand over arms documents.
The result, as Clinton said, was that Butler concluded that the
inspectors could not do their work, or make disarmament progress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listed the offenses with an air of stern astonishment.
But he knew, and the report said so clearly, that blocking
inspection had been going on since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Americans studied U.N. reports for years they could get
the impression from Clinton that they were hearing things just
discovered, necessitating immediate attack. After years of not
retaliating against Saddam's war on U.N. inspection, he decided to
attack in the few days before the Muslim holiday of Ramadan,
rejecting the option of waiting until it was over in January.
</P>
<P>
   The date for the Butler report was set before the timing of
impeachment was known. I have no evidence that Clinton ordered the
immediate bombing attack for anti-impeachment purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton took the risk that his timing would create disbelief
in America and help Saddam become even more popular in the Mideast.
Palestinians in pro-Saddam ecstasy are already burning U.S. flags
they waved for the president a few days ago. Clinton is given to
strange risks _ as when he gambled the presidency for office sex.
</P>
<P>
   Until Clinton ordered the attack on Iraq the day before the
scheduled impeachment vote, his departure was a dispute about
morality, the Constitution and politics. Now something has been
added: how much damage his continuation as president does to
American military and security interests, jargon for life and
death.

<P>
   Even if the U.S. and British bombing of Iraq ends in the next
few days, as the Clinton administration has suggested, the
uncertainty it has created could linger and hurt airlines, hotels
and others in the travel industry at the height of the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Travel industry spokespeople said Thursday that a terrorist
reprisal against a target in the West or an Iraqi strike against
Israel would presumably halt much international travel, as it did
shortly before, during and after the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   In the only response by an air carrier to the current fighting,
United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., canceled its daily round-trip
flight between London and New Delhi Thursday. It tentatively
planned to resume the flight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this is only a skirmish, so not many people are likely
to postpone their flights,'' said Michael Boult, an international
air travel specialist for Rosenbluth International, a
travel-management company. ``But it depends on the degree of
escalation. If it becomes a full-scale conflict like the Gulf War,
or at the first sniff of terrorist activity, lots of people will
cancel or postpone.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at U.S. airlines and airports, while reluctant to
discuss the subject publicly, acknowledge that they began
tightening security as of Wednesday evening, when the missile
attacks began. But security has already been at a high level since
at least late August, they added, when the United States attacked
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan with cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for example, dogs trained to detect explosives
patrolled John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and
O'Hare Airport outside Chicago, the nation's busiest. The police at
Kennedy towed illegally parked cars, instead of just ticketing
them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the heightened concern about security, though, travel
agents said they had not received any cancellations. ``I think
people are so used to hearing about the possibility of terrorism,
especially from Iraq, they no longer panic,'' said Richard Earls,
president of the Summit Travel Group in Winston-Salem, N.C. But if
the conflict escalates, he said, ``I think you'll see people who
had planned to visit overseas turning to domestic destinations and
the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Many travel agents warned clients to get to the airport early
and to carry identification. ``We assume they already know that,
but it's still important to remind them,'' said Michelle Dahan,
general manager of leisure travel for Rosenbluth International. The
National Business Travel Association reiterated a warning that
members headed for destinations considered dangerous or chancy
should travel in twos, vary their routines and notify the local
embassy or consulate of their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Deliberto, an official with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, does
not anticipate a prolonged war and also does not expect a
significant drop in international air travel. ``But during the Gulf
War,'' he said, ``as tensions escalated, international travel
dropped to almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers on U.S. airlines fell 44 percent on
trans-Atlantic routes in 1991, according to the Air Transport
Association, and 20 percent on Pacific routes.
</P>
<P>
   While airlines bore the brunt of the Gulf War, the broader
domestic travel industry also suffered. Losses during that period
were exacerbated by domestic recession.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. hotel occupancy in 1991 fell to just over 62 percent, well
below the 65 percent break-even figure of that time, and Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) estimated that 60 percent of
the hotels in 1991 lost an average of more than $1,000 a room.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities were hurt by a downturn in the convention business
in 1991, as corporate America and professional associations
tightened spending. Hawaii lost about 850,000 tourists from 1991
through 1993. Most were Japanese who opted to visit Australia or
stay home, rather than risk a terrorist incident en route to or in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans also stayed home as gasoline prices soared _ from
an average $1.075 a gallon on Aug. 1, 1990, the day before Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait, to $1.387 by Dec. 4, according to the AAA.
Through the first nine months of 1991, 2,300 travel agencies closed
or went bankrupt, compared with 1,600 for all of 1990. And the war
hurt the cruise industry, which had to advertise heavily and cut
prices to attract passengers. Cruise lines were also forced to
abort sailings to the Mediterranean, which cruise officials
promptly dubbed the ``Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But no industry is more fearful of even a partial re-enactment
of the Gulf War than is the airline industry, which lost $12.8
billion from 1990 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines trimmed flights and flew smaller planes, 40,000 airline
employees were laid off and several airlines petitioned for
bankruptcy. Two of the nation's oldest airlines, Eastern and Pan
American _ financially weak even before the Gulf War _ were so
damaged by fallout from the war that they sold their international
routes in a desperate but ultimately futile effort to stay afloat.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, shaken by leadership turmoil in its early
days as America's largest financial services company, has sped up
the integration of its banking units in a headlong effort to prove
that commercial bankers and investment bankers can mix.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the co-chairmen of Citigroup _ the financial
giant formed by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group _ ousted
their heir apparent, Jamie Dimon, from his post, the investment
bankers from Travelers' Salomon Smith Barney investment banking
unit have been ordered to find a way to merge most of their
operations with the corporate banking side of Citicorp. Michael
Carpenter, one of the two people charged with leading the combined
bank, calls this ``the third way, the Citigroup way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a new way. Investment bankers from New York to
Sydney, Australia, are moving in with their commercial-bank
counterparts, putting their product lines together and making joint
calls on corporate clients like News Corp., Seagram Co. and
Monsanto Co. The Citigroup merger became a formal reality only two
months ago, but executives are already talking about 100 potential
new banking deals made possible by closer cooperation between
Citicorp and Salomon bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Integration appears to be happening faster _ and reaching deeper
into the organization _ than envisioned in the earliest days of the
merger. Like fingernails dragged across a chalkboard, the ouster of
Dimon and one of his chief deputies, Steve Black, has silenced the
open squabbling that divided Citibank executives from their
counterparts at Salomon Smith Barney, many at the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rush to meet a self-imposed year-end deadline to
resolve outstanding conflicts, the merged company has also muffled
important questions about how to balance vastly different
commercial and investment banking cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The fast pace of unification has pleased some within the
company, who said they are surprised by how well the bankers from
both sides have learned to work together despite leadership
turmoil. Spirits are also higher as word filters out that Salomon
bonuses, which many feared would be slashed from last year's
levels, will probably keep pace with 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, said the discord at the top confirms their worst
fears about the financial supermarket envisioned by Sanford Weill
and John Reed, the co-chairmen. Some predict that the forced-march
cordiality disguises smoldering battles, such as an ongoing clash
about the fate of the combined entity's derivatives units. Many
there are also consumed by nuances, like whether London-based
Salomon bankers will move to Citibank's offices in that city's
Canary Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression was that to make the merger a success, they
would never try to mush the two sides together,'' said Susan Weber,
a finance industry expert with Jaquish Advisers and a former
investment banker. ``I am surprised they are trying to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Berry, a banking expert at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, said
he sees the pitfalls in a quick marriage of the banking divisions,
but also the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said the most obvious synergies in Citigroup were
on the consumer side of the business. The consumer banking, credit
card, mortgage, insurance and retail brokerage units do not overlap
much and open the possibility of cross-selling products through new
distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry predicted that successful integration of corporate
banking would initially add to Citigroup's profits faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four big, new corporate deals would have an immediate impact
on the bottom line,'' he said. ``If they can resolve the
philosophical issues about how to organize the group, I think it
has real potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome, Citigroup appears increasingly
determined to challenge conventional financial wisdom. The company
is crossing one of the oldest fault lines in the business, the one
dividing banks that lend money to customers from banks that help
customers raise money in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The two types are known generically as commercial banks and
investment banks. These days, those descriptions do not do justice
to companies that fall somewhere in between. But there are still
many in the industry who think of commercial and investment banks
as East and West, the twain never to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, commercial banks provide loans and help manage
their clients' capital. Investment banks swoop in for big stock and
bond offerings. Commercial bankers get paid a salary each month.
Investment bankers depend on annual bonuses for most of their
income. There is some overlap, but the biggest lenders are all
commercial banks and the biggest underwriters are all investment
banks, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Citigroup had to confront those doubts. But this
merger seemed a better match than some previous linkups. The
acquirer was Weill, the Travelers Group chairman who grew up on
Wall Street. Many saw Weill as unlikely to allow his company's
freewheeling investment-bank culture to be swallowed by the larger
Citicorp and its by-the-book traditions. The departure of Dimon, a
protege of Weill for 15 years, shook that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   One former Salomon Smith Barney official described it this way:
``In the early days, the Citi people thought they had been bought.
They were the Russians when the Germans invaded. Then came the
long, hard winter. Now the Russians are counterattacking.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Citibank banker did not disagree with that analogy. He
said many at the bank believe that they recently edged out longtime
Salomon executives in one subtle but key contest: Citibank's
relationship officers will often take the lead in presenting a
united face to their clients, offering them the full range of
services available from the combined entity, everything from loans
to advice on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though they will often work side by side with their Salomon
counterparts, it's still an important victory. The investment
bankers would have preferred to forge their own relationships with
the 1,700 multinational companies in Citibank's prized global
relationship-banking list. That's because the most richly
compensated investment bankers tend to be those with the tightest
client relationships. Salomon bankers say their worst fear is to
become merely ``product providers'' for Citibank clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinction is blurring between Citibankers and Salomon
people, that's where we are going with this thing,'' the Citibank
executive said. ``I am not saying that there will be no
distinctions. But the Solly guys who think they can continue doing
things the old way will be looking for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter and Victor Menezes, the executives newly named to
manage the Citigroup's corporate banking unit, dismiss such
complaints. In a brief interview in the library of Citibank's
hushed Park Avenue headquarters, the two said they have taken a
pragmatic approach. No one model prevails, they said, adding that
the degree of integration varies depending on product and
geography. They would not impose a solution on corporate customers,
they stressed, but allow customers to decide how they want their
bankers to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter carries around a progress report on the merger. On the
plus side: A plan to unify the two banks' trust businesses has been
reached, in a compromise between Salomon's sales-driven
organization and Citibank's big but slow-growing style.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, he acknowledged that resolving
how to combine Citibank's autonomous derivatives unit with Salomon,
where derivatives experts are meshed with the stock and bond teams,
is proving politically tricky. Still, he predicted a swift
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives claim to get along famously. Menezes, a
Citibank career officer, is an avuncular Indian-American schooled
in the bank's textbook corporate culture. Carpenter, who briefly
presided over the failed brokerage Kidder, Peabody before joining
Weill at Travelers, is a London native who sits sideways on his
chair in the Citibank library, legs dangling over the arms.
</P>
<P>
   Menezes said that after scores of hours together, the two now
think the same thoughts. ``We can finish each other's sentences,''
he said, a challenge Carpenter readily took up, answering a
question about Citibank asked of Menezes. The two sometimes commute
together to Manhattan from their suburban homes.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness is not just cosmetic. The two executives said
Citigroup is already generating more business than Citibank and
Salomon Smith Barney would have alone. One example is Monsanto, a
longtime Citibank customer for bank services but a client of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. when investment banking was called for. It
recently invited Salomon to join Goldman in managing a $1 billion
stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   The harmony extends to bankers on the front lines, people at the
company said. One newly unified team is the consumer products
groups run by Christina Mohr, a managing director at Salomon, and
Natica von Althann, a managing director at Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our working relationship is seamless,'' Ms. Mohr said.
Agreeing, Ms. Althann added that ``We have been at this for a few
months and already we have repeated successes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams handle clients together as long as the clients
want it that way, they said. They described a recent approach that
led to new business from one big client, the Rite Aid retail
drug-store chain. ``It's a perfect example of two plus two equals
five, how we can build on the strength of each relationship,'' Ms.
Althann said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other Salomon bankers describe the need for coordination
as a distraction from client work. Some said the Citibank
structure, in which the people who handle clients are sometimes
junior to executives who run the operation from behind the scenes,
results in regular mismatches with Salomon's lead relationship
bankers, who tend to be more senior.
</P>
<P>
   And in some industries, others said, a unified Citigroup team
can be a big disadvantage. Salomon investment bankers who work on
deals for big commercial banks said they face an uphill battle to
persuade those banks that Salomon will keep client business secret
from Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new company is competing with virtually all our clients,''
one banker said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest problem is compensation. Salomon
relationship bankers say they often make two or three times as much
money each year as their Citibank counterparts _ a disparity that
becomes more glaring as the two gain the right to offer clients the
same full line of Citigroup banking products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some rival bankers see compensation as the weak link
when commercial banks are merged with investment banks. ``No one
has ever resolved this puzzle: How do you have high-priced bankers
selling low-margin products, and ordinary bankers selling M&AMP;A
advice?'' asked one executive at a competing bank. ``It looks good
on paper but it blows up when bonuses are paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials said they would resolve this issue as it
arose, but downplayed its significance. ``If we are generating big
new fees,'' one said, ``how to divide them is a luxury.''

   BAGHDAD _ When the first blast thudded against the windows of
this kabob restaurant at about 10 p.m. Thursday, a young bow-tied
waiter ran to open the front door _ just what Iraqis recommend to
protect a building against shockwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Diners at the Al Meelad (it means ``The Birthday'') walked out
to view a fireworks show of anti-aircraft fire and a plume of smoke
from a nearby high-rise. But they soon returned to their meals, and
the waiter hurried back to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, U.S. missiles and Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries periodically lit up the sky above this
battered capital. But Iraqis, in a mixture of defiance and
helplessness, kept to their routines. They took walks with their
families and celebrated weddings.
</P>
<P>
   During the first visible exchange of fire Thursday, a cook came
out from behind his counter to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become very normal to us,'' said Ali Al Dhahab, a
26-year-old who stood on the sidewalk in his yellow paper hat and
fry-cook uniform. ``We wish it would end soon. Sometimes we feel
afraid for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he would work several more hours anyway. ``Whether I go
home or stay here, it's the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 a.m., the firing was still sporadic, though air raid sirens
wailed frequently. This would be another sleepless night for the 5
million residents of Baghdad, but it was unclear if the barrage
would be as bad as the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic moment had been a strike on what were said to
be offices of Iraq's military industries. A direct hit sent a ball
of flame shooting from the top of the downtown building. Somehow,
the electricity stayed on. But the blast blew out several ground
floor windows of the Al Rashid Hotel a few hundred yards away, home
to most of the foreign journalists in town.
</P>
<P>
   The quick air strikes were followed by excruciatingly long
periods of quiet. And the evening was filled with incongruous
images of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The city is flat and dotted with palm trees, somewhat
reminiscent of coastal South Florida but with scores of billboards
and murals glorifying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. It could be a
pretty city, but eight years of crippling economic sanctions have
left its buildings and cars run down. And anti-aircraft guns can
occasionally be seen on rooftops or trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night there were fewer cars than usual on the wide
avenues, where diners ate seafood at restaurants along the banks of
the Tigris River, or bellied up to counters for ice cream, the
favorite Iraqi treat.
</P>
<P>
   People carried on with an almost eerie disinterest in the
explosive events around them. When asked to explain, they cited the
bloody 1980-1988 war against Iran and the 45-day assault in the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iraqis have faced U.S. air strikes in September 1996
and twice in 1993. They have also endured several threatening U.S.
military build-ups aimed at containing the weapons-making ability
of their renegade leader. Iraqis tell their stories with a mix of
resignation and defiance _ a sort of you-can't-scare-me-anymore
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Even as more air strikes were expected, people stopped to gaze
at a four-foot-deep, 10-yard-wide crater in a road in a busy
shopping district, the result of a missile that landed the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   The blast cut a major water line, disrupting service to more
than 2 million residents, according to Faris Alasam,
director-general of the city water department.
</P>
<P>
   An earth mover worked in the dark to fill the hole while about
50 people looked on from the muddied street. Iraqi Health Minister
Omed Medhat Mubarak said as a many as 30 people were killed, and 75
injured from the two rounds of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Postal worker Abdul Kareem said his six-year-old daughter, Asra,
woke up when the missile landed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked, 'Why does the United States attack us,' `` said the
40-year-old father, ``I told her that they hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hate was the subject on this street corner, it was
love that was in the air in the posh Mansour Hotel, where couples
arrived in suits and bridal gowns for wedding celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   One couple, in particular, said their separate men's and women's
parties Wednesday night, traditional in Muslim weddings, were
played out to the noise of missile explosions. But, they were not
about to reschedule their nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy tonight, and we hope that all the Iraqi youth
will marry and challenge the United States,'' said 29-year-old
groom Ahyee Khazal.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon said Thursday that American and
British attack jets battered military, intelligence and
communications targets across Iraq for a second day but carefully
avoided hitting commercial plants that might produce chemical or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors to determine whether it
had destroyed its stocks of those weapons led to President
Clinton's order on Wednesday to begin the air assault.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon said Thursday that although the elimination of
chemical and biological weapons was the ultimate aim of the United
States, the strikes avoided those plants for fear of unleashing
deadly plumes of poisons and causing civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes, which resumed Thursday night after a daytime lull,
were inflicting significant damage to Iraq's air defenses,
intelligence and security headquarters and barracks belonging to
the elite Republican Guards, according to an early assessment
offered at the Pentagon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, who appeared at the
Pentagon with Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said the United States did not intend to destroy
suspected weapons factories that might also make benign commercial
products, even though those plants could be essential to the covert
development of chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to take a chance and try to target any
facility that would release any kind of horrific damage to innocent
people,'' Cohen said earlier on NBC's ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks underscored the fact that even three or four
days of heavy attacks _ as Pentagon planners now envision _ would
not be enough to destroy Iraq's ability to produce even small
amounts of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Having conceded that, Cohen and Shelton outlined a mission with
the objective of weakening Saddam's government and military,
including missile sites and military bases central to launching
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no illusions of how difficult it is'' to destroy
chemical or biological weapons production, Cohen said at the
Pentagon. ``We intend to focus on the military aspects of his
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   To that extent, the first wave of strikes appeared to succeed,
officials said. Nearly 250 cruise missiles launched from seven
warships and a submarine in the Persian Gulf _ followed up by 40
attacks by fighter jets launched from the aircraft carrier
Enterprise _ struck more than 50 targets in the first day of the
attack, Shelton announced.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton unveiled satellite photographs showing extensive damage
to two targets in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad: the military
intelligence headquarters and barracks belonging to Republican
Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building right here,'' Shelton said, pointing to a
photograph of the intelligence building, ``you'll notice down here
there's nothing left but rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Air force bombers and fighters _ including B-52s armed with more
powerful cruise missiles _ and British attack jets based in Kuwait
joined in the assault for the first time just as dusk fell in
Baghdad.

 WASHINGTON: in Baghdad. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Iraqi capital, sirens again sounded and anti-aircraft
fire speckled the dark with flashes and bursts. Afterward loud
explosions reverberated throughout the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf said the attacks
struck civilian areas of Baghdad and inflicted heavy casualties. He
described damage at several targets, including a factory producing
batteries and several Government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strikes also damaged a palace belonging to Saddam's
daughter, Hala, who was uninjured, officials said. ``The last time
I checked, Saddam had something like 80 palaces,'' Cohen said when
asked whether the strikes were deliberately aimed at Saddam or his
family.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon offered few details of the strikes, officials
said that nearly 100 missiles, each with 2,000-pound warheads,
struck targets in Iraq Thursday. They said they were fired by B-52s
based on the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Other American and British pilots flew deep into Iraq on
Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday night, after two days and dozens of strikes, no
American or British pilot had been killed, the Pentagon said. Cohen
and other officials said they had no clear sense of Iraqi
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bursts of anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad, few of the
fighter jets involved encountered significant challenges from
surface-to-air missiles, though most of the aircraft flew high
enough to avoid low-level threats.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said the initial cruise missile strikes succeeded
in striking their first targets: Iraq's air defenses, especially in
the southern half of the country. ``The cruise missiles softened
things up pretty well,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The first strikes, launched without warning less than a day
after the chief U.N. weapons inspector accused Iraq of violating
its pledges to cooperate with inspections, apparently caught the
Iraqi defense forces by surprise, leaving little time for deploying
troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were not without errors. At least a half-dozen of
the Navy's Tomahawk cruise missiles misfired and never made it to
their targets. Iran protested that at least one cruise missile
landed in its territory, near the border town of Khorramshahr.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks Thursday continued through the night. The heavier cruise
missiles launched from the B-52s _ with their 2,000-pound warheads
able to penetrate thick layers of concrete _ were aimed at more
heavily fortified targets in Baghdad, including underground bunkers
used by the Iraqi military and political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton said the objective was to erode Saddam's
ability to threaten attacks against neighboring countries _ like
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or Israel. With the Clinton administration now
advocating the overthrow of Saddam, Shelton conceded that anything
that weakened his grip on power ``would be value added.''

BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR EMBATTLED PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He stands where no American president has been
before _ on the field of battle and the precipice of impeachment.
Yet, Thursday President Clinton hardly seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   As with many of his days, there were phone calls and meetings
about matters of state, capped off by a black-tie gala at the White
House that featured no shortage of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment and Iraq converged on the White House for the
second day in a row, Clinton left one to his aides while he spent
his energy working on the other.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, aides, and supporters
began working the phones in a last-ditch effort to argue his case
against impeachment, Clinton focused on doing his job rather than
trying to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Though the White House had suspended its efforts against
impeachment for 24 hours after the United States and Britian began
bombing Iraq Wednesday, the battle was renewed Thursday. Aides
seemed in no mood to give up, even if the boss had all but done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the view of the great philosopher Yogi Berra, it's not
over till it's over,'' said White House press secretary Joseph
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, according to his aides and advisers, has resigned
himself to accepting whatever decision the House renders on
impeachment this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They described the president as stoic, even philosophical, about
the possibility of impeachment. And sensing there is little he can
do personally to get Republicans to vote with him, he has turned
his focus to, among other matters, carrying out the bombing against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton met with his national security team to get an
assessment on the damage in Iraq, and made a series of phone calls
to foreign and congressional leaders to update them.
</P>
<P>
   He later met with his economic advisers to work out details of
the 1999 federal budget. Then Thursday night he and Mrs. Clinton
hosted a black-tie gala honoring the Special Olympics' 30th
anniversary under a stadium-sized, heated pavilion on the South
Lawn with guests that were to include Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy
Chapman and Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the over 30 years that I've know him, there is nobody that
I know better able to compartmentalize issues and problems than
Bill Clinton,'' said Lanny Davis, former White House special
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can totally focus his mind and his energy on one problem
even though swirling around him are five other problems that need
his attention,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Lockhart ticked off the big issues that
Clinton has had to confront this week: the looming impeachment
vote, the missile strike against Iraq, peace negotiations in the
Middle East. The president returned late Tuesday after a four-day
trip to that region to find many Republicans in Congress whom he
had counted on to vote against impeachment saying they now planned
to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an understatement to say the president has been
tested over the last week,'' Lockhart said. ``What you can see and
what he's demonstrated is he's up to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq has been second-guessed by his
critics, and Thursday the president defended the timing of the
decision, coming as it did on the eve of the originally scheduled
House impeachment vote, which had been set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meeting in the Oval Office Thursday morning with Vice
President Al Gore and other top security advisers, denied that the
bombing was a diversionary tactic to delay the vote, as some of his
critics have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any serious person would believe that any
president would do such a thing,'' said a weary-looking Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To believe that, he said, would require accepting complicity on
the part of Defense Secretary William Cohen and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, General H. Huge Shelton, and his other
national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any reasonably astute person in Washington
would believe that,'' he said. ``This was the right thing for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, Clinton's former aide, vouched for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absurdity of the charge strikes those of us who are
supporting President Clinton as simply further proof of the
mean-spiritedness and partisanship of this process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Clinton, contrary to some reports, was not
consumed with being impeached. ``Some of us would like him to be
more consumed,'' he said. ``He is more philosophical and more
concerned about his own personal healing and closure and family
isses than he is about his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said impeachment was a problem of Clinton's own making
that he cannot now control, unlike the situation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Clinton's resiliency under pressure that makes it hard
to count him out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real counterpuncher and he does come off the matt,''
Hess said. ``But every time he seems to be up and doing well, he
slips.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I fully expect he will limp across the finish
line.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans walked a fine line Thursday
between saluting the patriotism and sacrifice of U.S. troops and
voicing their distrust of President Clinton's Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question _ Democrat, Republican, liberal, moderate,
conservative stands in unequivocal support of our troops in the
Persian Gulf,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the House
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House overwhelmingly voiced official support for the troops
in combat, but the Republicans argued that the Clinton
administration's air offensive against Iraq did not go far enough
and should include the ouster of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said, ``I implore the administration not to be satisfied
with the interim result of containment, but rather to work toward
dismantling Saddam Hussein's destructive regime; otherwise we will
be doing this again.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Congress approved a bill that Clinton signed,
providing up to $97 million in military aid for opposition groups
supporting Saddam's removal. But Republican leaders have criticized
the Pentagon and State Department for not disbursing the money fast
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of support for the troops was approved, 417-5.
Three Democrats voted against the measure: John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, Barbara Lee of California and Cynthia McKinney of
Georgia. Two Republicans opposed it, Ron Paul of Texas and Mark
Sanford of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers had different reasons for voting no. Sanford, for
example, said there were ``too many red flags around the timing of
this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the U.S.-led air strikes, the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, contended he was merely
questioning why the president had not bombed Iraq sooner, when he
said on Wednesday that he doubted the official assurance that
``there is no connection with the impeachment process'' and the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the speaker-designate,
opened nearly four hours of floor debate on the Iraq resolution
Thursday by calling on the man he replaced, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has to lead,'' said Gingrich, adding that
administration officials fully consulted him and Livingston before
the strikes. ``There is no other country capable of organizing
against an Iraqi dictator who wants to get weapons of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans voiced support for the bombing, arguing that
it was essential to punish Iraq for violating U.N. resolutions and
for trying to take advantage of the domestic uproar over
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not permit Saddam Hussein to defy the U.N. Security
Council,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But other House Republicans criticized the aerial bombardment as
insufficient to topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that our military action against Iraq attacks
only the symptoms of the problem rather than the problem itself,''
said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who heads the House National
Security Committee. ``The root cause of our problem with Iraq is
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as Clinton's national security advisers briefed
senators on the Iraq operation, many Republicans still harbored
doubts about the timing. ``The fact that there is skepticism about
the timing of these attacks reminds us that America should always
have a president whose motives are unassailable,'' said Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Democrats lobbed counterattacks against the
president's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said: ``To my colleagues who have
questioned the president's motive in the midst of this crisis, I
say shame on you. Shame on you for playing into the hands of
Saddam, who clearly staged his latest act of defiance to coincide
with the impeachment process.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans raised the ghosts of Watergate
and Vietnam on Thursday to justify their decision to move ahead
with the impeachment debate on Friday in the face of Democratic
protests and continuing U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, extraordinarily bitter day that seemed to
relive the cultural wars of the 1960s and 1970s and a
quarter-century of grudges between the two political parties.
Democrats vehemently condemned the Republicans' plans, announced on
Thursday, to return to the impeachment of President Clinton without
waiting for the military action to conclude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way protecting the interests of the people
of the United States,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, said on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said that the House should consider how ``Saddam
Hussein will receive the idea and information that while he is
under physical attack from the United States and its people, we are
having a debate in our House of Representatives to remove the
commander in chief from his office.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Republicans eager to push forward with impeachment,
Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, whom Republicans have
chosen as the next House speaker, said, ``There's no way to know
when the troops will have completed their mission.'' He added, ``We
cannot anticipate what Saddam Hussein will do, and yet we cannot
refrain from advancing the people's business on this critical
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first floor speech since he was chosen to be speaker,
Livingston looked back to the Watergate scandal. He said that
impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon began when ``troops,
American troops were deployed in the field in Vietnam and yet the
Democrat Congress at the time undertook the responsibility of
impeaching Richard Nixon.'' In fact, however, the last American
combat troops left Vietnam on March 29, 1973, and Democratic
leaders first asked the Judiciary Committee to look into
impeachment nearly seven months later, on Oct. 22, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The battle on the House floor, amplified in a series of
competing news conferences across the day, set the stage for the
first House debate on impeaching a president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats now say that Clinton will be impeached, after a
stream of moderate Republicans came out against him in recent days.
On Thursday, Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., said that she too would
vote for impeachment. ``I was looking for an explanation, a
rebuttal of the facts, some justification to spare the country from
impeachment,'' she said. ``I could not find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., a Republican, said ``Are all
Americans, including the president of the United States equal
before the law? My answer to that question is yes and so I will be
voting for the articles of impeachment of President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats all but conceded that Clinton was now going to face a
Senate trial. Rep. Jim MOran, D-Va., said that he expected two of
the four articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary
Committee to pass and he thought that about six Democrats would
vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty bad,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who
has been one of the stalwarts in the Judiciary Committee against
impeachment. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the only thing she
could conceive of that could stop impeachment now ``is if Saddam
Hussein is taken out this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if they were resigned to Clinton's impeachment, the
Democrats fought the Republican plan to move ahead while air
strikes continue in Iraq. They rebuffed a proposal by Livingston
for 16 to 18 hours of debate beginning Friday and ending in votes
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look down on any activity of this body to go forward
with impeachment while American men and women are engaged in armed
conflict,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House
minority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said of Livingston, ''I think he's a fool to proceed in
spite of all this and to go ahead while we're still striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the House, the impeachment articles are a
``privileged resolution'' entitled to one hour of debate, unless
both parties agree to extend the time period and no one objects.
Republican leaders were still looking on Thursday night at
parliamentary ways to extend the debate hour by hour if the
Democrats would not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that Clinton had timed the air strikes against Iraq
to stop the impeachment proceedings, Republicans on Thursday argued
that impeachment would not weaken Clinton any further and said that
the men and women in the armed services would not be affected.
``That ladies and gentlemen is why our democracy is so wonderful,''
said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. ``As we
engage in conflict, democracy does not stop in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Irritated at being the ones accused of failing to show support
for the military, the Republicans also tried to relive the party
divisions over past wars in the Persian Gulf and in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, they showcased several of their members
who served in Vietnam to rebut the Democrats. ``When we were over
there the thing that demoralized us wasn't the fact that Congress
was doing its work,''said Rep. Joseph R. Pitts, a Pennsylvania
Republican who served in the Air Force from 1963 to 1969. ``The
things that disturbed us were the protesters like Jane Fonda and
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., who had a 22-year career in the
military, said, ``When I was in Vietnam and coming down in a
parachute, I didn't give a rat's rear what Congress did.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, who had questioned the president's timing as the air
strikes were announced, criticized Democrats for circulating
statements he had made dating to the Persian Gulf War in 1991,
supporting attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the vote in the House and the Senate on Desert
Storm, I don't believe there was a single Democrat that voted for
it,'' Lott said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott later said that he was wrong. In fact, 10
Democrats in the Senate and 86 in the House supported the Gulf War
resolution.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On another day of surreal split-screen frenzy in
the capital, the Republicans in the House of Representatives
decided Thursday to begin debate on the impeachment of President
Clinton on Friday, when American warplanes will presumably be
preparing for further raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An uproar over the timing of the impeachment debate broke out on
the House floor Thursday afternoon while television screens outside
were aglow with ghostly green images of bombs and missiles
exploding in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no sign that any House Republicans were wavering
on impeachment _ indeed, several more undecided Republicans said
they would vote for impeachment _ it was evident that the party
leadership had been thrown off stride by the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's strategists conceded that the struggle in the
House had been lost and turned grimly to the task of preparing for
a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also faced bitter criticism on the diplomatic front from
a handful of foreign countries, notably Russia and China, for
resorting to force. The Russians recalled their ambassador from
Washington in protest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected strenuously to moving ahead with impeachment
while the bombing campaign was under way. It is expected to end by
this weekend, a White House official said, when the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan starts.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said debate
would begin at 9 a.m. Friday, with voting on the four articles of
impeachment running into Saturday. No change was conceded by the
Republicans, but discussions about the timetable and the rules,
especially the one governing the time to be allotted for debate,
continued deep into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some significant change, the stage was set for the
spectacle of a House vote on impeachment, only the second in 130
years, taking place while American military planes were flying over
hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to complete this mission,'' Clinton vowed as allied
bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and other parts of Iraq
with a second wave of punishing airstrikes. Reports from the scene
said that explosions in the capital were louder and more percussive
than those in the first wave on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of casualties among American pilots, but
Clinton acknowledged that Iraqi civilian casualties were
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes red and puffy with fatigue, the president forcefully
but without visible rancor rejected suggestions from senior
Republicans that he had ordered the strikes to dissipate momentum
towards impeachment. ``I don't think any serious person would
believe that any president would do such a thing,'' Clinton
commented just before a briefing in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The president was told at the briefing, and reporters were later
informed, that the first volley of more than 200 unmanned cruise
missiles, launched from ships in the Persian Gulf at some 50
targets, had leveled President Saddam Hussein's military
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks of security guards at
weapons sites. But Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, conceded that other strikes were ``not as
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at an aerial photo of one of Iraq's special security
brigade headquarters, Shelton said, ``You don't see anything but
rubble in what was formerly this building.''
</P>
<P>
   The second wave on Thursday, which included British Tornado
bombers for the first time, sent more cruise missiles deep into
Iraq while navy planes with laser-guided bombs went after Iraqi
air-defense sites along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, China and Russia all called for an immediate end to the
attacks, but a divided U.N. Security Council took no further
action. France, whose initial reaction was rather negative, seemed
to be softening somewhat after President Jacques Chirac had what
his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, called ``a good conversation''
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, responsibility lies clearly with the Iraqi
president,'' Chirac said in a subsequent statement. ``The main
point is to settle problems that, without a doubt, will not be
settled by airstrikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four national polls taken Wednesday evening after the bombing
began indicated that the American public overwhelmingly supports
the military action in Iraq and accepts Clinton's explanations of
its timing and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   However, a significant fraction of those who support
impeachment, a relatively small minority of the population in
itself, believes that the imminence of a House vote may have
affected the timing of the raids in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans who sharply questioned the honesty of
Clinton's justification of the raids on Wednesday pulled back on
Thursday, though none apologized. Notable in this group was former
Secretary of State Lawrence F. Eagleburger, who said after a
meeting with the present holder of that job, Madeleine Albright,
that he would mute his language in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism from both parties, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, backed away from his charge that the strikes were
linked to impeachment. After overnight reflection, he said, ``I am
satisfied this was a military decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN, Lott also confirmed that the Senate
would open a trial of the president if any of the articles of
impeachment were approved, and he said there would be no deals to
cut it short, as a number of Democrats have proposed recently.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of Republican senators, including John McCain of
Arizona, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, John W. Warner of Virginia
and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, voiced support of the
president's decision to strike now. All are prominent party
spokesmen on defense and foreign policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the party worried that proceeding with the impeachment
debate and vote might backfire on the speaker-elect, Rep. Robert L.
Livingston of Louisiana, just as closing down the federal
government a few years ago came to haunt the outgoing speaker, Newt
Gingrich. A Republican senator deeply involved with foreign policy
said, ``It is Bob's call, of course, but he had better watch
carefully where he treads.''
</P>
<P>
   The political future of Livingston himself was called into
question on Thursday when, after being informed that a disclosure
was imminent, he admitted to extramarital indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in what may have been his last speech as speaker, told
the House: ``No matter what our debates at home, we are as a nation
prepared to lead the world.'' Later, the House voted 417-5 in favor
of a resolution expressing support for U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against an impeachment debate now, Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., the House minority leader, said it could be ``misperceived
as a sign of disunity'' by Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Lee Hamilton, a widely respected Indiana Democrat,
said it was ``unwise to weaken the president'' at a time when a new
invasion of Kuwait, a missile assault on Israel or a peace
initiative might be triggered by the allied air raids.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey quoted the president himself in rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the White House Thursday morning whether his authority
would be undercut by an impeachment vote, Clinton said: ``No. I'm
going to complete this mission, we're going to complete this
mission. The Republican leadership have to decide how to do their
job. That's not for me to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote of support for Clinton came from former President Jimmy
Carter. Though a Democrat, he has never been particularly close to
Clinton, and he has said little about the prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, he said in a statement issued in Atlanta
that charges that the president had launched the attacks ``for
political purposes are both unjust and ill-advised.''
</P>
<P>
   As Saddam visited sites struck by allied missiles, including the
home of the youngest of his three daughters, Clinton talked by
telephone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of
Jordan and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as well as
Chirac, searching for support.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she had called officials in more than 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Russians and the Chinese demanded the
resignation of Richard Butler, the head of the U.N. inspection team
in Iraq, whose report triggered the American attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said the United States would ``fight for him,'' and
Butler defended his report as ``factual, clear, objective and
honest.'' No one had orchestrated it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sought to squelch any
suggestions that Saddam or any members of his family were the
targets of American weapons. ``We are targeting military or
militarily related targets, period,'' the secretary declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that it was sending reinforcements to the
gulf, including 10 F-117 Stealth fighters, Patriot antimissile
units and troops. Military police, communications specialists and
Special Forces are among those to be rushed to the area. More than
3,000 other troops are already on hand in Kuwait in case Saddam
should decide to strike back there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, meanwhile, security was tightened at airports, the
Capitol and other federal buildings, to guard against any
retaliatory terrorist attacks. Up to 40 U.S. embassies were closed
by the State department for two days for the same reason, officials
said.

MARKET GIVES EVENTS A `BEEN THERE, DONE THAT' SHRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When economically tiny Russia defaulted on its
foreign debt last August, world financial markets came close to
collapse. But now that economically gigantic America is bombing
Iraq and apparently about to impeach President Clinton, markets are
rallying. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   Asked that question Thursday, investment professionals conceded
that the placid response of financial markets to the recent
upheavals is puzzling. Most traced it to a combination of investor
weariness after a year of sharp ups and downs, and to a conviction
that, absent unexpected catacylsm, events in Washington and Baghdad
no longer matter as much to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets react to things they've never seen before,'' said Greg
A. Smith, chief investment strategist for Prudential Securities in
New York. ``But we've had a Gulf War, we've had an impeachment,''
Richard Nixon's, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been there, done that,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, behind Wall Street's complacency are signs of deep
confusion, especially about impeachment, a confusion that some
analysts warn could be dangerous if investors suddenly decide that
the possibility of President Clinton's departure from office
matters after all.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it appears that Wall Street is not paying much
attention to the unfolding drama in Washington, D.C. For example,
one chief strategist for a major investment house said she thought
the House would be allowed to vote on a censure resolution against
Clinton though House leaders are adamant they will permit no such
vote. Another investment professional seemed thunderstruck by the
idea that a Senate trial of the president could set off such an
outcry that Clinton could no longer govern and might be forced to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no different than anybody else. Denial runs deep on this
impeachment issue,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a very tough reality check'' if the House
actually votes to impeach the president in the next few days, Roach
added. ``The markets are neither prepared nor priced for an
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Wall Street and Washington are always out of
sync. What one considers historic, the other often treats as
trivial. But in the natural course of things, one would have
expected stock prices to fall in recent days because of uncertainty
over Clinton. And one would have thought that the price of
commodities like oil would rise because of worries a US attack on
Iraq could reduce supply.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the opposite has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.22 points, or 1
percent, Thursday, to close at 8875.82. The broader Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index went up 18.02 points, or an even greater 1.6
percent, to close at 1179.96. And perhaps most surprising, oil
prices fell 11 percent to some of their lowest levels in a dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some markets have behaved as expected. The US
dollar, for example, slid in trading Thursday against the German
mark and the Japanese yen as foreign investors grew increasingly
concerned about what a Clinton impeachment might mean for the value
of their holdings. And the stock market is off almost 5 percent
from its record highs of three weeks ago, a decline some analysts
said is partially attributable to growing nervousness about
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors' reaction so far has been drastically different
than the last time they confronted war and impeachment. In 1974,
for example, the Dow tumbled almost 20 percent between late July
and the days immediately following Nixon's resignation in August.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there were several reasons behind the market's
blase attitude toward the impeachment and Iraq crises:
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's impeachment and Iraq's intransigence are only some
of the issues with which the market has been trying to deal, and
recent news from others areas has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been particularly worried that the economy is
slowing and corporate profits, which had been growing steadily, are
stalling. But recent statistics suggest that far from slowing, the
economy is still barreling along. And a string of companies have
said recently they will make even more than they were predicted to
make this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton doesn't oversee the nation's economic policy. Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
do. So the president's departure would not make that much
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton adminstration's economic policies are of trivial
consequence and have been for years,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief
economist of BankAmerica Corp. ``If Clinton were to disappear, the
markets might sigh. If Greenspan were to stub his toe, the markets
would go ballistic,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   --After a wild year like the one just finishing, money managers
have arranged their portfolios to lock in their gains and have
little interest in making changes.
</P>
<P>
   --Investors are so exhausted from the year's wild ride that they
simply are not paying attention. But they will have to shortly.
``We weren't prepared for the Asian crisis. We weren't prepared for
Russia. And we're not prepared for an impeachment,'' said Roach.

ATTACKS DEVASTATE KEY ELEMENTS OF SADDAM'S FORCES, SAY PENTAGON
OFFICIALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials said Thursday that the first
wave of attacks on Iraq knocked out key elements of Saddam
Hussein's air defense system and military command structure.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 50 targets hit by Tomahawk cruise missiles
launched from ships in the Persian Gulf and from U.S. and British
warplanes were Saddam's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad and
facilities housing his Republican Guard troops and secret security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
four out of five barracks buildings where some of Saddam's most
loyal troops may have been sleeping were completely destroyed and
that the intelligence headquarters had been reduced to ``rubble.''
He could not say, however, whether any of Saddam's troops had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, pointing to satellite photos of the destroyed
buildings, said the targets were just a few of the more than 50
that were hit over the course of the initial U.S.-British attack
that began at about 5 p.m. EST Wednesday and continued for about 4
1/2 hours. He said suspected weapons sites, air fields, air defense
systems and other military targets had been hit as well in the
strikes involving more than 200 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen also emphasized that U.S. and
British forces involved in the operation, dubbed Desert Fox, had
sustained no casualties. He said the crews of about 70 aircraft
involved in the first assault had returned safely to the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Persian Gulf or to nearby allied land
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no American casualties, and we are achieving
good coverage of our targets. And as a result we are advancing our
goal of containing Saddam Hussein,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the goal of the operations is to
``significantly degrade'' Saddam's ability to threaten his other
Middle East states and build weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are diminishing his ability to attack his neighbors _
either conventionally or with weapons of mass destruction,'' Cohen
said.

EDITORIAL: WAR AT HOME AND ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   At a time when its members would normally be in holiday recess,
Congress is wrestling with its two most solemn responsibilities _
whether to impeach the president and whether to support his
decision to send American troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats made a strong case against starting the impeachment
debate while American forces are attacking Iraq. But in discussing
that issue, the Democrats were also playing to an emerging theme in
popular opinion that the impeachment process is being guided by
Republican muscle rather than sober judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about this whole process that shows a lack
of judgment, a lack of proportionality, a lack of common sense,''
warned the Democratic whip, David Bonior of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans as eminent as Gerald Ford and Bob Dole favor
censure, Bonior asked, why was the House limited to a yes-no vote
on impeachment? The answer, of course, is that the incoming
speaker, Robert Livingston, and his whip, Tom DeLay, were certain
they could win an impeachment vote. They will be counting votes on
Friday to see if Livingston's confession of marital infidelity has
weakened their hold on Republican moderates who might fear that
voting against Clinton would look hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the headlong rush toward an impeachment that is
opposed by the public has made this a time in Washington unlike any
other in living memory. Even at the depths of Watergate, there was
a sense of strong hands reaching for the rudder that President
Nixon had relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   But at this crucial moment, the capital lacks two ingredients
that are essential to the steady guidance of a government designed
around checks and balances among coequal branches. One is the
emergence of leaders capable of growth in the midst of crisis. The
other is a shared commitment to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   To look for those qualities in the new GOP is to understand that
Ford and Dole, with their urgings toward bipartisan censure, are
dinosaurs. The voters in the Sun Belt congressional districts that
now control the House Republican Conference do not elect
compromisers. At the same time that the GOP devalued compromise,
the Democrats have been hobbled by congressional losses and a
vitiated president.
</P>
<P>
   In this chaotic atmosphere, events are being shaped by the
Republicans' hunger for maximum partisan advantage rather than the
best outcome for the country. The strategy of the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, seems to envision using the Senate trial to
drive President Clinton toward resignation if impeachment passes
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest thinking in the Republican Party is coming from two
New Yorkers, Reps. Amo Houghton and Peter King. On Thursday they
introduced a censure resolution noting that Clinton ``lied under
oath.'' Clinton now seems willing to consider that essential
language, but as is typical of his every action since his landmark
falsehoods of Aug. 17, he has waited too long to make a saving
move.
</P>
<P>
   The public has defined the correct punishment for Clinton. It
wants a condemnation occupying the serious space between a vengeful
Republican leadership and those mindless speakers at
anti-impeachment rallies who see the president as a victim of bad
dating etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Although we have called for swift completion of the
constitutional process, we think Livingston is mistaken to conduct
the impeachment during combat operations in Iraq. He is even more
mistaken to exclude the only resolution that fulfills justice and
the public will.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tree is a sermon in itself. A big, sturdy oak
with serpentine limbs, it's the first thing the audience sees in
``Parade,'' the solemn, high-reaching new musical directed by
Harold Prince that opened Thursday night at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The oak's branches glow, in sinister abstraction, through a
scrim before a single note is sung, and it will be a dominant
presence throughout the evening, casting a metaphoric shadow that
is both premonitory and admonitory. A man, a good man, will be
hanged from that tree before ``Parade'' is over. It is the image of
a brutally unfair fate awaiting its victim, and we are never, ever
allowed to forget what it signifies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we would have anyway. One thing ``Parade'' cannot be
accused of is fuzziness of focus. Inspired by the story of Leo
Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched in Marietta, Ga., in 1915 for
the murder of a 13-year-old girl, this musical provides a
painstakingly rendered chart of the wheels of injustice. And it
never lets up in its insistence on the innocence, on several
levels, of its protagonist and the moral blindness and corruption
of his persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   That the result is often more podium-thumping screed than
compelling story is in itself a heartbreaker. ``Parade'' prompted
raised eyebrows and arch jokes (have you heard the one about the
dancing lynch mob?) long before it went into previews, and the
involvement of Livent Inc., the financially ailing Canadian-based
theatrical company, as one of its producers only added to the air
of gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Parade'' also represented the possibility of answered
prayers for anxious lovers of the American musical. The genre,
after all, is represented this season in new productions on
Broadway only by the flaccid ``Footloose'' and the revivals of
``Peter Pan'' and ``On the Town,'' and this is by no means an
atypical season.
</P>
<P>
   Here at last was a show of daring aspiration, shaped by a young
composer of talent and invention, Jason Robert Brown, and a
Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright, Alfred Uhry (``Driving Miss
Daisy''). What's more, it was to be overseen by the director who
had done more than any other to extend the boundaries of the
Broadway musical and to confound expectations of what the form's
proper subject matter is.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Nazi party, a portrait of marital disharmony set
in the gloom of a decrepit show palace, the rise of a politician
and his ravenously ambitious wife in Argentina, a homicidal barber
in Victorian London: Prince repeatedly turned ostensibly sour
material into scintillating theater with his fabled productions of
``Cabaret'' (1966), ``Follies'' (1971), ``Evita'' (1978) and
``Sweeney Todd'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1993, he was still breathing hit-making musical
life into unlikely themes with ``The Kiss of the Spider Woman,''
the Kander-Ebb show about South American political prisoners that
joltingly juxtaposed cinematic fantasy sequences with scenes of
barbaric torture. Given this context, is ``Parade'' really such a
stretch, especially given the participation of its star, Brent
Carver, who appeared to such resonant effect in ``Spider Woman''?
</P>
<P>
   That Carver, through no fault of his own, is a far less
compelling presence here says much about what has gone wrong with
``Parade.'' As the gay, escapist story spinner forced into
political engagement in ``Spider Woman,'' this first-rate actor
guided his audiences through the labyrinth of one man's very
conflicted interior. The role of Leo Frank in ``Parade'' offers him
no such opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The character, a Jewish scapegoat in a blood-lusting Southern
society, is a martyr, pure and simple, a man whose worst crimes are
emotional reserve and fastidiousness. Carver renders these traits,
in both his singing and acting, with delicacy. But there's no
getting beyond the impression that his Leo is as flat and iconic as
a bleeding saint in a religious mural.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Carolee Carmello, who gives a stirringly
heartfelt performance as Leo's wife, Lucille, all of the actors in
``Parade'' appear claustrophobicly trapped in that mural. It is
sometimes hard to distinguish them from the two-dimensional cutout
figures used to fill out the crowd scenes in Riccardo Hernandez's
visually arresting but oddly distancing set, in which only vistas
of picturesque landscapes give off any warmth at all.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondingly, Brown's songs, while artfully shading classic
hymn and march forms with dark dissonance, also keep you at an
intellectual remove. He has a tendency to use martial drumbeats and
knell-like chords to underscore his melody lines, and the devices
give the effect of someone continually whispering in your ear:
``Look at what these people are doing to a blameless man. Just
look.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved with the creation of ``Parade,'' which
has been incubating for six years, have said that its real center
is the love story of the Franks, partners in a sterile arranged
marriage who finally fall in love during Leo's trial and
imprisonment. Yet in the performance, the balance of the show is
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's first act is devoted almost entirely to the
mechanics of framing Frank and the agitating of popular sentiment
against a social outsider by a yellow press. As a jaded journalist,
played by Evan Papas, sings, shortly after Leo's arrest, ``Take a
superstitious city and a little Jew from Brooklyn with a college
education and a mousy little wife.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the recipe, all right. From the beginning, both Uhry's
book and Brown's lyrics baldly set up Frank's status as an alien,
with references to his disdain for Southern cooking and tendency,
as a song lyric puts it, to say ``shalom'' instead of ``howdy.''
When Mary Phagan (the appealing Christy Carlson Romano), a teen-age
worker in the National Pencil Factory where Frank is a
superintendent, is found murdered in the factory's basement, the
police immediately fix an accusatory gaze on the exotic Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a streamlined railroading process of the sort that
has become common fodder for socially sensitive television movies
of the week. The expediency of pinning the crime on Leo is
established through a series of scenes in which blatantly corrupt
politicians say things like: ``You got a lousy conviction record,
Hughie. How long you think they're going to keep you in office if
you let this one off the hook?''
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Atlanta grow ever louder in their cries for
vengeance, goaded by a satanic newspaper publisher, Tom Watson
(John Leslie Wolfe), who is given to statements like ``Jesus was
not a Jew.'' An ambitious prosecuting attorney, Hugh Dorsey
(Herndon Lackey), is seen cutting a deal with a black factory
janitor with a prison record (Jim Conley, who brings some flair and
fire to the proceedings) to testify against Frank.
</P>
<P>
   When three young female factory employees show up in court to
speak of Frank's lascivious behavior toward them, you have no doubt
that they have been coached to lie, despite an all-too-brief
fantasy interlude in which Frank becomes the leering, worldly
figure of their testimony. (The vignette provides what is by far
the best work of Carver and the choreographer Patricia Birch in the
show.) As Lucille sings passionately to a reporter: ``He is a
decent man! He is an honest man!''
</P>
<P>
   As any number of Alfred Hitchcock movies confirm, ``wrong man''
plots, even rudimentary ones, can generate alarming levels of
suspense. But to do so, they have either to admit you, Kafka-style,
into the baffled, frightened mind of the persecuted or to sweep you
up into the frenzy of the persecutors, making you feel vicariously
implicated. That was the strategy of ``They Won't Forget,'' the
1937 Mervyn LeRoy film inspired by the same events.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Prince and Ms. Birch use the ensemble to create
tableaux of tidal waves of crowds, in ways that recall the mob
scenes in ``Evita,'' you never escape an overriding feeling of
disdain, a chilly indignation. Nor is Leo ever allowed to doubt
himself, to wonder (as most of us surely would) if he had somehow
gone mad. The shy Lucille is clearly tortured by the public
scrutiny of herself and her husband, but she also never seems to
wonder if her husband might indeed be guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmello nonetheless creates a vital and affecting portrait
of a sheltered woman thrust out into a harsh and dangerous world.
Made up and dressed to look a bit like Eleanor Roosevelt (the
period-appropriate costumes are by Judith Dolan), the actress' very
accent and vocal inflections bespeak both a heritage of Southern
Jewish gentility and a fluttery primness that never quite conceals
a yearning for a more fully lived life.
</P>
<P>
   The second act is mostly hers, as Lucille convinces Georgia's
governor, John Slaton (John Hickok), to reopen her husband's case.
Though much of what follows has the feeling of a historical
detective story, there is something infinitely touching about the
valiant hope that Ms. Carmello projects. In her climactic love
duet, during a conjugal visit to Leo in prison just before his
abduction and murder by a mob symbolically commanded by a
Confederate Civil War veteran, you suddenly feel you've been given
emotional entry to a show that has determinedly kept you outside of
it.
</P>
<P>
   That moment arrives too late. The death of Leo Frank may be an
unlikely subject for a musical, but that is not what sabotages
``Parade.'' Musicals can be grim and even grotesque as long as they
let you feel their heartbeat, the pulse that animates the behavior
onstage. You need only think of ``Sweeney Todd,'' which drew its
audience into improbable identification with its crazed, murderous
title character.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the odds are comparatively in favor of
``Parade.'' It arrives with an innately sympathetic hero,
undoubtedly worthy of our tears. But for those tears to flow, we
have to get to know Leo Frank as a man, not a symbol. The civics
lesson that is ``Parade'' forbids our ever approaching such
knowledge.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and British missiles tore at the heart of
Iraq's military and intelligence operations Thursday, pounding to
rubble more than 50 sites as the strikes rolled toward a third day
early Friday with no sign of let up.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials condemned the attacks, with Foreign Minister
Mohammed Said Al-Sahhaf lashing out at ''corrupt politicians,'' in
London and Washington he accused of using ''cheap lies,'' in order
''to have the pretext to commit aggression against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   With Iraqi defense systems, airfields, military barracks and
communications systems in the crosshairs, U.S. warships, fighter
jets and giant B-52 bombers launched scores of cruise missiles deep
into Iraq as an operation the Pentagon has dubbed ''Desert Fox,''
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the possibility that the attacks could continue through
the weekend, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday
that he does not regard the beginning of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan -- expected to begin on Saturday night -- as a deadline for
halting strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take whatever time is necessary to carry out the
operation,'' Cohen told reporters at a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to complete it as soon as we can without
restricting the military operation,'' Cohen said. ''But we're
sensitive to the Ramadan period and that's all I care to say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In early signs of success, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Gen. Hugh Shelton showed reporters at the briefing military
pictures of two key Baghdad sites -- a military intelligence
headquarters building and barracks for units of Iraq's elite
Republican Guard -- reduced to smoke and ash by multiple cruise
missile hits early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing left but rubble,'' Shelton told reporters, as
they looked on at a shot of what had been military intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad. Thursday's attack began about 11 a.m. EST
and lasted nearly twice as long as Wednesday's six-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton showed shots of the Republican Guard barracks in a
similar state, saying that ''four of the five barracks (targeted)
were destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the country, Shelton said, attacks were ''as
successful or more successful than this was, some of it not quite
as successful.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no U.S. or British casualties reported as of 9 p.m.
EST Thursday night, according National Security Advisor Samuel E.
``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that the Republican Guard units and the agents who
worked at the military intelligence unit in Baghdad were central to
Iraq's efforts to spy on and obstruct the work of United Nations
weapons inspectors in Iraq. The inspectors have been working there
to try to identify and dismantle Iraq's alleged chemical and
biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on air defenses were designed to make it safer for
piloted aircraft to strike deeper into Iraq in attacks that are
expected to continue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 51 combat aircraft from the United States, including F-117
Stealth fighters and F-15 fighters, were ordered to the gulf
Wednesday, along with a Navy carrier and 5,600 Army soldiers from
Georgia, Texas and New York. They will join the 24,000 troops
already in the region and are expected to arrive this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's Al-Sahhaf said the United States was unjustifiably
targeting sites that United Nations weapons inspectors had been
allowed to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference, he noted several that he said had been
hit. He said that some had cameras in place that monitored the
developments of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are examples to show what cheap liars the leaders of the
British and American regimes are,'' Al-Sahhaf said. ``They think
they can get away with their crimes by deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, there were lines at some gas stations Thursday as
residents stocked up on fuel in apparent anticipation of more air
strikes. But for the most part, there was a sense of normalcy in
the capital city of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said the two nights of
bombings had killed as many as 30 people and injured 75 others.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to obtain independent damage assessments.
Foreign reporters are not permitted to roam the city without
government escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton told reporters he had no regrets
about launching the attacks -- criticized by some of his political
opponents as being timed to somehow interfere with a looming
impeachment vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced the decision I made to order this military
action, though difficult, was absolutely the right thing to do,''
Clinton said in remarks before a White House meeting with his
national security team to discuss the ongoing strikes Thursday
morning. ''It is in our interest and in the interest of people all
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With the House set to open debate on four articles of
impeachment against him on Friday, and a vote set for Saturday,
Clinton said the proceedings would have no impact on Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to complete this mission,'' Clinton said. ''And
the Republican leadership have to decide how to do their job.
That's not for me to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. and British forces pressed the attacks, world reaction
to them was deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   Most NATO members generally backed the attacks, as did U.S.
Pacific allies Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the attacks, however,
warning that they could shatter regional stability. China and
France also called for immediate end to the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, Iran, which fought a 10-year war against Iraq
in the 1980s, denounced the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied West Bank
territories and Gaza protested the strikes, burning American flags
that, in Gaza at least, were waved in support of Clinton only
Monday, when he journeyed there to lend the aura of American
legitimacy to the cause of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqi officials began alleging that the strikes were killing
civilians, Cohen reiterated that the mission had been planned to
reduce such casualties, though he did not rule out further such
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are targeting military or militarily-related targets,
period,'' said Cohen. ''We are not attacking the people of Iraq.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has closed 38 embassies in Africa
for at least two days to protect employees against possible
terrorist reprisals for the American air strikes on Iraq,
administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the administration
was taking the highly unusual step of closing so many embassies
``because we are concerned about general threats and the heightened
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that two of the largest and
busiest American embassies, in South Africa and Nigeria, remained
open.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were hit by terrorist
bombs in August, were among those closed Thursday. Administration
officials said the 38 embassies were closed, in part, to avoid a
repetition of such attacks, which killed more than 250 people and
injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other embassies closed Thursday include those in Angola,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Several State Department officials expressed doubts about
whether it was necessary to close so many embassies. But a
spokeswoman for the department said: ``This action was carefully
considered. A number of African posts have received threats in
recent weeks, and our caution is fully justified in the current
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that, as a precaution, they had
instructed dependents of American diplomats to leave the American
embassies in Israel and Kuwait and the consulate in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were concerned that the dependents could
not be adequately protected if Iraq used chemical or biological
weapons in retaliation for the American air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At the American embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a spokeswoman
said, ``We haven't received any specific threat, but it is better
to be on guard and take precautions instead of having regrets
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Thursday that they had also ordered extra
security at government buildings here and at airports around the
United States. Additional police officers and guards were on duty
at the Capitol, and the General Services Administration said
security had been increased to a ``maximum state of alert'' at
federal buildings.

IN UPSTATE N.Y., VOTERS DISMISS A CONGRESSMAN'S REMARKS

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Amid the many voices skeptical about
the timing of the air strikes against Iraq, few were blunter or
quicker on the draw than that of Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House Rules Committee and the representative from
this gentle land of horse farms and mineral spas. ``Never
underestimate a desperate president,'' he declared, as cruise
missiles began to rain on Baghdad. ``It is obvious he is doing it
for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But as snow drizzled on the largely Republican Hudson Valley
Thursday, Solomon's constituents had an equally chilly reaction to
his claim. The combination of a reservoir of affection for the
president and an instinctive protectiveness for the nation's young
fighters seems to have put American cynicism at least temporarily
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's been warned and warned, and that's been going on a
lot longer than impeachment,'' said Kevin Clark, 30, a mail
processor. ``Clinton's had so much controversy that he's had to
learn to just push on with his job, and that's what he's doing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Howe, a retired candle-company worker who was folding
bedding at a coin laundry, said, ``It's the first thing that comes
into people's minds, but you have to stop and think.'' She went on
say that the president could not ignore the national interests
involved in Iraq just because of his problems back home.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon is leaving Congress at the end of the year, so he may
have felt free to speak more frankly than some of his colleagues.
But he was by no means alone among high-profile conservatives in
charging that there was no coincidence in Clinton's decision to
bomb Baghdad on the eve of an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several leading conservatives were amplifying the
charge, including Rush Limbaugh, who said on his radio show that
although he hated what he was saying and hated what he was
thinking, the military option ``has been a card in the back pocket
waiting to be played at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Saratoga Springs, that thinking was dismissed as overly
harsh and even dangerous. James Weingartner, a sales consultant who
was warming up with a big bowl of navy-bean soup at the Spa City
Diner, has voted for Solomon in the past but said he looked ``like
a little kid stomping his feet'' when he was talking about the
bombing. ``Our kids are over in the gulf,'' said Weingartner, who
is 49. ``If we can't stand behind our president when we're at war,
when can we?''
</P>
<P>
   At the counter, Roger Gaynor, a 77-year-old who served in World
War II, said that to accept the position that it was all politics
would be to accuse the entire chain of command of collusion. ``It's
a cheap shot at the military,'' he said. Gaynor said he always had
supported Solomon, but said now he wouldn't ``give him the
dogcatcher's vote.''
</P>
<P>
   However much they might disagree with Solomon's remarks, few
people here seemed to be surprised by them. Solomon, an
insurance-agency founder who rose to become New York's most
influential member of the House, has been a persistent critic of
the president's. He has championed such conservative causes as a
constitutional amendment that allowed the states to make it a crime
to desecrate the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   His district, New York's 22nd, stretches from Dutchess County
through Albany's suburbs and north to Lake Placid in the
Adirondacks. It has been heavily Republican since the late 19th
century and was reliably conservative when Solomon was first
elected in 1978. The views of voters there have become more
moderate since then, and the district backed Clinton in 1996 after
overwhelmingly rejecting him in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's successor, John Sweeney, is a Republican who is viewed
as more moderate; but Sweeney said he did not disagree with
Solomon's take on the timing of the air strikes. ``He said publicly
what a lot of people say privately,'' Sweeney said. ``This just
shows how much Bill Clinton has undermined the credibility of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the criticism of Solomon was predictable. Ken Klotz, a
college administrator who is chairman of the Saratoga Springs
Democratic Committee, said the comments ``undermine the credibility
of the nation at a time of high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But listen to John Nolan, the Saratoga County Republican
chairman, who said most party members in the area believe the
bombing was necessary. ``We are loyal and supportive of our
president when our friends and neighbors are in jeopardy,'' he
said. ``Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at us one too many
times.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Saratoga Springs, which locals call the home
of ``health, horses and history,'' it was tough to find anyone who
embraced Solomon's viewpoint. ``I think he got a little hot under
the collar, and his mouth was moving a little faster than his
brain,'' said Jim Karge, a librarian at the Sarasota Springs Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Abrams, 32, an investment adviser, said he doubted that
the bombing was a political plot, but said he could understand why
that view was likely to get plenty of attention in the days to
come. ``Mr. Solomon has a record of being very sincere,'' Abrams
said. ``President Clinton doesn't have sincerity on his side.''

   James Byrd's grave disturbed by vandals
   By Denise Gamino
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Vandals have disturbed the grave site of the
black man whose hideous dragging death behind a pickup inspired a
national outcry about racism in America.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-by-16-inch nameplate that adorned the grave of James Byrd
Jr. has been stolen from the Jasper city cemetery. The theft leaves
Byrd's grave unmarked and his family with more hurt to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Betty Boatner, one of Byrd's
sisters. ``Why take it? Why take it? Why take it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a hurting thing,'' she said. ``I just couldn't
understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show what people will do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows when the stainless steel plaque, attached with two
screws, was stolen from Byrd's casket vault. His family believes it
has been missing for more than a month because Boatner saw the
nameplate Nov. 10, but another relative who visited the cemetery
the next day doesn't recall seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was buried in the cemetery June 13, a week after he was
dragged by a pickup until he was beheaded. Three white men are
charged in the murder, which law officers call a racially motivated
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it wasn't done in meanness or hatred toward the grave.
It was done as someone trying to take something as a symbol of what
happened,'' said Jasper's incoming police chief, Stanley
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's cool to have this, but in actuality
they're just a common thief,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   The police department never received an official report about
the theft. Christopher said he did not learn of the missing
nameplate until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boatner said she had planned to file a police report, but time
got away from her. ``With the hurt and with everything else, I just
didn't do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The family has arranged to replace the nameplate and to fasten
it permanently with cement or solder.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in Jasper are aware that Byrd's grave has been
disturbed. But Booker T. Hunter, founder and president of the
Jasper NAACP, said he was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate. That's what it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Bartee, whose husband was a pallbearer at Byrd's funeral,
said no one should feel a need to take Byrd's nameplate for a
memento of the horrific murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go stealing that off the grave to remember
that,'' she said. ``You're going to remember it for the rest of
your life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting on early word from the chief weapons
inspector in Iraq, President Clinton set in motion Wednesday's
military strikes a full two days before the inspector formally
declared to the Security Council that Saddam Hussein was once again
in defiance of the U.N. inspection program, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president and senior administration officials said that
Clinton had not made the final decision to unleash a barrage of
missiles and bombs on targets across Iraq until Tuesday, hours
after receiving the report by Richard Butler, the weapons
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   But a full two days earlier, Butler had informed Clinton what he
intended to say in his report, and when he would say it. And the
president issued a highly classified order to the Pentagon on
Sunday morning that began a 72-hour countdown to the air assault.
Clinton was in Jerusalem on the first day of a whirlwind trip to
Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's report was delivered formally to the U.N. Security
Council and American officials as Clinton was flying home from the
Middle East on Tuesday. About two hours into the 10-hour flight
from Jerusalem to Washington, Clinton gave the order to U.S. forces
to be prepared to strike within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler's report was in many ways a simple formality.
Officials in New York and Washington said that there was little in
the Butler report that had not been available to American officials
days, even weeks, earlier. Military plans and hardware were already
in place for raids that could have come at any time after Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the strikes, coming on the eve of the impeachment
vote, set off protests from Republicans, who charged on Wednesday
that Clinton had orchestrated a crisis to slow the seemingly
inexorable momentum toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at the United Nations on Thursday, Butler
forcefully rejected suggestions from Republicans and others
skeptical of the timing of the bombing campaign that he had
tailored his report or the timing of its release to give Clinton a
pretext to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is utterly wrong,'' Butler said. He said he had always
planned to present his report to the Security Council on Monday or
Tuesday, and he said that plan had not been changed by pressure
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say as simply and plainly as I can,'' Butler said.
``That report was based on the experts of UNSCOM. It danced to no
one's tune. It was not written for anyone's purposes, for the
purposes of the United States, for example. It was my report, as
promised, on time, based on the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton in Israel through the weekend and the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan beginning on Saturday, the window for American and
British military action was very narrow, officials said. The
administration did not want to offend Arab allies, or put the
president's safety in jeopardy, by ordering an attack on Iraq while
Clinton was in Israel, a senior American official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not make the final decision to undertake military
action until after he had held a discussion aboard Air Force One
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a half-dozen members
of Congress who traveled with them to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Albright informed the members of Congress of Butler's latest
findings, saying the U.N. inspection group had presented a
clear-cut case of Iraqi defiance. Clinton asked the lawmakers for
their reactions. Although the question was not explicitly put to
them, Clinton was clearly seeking to gauge the political impact of
ordering American forces into action on the very eve of the
scheduled impeachment vote in the House, one of the lawmakers
present said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there could be no considerations other than the
national security of the United States and the safety of our
service personnel,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdensen, D-Conn., the ranking
minority member of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdensen said that one of the lawmakers told the president that
there was a danger that Congress and the public would
``misinterpret'' a decision to take military action against Iraq as
a means of diverting attention from Clinton's political peril.
</P>
<P>
   But the group concluded, and Clinton agreed, that that was a
risk that had to be borne.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to accounts from several participants in the decision
making that led to Wednesday's strike, Butler had briefed American
officials as early as last Friday on his most recent conclusions,
which were consistent with weekly reports he had been filing to the
U.N. for the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the administration was
prepared to act any time during the month of December, but chose to
await Butler's most recent report before making the final decision
to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been prepared to go during the month of
December, to take action,'' Cohen said. ``We were not going to take
any action until such time as a report was filed, we knew what was
said, and the president actually called for a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat involved in the U.N. deliberations said that there
were no surprises in Butler's latest report, nor in the rapid
American and British decision to launch air strikes. ``We were
conscious on Monday that we needed to be prepared for action when
Mr. Butler's report came out,'' this diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reconfirmed his decision to act at a meeting at the
White House early Wednesday morning. Military aides told the
president that he had to make a firm go/no-go call no later than 8
a.m. Conscious of the likely political fallout _ but unprepared for
the harsh condemnation from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
other Republicans who questioned the president's motives _ Clinton
began working on the address to the nation that he delivered
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 15-minute speech, he made a brief reference to
the impeachment debate raging in Washington, but said that domestic
politics would never weaken American resolve to act in its own
interests.

<P>
   TOKYO _ A North Korean vessel that intruded deep into South
Korea's waters was pursued and sunk Friday morning after a fire
fight with South Korean forces, South Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, whose incursion is sure to aggravate the already
strained relations between North Korea and the rest of the world,
was first detected late Thursday a mile from the city of Yosu on
South Korea's southern coast, the Defense Ministry said. After a
pursuit in which the North and South Korean boats exchanged fire,
the South Korean navy sank the intruder at dawn Friday about 60
miles off shore in 300 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea referred to the North Korean boat as a
``half-submarine,'' describing it as a high-speed boat that is
mostly submerged and thus difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a series of warnings and warning shots by the joint
forces against the escaping half-submarine, but the sub continued
to flee and fired back,'' said Hwang Dong Kyu, a Defense Ministry
spokesman. ``As a result, a Korean naval vessel fired on and sank
the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-submarine carried about four people, and the body of
one North Korean commando was recovered in the water, the Defense
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between North Korea and the West have been
deteriorating, with North Korean officials regularly warning of the
possibility of another Korean war. The four-year-old ``Agreed
Framework'' intended to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula has
seemed in recent months to be headed for a possible breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, North Korea is believed to be close to conducting
another rocket test, after one over Japan in September sent
tensions rising in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The one leader who has been arguing for conciliatory policies to
engage the North has been President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea,
but Kim's calls have been constantly undermined by North Korea.
Already criticized for being soft on the North, Kim may find his
room to maneuver even more limited after Thursday's incursion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   North Korea had no immediate comment. But the North normally
denies that it ever sends commandos into the South, and when it has
been caught, it has said that its submarines have lost power and
drifted south, even when the prevailing current is moving north.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers and diplomats in Seoul say that North Korea
regularly sends submarines sneaking into South Korean waters,
partly to infiltrate commandos for reconnaissance missions to
gather intelligence. Several times it has been caught, most
spectacularly in September 1996, when a taxi driver along the South
Korean coast spotted a 110-foot North Korean submarine that had
been beached on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   An intensive search then by 40,000 South Korean troops turned up
25 North Korean intruders, some of them killed by other North
Koreans so as not to slow the group down. One was never found and
is presumed to have died in the woods or possibly to have slipped
across the border back to the North.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as June, another North Korean submarine was captured
in South Korean waters, and shortly afterward the body of a North
Korean commando _ apparently from a different submarine _ was found
on a South Korean beach.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has many spies in South Korea, and it is relatively
easy to give a North Korean spy a fake or stolen Japanese passport
and have him fly into South Korea in the comfort of business class.
So one of the puzzles has been why North Korea goes to the risk of
infiltrating with submarines and other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts say that one reason may be to test South
Korean defenses, for in a war North Korean doctrine calls for
infiltrating commandos deep into South Korea to disrupt
communications and blow up buildings to sow chaos and fear. In
addition, some of the submarines are said to be dropping off
weapons to be hidden in case they are needed in the future.

ECONOMY IS BOOMING IN SITE OF `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ This 1,000-year-old city is losing its
inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Limerick, with 52,000 people the third-largest
Irish city, was widely known in the rest of the country as ``stab
city,'' a bad place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there,
either.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has changed for the better as Ireland's economy has
boomed. The upsurge would have pleased Limerick's Viking founders,
to say nothing of Frank McCourt, a native whose best-selling book,
``Angela's Ashes,'' describing the bad old days of 50 years ago,
has made him a rich man and the city's most famous former resident.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment here is at the national average of 8.5 percent, but
there are no jobless pockets of 80 percent or 90 percent, as there
are in the two larger cities _ Dublin, the capital, and Cork. More
factories are now opening than closing in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Shannon Airport provides 500 year-round jobs. People are
proud of the airport, where the hot mix of whiskey and coffee was
invented as Irish coffee in 1949, two years after the opening of
the first duty-free shop in the world. New jobs arrive regularly,
many of them at branches of U.S. and European electronic technology
factories locating in the area.
</P>
<P>
   And Limerick now ranks only fifth or sixth in urban street
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ```Stab city' was a legend, based on an old family feud
involving rugby,'' said Ciaran MacGonial, director of the new Hunt
Museum of art. ``There is a new self-confidence, a new dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment is relatively free of pollution. People fish for
pike in the wind-scalloped River Shannon from the Sarsfield Bridge
in the middle of the city. The number of painters and sculptors _
about 140 _ is rising, producing outdoor statues and indoor
exhibitions. The City Museum of Art has studded the city with art
in a current festival.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always the local propensity to claim Limerick as
the birthplace of the verse form, one more tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   People here talk less about the Celtic Tiger, as the boom is
called in Dublin, and more about how they pulled themselves up with
the help of the aggressive government-subsidized body Shannon
Development and with money from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's booming,'' said Frank Prendergast, a historian and former
mayor, who delights in anecdotes about the city and its people.
</P>
<P>
   Limerick, he said, was chartered as a city in 1197, before even
London and about the time Robin Hood was working Sherwood Forest.
Viking traces are everywhere, he said, not only in ancient dishes
and coins in museums, but in the names of current residents, like
MacOlaf and Doyle. ``Doyle,'' he said, derives from the Gaelic
words describing ``dark-haired foreigners,'' probably Danes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are problems, like the closing of the Krups
kitchen-appliance factory, which will kill 500 jobs in the next few
months. Outside the Krups plant the other day, workers whose jobs
are to end were grim, but did not seem desperate. The French parent
company, Moulinex, is moving production of electric kettles and
food processors back home, partly because of the collapse of
markets in Eastern Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called us in one morning without warning and just told us
we had no more jobs,'' said Doreen Rooney, a packer who has worked
at Krups for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are husbands and wives working here,'' she added, ``so
they have to find two more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Jacinta Stoica, who assembles food choppers, said
that despite the problem her family would have a normal Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more evidence of prosperity than of decline.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the makers of a movie based on ``Angela's
Ashes'' could not find streets decrepit enough to portray McCourt's
Limerick. So they went to Cork and filmed some slum streets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This meant, to some people here, that McCourt had overdrawn the
hardship of his youth. He wrote that the Shannon used to flood his
house, but that seems unlikely, residents say, as the river is too
far away from where he lived off O'Connell Street.
</P>
<P>
   But most people feel the absence of filmable slums is a
reflection of how the city has improved. Tours of McCourt's
remembered places now attract American visitors, who regularly
steal the metal plaques identifying them.
</P>
<P>
   The verse limerick was recently promoted, as a tourist
attraction, with the first international limerick contest. Each
entry had to begin ``In Limerick where once I did stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner among 1,500 entries, by Marian Gormley, of Drogheda,
County Louth, started that way and ended with a McCourt reference,
``From `Ashes' they've come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Development officials, who sponsored the contest,
produced research purporting to prove that Limerick was really the
birthplace of the limerick, that Gaelic-speaking poets learned the
form in France in the 16th century and came here to develop it in
pubs.
</P>
<P>
   They brushed off the statements in reference books that the
origin of the form is unknown and that it first appeared in print
in England in 1820.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve Kelly, the author of two novels, who was chief judge, said
in an interview: ``It doesn't matter whether it originated in
Limerick. It was popularized here.''

INDONESIA'S LEADER WARNS OF `DISINTEGRATION' FROM STRIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia &UR;  &LR; _ Student demonstrators clashed with
soldiers Thursday in a burst of gunfire, stone-throwing and clouds
of tear gas as President B.J. Habibie warned that continued
protests could lead to ``the disintegration of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 demonstrators, some of them throwing gasoline bombs,
challenged security forces guarding the Parliament building. The
military said 14 soldiers and police officers were wounded, four of
them seriously. Estimates of injured students treated at hospitals
ranged from 50 to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest and one of the most violent of the mostly
peaceful student demonstrations that have paralyzed parts of the
capital nearly every day for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   After the worst recent clash, on Nov. 13, in which at least nine
students were killed, the military and the police made elaborate
attempts to avoid confrontations, sometimes falling back when
protesters broke through their lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the more militant students seem bent on
confrontation, and some members of the security forces seem eager
to take them on.
</P>
<P>
   The students represent many different colleges and several
student groups. Some have moved from shouting for reform to
shouting for revolution. But their motivations and demands remain
unfocused and their protests seem more and more cut off from the
concerns and mood of the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters, who cruise the city in buses, waving
flags and dancing on their roofs, seem uncertain about just what
they really want. Their most common demand is for a trial of former
President Suharto, who resigned in May, partly as a result of
pressure from student protests.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the atmosphere has grown more unstable as Indonesia
moves uncertainly from a period of authoritarian rule toward the
possibility of a more democratic and open system.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to graduates at a military college Thursday, Habibie
said Indonesia's new freedoms allow for public protests. ``But in
carrying out these rights people must also respect other people's
rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead to the
disintegration of the nation,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread expectation here that the protests will
subside during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this
weekend. But they are expected to resume next year as Indonesia
moves toward its first free elections, scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the tightly controlled system of Suharto, the
ritualistic elections held every five years, with their
foreordained outcomes, were accompanied by outbreaks of street
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the government has loosened its grip, almost any
grievance can be taken to the streets. Hours before the clash
outside the Parliament building a group of some 200 students held a
separate rally near the National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Their demand: an end to student protests.

this point. A lot of people who might otherwise be inclined to cut
him some slack end up angry at him instead.

   ``This bombing of Iraq at a crucial juncture in the impeachment

Bill Clinton political ploy? You have to wonder.
</P>

   ``In his six years in the White House, he has failed to do the
really hard work of governing, the reaching out and forging
relationships part, especially creating strong ties with the
legislative branch. So now, when he stands accused of perjury and
other very serious misdeeds and needs all the help he can get on
Capitol Hill, that failure to do what presidents must do is coming
back to haunt him. ...

moral accountability. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the American people through the polls have also
indicated the desire to extend forgiveness and mercy to this
particular president. Consequently, the impeachment hearings, in
view of that expression, represent too much too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president ought to consider a gesture of self-censure,
where he goes away for a couple of weeks to engage in a time of
moral reflection and repair, prayer and study. And Mr. Clinton
needs to prepare an essay on the state of his own soul, his own
personal journey, from bondage toward deliverance. And that essay
could become the occasion of a national conversation on the state

something that is very human. ...

whites, it has been the spirit of the law, law applied leniently.

ANOTHER HOFFA ALLY CHARGED BY COURT-APPOINTED BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A court-appointed review board has accused an official elected
on James Hoffa's slate for the Teamsters' presidency with having
lied to federal officials about an improperly large campaign
donation.
</P>
<P>
   In filing charges this week against J.D. Potter, who was elected
as a Teamsters vice president, the review board has now brought
charges against three of the 19 people elected to be vice
presidents with Hoffa, son of the famous Teamsters leader. The
charges can result in acquittal, suspension or expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer, won the presidency of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, with his slate
capturing all 19 vice presidential positions.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's opponents seized on the charges against Potter to
criticize Hoffa for surrounding himself with unsavory people who
are willing to lie and cheat. The charges against Potter mean that
a total of seven officials who ran on Hoffa's slate either in this
year's election or in his unsuccessful 1996 election have been
accused of wrongdoing, with several of them kicked out of the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Review Board has charged Potter, president of a
Teamsters local in Texas, with having testified falsely about the
source of $5,000 given to the Hoffa campaign. According to the
charges, Potter originally donated $10,000, but that check was
returned when the federal election monitor told him that the
maximum he could donate was $5,000 under Teamster election rules.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, the review board asserted, then wrote a $5,000 personal
check to the campaign, while also giving a $5,000 cashier's check.
Potter later told federal monitors that five union staff members
had each given him $1,000 to donate to the campaign and that he had
bundled those contributions together in his cashier's check.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the review board also filed charges against Tom
O'Donnell, a prominent New York Teamster, accusing him of lying in
a campaign finance report. According to the board, O'Donnell,
president of a movie drivers' local elected to a Teamsters vice
presidency, provided false information when he failed to report
that a convicted felon was on the Hoffa campaign payroll as one of
the leaders of its 1996 effort in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Potter nor O'Donnell returned telephone calls made to
their offices Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-person review board and the federal monitor are part
of a large government oversight effort that the Teamsters agreed to
in a 1989 consent decree, which settled a federal racketeering
lawsuit against the union.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the charges against Potter and other members of
his slate, Hoffa said in a statement Thursday, ``These are
allegations which have to be dealt with pursuant to the procedures
set forth in the Teamsters' constitution and the consent decree,
and we intend to see that those procedures are followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, federal monitors have barred one Hoffa
slate member from running after she pressured union officials into
donating to her campaign. The official who was Hoffa's running mate
for secretary-treasurer in 1996 was ousted from the presidency of a
Chicago union local because the local signed contracts with
companies run by the president's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic
Union, which campaigned against Hoffa, said, ``He has people
associated with him who embezzled union funds, people who ran
businesses that interconnected with the union, people who extorted
union employees for the Hoffa campaign, people who received illegal
contributions and covered it up. You take that picture as a whole
and it's not an attractive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leedham, who was Hoffa's main opponent in this year's
election, said the review board should bring charges against Hoffa
like the false testimony charges it brought against Potter and
O'Donnell. In April, Michael Cherkasky, the federal election
monitor, issued a report that allowed Hoffa to remain in the
Teamsters race even though he found that Hoffa had testified
falsely about the source of some donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defies logic,'' Leedham said, ``that you can charge vice
presidents-elect with lying under oath, and not follow right up the
chain of command to do the same thing. If anything, the president
of the union should be held to a higher standard.''

 Though Most Gurus Are Upbeat, Some Say Stocks on Skaky Ground       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The awkward confluence of war and impeachment could easily make an
already choppy stock market even more erratic, but efforts to expel
President Clinton are not expected to trigger a market collapse or
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that investors
consider impeachment by the House of Representatives a foregone
conclusion, and they have already factored that into what they pay
for stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average closed yesterday at
8,875.82, up about 1 percent for the day. The impeachment effect
already was ``baked'' into the Dow after it tumbled for five days
in a row beginning December 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock markets hate uncertainty, (but) you can assume that a
lot of the uncertainty surrounding President Clinton has already
been discounted in the market,'' said Paul Siegel, president of
Hollis Capital Management, a San Francisco private investment
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   For now, House Republican leaders have briefly delayed an
impeachment vote while the United States and Britain launched their
military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1990 Persian Gulf War did trigger a significant
economic recession and stock sell-off, most financial pros don't
expect the markets nor economy to get seriously wounded by any
military conflict this time. For the most part, the current
domestic economy is far more sound than it was then.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, the assault on Iraq now further delays
impeachment action by the House, which in turn creates more angst
for the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving Wall Street crazy is that there will not be a
quick resolution to President Clinton's status. Investors are less
concerned about whether the president remains in office or whether
he is ousted. What they would like to see, and it is precisely what
they probably won't see, is a rapid end to the saga that has
crippled the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors are saddled with the unpalatable likelihood
of having an already lame duck president being rendered totally
ineffective for the duration of protracted Senate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the market cares if Bill Clinton is in the White
House or if Al Gore is in the White House, but if you tie up the
Senate with an impeachment trial then you tie the hands of
government,'' says portfolio manager James Carroll of Loomis,
Sayles &AMP; Co., a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., investment firm with $75
billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern, then, is that the whole country gets distracted
and the economic slowdown continues,'' Carroll says.
</P>
<P>
   And while institutional investors, for the most part, don't
envision that Senate hearings would cause financial markets to
crater, they do expect a trial would add more volatility and
churning to the roller-coaster market.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House of Representatives conducts its vote and the
Senate embarks on impeachment hearings as anticipated, financial
markets are likely to experience sharp, short-term swings driven by
dramatic developments in the Senate testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see some ups and downs, but it will be very
short-term stuff,'' says investment adviser Bob Bingham, a
principal of Bingham, Osborn &AMP; Scarborough LLC in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that an impeachment trial should be construed
as a positive influence on financial markets. During the
impeachment process, investors ''may well get whipsawed as the
ultimate resolution swings in the balance,'' says PaineWebber Chief
Strategist Edward Kerschner in a research note.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, over the long haul, financial markets should be able to
weather a Senate trial as long as there are no new crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to a Clinton scandal and the stock market, one
has to ask, 'What else is new?''' Kerschner asks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been living with Clinton scandals for
several years, and it is up more than 150 percent since 1995,
Kerschner points out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ultimately, it's the performance of the economy that
matters, and most financial pros do not expect either the Iraq
attack or a Clinton impeachment will have a direct effect on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment hearings normally would hurt the value of the
dollar, war usually bolsters the greenback because the world views
the United States as a safe haven. Thus, one of the things that
might ordinarily suffer from impeachment _ foreign investment in
the dollar _ likely will be a wash. Consequently, the current
strengths of the U.S. economy _ low inflation, a federal budget
surplus and low interest rates _ are expected to prevail over
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an impeachment trial would have no discernable impact
on the economy'' as long as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin remain in their current jobs,
says Harry Smith, a principal and chief strategist of Harris
Bretall Sullivan &AMP; Smith, a San Francisco investment firm with $3.1
billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan still has a number of years left in his term,
there have been rumblings that Rubin might leave. But PaineWebber's
Kerschner asserts that Rubin would depart only if he thought the
global financial system had ``turned the corner toward stability.''
</P>
<P>
   So, based on this overwhelming optimism from Wall Street, can we
assume that the stock market will continue to rise?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. A number of economists and market strategists say
there are plenty of fundamental reasons why the stock market is on
shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many are concerned that any hot air let out of the market during
the late summer downturn has been replaced. In fact, their biggest
concerns are that corporate earnings continue to go down while
stock prices continue to hover at pricey levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sitting on a boiling keg of water,'' says Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at Well Fargo Bank, a contrarian who believes
that impeachment hearings actually could be a catalyst for a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we could really see this Clinton thing as the straw
that breaks the camel's back and could precipitate a correction in
the stock market,'' Sohn says.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reuss, chief strategist for Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis,
also is concerned about deterioration of corporate earnings. While
he does not place much fear on war or impeachment, he finds the
frothy and volatile stock market scary in its own right.

   ``I'm worried that we have a lot of new (stock) players who

 Avant's CEO, 7 Others Are Indicted by Jury       
 By David Einstein 
    c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Avant Corp. and eight individuals, including the company's chief
executive, have been indicted on charges of stealing trade secrets
from rival Cadence Design Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an eight-count indictment handed down Wednesday, the Santa
Clara County grand jury said the defendants, who all used to work
for Cadence, stole that company's code to create products for Avant
that competed directly against those of Cadence. Both companies
make software for designing computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Each defendant faces a maximum of 12 years and four months in
prison and $17 million in fines and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was the latest in a series of legal setbacks for
Avant. Earlier this month, a federal judge in San Jose ordered the
Fremont company to stop selling its Aquarius software and cleared
the way for a trial in a 3-year-old civil suit brought by Cadence
of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted by the grand jury were Avant CEO Gerald Hsu, Vice
President Stephen Wuu, Vice President Yuh-Zen Liao, board member
Eric Cho and Eric Cheng, an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were former Avant President Mike Tsai, former
employee Leigh Huang and Mitsuru Igusa, who was accused of
delivering stolen code in return for thousands of dollars in
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleged that the theft and misuse of trade
secrets _ from February of 1991 to last October 17 _ cost Cadence
an estimated $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the largest cases ever in the country
involving trade-secret theft,'' said Julius Finkelstein, deputy
district attorney for Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein brought criminal charges against Avant and the same
individuals in April of last year, only to have the the case
delayed repeatedly by motions and appeals by Avant attorneys. In
November, the district attorney's office turned to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office believes the filing of this new indictment will
result in a speedy trial,'' Finkelstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are scheduled for arraignment on January 11. They
are expected to surrender at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Wuu, Cho, Liao and Tsai founded Avant in 1991 under the name Arc
Systems, which later became ArcSys. Their first product, ArcCell
was developed in 1993 using stolen Cadence source code, the
indictment stated.
</P>
<P>
   In September of 1997, responding to Cadence's suit, a U.S.
appellate court blocked the sale of ArcCell. Avant replaced it with
Aquarius, a second-generation product that it said contained no
Cadence code. However, Cadence claimed that Aquarius was really
just ArcCell with some minor changes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's indictment came as no surprise to Avant officials.
``Once we were notified in November of the beginning of the grand
jury investigation, we knew this was the eventual outcome,'' said
the company's general counsel, David Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   He called the case ``a dispute that has been orchestrated by our
main competitor'' and said, ``When this does come to trial and
we're able to put on our case, we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the indictment, coupled with the recent injunction
against Avant's product, could hurt the company with its customers,
potentially slowing what has been steady growth. Avant had revenues
of $147 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Cadence _ a far larger company, with revenues of more than
$900 million _ the indictment was seen as a vindication of its
claims. In addition, analysts said it could give the company the
opportunity to take away some of Avant's business.

 PUC Lets Pac Bell Cut Refund by $33 Million       
 By Deborah Solomon and Rebecca Smith 
    c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pacific Bell got an early holiday gift yesterday when state
regulators approved its request to refund a lower amount to
consumers than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   Although consumer groups and the Public Utilities Commission
staff said Pac Bell should refund $47 million, the PUC instead said
Pac Bell could provide a rate cut of just $13.9 million _ about 2
percent of one month's bill for the average customer. The refund
would happen over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   In a marathon, end-of-the-year PUC meeting, the commission also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rejected Pac Bell's request to provide long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ordered an investigation into PG&AMP;E's performance before and
during the December 8 blackout.
</P>
<P>
   _ Required Pac Bell to give competitors affordable access to its
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voted to adopt a statewide policy regarding area-code changes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fined GTE California $9.8 million for abusive marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Told Pac Bell it could not separate the White Pages from the
Yellow Pages without making a formal request.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approved Southern California Edison's request to provide
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious issue was the rate reduction, which
prompted several consumer groups to cry foul and say they would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was a giveaway to Pac Bell, and it really stinks,''
said Paul Stein, staff attorney with The Utility Reform Network.
``That extra $33 million may not have amounted to a whole lot per
customer, but it's still a rip-off.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The discrepancy stems from a commission decision in July,
which ordered Pac Bell to refund $305 million to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ordered the refund after a new California law
allowed Pac Bell to place a surcharge on customers' bills to
subsidize rural and low-income phone service. In the past,
customers had paid inflated rates to subsidize the service. In
order to prevent Pac Bell from collecting the money twice, the
commission ordered the company to refund the amount _ $305 million
_ that it assumed Pac Bell would earn from the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell said it collected $352 million but that it actually
refunded customers $338 million, not $305 million. Therefore, Pac
Bell said, it only had to cut rates again by $13.9 million, not $47
million.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted to allow Pac Bell to use its own
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The other controversial issue of the day was Pac Bell's
long-distance application, which, as expected, was rejected by the
full commission.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a PUC judge said Pac Bell had not opened the
local telephone market to competition _ a prerequisite for becoming
a long-distance carrier _ and should not be granted entry into
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The commission laid out about 200 requirements yesterday that
Pac Bell must meet before getting PUC approval. The company has
until July 1999 to either reapply or tell the commission what it
plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blase, vice president of regulatory at Pac Bell, said the
company was satisfied with the PUC's rejection of the application
because the commission indicated that it wants to see Pac Bell
competing in long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   Blase said Pac Bell would reapply in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to do the things that are required in the order,''
Blase said. ``We're doing it in a very thorough manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's competitors, such as AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, also
praised the PUC decision, saying it proves that Pac Bell has not
released its stranglehold on the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the commission postponed a vote on an order that
would have created statewide service-quality standards for
incumbent telephone companies, including Pacific Bell. That draft
decision followed a six-month investigation of service issues
resulting from a huge increase in consumer complaints about Pac
Bell installations and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the proposed rules aren't strong enough
to assure uniform good quality, but that isn't why Commissioner
Neeper urged the issue tabled until January. He said he isn't
convinced there is any need for standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about an order that appears to pick on Pacific
Bell,'' Neeper said. ``Maybe the answer ought to be that we
shouldn't regulate at all.''
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Commissioner Jessie Knight Jr., whose
six-year term expires December 31, Neeper yesterday became the
commission's new point man on telecommunications issues. The
assignment puts him in a pivotal position to influence how
telephone users' interests are balanced against utility interests.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big issues Neeper will tackle next year is how
California should deal with the proliferation of area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the PUC voted to hold hearings during the next year
and adopt a statewide area-code relief plan by December 1999. The
commission will choose one of three plans:
</P>
<P>
   _ Geographic area-code splits that divide a region into two or
more area codes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overlays, which require callers to dial 1 plus the area code
and phone number for every call, even calls within their own area
code.
</P>
<P>
   _ A combination of the geographic splits and overlays.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, regulators pick one of those options on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area could be affected by whatever policy the commission
adopts. Area-code relief currently is planned for 415, 510 and 650.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also voted unanimously to commence an
investigation into PG&AMP;E's performance before and during the
December 8 blackout that brought San Francisco to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The utility was ordered to submit a report by January 6 so that
the PUC can issue its preliminary conclusions by February 15.
Hearings, if any are ordered, would begin February 26.

   GOP sets debate as fighting goes on
   By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House decided to proceed
today with a debate on impeaching President Clinton after pushing
aside Democratic objections to taking up the matter while Americans
are in combat in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), the Republicans' choice to be the
new speaker of the House, pleaded with Democrats on Thursday to
abstain from invoking parliamentary maneuvers that would stall a
vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them cast their votes without pressure; let us debate the
issue; let them cast their votes and live up to exactly the
principle to which our young people in the armed forces are risking
their lives for,'' said Livingston, speaking from the House floor
after lawmakers approved, 417-5, a resolution supporting the U.S.
troops taking part in the operation in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 9 a.m. today, the House is to consider four
articles of impeachment against the president, alleging that he
lied under oath, obstructed justice and abused his presidential
powers in concealing his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Responding in a passionate speech from the House floor, Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) attempted to postpone the impeachment
vote until after the military mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that we strongly object to this matter coming up
tomorrow or the next day or any day in which our young men and
women are in harm's way,'' Gephardt said. ``We believe we've got to
also look at how Saddam Hussein will perceive the idea and
information that while he is under physical attack by the United
States and its people, we're having a debate in the U.S. House of
Representatives to remove the commander in chief from his office.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats echoed his objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would think of removing Gen. (Norman) Schwarzkopf in the
middle of Desert Storm?'' commented Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri,
ranking Democrat on the House National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said going forward with
the impeachment debate is a sign of strength, not weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The troops taking part in the mission in Iraq ``will be
demoralized if we do stop this constitutional process,'' said
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, lawmakers met behind closed doors to discuss
how to proceed. At first Livingston sought 16 hours for debating
the articles of impeachment today and finishing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That drew immediate opposition from Democratic leaders, who said
they found it unfathomable that the Republicans would vote to
impeach the president while the country was engaged in military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look down upon any activity in this body to go
forward with impeachment while our American men and women are
engaged in Iraq,'' said Minority Whip David Bonior (D-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   The debate on impeachment was delayed after Clinton ordered air
strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, just minutes before the
Republican House leaders met to discuss their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the attack prompted many Republicans to suggest
that the president ordered the air strikes in a desperate effort to
save his political life.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to respond to that criticism, Clinton said, ``I don't
think any serious person would believe that any president would do
such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who backed away
from his criticism Wednesday of the timing of the attack on Iraq,
ruled out a deal with the White House to spare the president an
impeachment trial. ``We will go to a trial, and there won't be any
deal making,'' Lott said in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote goes against him, Clinton would be the second
president to be impeached by the House. In 1868, Andrew Johnson
faced a similar fate, but the Senate declined to remove him from
office by one vote. President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before
articles of impeachment were voted on by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want to vote now to avoid inconvenience,
Gephardt said. ``I'd like all of us to think about the
inconvenience that our young people are going through. I want them
to see nothing from us but support and unity of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) argued: ``As
we engage in conflict, democracy does not stop in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates continued to jump on the impeachment train
Thursday, dimming hopes among White House aides that they could
derail impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.), who traveled to the Middle East with
Clinton last week, announced he would vote for impeachment. And
Republican Reps. Jim Nussle of Iowa, Steve Horn of California and
Heather Wilson of New Mexico announced they would do the same.
Outside the Capitol, 2,000 protesters led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
rallied against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), a member of the Judiciary
Committee, got into a verbal feud with Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.)
over his accusation that Clinton ordered the air strikes to divert
attention from the impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   As Solomon left the House floor, Waters said she asked him why
he had attacked the president in that fashion, telling him that he
had accused the president of a ``diabolical scheme,'' and that it
was ``unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon replied, ``No one can question my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a briefing by Defense Secretary William Cohen, a
former Republican senator from Maine, House Republicans remained
suspicious of the timing of the attack. Rep. Tillie Fowler (R-Fla.)
said she still questioned the timing of the bombing. But, she said,
once the bombs had fallen, it was important to ``stand together and
support our troops'' and she supported the resolution.

 Donating To Gift Fund At the Office       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  I'm a white-collar professional in a government agency.
There is a long-standing tradition of the professional staff each
donating $30 to a holiday gift fund that is divided among the
clerical staff. The clerical staff has come to rely on this money:
One secretary said she'd spent her Christmas money even before it
was handed out! I have problems with this whole process. Holiday
gifts should be a personal gesture from the heart, not an automatic
payment that people expect as a matter of course. And giving cash
rather than a gift seems mercenary. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  Ah, the holiday season. It brings joy, camaraderie and
eggnog to otherwise-staid workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   It also occasionally brings cultural clashes and tension.
</P>
<P>
   If you worked for a big private-sector company, the personnel
budget might very well include money for holiday treats for the
staff _ such as cash bonuses, an office party or luncheon, or gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   But as government employees, you can't very well use taxpayer
dollars to buy turkeys for all the secretaries. So someone came up
with a creative way to thank the support staff for their help _ an
idea that over time has become such a tradition that it no longer
feels spontaneous or personal to you.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the idea of all the professional staff chipping in for
holiday gifts for their subordinates seems reasonable to me. It's a
way to give presents without getting into potentially awkward
comparisons: ``Gee, Ms. Smith gave me an $80 watch but Mr. Jones
only gave me a coffee mug.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seems reasonable that the staff has come to rely on this
money _ just as the relatively low-paid doormen in the New York
apartment building where I grew up counted on a pile of envelopes
with tips from tenants each holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if this tradition feels oppressive to you, it's worth
trying to change it.
</P>
<P>
   The time to bring this up is after the emotions and pressures of
the holiday season have faded. Wait until March, and then talk to
your co-workers about updating the way your agency celebrates the
holidays. Don't be accusatory: Couch things in positive terms of
wanting to make sure the holiday rituals are meaningful to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, swallow your distaste and write that $30 check. It
may not be spontaneous, but it still will help make someone's
holiday season happier.
</P>
<P>
   The Exit Interview
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently gave notice that I was quitting my job at a
nonprofit group. The director has said she won't release my final
paycheck unless I do an exit interview. Can she do this? Frankly, I
have no desire to do an exit interview. I've already let the
director know my feelings about the organization on several
occasions and don't want to get into another argument.
</P>
<P>
   A: Employers like to do exit interviews for several reasons.
They can take care of final logistical details, such as collecting
office keys from departing employees. They can inform people about
helpful post-employment benefits like COBRA, the program that lets
people continue their company health insurance at their own
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies also use exit interviews as a way to improve
their operations _ finding out what employees liked or disliked
about working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an exit interview is done properly, in a relaxed and
friendly atmosphere, there's often a great deal that a company can
learn about supervisory relations,'' said Conley Baker, a human
resources consultant with The Employers Group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the key is to keep it relaxed,'' Baker added.
``Threatening to withhold someone's paycheck is not the way to
establish a relaxed atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   In your case, it doesn't sound like much would be gained by
either side from an exit interview.
</P>
<P>
   And your former boss actually has no legal right to withhold
your paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   California law says that employees who resign without notice
must be issued their final paycheck within 72 hours. Employees who
are terminated or who resign with notice must be given their final
check on their last day of work.
</P>
<P>
   If the director refuses to pay you, you should file an
unpaid-wages claim with the state labor commissioner at (415)
557-7878. Your former employer could face penalties of one day's
wages for every day that it fails to issue your check.
</P>
<P>
   When Do I Get Overtime?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many days in a row can an employee work before overtime
is required? I work for a health care provider, and my schedule
often has me working Thursday through Sunday of one week, followed
by Monday through Friday the next. That makes a total of nine days
without a break. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Overtime in California isn't based on the number of days you
work _ it's based on the number of hours worked over the course of
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most nonunion employers are required to pay overtime
after you put in 40 hours over a seven-day work week. (A few
employers, like hospitals, don't have to pay overtime unless
workers put in 80 hours over a 14-day period.)
</P>
<P>
   There are some laws that limit the number of consecutive days
that people can be asked to work. For instance, most California
employers are required to give their workers one day off out of
seven. But those days off can be postponed due to business
necessity, as long as people receive the equivalent of one day off
out of seven by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, the company clearly is giving you one day off each
week. And unless your hours add up to more than 40 in one work week
(or 80 hours over two weeks in cases like hospitals), you're not
owed any overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? Your schedule may be inconvenient, but it's probably
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Want to double-check the overtime rules for your particular job?
You can find wage orders for different industries on the Web site
of the California Department of Industrial Relations, at
 &LR; www.dir.ca.gov/dir/Labor(UNDERSCORE)law &LR;   &LR; /DLSE &LR;

THE CASE FOR TIME OFF

   Q: I work for a small company with 30 or so employees. People
who have been with the company a year receive only four days of
sick and vacation time combined. All of us feel overworked and
underpaid. How we can get the owner to give us more time off? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Everyone, with the possible exception of Bill Gates, feels
overworked and underpaid. So before you go to the boss, conduct a
quick, if unscientific, survey to see how similar companies
approach the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do some benchmarking in your industry,'' advised Virginia
Byrd, president of the Work-Life Coalition, a nonprofit group in
San Diego that promotes workplace policies to help people balance
their professional and personal lives. Check vacation and
sick-leave policies at rival companies of about the same size in
your area. You don't want to raise the issue, only to discover that
the competition grants even less time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the likely event that four days is comparatively
stingy, you shouldn't march en masse into the boss' office to make
demands. There may be safety in numbers, but putting your boss on
the defensive is not the best way to succeed, warned Tom Jackson,
chairman of Equinox Interactive, a human resources consulting firm
and software developer based in Woodstock, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to shame your boss will probably prove unproductive,
too. Grousing about how much vacation Competitor X gives its
employees just might earn the suggestion that you go work for
Competitor X.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to go at this in a positive way,'' said Susan Seitel,
president of the Work and Family Connection, a consulting and
information firm in Minnetonka, Minn. Instead of talking about how
everyone wants to work less, Ms. Seitel advised, frame the issue as
part of a broader quest to make workers more committed and
productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, everybody is looking for what's in it for them _
and certainly the boss is,'' she said. ``Help him share a vision of
what could happen if people in the company were as committed as
they could possibly be, rather than point out to him what a jerk
he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, management will take the bait and ask for
supporting data. ``There is an enormous amount of evidence that
helping employees achieve work-life balance pays off in increased
morale, reduced turnover, increased loyalty and a better public
image,'' Ms. Seitel said.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search can put you in touch with many groups that conduct
or compile research on work-life issues; the best known may be the
Families and Work Institute in Manhattan (www.familiesandwork.org).
It notes, for example, that a study at Johnson &AMP; Johnson found that
the average number of days absent among all company workers
declined over the two years after the introduction of more generous
and flexible time and leave policies.
</P>
<P>
   By linking an increase in paid time off to the company's bottom
line, you may convince your boss of the error of his ways. But as
the reins are loosened, take care not to let productivity slip.
Otherwise, management may grant you a permanent vacation. &QL;

RUSSIA RESPONDS TO AIRSTRIKES SWIFTLY AND FIERCELY
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia recalled its ambassador to Washington Thursday
to protest airstrikes against Iraq in one of Moscow's angriest
ripostes to American policy since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's unusual decision to withdraw Ambassador Yuly
Vorontsov came as politicians across Russia's political spectrum,
usually divided over how to solve the country's own tangled
problems, united to denounce the American attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the Communist-led Parliament registered its
dissent by shelving plans to ratify the START II treaty slashing
strategic nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Winning approval of the treaty from Russia has been a major
objective of the United States and one that had seemed
tantalizingly close. A vote on the treaty, which was widely
expected to be approved, was scheduled for Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's protest stems, in part, from its long-standing ties to
Iraq. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a former foreign minister
and senior intelligence official, has maintained close relations
with Baghdad since Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Persian Gulf War, Primakov engaged in a hectic round
of shuttle diplomacy as he sought unsuccessfully to try to head off
the allies' attack on Saddam Hussein's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also owes Moscow billions of dollars _ loans that stand no
chance of being repaid unless the war clouds in the Middle East
clear and economic sanctions against Iraq are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But the unusually acerbic tone of Russia's reaction Thursday has
more do with Russia's attitude toward the United States. Much of
Russia's political elite, as well as many ordinary Russians,
believe that Washington has begun to throw its weight around since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's opinion was ignored,'' complained Gen. Igor Sergeyev,
the Russian minister of Defense. Sergeyev conveyed his displeasure
by skipping a meeting with NATO officials in Brussels on Thursday
to fly back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's decision to withdraw Vorontsov was conveyed to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by the deputy chief of the
Russian Embassy in Washington during a meeting on the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Albright was informed that Russia is calling its
ambassador for consultation,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin disclosed. ``That is unfortunate. But we continue to work
with Russia on a variety of levels to manage our differences on
this use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time U.S. relations with Moscow turned this frosty goes
back to the Soviet era when Washington recalled its ambassador in
early 1980, after the Soviet Union had voiced support for the
revolution in Iran. Although the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly
Dobrynin, was not formally recalled, he left Washington to return
to Moscow a month early.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits, of course, on how far Russia can go in voicing
its objections. Russia is too broke to launch a military buildup.
It also needs aid from Western organizations like the International
Monetary Fund, where the United States has substantial influence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Clinton tried to call President Boris Yeltsin to
discuss the Iraq situation, but was unable to reach him, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore spoke by telephone with Primakov, who
asked that the bombing be stopped. Primakov also denounced Richard
Butler, the head of the U.N. organization that oversees the
inspections in Iraq. Gore said that the bombing would continue
until Washington achieved its military aims, American officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The indignant mood here appears to confirm a deeper shift in
Russian opinion against the United States, sentiment which has only
been exacerbated by Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin denounced the attack
as political ``egoism.'' Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor and a leading
presidential hopeful, assailed the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant nationalist, led a noisy
demonstration outside of the American Embassy. Even Alexy II, the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, denounced the bombing as
a ``crude violation.''

CREW MIGHT GO FROM SCOUTS TO STARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They toil in the soil all season, known only by
their numbers, with nothing at stake except their future.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's scout players spent three months impersonating opponents
to prepare the Bruins' starters for weekly competition. A few
freshmen managed to impress the coaches and will compete for
starting spots when spring practice begins:
</P>
<P>
   __ Rusty Williams, an outside linebacker/defensive end from San
Diego. He plays with limitless energy and was named defensive scout
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mike Saffer, an offensive lineman from Tucson, Ariz., and the
son of former UCLA basketball player Don Saffer. The younger Saffer
can play either guard or tackle but might be more suited for guard
because of his athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be outstanding,'' said Bruins coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   __ Joe Hunter, a cornerback from Vacaville who overcame a
preseason knee injury to show promise in man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sean Phillips, a 290-pound defensive lineman from Missouri
City, Texas, who started slowly but has played well in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Audie Attar, a strong safety from Claremont who is, by far,
UCLA's hardest hitter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cory Paus: In his leadership skills, the quarterback reminds
coaches of a young Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lovell Houston: The touted freshman defensive back had
shoulder surgery two months ago but will be ready for spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Toledo contract: Athletic director Peter Dalis met with
school officials again last week about securing a long-term
contract for Toledo, 52, who is signed through 2003 and wants to
finish his career at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo makes $453,000 per year and will be the ninth-highest
paid coach in the Pac-10 when Arizona's Dick Tomey receives a
five-year, $2.5 million deal next month.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo and Dalis initially met with UCLA administrators before
Thanksgiving, a source said, after Toledo was contacted by
Oklahoma. Toledo's name has surfaced in conjunction with NFL
openings in Baltimore and San Diego, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pursuing anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Maybe next year: Sophomore nose guard Micah Webb tore
ligaments in his left knee and will need reconstructive surgery.
The damage was serious; he won't play in the Rose Bowl, he won't be
ready for spring practice and he might not play next season.
</P>
<P>
   True freshman Ken Kocher probably will replace Webb, meaning the
starting defense against Wisconsin will consist of four freshmen,
three sophomores, two juniors and two seniors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short stuff: Linebacker Ryan Nece and tailback DeShaun Foster
were named to The Sporting News' freshman All-American team. . . .
Toledo suffered a concussion and a separated shoulder in an
automobile accident last week in Atlanta. Offensive line coach Mark
Weber, who was driving, has a grotesque bruise on his back. . .
Twenty recruits will be on campus this weekend, and today's
practice was canceled as a result. (Someone needs to pick the
players up at the airport.) . . . The Bruins have received four
oral commitments _ Anaheim linebacker Asi Faoa, Temecula safety
Ryan Wikert, Bakersfield defensive lineman Rodney Leslie and Venice
quarterback J.P. Losman _ and hope to sign 18 players in February.

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL ALWAYS HAD SAD SACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cancel the basketball season. And while you're at it,
cancel the baseball season, too. There's no point playing ball,
what with big television money creating a wedge between the haves
and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Our worst fears about the dreaded Rupert Gap were confirmed the
other day by Sandy Alderson, who ran the Oakland A's in their glory
days, and is now executive vice president of the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen life from both sides now, Alderson estimated that
only 12 to 15 teams have a chance to reach post-season play.
Anybody can figure out the usual suspects _ the Warner-Turner
Braves, the Tribune Cubs, the MSG/Cablevision Yankees, the Angelos
Orioles, the Sold-Out Indians, the Disney Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Los Angeles Dodgers _ owned by an Australian-speaking
media mogul who wouldn't know Sandy Koufax from Fernando Valenzuela
_ have already wrapped up their division because of the frightful
$105 million contract to Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   (Now those poor innocent executives like Larry Lucchino of San
Diego are bleating because they consistently get fleeced by agents
like Scott Boras _ as if they never fudged or exaggerated or
bullied or bluffed to push a deal.)
</P>
<P>
   The Angels clinched by signing Mo Vaughn, the Diamondbacks
clinched by signing Randy Johnson, the Mets clinched by signing
Mike Piazza. No, the Braves clinched by signing Brian Jordan. And
whoever signs Roger (I'm Homesick for Houston, but Not That
Homesick) Clemens will clinch theirs, too. On the other hand, with
so many egocentric owners out there, spending money, methinks
Alderson is underestimating the delightful possibility for
mistakes, injuries and downright bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I would wish anything bad on Kevin Brown, but let's say
he's decorating the Christmas tree and he reaches up to hang the
star, and, oops, feels a twinge in his back. Backs are funny
things. Of course, it wouldn't be funny to Rupert, but what's $105
million to a swell guy like him?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. According to Alderson, only 12 to 15 teams have a
shot at the playoffs. The last I looked there were 30 major league
teams, if you count the Florida Marlins, who won only 54 games last
year after their post-world championship nuclear winter.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything new about this gap between rich teams and poor
teams? Ask fans who spent their early years rooting for dog teams
like the Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia
Athletics, Boston Braves or Philadelphia Phillies, whose histories
consisted of mostly six's and seven's and eight's, back when there
were eight teams per league.
</P>
<P>
   The early National League always had a few dominant teams _ the
Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants _ until Branch Rickey signed
every plowboy and millhand for the St. Louis Cardinals and then
signed African-Americans and earned a decade of pennants in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The American League? A few teams had their moments until the
Yankees bought Babe Ruth and clamped a headlock on the seven other
franchises. The most brazen form of collusion began in 1955 when
the Kansas City Athletics served as a Yankee finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, superior teams kept their edge because of
the reserve clause that bound a player to his club until his legs
fell off. The sainted Brooklyn Dodgers played the diabolical New
York Yankees in six World Series from 1947 through 1956. Every
winter, you sent a contract to Jackie Robinson or Mickey Mantle,
and that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Once players gained free agency in the 1970s, the domination
ended. Since the big strike of 1981, only three teams _ the Expos
and the two recent expansion teams _ have failed to win a
divisional title. The Expos are probably going to leave Montreal,
but they rarely look like abject losers under Felipe Alou. Don't
underestimate good managing, good scouting and good young players
hustling for the minimal $175,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even with their wild-card gimmick, the baseball owners allow
only eight teams into the playoffs. And if the lack of parity
frightened the owners, they would share the television income, as
the National Football League does.
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't underestimate the penalty for hubris. George
Steinbrenner won nothing from 1982 through 1994. Peter Angelos'
Orioles have been underachievers with the frosty Cal Ripken, and
now Angelos has brought in the truly antisocial Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of huge corporations and massive egos finish way back, and
that is always fun to watch. Come to think of it, don't cancel the
next baseball season. We'll enjoy it even more next spring without
basketball.

 GREEK DECISION CLOUDS POTENTIAL BIG bOEING F-15 SALE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Greece's decision this week to purchase what defense
experts say is a much inferior airborne early warning system from
Europe rather than from Northrup Grumman may have implications for
Boeing winning an important fighter plane order from the Greek
military early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Defense experts believe Greece caved in to considerable pressure
from the European Union not to buy the system from a U.S.
manufacturer, and similar pressure is being applied to the fighter
competition.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly for Boeing, the ``Fortress Europe'' that now
appears to be going up on the other side of the Atlantic could in
the long term make it harder for the U.S. aerospace giant to sell
commercial jets to European airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls are going up, brick by brick,'' said Richard
Aboulafia, senior aircraft analyst with the Teal Group, a closely
followed market research firm in Virginia. ``It's not fully in
place yet, but it can only get worse ... and it has very serious
implications for Boeing and other U.S. defense companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Lockheed Martin in the U.S. are vying for a
multi-billion-dollar contract to supply Greece with up to 60 modern
fighters. For months, defense experts believed Boeing's F-15 strike
fighter was the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eurofighter, a joint European venture by Germany,
Britian, Italy and Spain, now has the edge, the trade publication
Defense Daily reported. If it does pick the Eurofighter, Greece
would be the first export customer for the multinational fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is likely to name the winner in January or February next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the Greek fighter competition,
Jim Schlueter, Boeing's spokesman in St. Louis for international
fighters sales, issued this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greek military has proven to be a very sophisticated and
knowledgable customer. As with their other programs, they are
continuing a very detailed and thorough evaluation of the new
fighter aircraft. We are confident they will select the solution
that best meets their requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Without new orders, Boeing will have to shut down its F-15
production line after December 1999. The F-18 Hornet line will meet
the same fate in mid 2000 without new orders. Both fighters are
built in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighter lines provide several hundred million dollars of
profit annually for Boeing. While that is a small percentage of
Boeing's total profits, the company can ill afford to see the
fighter money disappear at a time when the commercial side is
hurting and investors are demanding higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Farnborough international air show in September, Boeing
President Harry Stonecipher told industry analysts that he was much
more optimistic than before that the F-15 line will soon get new
orders. But he said he was less optimistic about the F-18 line.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been working hard behind the scenes to win fighter
competitions not only in Greece, but in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Farnborough show, Mike Sears, head of
Boeing's Military Aircraft and Missile Systems Group in St. Louis,
flew from London to Athens for further talks with that country's
military on its fighter competition.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boeing opened a new office in Athens to support its
efforts to develop long-term business relationships with Greece. It
has a similar business relationships with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is considering a $2 billion order for either the F-15 or
Lockheed Martin's F-16.
</P>
<P>
   And Saudia Arabia has indicated it may want more F-15s once
Boeing fills a previous order for 72 of the fighters. About half
have so far been delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia said Boeing is still alive in the Greek competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't kill Boeing's chances (to sell Greece the F-15),
but it's not a welcome sign,'' Aboulafia said of the decision by
Greece to accept a proposal from Sweden's Ericsson for $600 million
worth of airborne early warning planes.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson will supply the radar system for four EMB-145
twin-engine passenger planes built by Brazil's Embraer. That system
would be integrated into the planes by Thomson-CSF, the French
aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin also had submitted
proposals to the Greek military.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop's E-2C Hawkeye 2000 was thought to be the clear
front-runner. Updated versions of the Hawkeye have been in service
with the U.S. Navy since the 1970s, and is used by Japan, Egypt,
Singapore and Taiwan. Even France has ordered two for its new
carrier the Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ericsson proposal selected by Greece is for an untested
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like comparing a Volkswagon to a Ferrari,'' Aboulafia
said. ``It's like comparing a Fisher-priced toy to a Ferrari ....
This decision was either an extreme cost-cutting measure by Greece
or there was a great deal of political pressure applied, which is
not a welcome sign of things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Daily quoted U.S. government sources as saying Greece
decided to go with the Ericsson proposal after a meeting of the
European Union in Vienna last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Greece and other European countries such as Spain receive
important EU subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Daily quoted an unnamed senior U.S. executive as saying,
``This is a blunt message that's hard to compete against. The
Germans, French and Swedes are saying, `We give you money, then
you've got to buy our products.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense companies are worried that a Fortress Europe will
make it more difficult for them to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their worst nightmare,'' said Aboulafia.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for U.S. defense companies is that most of their
foreign military sales are in Asia and the Middle East, not Europe,
said Cai von Romohr, a defense analyst with Cowen &AMP; Company
</P>
<P>
   ``These political issues don't have the significance there that
they do in Europe,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   But if the military aspects of a Fortress Europe are extended to
the commercial sector, that would be an even bigger concern for
Boeing, Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly the prospect that airlines would be coerced
in this effort,'' Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analysts with JSA Research, said European
airlines have long felt pressure from the European Union to buy
from Airbus Industrie rather than from Boeing, but that pressure is
getting more aggressive as Europe moves toward a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to have a rival to the dollar and keeping
business in Europe is all part of it,'' he said. ``International
politics plays a big part in the selection of aerospace
purchases.''

   WASHINGTON _ In a confession that will add fuel to an already
overheated impeachment debate, incoming House Speaker Bob
Livingston, R-La., said Thursday that he had ``on occasion
strayed'' during his 33-year marriage but was quick to distinguish
his infidelity from the one that threatens Bill Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not
with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify
under oath about them,'' Livingston said in a statement distributed
after he admitted the affairs in a meeting with House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's admission came less than 13 hours before the House
is scheduled to begin debate Friday morning on whether Clinton
should be impeached on charges that he lied under oath about his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He had
decided some days ago not to preside over the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the speaker-to-be's confession is sure to further enrage
House Democrats who were already furious Thursday that the
Republicans would schedule a debate and vote on impeachment while
Clinton is performing his duties as commander-in-chief of the U.S.
armed forces attacking Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, including Livingston, were bristling Thursday
night that yet another GOP leader had been forced to acknowledge
marital problems under the threat of possible exposure in the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   The last and, until Thursday, most visible target was Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., whose long-ago affair was
reported by the Internet magazine Salon as the committee began
considering impeachment articles against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, in his statement, said he was confessing, in part,
``because of forces outside of this institution seeking to
influence the upcoming events and/or media coverage of these
events.'' He did not elaborate, and said, ``this will be the only
statement I will make on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans were quick to point down Pennsylvania Avenue:
``We feel like the White House is behind a lot of this,'' said Tony
Rudy, deputy chief of staff to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas. DeLay had asked in September for an FBI investigation of
the source of Salon's story on Hyde, saying Republicans ``will not
be intimidated by this kind of sleazy activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders, including the outgoing fourth-ranking
leader, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, bypassed reporters and cameras
without comment, looking weary and disbelieving after a week in
which House members reassembled in Washington to deal with
impeachment, only to be confronted with bombing in Baghdad and
another bombshell under their own roof.
</P>
<P>
   Both a White House spokesman and aides to House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston had been nominated as House speaker by Republicans
just five weeks ago to replace Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., whose decision
to resign in the days after his party's poor showing in the Nov. 3
election rocked the Capitol. Challenges to other leaders roiled the
Republican delegation for days, until the conference settled on
Livingston, who had been chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee and was prepared to try to unseat Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in the basement of the Capitol, Republicans rallied
again around their selected speaker, who said the other reasons for
his admission were the ``tremendous trust and responsibility my
colleagues have placed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who in March suggested that because Clinton ``cheated on
his wife, he will cheat on the American people,'' spoke out for
Livingston on Thursday night, Rudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston ``didn't lie under oath. He didn't lie in a
deposition. He didn't lie to a grand jury,'' Rudy said. Livingston
admitted his infidelity ``in a forthright, honest and honorable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., agreed Thursday ``there's no
comparison here, there's no parallel'' between Livingston's and
Clinton's situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is here under articles of impeachment because he
refused to deal with the Paula Jones case, and he swore under oath
before a grand jury and in a deposition, and there is good evidence
that he obstructed justice,'' she said. ``The issue before the
Congress is did the president disobey the law ...not sex, or the
president and Mrs. Clinton's private family life.''

U.S., BRITAIN HAMMER IRAQ IN SECOND WAVE OF BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Britain launched a second
wave of missiles at Iraq on Thursday as President Clinton defended
the mission as ``the right thing to do'' despite the House vote
pending on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the U.S.-led campaign to destroy Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's weapons program, Russia recalled its
ambassador to the United States in a surprising show of protest.
And in an extraordinary and unprecedented day in the nation's
capital, the House voted 417-5 for a resolution backing U.S.
troops, pointedly omitting references to the commander in chief,
and then opted to begin debate Friday on impeachment of the
president regardless of the on-going military mission.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials reported no U.S. casualties during
``Operation Desert Fox.'' Air-launched cruise missiles from U.S.
B-52 bombers and British Tornado bombers pelted Iraqi military
targets again Thursday, following an initial night assault
Wednesday from more than 200 ship-based Tomahawk cruise missiles
and 70 attack warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported 25 Iraqi dead and 75 wounded in Baghdad, based on
Iraqi statements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended the mission as necessary to prevent Saddam from
dismantling the United Nations weapons inspection operation
instituted after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and to stop him from
rebuilding his chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced the decision I made to order this military
action, though difficult, was absolutely the right thing to do. It
is in our interest and in the interest of people all around the
world,'' Clinton told reporters while awaiting a briefing from his
national security team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles before; I have no doubt he would use them again
if permitted to develop them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the mission ``a
success,'' but military officials offered a more measured
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our early assessment of the military action against Iraq shows
that our forces are performing well. There have been no American
casualties and we are achieving good coverage of our targets. And
as a result, we are advancing our goal of containing Saddam
Hussein,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., warned that America's
enemies should not see the confluence of the Iraqi action and the
impeachment issue as a sign of possible U.S. weakness. ``We have a
chance to say to the world today no matter what our constitutional
process, whether it is an election or it is the eve of a
constitutional vote, no matter what our debates at home, we are, as
a nation, prepared to lead the world,'' Gingrich said as debate on
the resolution began.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, one of the five members to oppose the
resolution voicing support for U.S. troops, said he voted against
it for policy and constitutional reasons. He said Congress should
have approved the military action before it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking for months so much about the need to follow
the Constitution. I don't know why we can't follow it when it comes
to waging war,'' Paul said. He added ``bombing never wins a war''
and Clinton ordered the strikes to divert attention from
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to question the timing of the mission,
which occurred on the eve of the scheduled impeachment debate. Some
suggested it was a deliberate move to alter the impeachment
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any serious person would believe that any
president would do such a thing. And I don't believe any reasonably
astute person in Washington would believe that Secretary Cohen and
(chairman of the Joint Chiefs) Gen. (Hugh) Shelton and the whole
rest of the national security team would participate in such an
action. This was the right thing for the country,'' Clinton
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., backtracked from his
press statement issued as the bombing began and maintained he did
not believe the timing of the military mission was tied to
impeachment. Lott voiced support for U.S. troops but again
questioned the strategy of the administration's Iraqi policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, air raid sirens sounded throughout the night as the
missiles sought out military and intelligence targets as well as
suspected sites for biological and chemical weapons in outlying
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf accused the United
States of ``lying shameless'' about Iraq's level of cooperation
with the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM. ``They call
it `Operation Desert Fox.' In fact, it is `Operation Villains in
the Arabian Desert,''' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained there were only five cases of noncooperation out
of 427 inspections. He also charged that the missiles damaged the
home of Saddam's daughter as well as nonmilitary sites such as a
training center for mechanics and a plant producing brake oil for
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the minister did not rule out further cooperation with
UNSCOM, the arms inspection group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is premature, to have an answer on it. We are dealing
with the circumstances, and we will see after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq found allies on the U.N. Security Council as Russia and
China continued to demand a halt to the bombing and the resignation
of UNSCOM chief Richard Butler. France also voiced objections to
the military response.
</P>
<P>
   Russia took the rare step of recalling its ambassador, the first
time it has taken such action since the breakup of the Soviet Union
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin took the action despite appeals from
Vice President Al Gore. Officials said Clinton, who called several
world leaders Thursday, would try to speak to Yeltsin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said in Moscow that ``Russia demands an immediate end to
military action, to show common sense and restraint and not to
allow further escalation of the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's report to the United Nations on Tuesday outlined the
level of noncompliance by Iraq since Nov. 15, when it averted a
U.S. military strike by promising unconditional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective is utterly
false,'' Butler told reporters. ``There is no doubt in my mind that
the conclusion I came to that Iraq did not keep its promise of full
cooperation is correct, whether we are talking about inspections or
documents or interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged the
criticism from Russia and China but added, ``over the past year
they have failed to provide any viable alternative.'' Albright
called 20 foreign ministers to inform them of the U.S.-British
operation, and administration officials were informing all foreign
missions in Washington.

ATTACKS DEVASTATE KEY ELEMENTS OF SADDAM'S FORCES, SAY PENTAGON
OFFICIALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials said Thursday that the first
wave of attacks on Iraq knocked out key elements of Saddam
Hussein's air defense system and military command structure.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 50 targets hit by Tomahawk cruise missiles
launched from ships in the Persian Gulf and from U.S. and British
warplanes were Saddam's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad and
facilities housing his Republican Guard troops and secret security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
four out of five barracks buildings where some of Saddam's most
loyal troops may have been sleeping were completely destroyed and
that the intelligence headquarters had been reduced to ``rubble.''
He could not say, however, whether any of Saddam's troops had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, pointing to satellite photos of the destroyed
buildings, said the targets were just a few of the more than 50
that were hit over the course of the initial U.S.-British attack
that began at about 5 p.m. EST Wednesday and continued for about 4
1/2 hours. He said suspected weapons sites, air fields, air defense
systems and other military targets had been hit as well in the
strikes involving more than 200 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen also emphasized that U.S. and
British forces involved in the operation, dubbed Desert Fox, had
sustained no casualties. He said the crews of about 70 aircraft
involved in the first assault had returned safely to the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Persian Gulf or to nearby allied land
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no American casualties, and we are achieving
good coverage of our targets. And as a result we are advancing our
goal of containing Saddam Hussein,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the goal of the operations is to
``significantly degrade'' Saddam's ability to threaten his other
Middle East states and build weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are diminishing his ability to attack his neighbors _
either conventionally or with weapons of mass destruction,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen spoke, a second round of cruise missiles began falling
on targets in Baghdad and in key areas in the southern and northern
parts of Iraq where Saddam is believed to be hiding key elements of
his weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles were launched primarily from B-52s. Smaller fighter
planes also flew along Iraq's border dropping laser-guided bombs on
various sites, including suspected storage and manufacturing
facilities for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Air
fields, air defense sites and a number of military bases were also
targeted. Military food storage facilities and other infrastructure
sites that could be used to sustain his army were also hit,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes also took place on or near a number of palaces or other
complexes known to be used by Saddam on occasion, although U.S.
officials were quick to point out that the Iraqi dictator was not
being targeted specifically. The palaces have also been identified
as possible hiding places for elements of his chemical, biological
and nuclear programs, as well as his centers of his command and
communications operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been tracking Saddam Hussein by day and Saddam
Hussein was not the objective established for this operation,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen emphasized that the U.S. and British firepower was
concentrated primarily on military targets to minimize the chance
of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not attacking the people of Iraq, and we have no desire
to increase the suffering that Saddam Hussein has imposed on his
own people,`` Cohen stressed.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there ``are a number of facilities that could
probably be characterized as dual-use'' that house both legitimate
civilian manufacturing operations as well as questionable
activities related to Saddam's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have civilian activities on certain floors and
inappropriate activities on others,'' he continued. ``So we have
been careful in our targeting to try to limit it to military types
of targets that would minimize the potential for harm to innocent
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that targets had been scrutinized closely before
the attacks began to determine which ones housed chemical or
biological elements that might be released if bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very scrupulous in looking at those targets and
trying to minimize any possibility of that,'' Cohen said, adding
that there's been no indication thus far ``that any kind of release
or anything has taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also noted that no activities have been detected that
would suggest Saddam is preparing to launch retaliatory strikes at
U.S. and British forces, Israel or Kuwait as he did with his Scud
missile attacks during the Gulf War.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented
a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President
Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to
admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on
adulterous affairs in his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are
individuals working together with the media who are investigating
my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may
be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming
historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement
after appearing before a shocked House Republican conference to
head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing his admissions in a closed session, Livingston's
colleagues gave him a standing ovation of support and said the
question of his resigning had never arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans,
according to lawmakers who were present.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the president's fate would go forward,
Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions between the
speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that
has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president is
charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of
power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered no immediate comment, but Republicans were
braced to hear Livingston's admissions alluded to in the debate
Friday by Democrats who have decried the investigation of the
president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his
sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had
received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several times
told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that ``I was
running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There was a
reason for those words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on
occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my
marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his brief prepared
statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations
against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure everyone that
these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have
never been asked to testify under oath about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities,
disclosed in ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new
jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the
momentous debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in
office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee who is to bring the impeachment charges against the
president, previously was cited by a magazine for an extra-marital
affair in his past. Then, as on Thursday night, Republicans voiced
suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president instigated
media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's
principal accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But no proof was offered as Republicans left their conference,
facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised to be
bare-knuckled in its partisanship. Livingston left the conference
surrounded by Capitol police, not taking questions from waiting
reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rallied in
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional
question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly
investigation of private lives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the
Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not
disclose its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the
sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year
advertised an offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e
of members of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart because we're all subject to human
frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as he left the
conference. ``This is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone,''
he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented
two separate issues. ``We've got a duty to do under the
Constitution.''

FREE SPIRITS AT THE FAMILY TABLE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Wis.)  (af) 
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All happy people have steady incomes, but every unhappy person
is a paycheck short each month.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Tolstoy didn't say that, but many parents could have. At no
time does this unspoken maxim hang in the air more heavily than
during the holiday season, when families gather around Jell-O molds
and eggnog, firing off questions as if they were prosecutors in an
impeachment inquiry: Are you seeing anyone? Is it serious? Does he
make a good living? And how good is yours?
</P>
<P>
   Therapists warn people attending holiday reunions to avoid
topics like relationships, weight or money _ all of which can raise
the tension level. Instead, we are advised to stick to safer
subjects, like fruitcake recipes or Mother Teresa, that are geared
to maintaining Yuletide harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Consider my family. I'm a 30-year-old freelance writer, and my
brother, Ray, 28, is an actor and stand-up comedian. Our vocations
are synonymous with erratic incomes, exorbitant health insurance
rates, quarterly tax payments and endless waits for overdue checks.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, our older sister, Hillary, 32, makes a bundle
as the director of global operations at a high-technology company
in Silicon Valley, has two engineering degrees from Stanford and an
MBA from Santa Clara University in California and lives in a
four-bedroom, two-bath home with a businessman husband, a baby and
two dogs.
</P>
<P>
   My parents have never fretted openly about Ray's and my career
choices or compared them unfavorably with our sister's. And while
most parents never shout, ``You're a financial loser,'' their
children may interpret some of their words as misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have always told me to keep my chin up, to keep
plugging away,'' says Stacey Zackin, 28, a career adviser in Los
Angeles. ``But then they'd hand me a check just to be nice, and I'd
feel so lame. Why did I have to take money from them? It was their
pleasure, but I felt like I should have been able to make it on my
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In my family, the zings are also unintentional _ Mom and Dad are
just expressing their concern, after all _ but the questions are
more direct. ``How are you paying your rent?'' I once was asked.
And a question aimed at my brother was: ``How can you be secure
with no steady income?''
</P>
<P>
   Ray tells me that while living from paycheck to paycheck isn't
great, it works for him. ``But for them,'' he said of our parents,
``it's not the way a normal human being lives.'' How a normal human
being lives, of course, depends on the definition of normal.
</P>
<P>
   But for many parents, who have dedicated their lives to
providing for their children and saving for their own retirements,
normal living definitely includes health insurance, pension plans
and an armchair with backrest. And, oh yes, a steady income.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Treu, 38, an independent master carpenter who works
from project to project on movie, television and theater sets and
lives in Manhattan, knows all about familial holiday inquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   He has made it a point never to work more than 10 months out of
12, and he has often packed his bags on a moment's notice and moved
to a distant place to take a job that captured his imagination. For
a long time, he says, his parents didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was in real-estate construction for 25 years; he didn't
understand the way I worked,'' he recalled. ``He'd say, `How are
you making it?' But I'm making it great. I'd work 10 months and
take in about $65,000. I'd turn down work, and they'd say, `How can
you do that?' But once you've been in a field long enough, you know
another job always comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, his parents, who live in Milwaukee, finally got
it. While they were visiting New York, he took them to see Kaufman
Astoria Studios in New York, where he has often worked. ``That's
when they saw I was in a good situation,'' he said. ``People came
up to me, asked if I was free to work next Thursday, if I was
available for this gig or that. My folks realized I was O.K., that
I had plenty of work, and they haven't bugged me since.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many parents whose children choose unconventional
careers reach such conclusions. After all, if the kids have
survived this long without begging for money or sleeping in the
gutter, they probably will be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Parents see that the phrases ``9 to 5,'' ``company car'' and
``expense account'' are simply not in our lexicon _ but that we can
still be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Now that my brother and I have some career triumphs, my parents
have stopped asking us, ``How much do you think you'll earn this
year?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when my family and I sit down to holiday dinner this
year, we'll be playing it safe. There will also be friends at the
table, so we'll make polite conversation and stick to the
financial, emotional and spiritual woes of other people. Thank God
for Bill Clinton.

<P>
   When impeachment came, after long months of legislative
stalemate and partisan struggle over how to rebuild the Union, it
came swiftly. No long-winded preliminaries in committee hearings.
No careful testing of the political waters back home.
</P>
<P>
   Swept up in oratorical passion for the sanctity of the
Constitution and the Republic, the House of Representatives debated
for a scant 14 hours and then voted, for the only time in history,
to impeach a president.
</P>
<P>
   The president was Andrew Johnson, derided by his enemies as the
``accidental president'' who had taken office on Lincoln's
assassination and who, they maintained, was bent on mocking the
will of Congress. The date was Feb. 24, 1868, and the country was
deeply divided over Reconstruction. With the House visitors'
gallery packed to overflowing and a snowstorm raging outside,
Johnson was impeached on a partisan vote of 126-47, with 12 members
absent.
</P>
<P>
   The ardor of that distant drama may well echo in the same hall
Friday when the House convenes to debate whether to impeach
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, whose Senate trial began a month after impeachment,
the process ended in acquittal, by only one vote. He served out the
few months remaining in his term and even found a measure of
accommodation with his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But the House debate, lofty and hackneyed by turns, gave no hint
of that outcome. As the congressional anger at him peaked that
stormy week in February, a Washington correspondent for The New
York Times wrote that ``if anyone can believe what he sees with his
own eyes and hears with his own ears, Johnson's term of office is
likely soon to come to a miserable, mortifying and ignominious
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a pro-Union Democrat, had clashed with the
Republican-controlled Congress ever since assuming office three
years earlier. At its heart, their conflict was over how to treat
the defeated Confederacy. It was a battle not only of ideology but
also of politics: Democrats and Republicans alike hoped to win
Southern votes in any postwar reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson favored leniency to the former rebels and a speedy
return to civil government in the South. To undermine the
Republicans' Reconstruction policy, which demanded that Southern
states guarantee racial equality and voting rights for freed slaves
before rejoining the Union, the president had begun purging
military officers in the South who favored the Republicans'
Reconstruction policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' radical wing twice tried to impeach him. The
first effort failed to clear the House Judiciary Committee. The
second made it to the House floor in December 1867 but was doomed
by intraparty fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two months later, however, Johnson went further to
challenge Congress than he had before: On Feb. 21, he discharged
the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, an ally of Johnson's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The summary dismissal amounted to an invitation to a showdown,
since it violated the Tenure of Office Act, which Congress, over
the president's veto, had enacted the year before to limit his
ability to remove federal appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Stanton's dismissal set Washington afire. The ousted
secretary locked himself in his office overnight, and his
Republican congressional allies rallied to his side. When the House
convened the next morning, members once again called for Johnson's
impeachment. This time the proposal was referred not to the
Judiciary Committee but to the Reconstruction Committee, which met
behind closed doors for two hours and, after a party-line vote of
7-2, emerged with a recommendation for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With barely a pause for breath, the House debate began, although
the committee had not spelled out what high crimes and misdemeanors
Johnson had committed. (Eleven articles of impeachment, with
violation of the Tenure of Office Act as the centerpiece, were not
written until after the House vote two days later.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate now under way, James Brooks of New York City, leader
of the House Democrats, compared the rush toward impeachment to the
excesses of the French Revolution. Other Democrats gamely tried to
focus the House's attention on the fact that it was the anniversary
of George Washington's birth. One suggested that the House hear a
reading of Washington's farewell address and then adjourn. The
majority, laughing, agreed to the first proposal but rejected the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The House debated until 11:15 that night, a Saturday, and, after
a one-day break, resumed at 10 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 24. People
began lining up outside the Capitol at dawn, in the snow. Three
thousand were allowed in to watch. Reporters estimated that at
least three times that many were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continued, telegrams poured in and were read on
the floor. The Republican Party of the city of Chicago demanded
impeachment. The Democrats of the 4th Ward in Philadelphia opposed
it. The emotion of the day boiled over. One member accused Johnson
of embracing the defeated Southern rebels, ``men fresh from the
halls of treason and the fields of blood.'' But another warned of a
collapse of the currency and economic ruin if the president was
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   During it all, Johnson appeared unperturbed. He sent his private
secretary to the Senate several times with routine messages. On
Saturday and Sunday evenings, he played host at elegant White House
dinners for Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment drew the routinely split Republicans together as no
issue had before. One of them, Rep. James Wilson of Iowa, was
chairman of the Judiciary Committee and had been roundly criticized
for refusing to back impeachment in December. Now, rising in
support of it, he said, ``Guided by a sincere desire to pass this
cup from our lips, determined not to drink it if escape were not
cut off by the presence of a palpable duty, we at last find
ourselves compelled to take its very dregs.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m., one of the fieriest of Johnson's foes, Thaddeus
Stevens, rose to speak but found his voice too weak. The clerk read
his written statement. It was the last speech before the fateful
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to be the temporary triumph of a political
party,'' Stevens said, ``but is to endure in its consequence until
this whole continent shall be filled with a free, untrammeled
people or shall be a nest of shrinking cowardly slaves.''

   LIVINGSTON ADMITS EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS
   Eds: Corrects name in headline.
   By CHRISTI HARLAN
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a confession that will add fuel to an already
overheated impeachment debate, incoming House Speaker Bob
Livingston, R-La., said Thursday that he had ``on occasion
strayed'' during his 33-year marriage but was quick to distinguish
his infidelity from the one that threatens Bill Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not
with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify
under oath about them,'' Livingston said in a statement distributed
after he admitted the affairs in a meeting with House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's admission came less than 13 hours before the House
is scheduled to begin debate Friday morning on whether Clinton
should be impeached on charges that he lied under oath about his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He had
decided some days ago not to preside over the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the speaker-to-be's confession is sure to further enrage
House Democrats who were already furious Thursday that the
Republicans would schedule a debate and vote on impeachment while
Clinton is performing his duties as commander-in-chief of the U.S.
armed forces attacking Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, including Livingston, were bristling Thursday
night that yet another GOP leader had been forced to acknowledge
marital problems under the threat of possible exposure in the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   The last and, until Thursday, most visible target was Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., whose long-ago affair was
reported by the Internet magazine Salon as the committee began
considering impeachment articles against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, in his statement, said he was confessing, in part,
``because of forces outside of this institution seeking to
influence the upcoming events and/or media coverage of these
events.'' He did not elaborate, and said, ``this will be the only
statement I will make on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans were quick to point down Pennsylvania Avenue:
``We feel like the White House is behind a lot of this,'' said Tony
Rudy, deputy chief of staff to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas. DeLay had asked in September for an FBI investigation of
the source of Salon's story on Hyde, saying Republicans ``will not
be intimidated by this kind of sleazy activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders, including the outgoing fourth-ranking
leader, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, bypassed reporters and cameras
without comment, looking weary and disbelieving after a week in
which House members reassembled in Washington to deal with
impeachment, only to be confronted with bombing in Baghdad and
another bombshell under their own roof.
</P>
<P>
   Both a White House spokesman and aides to House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston had been nominated as House speaker by Republicans
just five weeks ago to replace Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., whose decision
to resign in the days after his party's poor showing in the Nov. 3
election rocked the Capitol. Challenges to other leaders roiled the
Republican delegation for days, until the conference settled on
Livingston, who had been chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee and was prepared to try to unseat Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in the basement of the Capitol, Republicans rallied
again around their selected speaker, who said the other reasons for
his admission were the ``tremendous trust and responsibility my
colleagues have placed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who in March suggested that because Clinton ``cheated on
his wife, he will cheat on the American people,'' spoke out for
Livingston on Thursday night, Rudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston ``didn't lie under oath. He didn't lie in a
deposition. He didn't lie to a grand jury,'' Rudy said. Livingston
admitted his infidelity ``in a forthright, honest and honorable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., agreed Thursday ``there's no
comparison here, there's no parallel'' between Livingston's and
Clinton's situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is here under articles of impeachment because he
refused to deal with the Paula Jones case, and he swore under oath
before a grand jury and in a deposition, and there is good evidence
that he obstructed justice,'' she said. ``The issue before the
Congress is did the president disobey the law ...not sex, or the
president and Mrs. Clinton's private family life.''

THE GOSPEL, WITH SUGAR ON TOP  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Vt.)  (af) 
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   He always wanted to fly the skies. But when his boyhood dream of
becoming an airline pilot was thwarted, Mark Bontempo found another
route to the heavens: selling candy and clothes emblazoned with
verses from the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier business forays weren't so spiritual. Bontempo, who
qualified for his commercial pilot's license just out of college,
couldn't find work in the tight airline job market of the early
1990s, so he turned to freelance work as a corporate pilot. He also
worked part-time as a clerk in a private patent office in Essex
Fells, N.J., where he came up with a business idea: attaching an
edible handle to Oreo cookies _ a creation he called the Dunky.
</P>
<P>
   He took the idea to a food trade show, where he met Jerry
Greenfield, co-founder of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, and later
arranged to talk with him at its headquarters in Burlington, Vt.
Greenfield didn't buy the idea, Bontempo said, but the experience
offered a business lesson: ``It is possible to get into high places
and talk to important people.''
</P>
<P>
   As often happens with entrepreneurs, the inspiration for his
next product began with a problem he encountered in everyday life.
A devout Christian, Bontempo distributed religious pamphlets as
part of a local street ministry. Most people discarded them almost
immediately, and he wondered how he could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at my desk when it hit me like a bag of
nickels,'' he said. `` `Testamints'! Candies bearing the Lord's
message. And people would hold on to the Bible verse, because it
would be right on the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident that he had a winner, he quit his job and flew to
Chicago to talk to Rainer Schindler, the chief operating officer of
Ragold Inc., maker of Velamints. Schindler said he liked the idea,
but was concerned that the company, based in Karlsruhe, Germany,
``would be very sensitive about either slighting Jesus or profiting
through the use of God's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was intrigued enough to give Bontempo a ticket to a
candy convention in California. There, Bontempo approached the
makers of Chiclets, Pez candies and Trident gum, but they, too,
didn't bite. Discouraged, he returned home.
</P>
<P>
   It was about then, in 1994, that he got the call _ from
Continental Airlines, that is _ offering him the job he had once
coveted. ``I was 34, and I knew that they only hired until about
age 40, and so the window was narrowing,'' he said. ``I went for a
prayer walk. And though it wasn't quite like Saul on the road to
Damascus, I felt a sense of assurance that Testamints was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned down Continental's offer and, with $130,000 in capital
raised from local Christian businessmen, created Food for Thought
(later renamed Testamints Inc.) in Randolph, N.J. Again he went to
Schindler, who was more receptive now that Bontempo had both a
business plan and financing.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler agreed to produce Testamints in three flavors, with
the design of a cross on every mint and a passage from Scripture on
each package of 12. (Schindler said he also put posters in the
German production plant, assuring workers that the candies were
intended to be inspirational, not sacrilegious.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is meant to be encouraging,'' Bontempo said of the
messages. ``There aren't any `turn or burn' selections.'' An
example is ``We love because He first loved us'' (1 John 4:19).
</P>
<P>
   Testamints hit the market in 1996 and quickly became a big
seller in Christian bookstores. Bontempo expects revenues to reach
$3 million this year, up from $1 million the first year. QVC, the
home shopping channel, recently started selling the confections in
collectors' tins.
</P>
<P>
   Testamints doesn't divulge earnings but says it contributes 10
percent of profits to Christian ministries.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the business going, Bontempo decided to replace
himself as chief executive last year, though he remains the
majority shareholder. He handed the reins to Alfred Poe, most
recently the president of the Campbell Soup Co.'s meal enhancement
group.
</P>
<P>
   Poe has since expanded the product line to fruit sours and
Promise Pops, which are likewise wrapped in Scriptural sayings, and
plans to introduce Spanish-language Testamints soon. A born-again
Christian, Poe said his goal is to reach further into the secular
market, so that ``you can find a Testamint wherever you find a Life
Saver.''
</P>
<P>
   Bontempo, meanwhile, has set out in new directions. In 1997, he
was the co-founder, with Valerie Fritz, of the Wee Witness Clothing
line, which includes Bibbles _ baby bibs with Bible verse. By the
end of this month, he said, Appalachian Inc., a large distributor
of Christian products, will have the apparel in 4,000 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the Gospel to the masses, of course, is a
2,000-year-old enterprise. But lately, evangelism has gone
commercial in a big way, with sales of Christian music, fiction,
clothing and now candy. And Bontempo, a supplicant not so long ago,
today plays the role of deal maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, this guy comes into the office and says he wants
to put verse on the side of Chap Stick and call it `Chapters' and
be 50-50 partners,'' Bontempo said. He declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Bontempo? Commandmints, anyone? He's already
patented the name.

MEXICAN AUTOPSY REPORT INDICATES TEXAS REPORTER STRANGLED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Texas newspaper reporter found dead in the
mountains of western Mexico had been strangled and his body left in
a ravine, authorities and friends said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered federal police to
assist the state police investigation of the murder of Philip True,
50, the Mexico City-based correspondent for the San Antonio
Express-News. True disappeared while on a hiking trip through a
remote section of mountains of western Mexico, about 150 miles
northwest of Guadalajara. His body was found Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Press and writers' organizations, among them the hemisphere-wide
Inter American Press Association, urged Zedillo to spare no effort
to bring True's killers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely anxious that the circumstances surrounding
Philip True's death should be established,'' the IAPA's president,
Jorge E. Fascetto of Argentina, said in a letter to Zedillo, ``and
we therefore welcome your announcement that `no effort will be
spared in investigating this regrettable crime.'
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we remain concerned at the fact that the majority of
similar cases in Mexico go unpunished.'' In the last year, Fascetto
said, five newsmen have been killed in Mexico and their assailants
had not been brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   True, an experienced hiker who enjoyed writing about people in
remote areas of Mexico, left for the Sierra Madre Occidental
mountains Nov. 29 for a vacation and an opportunity to research the
region's Huichol indians. He had agreed to call his wife, Marta, on
Dec. 8, but a call never came.
</P>
<P>
   She raised an alarm several days later, and friends, state
police and soldiers began tracing his route. A friend, Fred Chase,
located the body in a deep ravine near the border of Jalisco and
Nayarit states.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the searchers said they believed that True had fallen
to his death. But an autopsy carried out on Thursday by the Jalisco
state medical examiner, Dr. Mario Rivas Souza, found that True had
been strangled with a piece of cloth, possibly a cord or a
neckerchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a murder,'' said Rivas Souza, ``not an accident.`` The
medical examiner's report also listed numerous cuts among the
reporter's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing was unclear. Although True's backpack
and camera were missing, his assailants did not take his watch or
wedding ring, said Express-News reporter Susana Heyward.
</P>
<P>
   Even though drugs are sometimes cultivated in the area, True did
not intend to report about anything controversial during the trip,
his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Simon, Latin American coordinator for the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists, said that ``based on what I have
heard so far, it seems that he was killed because of his work.'' He
called on Mexican federal authorities to take over the
investigation and expressed concern that state police officers
might use heavy-handed methods to obtain false testimony from local
Huichol indians.
</P>
<P>
   The PEN International writers' group also called on Zedillo to
carry out ``an exhaustive investigation to discover the
circumstances of True's death.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said that although there was at this
time ``nothing to suggest he was killed because of his work as a
journalist,`` authorities would carry out a thorough investigation
before ruling definitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all still a bit confused and it is difficult to say
exactly what happened,'' the spokesman said. ``I think we have to
wait for a more detailed investigation, identify all his personal
items and other such things so that we don't enter into
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Attorney General's Office said late Thursday that
True's remains would be brought to Mexico City where federal
investigators would conduct a second autopsy aimed at establishing
``the type, origin and cause of injuries and the time of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Born June 18, 1948, in San Fernando, Calif., True graduated from
the University of California at Irvine. He moved to New York, where
he worked on the docks and as a maritime union representative,
before heading to Texas. He changed professions, and got his first
newspaper reporting job in 1990 at the Brownsville Herald. He
joined the Express-News in 1992 and became the paper's Mexico City
reporter in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of friends and family, as well as colleagues from both
the foreign and Mexican press corps, were expected to attend a
memorial service Friday in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is pregnant with the couple's first child. &QL;

STERN SENDS PLAYERS HOLIDAY LETTER OF DIFFERENT SORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an attempt to portray the National Basketball
Association as good-faith bargainers and sway more than 400
players, Commissioner David Stern has mailed out a nine-page
document detailing the owners' latest collective bargaining
proposal to the union's membership.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, sent by overnight mail on Wednesday and complete
with charts, graphs and explanations, seemed a clear indication of
how much the players and owners have become entrenched in their
positions as they approach the new year without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the 1998-99 season slips away from us, it is critical that
I communicate directly to you,'' Stern wrote in the cover letter.
``I recognize and respect your right to reject these proposals.
However, it is important that there be no doubt that the precise
terms you consider to be such a `bad deal' that you would prefer to
lose the entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the general concessions made by the NBA, Stern said
they were made in response to ``your union's forceful assertion of
your concerns.'' The league proposal included:
</P>
<P>
   _ No hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   _ The retention of the Larry Bird exception (a clause which
enables teams to sign their own free agents for whatever they
want).
</P>
<P>
   _ No immediate changes to free agency timing rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ A limit to the escrow tax that would be collected from
players' paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union executive director, dismissed the letter
as evidence of frustration on the league's behalf and added that
nothing the document contained was news to the players. The union
issued a formal 16-page, point-by-point response late Thursday
night and said it would send the document to its players by
overnight mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too concerned about it, other than it hints that I
haven't made a full disclosure to our membership,'' Hunter said.
``Our players are fully aware of what their proposal is. It's
another effort to try to sweat our players.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter added: ``They know what I want. I know what they want.
It's just a matter of getting together and putting it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first two and half months of the season being lost
to a lockout, no talks have been scheduled in the nearly
sixth-month-old labor dispute _ a fight over the sharing of the
league's $2 billion in annual revenue. Stern is leaving for his
Colorado vacation home this weekend and may be gone for more than a
week. Hunter, who was not scheduled to return to his home in
Oakland, Calif., until Christmas Eve, moved up his travel plans by
two days because of Stern's departure.
</P>
<P>
   With the principal negotiators leaving New York for the
holidays, it appeared that a bargaining session would not transpire
until after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's letter was also released to the national news media
Thursday. It contained a 12-point summary of the league's principal
economic terms for a new deal, including details about maximum and
minimum salaries, salary cap exceptions, annual raises for players,
changes to the rookie wage scale and length of a new deal, which is
proposed at six years with an option for a seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposals have been released in some form over the
past two months, but several changes to previous proposals were
disclosed for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   They included a maximum contract length of seven years for
players who sign a Bird contract, an increase from six years.
Players who don't sign Bird contracts could sign a deal for six
years, up from five years; allowing a team to use the new
``middle-class exception'' to re-sign its own free agent, instead
of limiting it to another team's free agent; and an increase in the
maximum allowable raise, from 10 percent on Bird contracts and 5
percent on other contracts, to 12.5 percent on Bird contracts and
7.5 percent on other deals.
</P>
<P>
   As for when the two sides would meet again and try to salvage
the season, Hunter could not say. But downplaying the personal rift
between he and his counterpart, Hunter did say he had spoken to
Stern by telephone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called to say hello and see how I was doing,'' Hunter said.
``He wanted to dispel the notion that he doesn't call me. He said
he'll call again to wish me a Merry Christmas. I said I'd do the
same and wish him a Happy Hanukkah. We're cordial and pleasant with
one another. That's not the issue. The issue is, when does he want
to make a deal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's just an issue of making a call,'' Hunter
added. ``I have to feel they're willing to negotiate.''

   OIL PRICES FALL 10.9 PERCENT AS IRAQ OUTPUT FEARS EBB
</P>
<P>
   With the air strikes on Iraq causing no damage to its ability to
pump and ship oil, prices plunged, wiping out a large part of the
gains of the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil fell 91 cents, or 8 percent, to $10.45 a
barrel, on London's International Petroleum Exchange. It also
plunged to $11.03 a barrel, down $1.35, or 10.9 percent, in trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The decline also reflected
disappointment with a meeting in Madrid by the oil ministers of
some of the world's largest oil producers _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Mexico _ to initiate further production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged bombing attack on Iraq, a terrorist attack against
the West or an Iraqi strike against Israel would most likely bring
international travel to a halt. The current fighting has caused
relatively little concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of improved demand for American products abroad, the
Commerce Department said the trade deficit unexpectedly dropped to
$14.2 billion in October after having narrowed in September to a
revised $14.4 billion. In a separate report, the Labor Department
said the number of first-time jobless claims filed last week fell
to the lowest level since September.
</P>
<P>
   LIVENT COULD FACE FRAUD CHARGES
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators intend to file civil charges against Livent,
the Broadway theater producer, and some former employees for
securities and accounting fraud, according to documents the company
has filed in bankruptcy court. And the U.S. attorney in Manhattan
is deciding whether to bring criminal charges against Garth
Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, the company's founders, a lawyer
representing Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   COLTEC DISPUTES CRANE SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Coltec Industries, before agreeing to merge with B.F. Goodrich,
never received a formal purchase offer from Crane, raising serious
doubts about Crane's interest in the company, Coltec's chief
executive said. As a result, Crane's lawsuit seeking to block the
deal is without merit, Coltec said.
</P>
<P>
   BIG SHARE BUYBACK BY PHILIPS ROYAL
</P>
<P>
   Philips Electronics, Europe's largest maker of consumer
electronics, will reduce the number of its outstanding common
shares by 8 percent, the company said. Philips received about $6
billion in cash last week from the sale of its 75 percent stake in
Polygram, and the company said it had earmarked about $2 billion
for a share buyback. The American depository receipts of Philips
rose $2.625, to $64.625 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT DENIES SABOTAGE CLAIM
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a government witness' testimony that Microsoft had
sabotaged a program designed to gather evidence against the
company, lawyers for the software giant offered an explanation to
the judge presiding at the trial of its antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS AT NIKE FALL 51 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the world's top athletic shoe and apparel seller, said
that its second-quarter earnings dropped 51 percent amid soft
conditions in retailing. The company said earnings fell to $68.9
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $141.1 million, or 48
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results slightly
exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   SOFT-DRINK SHOWDOWN IN VENEZUELA
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, which once held an overwhelming lead over Coca-Cola in
Venezuela but then lost it when its bottler switched to Coke, is
battling back in the country's soft-drink market. This marks the
first time Coke and Pepsi have been simultaneously present in the
Venezuelan market at full strength, and analysts predict it will be
a long and costly entanglement.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He always wanted to fly the skies. But when his boyhood dream of
becoming an airline pilot was thwarted, Mark Bontempo found another
route to the heavens: selling candy and clothes emblazoned with
verses from the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier business forays weren't so spiritual. Bontempo, who
qualified for his commercial pilot's license just out of college,
couldn't find work in the tight airline job market of the early
1990s, so he turned to freelance work as a corporate pilot. He also
worked part-time as a clerk in a private patent office in Essex
Fells, N.J., where he came up with a business idea: attaching an
edible handle to Oreo cookies _ a creation he called the Dunky.
</P>
<P>
   He took the idea to a food trade show, where he met Jerry
Greenfield, co-founder of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, and later
arranged to talk with him at its headquarters in Burlington, Vt.
Greenfield didn't buy the idea, Bontempo said, but the experience
offered a business lesson: ``It is possible to get into high places
and talk to important people.''
</P>
<P>
   As often happens with entrepreneurs, the inspiration for his
next product began with a problem he encountered in everyday life.
A devout Christian, Bontempo distributed religious pamphlets as
part of a local street ministry. Most people discarded them almost
immediately, and he wondered how he could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at my desk when it hit me like a bag of
nickels,'' he said. `` `Testamints'! Candies bearing the Lord's
message. And people would hold on to the Bible verse, because it
would be right on the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident that he had a winner, he quit his job and flew to
Chicago to talk to Rainer Schindler, the chief operating officer of
Ragold Inc., maker of Velamints. Schindler said he liked the idea,
but was concerned that the company, based in Karlsruhe, Germany,
``would be very sensitive about either slighting Jesus or profiting
through the use of God's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was intrigued enough to give Bontempo a ticket to a
candy convention in California. There, Bontempo approached the
makers of Chiclets, Pez candies and Trident gum, but they, too,
didn't bite. Discouraged, he returned home.
</P>
<P>
   It was about then, in 1994, that he got the call _ from
Continental Airlines, that is _ offering him the job he had once
coveted. ``I was 34, and I knew that they only hired until about
age 40, and so the window was narrowing,'' he said. ``I went for a
prayer walk. And though it wasn't quite like Saul on the road to
Damascus, I felt a sense of assurance that Testamints was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned down Continental's offer and, with $130,000 in capital
raised from local Christian businessmen, created Food for Thought
(later renamed Testamints Inc.) in Randolph, N.J. Again he went to
Schindler, who was more receptive now that Bontempo had both a
business plan and financing.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler agreed to produce Testamints in three flavors, with
the design of a cross on every mint and a passage from Scripture on
each package of 12. (Schindler said he also put posters in the
German production plant, assuring workers that the candies were
intended to be inspirational, not sacrilegious.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is meant to be encouraging,'' Bontempo said of the
messages. ``There aren't any `turn or burn' selections.'' An
example is ``We love because He first loved us'' (1 John 4:19).
</P>
<P>
   Testamints hit the market in 1996 and quickly became a big
seller in Christian bookstores. Bontempo expects revenues to reach
$3 million this year, up from $1 million the first year. QVC, the
home shopping channel, recently started selling the confections in
collectors' tins.
</P>
<P>
   Testamints doesn't divulge earnings but says it contributes 10
percent of profits to Christian ministries.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the business going, Bontempo decided to replace
himself as chief executive last year, though he remains the
majority shareholder. He handed the reins to Alfred Poe, most
recently the president of the Campbell Soup Co.'s meal enhancement
group.
</P>
<P>
   Poe has since expanded the product line to fruit sours and
Promise Pops, which are likewise wrapped in Scriptural sayings, and
plans to introduce Spanish-language Testamints soon. A born-again
Christian, Poe said his goal is to reach further into the secular
market, so that ``you can find a Testamint wherever you find a Life
Saver.''
</P>
<P>
   Bontempo, meanwhile, has set out in new directions. In 1997, he
was the co-founder, with Valerie Fritz, of the Wee Witness Clothing
line, which includes Bibbles _ baby bibs with Bible verse. By the
end of this month, he said, Appalachian Inc., a large distributor
of Christian products, will have the apparel in 4,000 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the Gospel to the masses, of course, is a
2,000-year-old enterprise. But lately, evangelism has gone
commercial in a big way, with sales of Christian music, fiction,
clothing and now candy. And Bontempo, a supplicant not so long ago,
today plays the role of deal maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, this guy comes into the office and says he wants
to put verse on the side of Chap Stick and call it `Chapters' and
be 50-50 partners,'' Bontempo said. He declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Bontempo? Commandmints, anyone? He's already
patented the name.

ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER SERAPH: LAST-MINUTE GIFTS UNDER $250,000

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Your internet stocks have sizzled. Your law firm had
record billings, having represented various parties called before
the independent counsel. Against Denver, you took the Giants and
the points.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, you were simply born with a silver spoon in your
mouth and a Silver Dawn in your garage.
</P>
<P>
   It's the season for giving, and you'd like to share your good
fortune with the object of your affection. A diamond is forever and
fur may be what becomes a legend most, but nothing says ``I love
you'' quite so conspicuously as a Rolls-Royce. And this year there
is an all-new Rolls, the Silver Seraph, that outshines the lights
on almost any tree. It will also make a dent in the average wallet,
with a price that starts at $216,400, plus luxury tax of nearly
$13,000.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck, toss in the most popular options _ it's the
holidays, after all. The top five are full wood-veneered door
panels ($990); light burl oak trim, instead of walnut ($1,055);
four umbrellas fitted into the trunk ($300); an electric sunroof
($1,820), and chrome-plated wheels ($2,990). And who would object
if you dug a little deeper to cover the $65,000 tea set sold in
conjunction with Wedgewood?
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Seraph replaces the Silver Spur and is the first
all-new Rolls-Royce in nearly two decades. It is the last developed
under British control, and the last produced at the company's
historic plant in Crewe, England, where Rolls-Royces are now built
alongside Bentleys.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in a takeover tale filled with as many intriguing
twists as the Cornwall coast, two German companies, BMW and
Volkswagen, battled to gain control of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
which had put on the block by its parent, Vickers PLC. After a
series of offers and counteroffers, VW sealed a deal for $790
million, many times the initial estimates of what the company was
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, it was disclosed that BMW had actually obtained
for $65 million the rights to the Rolls name, which were held
separately by Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet-engine maker that had been
split off from the car company in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   VW was forced into negotiations with BMW, and the companies
agreed to split the baby: VW will keep Bentley, and until 2003 will
keep producing Rolls-Royces. BMW will continue to supply engines,
and after 2002 it will have exclusive rights to the Rolls name, the
distinctive grille and the elegant Flying Lady hood ornament _
which on the new Silver Seraph retracts under pressure into a trap
door on the hood, so as not to impale a pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   A Rolls for the 90s and beyond, the Silver Seraph is trimmer
than its predecessors and tailored like a Savile Row suit. Yet it
is immense, timeless and readily recognizable as a Rolls. Its
designers were inspired by the classic Silver Cloud of 1955-65.
Even the name continues to draw on celestial imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Seraph is precisely and everything one expects a
Rolls to be, with a fillip: As the last blue-blood British design,
it may have special resonance with collectors. (On the other hand,
if Rolls' new owners carefully nurture the brand, as Ford has done
with Jaguar, there may be little price difference between this and
future models.)
</P>
<P>
   Hand-stitched Connolly leather covers virtually every interior
surface including, quite wonderfully, the headliner. Aside from the
black-leather dashboard, the color is creamy vanilla, and dark
piping accents the curvaceous seats.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once seated, you are tempted to remove your shoes and socks and
wiggle your toes in the furry Wilton carpet. All the instruments
are new, the gauges encircled with chrome bezels for a timeless
look. There is nary a speck of plastic, and only the unexceptional
controls of the Alpine stereo, familiar to BMW owners, seemed out
of sync with the elegant motif.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many automobiles, the Silver Seraph pampers
rear-seat passengers as much if not more than the occupants up
front. That is only fitting, since many Rolls owners rely on
chauffeurs to get them around. (Bentley owners are more likely to
drive themselves.) With enough legroom for the NBA's tallest
players, the rear seats heat and electrically adjust the lumbar
support.
</P>
<P>
   Back-seat passengers also have their own large heating ducts and
polished wood writing tables that fold from the back of the front
seats. The trunk is big enough for multiple sets of Louis Vuitton
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its ownership of Rolls, BMW participated heavily in
the development of the Silver Seraph and it supplies the car's
powerful V12 engine, the same one used in the BMW 750iL. Nearly a
third of the parts in the Silver Seraph are already shared with BMW
models, and more parts-sharing is likely with BMW becoming the
future owner.
</P>
<P>
   Though hidden from view, BMW's influence _ in the parts and
engineering _ apparent when driving the Silver Seraph, which is the
most capable Rolls of recent times. The body structure is extremely
rigid, providing a ride that is nothing short of heavenly even over
the hellishly potholed roads of southern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is appropriately ponderous but with no wallowing,
it is far better than any Rolls built before. The 322 horsepower
under the hood, coupled with a smooth and modern five-speed
transmission, moves the three-ton Silver Seraph rather quickly,
from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than six seconds. Modern
features include a refined suspension system and a stability
control that keeps the rear-drive car from spinning out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Silver Seraph is less about how it drives than about how
it parks. The Silver Seraph earns the best parking spots in town,
and it will make sure your loved one gets the attention that he or
she deserves. Valet parking attendants at the finest restaurants
leave it right up front as testimony to their clientele.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night at the symphony, the Silver Seraph won a spot
right outside the door of the auditorium. (Numerous concert goers
tried to claim the Rolls as their own, the attendant reported;
other times, passersby posed for pictures around the car, as if it
were a historic landmark.)
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions, so common around the Rolls, underscore the car's
appeal as a first-tier status symbol. The new Mercedes-Benz S-Class
is technologically superior. The Jaguar Vanden Plas also exudes
British class.
</P>
<P>
   A Lexus LS 400 rides nearly as smoothly and quietly. All three
cars cost far less. And the Rolls lacks rather mundane features
like side air bags, which one can now have on a $16,000 Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   But like a $30,000 Patek Philippe that keeps no better time than
a $300 Seiko, value and practicality are beside the point. If it's
better to give than receive, what better way to give the gift of
status?  &QL;

SUPER BOWL: SAINTS VS. SEAHAWKS?
</HEADLINE>
 REPEAT FOR RIVERSIDE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BUZINSKI  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could New Orleans and Seattle really end up in the Super Bowl?
You bet they can, though it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the NFL playoff possibilities with two weeks remaining
in the regular season:
</P>
<P>
   NFC
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (12-2):
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have clinched a playoff spot. They will win the
division and have a first-round bye by defeating Detroit this week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (11-3):
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have clinched a playoff spot. They will clinch the
division and have a first-round bye by winning their last two games
and if Atlanta loses to Detroit this week (based on best record vs.
common opponents).
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Saints will win a playoff spot with two
wins (against Arizona and Buffalo) and one Tampa Bay loss (based on
head-to-head wins over Arizona and Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (4-10)
</P>
<P>
   and Carolina (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the end of Daylight Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (13-1):
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have clinched the Central Division and a first-round
bye. They will clinch home field advantage through the NFC playoffs
this week with either a win and if Atlanta beats Detroit by less
than 68 points, or an Atlanta loss.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Packers will clinch a playoff berth with one win or one loss
by either Tampa Bay or Arizona. The only way for the Packers to not
make the playoffs would be to lose twice while Arizona and Tampa
each win twice. The Packers will almost certainly be the NFC's
fifth seed and have to play a wild card game at San Francisco or
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers will clinch a playoff berth with two wins and one
Arizona loss or two Green Bay losses. It is also mathematically
possible for Tampa to qualify at 8-8, but it would take up more
space than the Ken Starr referral.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Chicago (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the season premiere of the ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (8-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will clinch the NFC East with one win or one Arizona
loss. The only way for the Cowboys to miss the playoffs is to lose
twice while Tampa Bay beats Washington this week (based on a worst
record vs. common opponents with Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will clinch their first playoff berth since moving
to the desert in 1988 with two wins, or a win this week coupled
with one Tampa Bay loss and one loss or tie by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   New York (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will clinch a playoff berth with two wins, two Tampa
Bay losses, plus one loss each by Arizona and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Philadelphia (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when Mark McGwire had only 40 homers.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented
a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President
Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to
admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on
adulterous affairs in his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are
individuals working together with the media who are investigating
my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may
be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming
historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement
after appearing before a shocked House Republican conference to
head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing his admissions in a closed session, Livingston's
colleagues gave him a standing ovation of support and said the
question of his resigning had never arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans,
according to lawmakers who were present.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the president's fate would go forward,
Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions between the
speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that
has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president is
charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of
power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered no immediate comment, but Republicans were
braced to hear Livingston's admissions alluded to in the debate
Friday by Democrats who have decried the investigation of the
president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his
sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's reluctant admission underlined growing anxieties
haunting the impeachment showdown, with members of Congress far
from certain that the private lives of additional lawmakers will
not become subject to disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who are investigating me or others of my colleagues,
please understand that I will not be intimidated by these
efforts.'' Livingston declared. ``These efforts will not deter me
from performing my sworn duty under the Constitution as a member of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had
received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several times
told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that ``I was
running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There was a
reason for those words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on
occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my
marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his brief prepared
statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations
against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure everyone that
these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have
never been asked to testify under oath about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities,
disclosed in ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new
jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the
momentous debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in
office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee who is to bring the impeachment charges against the
president, previously was cited by a magazine for an extra-marital
affair in his past. Then, as on Thursday night, Republicans voiced
suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president instigated
media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's
principal accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But no proof was offered as Republicans left their conference,
facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised to be
bare-knuckled in its partisanship. Livingston left the conference
surrounded by Capitol police, not taking questions from waiting
reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rallied in
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional
question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly
investigation of private lives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the
Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not
disclose its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the
sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year
advertised an offer of a $1 million bounty for information about
members of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart because we're all subject to human
frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as he left the
conference. ``This is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone,''
he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented
two separate issues. ``We've got a duty to do under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans seemed even more dedicated to the impeachment
effort. Rep. Bob Frank, R-N.J., said the indiscretions were
``extraordinarily different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One is between Speaker Livingston and his wife,'' Frank said.
``The other involves felonies committed by the president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who was informed of the news
on the CNN show, ``Crossfire,'' said, ``It makes for a horribly
confused jury setting'' in the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   While Livingston acknowledged his infidelities, he said he would
offer no details in order to spare innocent parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chapter was a small but painful part of the past in an
otherwise wonderful marriage,'' he said.

MORE REPORTS OF IOC FAVORS EMERGE IN UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The son of a leading International Olympic
Committee member from Africa worked as an intern at City Hall while
Salt Lake City was attempting to become the host city for the 2002
Winter Games, the mayor's office said Thursday. The admission
raised more questions about the extent to which an effort was made
to sway votes in landing the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And Tom Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake City
organizing committee, said in an interview that visiting IOC
members had been given presents such as shotguns, skis and free
lift tickets, airplane flyovers of Utah's arresting canyons, and
tickets to the opera and Utah Jazz basketball games, and had been
taken on hunting trips for pheasant in a successful attempt to
attract their votes.
</P>
<P>
   These were the latest eruptions in a mushrooming vote-buying
scandal among cities seeking to play host to the Olympics that has
been alleged by Marc Hodler of Switzerland, the
second-highest-ranking member of the IOC. Salt Lake officials have
acknowledged spending about $400,000 on scholarships and athletic
training for 13 people, including six relatives of IOC members, but
they have denied Hodler's charge that this money amounted to
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigations of the Salt Lake charges are being conducted,
one by the IOC and one by the ethics panel of the Salt Lake Olympic
organizing committee. Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday
that the Justice Department's criminal division was reviewing the
matter amid reports that the scholarship fund was not reported on
federal tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has said that it will not take the 2002 Winter Games
away from Salt Lake City, which won in a landslide vote in 1995
over Ostersund, Sweden; Sion, Switzerland; and Quebec. But there
has been a furor here, and embarrassment over allegations of vote
buying is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   One Salt Lake City councilwoman reiterated her call for the
resignation of top local Olympic officials. A meeting of the
organizing committee's executive board is scheduled for Friday, and
members are under pressure to come forward quickly and openly with
details of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One issue certain to be investigated is the employment of
Sibusiso Sibandze of Swaziland in the management-services office at
City Hall from Oct. 25, 1993, to Oct. 28, 1994, and whether that
was an attempt to curry favor with IOC members who determine which
city will hold the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze is the son of David Sikhulumi Sibandze, the IOC member
from Swaziland, said Ken Connaughton, a spokesman for Salt Lake
City Mayor Deedee Corradini.
</P>
<P>
   Connaughton said, ``As near as I can determine, no one knew'' of
Sibandze's family connections. He said there was no apparent
evidence that the internship was connected to the Olympic bid.
Sibandze worked for $6 an hour at City Hall while he was a student
at the University of Utah, where he received a bachelor's degree in
1995 and a master's degree in business administration in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both Connaughton and the office of the university's dean of
students said they did not know whether Sibandze had attended
school on an Olympic-related scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake Olympic officials declined to discuss the matter,
saying they preferred that it be handled by the two current
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, details of lavish gift-giving to IOC members
continued to emerge. Welch said that ``two or three'' IOC members
had been given shotguns and pairs of skis.
</P>
<P>
   Browning Arms, the Utah-based maker of Browning shotguns,
acknowledged that Salt Lake Olympic officials had bought one
12-gauge shotgun in 1997 for $1,039.50, and said it was
investigating whether other guns had been purchased or donated. IOC
members are not allowed to accept gifts with a value of more than
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and other Salt Lake Olympic officials have also
acknowledged doing what all bid cities do _ flying IOC members in
on first-class tickets, putting them up in the best hotels and
taking them to the nicest restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's largest health-care provider, Intermountain Health Care,
has also said that at Welch's behest three people with apparent
Olympic connections were given medical services ranging from
treatment for hepatitis to eye surgery to a knee replacement at a
total cost of $27,675 in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said that he and other Salt Lake Olympic officials were
simply playing by the long-accepted rules of the bidding game, and
that IOC members were wooed as if they were corporate executives
who might relocate their headquarters to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we did anything that was different'' from other
bid cities, Welch said. ``It is a process of wining and dining and
building relationships. I don't know any other way you could have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reports of bribery were ``way out of proportion'' and
that ``anticipation far exceeds reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   IOC members have long had a reputation as elitists whose votes
can be bought with gifts and favors, but as many as 40 of the 115
members have become so concerned about that reputation that they
have stopped visiting cities bidding on the Olympics, according to
Dick Pound, an influential IOC member from Montreal who is
conducting the investigation of Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uncomfortable feeling,'' Pound said. ``I don't want
people to look at me sideways when they see I'm an IOC member.
There's no reason to put up with it. Some of us are so concerned
with the perception, we don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough IOC members do visit, however, that the reputation
persists. Howard Peterson, a former president of the U.S. ski
federation, said that Welch and another high-ranking Salt Lake
Olympic official, Dave Johnson, complained to him in 1990 or 1991
about being placed in an uncomfortable position by members of the
IOC over expensive jewelry and airplane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One incident, Peterson said, involved the failure of an IOC
member to reimburse Salt Lake officials for the purchase of a
$10,000 diamond brooch. The other, he said, involved a complicated
scheme by which IOC members stood to make thousands of dollars by
redeeming airline tickets provided by cities seeking to hold the
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were clearly irritated'' over what they considered IOC
pressure, said Peterson, who served in various leadership positions
at the ski federation from 1981 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Welch denied ``absolutely, categorically'' that these events or
conversations with Peterson took place. Johnson did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deeda Seed, a councilwoman, said that for more than a year she
had heard rumors about a scholarship fund, but that they were
denied by Welsh, Johnson and Frank Joklik, the current president
and chief executive officer of the Salt Lake organizing committee.
She called for the resignations of Johnson and Joklik. Welch
resigned last year after pleading no contest to a charge of spousal
battery.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys need to go,'' Seed said. ``This is the epitome of
the corruption that has crept into the Olympic movement. It's not
about the glory of sport; it's about the glory of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake lost by four votes in 1991 to Nagano, Japan, to hold
the 1998 Winter Games and appears to have concentrated on wooing
the votes of African IOC members for the vote in 1995, which
awarded Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. Approximately 20 IOC
members are from Africa and they can form a powerful voting bloc.
Africans were most of the recipients of Salt Lake's $400,000
scholarship and training program, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake scandal broke in November when a local television
station reported a leaked 1996 letter from Johnson discussing the
final tuition payment of $10,000 to Sonia Essomba, the daughter of
an IOC member from Cameroon who attended American University in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Rene Essomba, who died this year, was head of the
association of Olympic committees in Africa and exerted
considerable influence. Salt Lake officials have described the
scholarship money for Essomba's daughter and others as humanitarian
aid, not an attempt to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that have angered many here is that Salt
Lake's bid for the 2002 Winter Games was technically superior and
stood a strong chance to win on merit alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we had to do this because everybody else was doing
it, but we don't ever have to be immoral or unethical,'' said Henry
Marsh, a four-time Olympic steeplechaser and a member of the Salt
Lake organizing committee's board of trustees. ``If somebody broke
the rules, they've got to be held accountable. Paying for
scholarships for relatives of IOC members is not humanitarian aid.
If you stretch the definition that far, you have stretched
definitions farther than President Clinton has.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When toting up expenses to determine New York City's
sky-high cost of living, don't forget to include the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Not just the bucks doled out each day to cab drivers and coffee
jockeys. It's those year-end holiday checks to doormen and dog
walkers, porters and parkers, nannies and dry cleaners and barbers
and personal trainers that really add up.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, people in other cities tip the help, too, but an informal
canvas shows that the tab in the Big Apple is as outsized as most
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that follows the pattern of higher wages. House
cleaners all over the country, for example, generally get an extra
day's pay for the holidays. For Virginia Dangerfield in Sun Valley,
Nev., that means $35, but for maids in Manhattan, it is closer to
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, New Yorkers pay more because more people have
their hands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a steady group of people in your life who help your
life run _ and that's what living in New York is about _ then you
have to show your appreciation,'' says Kathy Braddock of the
Intrepid New Yorker Co &UR; . &LR; , a consultant that helps people adjust to
life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Braddock said the $100 she gives her Upper East Side doorman
more than pays for itself. If she's running late, for example, she
just calls and asks him to drop a quarter in her parking meter to
avoid a $55 ticket. ``It's amazing that you can sit in your home
and they deliver your liquor, they deliver your laundry,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Braddock estimates that she spends about $1,500 a year on
tips, far more than on Christmas gifts for her husband and two
children. In contrast, Jean Gamble, a management consultant who
lives in a high-rise in Chicago's Gold Coast area, puts her total
at $350. And even that dwarfs the largess of Judy Skillman, a poet
and professor in suburban Seattle, who slips maybe $20 to the house
cleaner, end of story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm stingy, maybe I'm Scrooge,'' Ms. Skillman said. ``I
just never think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside New York, frugality rules. Sherman Reiner, a retired
sweater salesman in Stamford, Conn., gives the paper boy, mailman
and garbage collectors $10 each. He raised it from $5 about 20
years ago. ``I didn't take the cost of living into account,'' he
said. ``I also don't give them vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people interviewed in Chicago, Seattle and Nevada
said they tipped out of guilt or habit, many New Yorkers were
motivated by fear. At one Manhattan parking garage, the holiday
tote board shows that the guy in space 41 gave $450; other regulars
might well wonder what might happen to their cars if they failed to
return the envelopes left on their windshields. Likewise, some
veteran city dwellers say, &UR;  &LR; ignore the Christmas card from your
building's superintendent at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   Building staffs prefer cash, of course. ``Cookies are for kids,
not for me,'' said Michael Grabsky, an Upper West Side doorman. But
etiquette experts say other service personnel should get a personal
gift, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gamble gives her hairdresser Champagne or some soaps. ``If
you don't tip your hairdresser, you'll be bald,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions, however, can be complicated. ``I used to make
bottles of quite powerful eggnog, but it's hard to know now,'' said
Frank Gould, who owns three ranches along the Nevada-Utah border.
``Half the world has problems with spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gould is giving his 10 ranch hands winter jackets and
sending them to the annual Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Some people insist on the personal touch. George Gorham, a
doctor who lives in Manhattan House, a block-long building on the
Upper East Side, hand-delivers about 25 checks to the staff instead
of giving a lump sum to a fund that distributes contributions.
 &UR;  &LR; Workers in service industries say they rely on tips to make ends
meet _ but also spend some of the loot on holiday gifts or on tips
to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought a lot about holiday tipping until I became
this kind of worker,'' said Mrs. Dangerfield, the house cleaner in
Nevada. ``Now I give Christmas bonuses to the garbage collector,
the newspaper deliverer and the recycling guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write them a nice thank-you card, too,'' she added. ``When
you do work that's at the lower end of the social order, your own
dignity can take a battering, and the sense of appreciation is even
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Newman, who runs Mitchell's Newspaper Delivery Service, a
Manhattan company with 40,000 customers, remembers the tips he
received as a paper boy on Beekman Place when he was 9, including
shirts from a woman who owned a clothing company; shaving lotion
from Lee Bristol, a former head of Bristol &AMP; Myers (now
Bristol-Myers Squibb), and $100 from Irving Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Newman's company sends out a collective Christmas card and
splits the proceeds among the drivers. Most tips range from $10 to
$50, he said, though he got one for $1 this year and another for
$400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out saying on the card, `This is not a
solicitation,' '' he recalled. ``One or two people a year say, `Yes
it is.' They're right.'' &QL;

   The heart of the affluent Las Mercedes neighborhood in Caracas,
Venezuela, got a 150-foot artificial Christmas tree this year. The
avenue around the tree was blocked off last month so that thousands
of people from the Venezuelan capital could be brought in to watch
Santa Claus arrive on a Coca-Cola truck, scattering souvenirs to
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of the kids and people from the barrios who don't
have shoes or shirts in any kind of repair, it was the first time
you'd seen them in this area,'' said Brent Willis, president of the
Coca-Cola division that oversees Venezuela. ``When Santa Claus came
in, they got to see the free celebration, and nothing comes for
free to these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar trees and mass gatherings are planned in scores of
villages across the country. The Christmas campaign, aimed squarely
at what Willis refers to as ``the hearts and minds'' of Venezuela's
22 million people, is one sign of how intensely the Coca-Cola Co.
is battling for the soft-drink market in Venezuela, which for 50
years was one of the few places in the world where its rival
Pepsico Inc. held an overwhelming lead.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in August 1996 with a deal that ruptured
Pepsico's joint venture with a local bottler and shifted everything
that had been Pepsi's to Coca-Cola. The loss of one of its
top-performing international markets was an enormous blow to Pepsi,
which sued Coca-Cola over it and won $94 million in damages from an
international arbitration court.
</P>
<P>
   For close to a year after that, it was difficult to buy any
American soft drink but Coke in Venezuela. But these days, Pepsi is
teamed up with another local bottler, Polar, and is roaring back
with a combination of deep discounts, heavy advertising and more
and more cold-drink coolers everywhere from airports to mom and pop
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first time Coke and Pepsi have been
simultaneously present in the Venezuelan market at full strength,
and analysts predict it will be a long and costly entanglement for
both, particularly now that Coke's bottler is matching Pepsi's
discounts. It is not just financial interests that are at stake in
this country half the size of Texas, but issues of corporate
identity deeply rooted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``To dismiss the sentimentality of the Venezuelan market to
Pepsi would be naive,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage industry
analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who says Pepsi has
``steadily and consistently'' increased its market share over the
last three months, to an estimated 29 percent. ``There are emotions
and profitability at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts question whether Pepsi can continue spending as
heavily as it has been. A spokesman for Pepsi said that along with
its discounts, the company had installed more than 50,000
refrigerated display cases, known as ``visi-coolers,'' in the last
year, trying to match the 75,000 that Coke's bottler has set up.
Pepsi has about 1,500 delivery routes operating and expects to add
200 more by the end of the year, covering about 90 percent of
Venezuela, which extends from the Andean highlands in the south to
the Caribbean in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Coke, meanwhile, has already spent more than $1 billion in stock
and cash through its major bottler in the region to buy the former
Pepsi bottler, owned by Oswaldo J. Cisneros, Gustavo A. Cisneros
and other members of the Cisneros family, one of the country's
leading business clans. The purchase was completed by the publicly
traded Panamerican Beverages Inc., known as Panamco, nearly a year
after Cisneros switched allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   The original move by Cisneros turned over what had been Pepsi's
network and manufacturing assets to Coke almost overnight. One
Pepsi executive, who arrived in Caracas in October 1996, one month
after the Cisneros switch, said there was no sign that Pepsi had
ever been in the country at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing, because there were 50 years of signs and
machines that literally had been covered over in the matter of a
month,'' said William Mullenix, Pepsi-Cola's franchise director in
Venezuela. ``You could peel them back and see the Pepsi
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Coke claims to be slightly amazed at how fast it all
happened. ``We're surprised that after almost two years, we have
overtaken what it took Pepsi 50 years to build,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's market share in Venezuela has dwindled recently. A year
ago, it had 81 percent, but the combination of Pepsi's onslaught
and a market weakened by devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar has
reduced that share to 70 percent. In addition, the decision in
September to match Pepsi's aggressive discounting to retailers has
squeezed profits, leading at least one analyst to conclude that it
would not be a very merry fourth quarter for Panamco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their profitability is going to be very weak, and you could
see a loss,'' said Laura D. Meizler, a beverage industry analyst
for Salomon Brothers Smith Barney. ``The discount is not even being
passed on to the customer. The retailer is keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meizler expects the situation to stabilize eventually, with
Panamco retaining a 70 percent market share and benefiting from its
infrastructure and distribution network, both of which are larger
than Polar's. Because Panamco did not have to invest in equipment
in Venezuela, its focus has been on execution and brand-awareness
programs for consumers, ``instead of focusing on building
infrastructure as Pepsi has been forced to do,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, ``the current level of discounting is
clearly not sustainable,'' according to a recent report by Ms.
Meizler on the company's activity in Venezuela. And other industry
experts say some of the Panamco equipment will need to be replaced
before long, requiring additional capital from the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   In advertising, Coke has a budget of more than $50 million for
Venezuela this year, Willis said, which includes 35 television
commercials that are often locally made.
</P>
<P>
   And curiously, Coke's advertising is leaning on at least one old
Pepsi slogan. ``Consumers see Coca-Cola as the choice of the new
generation,'' Willis said, intentionally evoking the old Pepsi
campaign. ``Here Pepsi is the historical brand, and Coca-Cola is
the one that is new and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   What may turn out to be the wild card in all of this is the
joint-marketing agreement announced last month between Pepsico's
Frito-Lay division and Polar. The plan to sell potato chips and
other salty snacks together suggests an even closer bond with
Polar. Venezuela may prove an important international test for what
Pepsico's chairman, Roger A. Enrico, has called ``the power of
one,'' referring to the combined strength of Pepsi's products.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Venezuela is turning out to be the stage for one of
the more intense confrontations between the two soft-drink giants.
``Before now, there was a monopoly,'' Mullenix said. ``Over the
last two years, this place went from blue to red to red and blue.''

   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry predicted Thursday that he would
report to spring training on time with the Yankees in March, even
though he must receive chemotherapy treatment at least once a week
until April after undergoing colon cancer surgery two and a half
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, everything will be back to normal and people will
wonder if I ever had cancer,'' Strawberry said. ``People are saying
that to me now when they see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a conference call, Strawberry said he has had no
significant side effects from the chemotherapy treatments, which he
started by taking five in one week in November, and added that he
has gained 25 pounds to increase his weight to 210. The 36-year-old
outfielder and designated hitter, whose playing weight is 215, said
he lifts weights five days a week with a trainer to restore the
strength he lost before and after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Though doctors learned that the cancer had spread to one of the
36 lymph nodes that were removed during the surgery, Strawberry
said that he has not undergone any tests since to determine if the
cancer has spread. He said he would meet with doctors in New York
next month.
</P>
<P>
   In case he is not fully cleared to play by opening day and in
order for his $2.5 million contract for next season not to count on
the Yankee payroll, Strawberry will agree to a minor league
contract next week.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, have contributed a design to
the V Foundation for Cancer Research. It will be used in a tie as
part of the Jimmy Valvano neckwear collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never could have imagined I would be where I am today when I
look back at October,'' Strawberry said. &QL;

GOP TO BEGIN HISTORIC IMPEACHMENT DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans on Thursday announced their
intention to begin a historic impeachment debate Friday morning
despite Democrats' accusations that it was irresponsible to
consider removing the commander in chief while U.S. forces were
dropping bombs on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate, set to begin at 10 a.m. EST, even many
Democrats concede the president is likely to become only the second
president in U.S. history to be impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton faces four articles of impeachment on perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power, stemming from his
efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol, Democrats and Republicans jousted over the
procedure for the debate. Democrats refused to agree to a
Republican proposal to have a 16-hour debate over two days, with a
vote on the four articles of impeachment Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders responded that they would fall back on
established procedure, which calls for a vote after one hour of
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The House could extend the debate each hour if the majority of
the members approve. A vote to impeach would send the matter to the
Senate for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., dashed any hope of a
quick end to the ordeal by ruling out suggestions that the Senate
might move to censure the president rather than hold a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any deal making. The Senate has to go forward
with a trial,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Speaker-designate Robert Livingston, R-La. said
that his chamber must proceed with the impeachment debate because
the voters want the matter dealt with and no one could predict how
long the military action may take.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terribly unpopular item,'' he said. ``Nobody wants
to deal with it. But we must deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the incoming speaker may have further clouded the debate
when he chose to admit to the Republican caucus Thursday night that
he had been unfaithful to his own wife of 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most members said Livingston's confession was not likely to
change any votes on impeachment, though some thought it might
affect the tone of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston already had agreed to postpone by one day the
impeachment proceedings, originally scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been under severe pressure from GOP colleagues who
are furious with Clinton for launching the military strike a day
before impeachment proceedings were to begin.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats fired back that beginning debate while military
action is under way would be demoralizing to U.S. troops and would
send a dangerous message to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, said he envisioned split television
screens ``showing bombs being dropped while Republicans are saying
you can't trust this commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., charged that Republicans were
guilty of trying to undermine the president's job as commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of war anyone who conspires against the commander in
chief, that comes a lot closer to high crimes and misdemeanors than
where the president's hands were at any given moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, seized on Clinton's comments that the
impeachment debate would not affect his intention to complete the
military action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And some lawmakers dismissed the suggestion that servicemen
would be affected by events in Washington
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Vietnam coming down in a parachute I didn't give
a rat's rear what Congress did,'' said Rep. Duke Cunningham,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling over the timing of the impeachment debate capped
another surreal day in the nation's capital as the grave realities
of the bombing of Baghdad clashed with the partisan maneuvering
over efforts to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol several thousand people protesting the
impeachment listened to civil rights leader, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, and others attack Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in the House Judiciary Committee was a toppling of
the presidency of the United States. There was no fairness. There
was no integrity,'' said Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a member of
the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bickering over timing it has become increasingly
clear what the outcome will be as most of the moderate Republicans
whom the White House had hoped would side with the president have
indicated in recent days they will vote to impeach. On Thursday two
more GOP lawmakers, Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., and Rep. Heather
Wilson, R-N.M., said they would vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the Judiciary
Committee and staunch supporter of the president, conceded, ``it
looks pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank was one of the few Democrats who said it did not matter to
him when the impeachment occurred saying, ``I don't think it makes
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Public polls taken Thursday night showed that feelings about
impeachment had not changed as a result of the Iraq bombing. As
before the bombing, most of those surveyed opposed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While the moderate Republicans said they were voting their
consciences and had not been pressured by their leadership, Frank
said they were succumbing to ``right-wing pressure.'' He said that
many feared a primary challenge from conservatives if they vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who gathered outside the Capitol vowed to return for the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just angry,'' said Doug Reimel, a 30-year-old computer
analyst of Sterling Va. ``Angry that even though what Clinton did
is despicable, it is by no means worth dragging the country through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a coup d'etat by the conservative right wing,''
said 74-year old Betty Fenton of Lancaster, Pa., who noted that she
had not been to a demonstration since her son returned from the war
in Vietnam.

<P>
   The trip from gown to town can be a bumpy one. Just ask anyone
who has invested in small-capitalization stocks. According to a
number of impressive academic studies, small-company stocks have
significantly outperformed their larger-cap brethren over the long
term _ a pattern known as the small-cap premium. Yet in the real
world over the last 15 years, despite spurts of outperformance,
small caps have generally lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors 9-10
Small Co. fund, the index fund that most closely follows the
methodology of the academic studies. It invests in the 20 percent
of New York Stock Exchange stocks with the smallest market
capitalizations, as well as companies of similar size on the
American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ; such companies, on average, are
much smaller than those in the typical small-cap fund.
 &UR;  &LR;  DFA 9-10 Small Co. produced a 9.9 percent annualized return over
the last 15 years, through Sept. 30, according to Lipper Inc.,
versus 16.2 percent for the Vanguard Index 500, which tracks the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a large-cap benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, small-cap stocks have rallied forcefully since
August, leading some people to predict that they will soon reassert
their historical dominance. But so far, such a belief is proving,
as Samuel Johnson once said, to be a triumph of hope over
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the small-cap rally has been, the large caps have
performed even better: The Index 500 gained 22.5 percent from Aug.
31 to Dec. 11, versus 13.4 percent for the DFA fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several schools of thought have emerged to explain what is
happening to the small-cap premium. Each appears to hold a portion
of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   According to one school, it was wrong to ever think that the
small-cap premium was very large in practice. This group says
academic studies were seriously flawed because they ignored the
higher transaction costs incurred when trading small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs are substantial, according to research by Donald B.
Keim, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania. Keim looked at the total costs of trading _ not
only commissions and bid-asked spreads, but also the impact of
trading on the prices of securities being bought or sold _ between
1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He found that total trading costs for the buying and selling of
the smallest stocks were sometimes more than 7 percent. For the
largest stocks, by contrast, they were about one-half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such costs can quickly devour the small-cap premium. According
to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm, that advantage,
before trading costs, was just 3 percent, annualized, from 1925
through 1981. (Comparable figures are difficult to obtain after
1981, when Ibbotson started taking trading costs into account.)
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that the small-cap premium was a figment of a
few finance professors' misguided methodology? Some people say yes,
but Economics 101 tells us otherwise. Assuming a relatively
efficient market, small-cap stocks must outperform large caps over
the long term, in order to reward investors for their greater risk
and lower liquidity. This school holds that there must be a
small-cap premium in reality, not just in theory.
</P>
<P>
   If so, transaction costs are at most a contributing factor in
explaining the lack of a small-cap premium over the last 15 years.
One factor that can explain it is the growing institutional
dominance of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Harvard professors, Paul A. Gompers and Andrew
Metrick, the fraction of the United States stock market held by
large institutions nearly doubled from 1980 to 1996, from 28
percent to 52 percent. But, for a variety of reasons _ including
restrictions on what percentage of a company's outstanding stock
such investors can hold _ only a tiny amount of that institutional
ownership is in small caps. This has hurt the performance of small
caps by reducing the demand for them, relative to large stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the increasing institutional dominance of the
market has led to enormous stock market share being shifted from
small caps into large caps. No wonder that the small caps have had
such a hard time keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for small-cap investing is that this trend can't
last forever. And when it stops, or reverses, large caps will no
longer enjoy their performance advantage. No one can pinpoint when
this will happen, but the longer it takes, I believe, the stronger
the small caps' subsequent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Small caps will someday outshine large caps again. Yet even this
silver lining is accompanied by a gloomy cloud. The small caps'
relative advantage will not be big enough to pay the huge
transaction costs that would accompany frequent trading. &QL;

HOUSE DECIDES TO GO AHEAD WITH IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House leaders cleared the way Thursday for
President Clinton's impeachment, scheduling the historic debate for
Friday despite scathing dissent from Democrats about deciding
Clinton's fate during the US attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The move preceded another bizarre twist in the impeachment saga,
as the House speaker-designate, Robert L. Livingston, Thursday
night disclosed to the 228-member Republican caucus that he has
engaged in adulterous affairs during his 33-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments foreshadowed an extraordinary session Friday
when the House debates whether Clinton is fit to remain in office
in the face of four impeachment charges stemming from his
extramarital affair with the former White House intern, Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there will be turmoil and chaos on the House
floor,'' said Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat
who opposed Clinton's impeachment as a member of the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote on the four articles of impeachment Friday
or Saturday, depending on the outcome of a parliamentary protest by
Democrats who accuse GOP leaders of trying to bring down the
president at the possible expense of military morale and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural skirmish erupted as lawmakers in both parties
predicted the House will send at least one impeachment charge to
the Senate for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130
years.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown also formed the backdrop for charges and
countercharges over the timing of the attack on Iraq. Lawmakers in
both parties tossed about terms like ``treason,'' ``treachery,''
and ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' referring either to
colleagues or to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to believe that if we have this debate while bombs
are being dropped . . . that we do not invite some action on the
part of our enemy to take advantage of this situation at the cost
of our men and women in uniform,'' said Representative Patrick J.
Kennedy of Rhode Island, a member of the National Security
Committee and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, several hours before his stunning personal
disclosure Thursday night, said the House had a constitutional duty
to act on the impeachment charges despite the military assault on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to go forward Saturday,'' Livingston said on
the House floor. ``Let's not prolong the harm to the country by
hanging the issue out in this body.''
</P>
<P>
   In the showdown, Democrats blocked a plan by Republican leaders
to hold 16 hours of debate Friday and Saturday on the impeachment
charges: two counts of perjury and one count each of obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, GOP leaders said they would pursue several options,
including a bipartisan compromise to extend the debate longer than
the one hour that is permitted under the House rules.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a deal, Republican sources said, they will use an
unspecified parliamentary procedure to expand the debate throughout
the day, with votes on all four charges likely Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is scheduled to start Friday at 9 a.m., although it
could be delayed an hour or more as party leaders engage in final
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, showed
little willingness to yield, saying he would object to staging the
impeachment debate ``Saturday or the next day or any day'' while
the attack on Iraq is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they also plan to exploit the parliamentary
arsenal to protest the refusal by House leaders to permit a vote on
an alternative to impeachment, such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the leadership's resistance to the censure option,
Representative Amo Houghton, a New York Republican who had
discussed his censure proposal Wednesday with Clinton, Thursday
withdrew it in futility, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic whip, David E. Bonior, a Vietnam veteran from
Michigan, said he will file a motion to adjourn the proceedings
Friday until US military action has ended, an effort that
Republicans are certain to reject.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment debate, originally scheduled to start Thursday,
was postponed by GOP leaders so the House could pass a resolution
praising US troops participating in the attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   During the one-day political truce, Clinton continued to lose
the support of one Republican after another and picked up only two
of the remaining undeclared lawmakers. Notable among the GOP
moderates turning against him was Representative Stephen Horn of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties estimated that more than 220
lawmakers will support at least one impeachment charge _ 218 votes
are needed for impeachment _ a survey by the Associated Press
showed that 197 members favor impeachment, 192 oppose it, and 46
are undeclared or not disclosing their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House officials held out little hope of Clinton
surviving the House vote. But they refused to concede publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately we think that members, when they go in to the House
of Representatives and cast one of the most important votes in
their life, if they move forward based on the facts, the
Constitution and the law, we don't believe the president will be
impeached,'' said White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution supporting the US troops in the Persian Gulf
passed 417-5, but the apparent consensus was hardly on display as
the debate unfolded for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, numerous Republicans had accused Clinton of
launching the air strike on Iraq to try to stave off impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on you for breaking the long-standing tradition that
leaves party politics at our nation's shores,'' said Representative
Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on both the Judiciary
and National Security committees. ``Shame on you for playing into
the hands of Saddam, who clearly staged his latest act of defiance
to coincide with the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy went further. ``I think it actually borders on treason
to assume that this president would actually sacrifice men and
women in uniform for his own political objectives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, a New York Republican and
former marine, had blasted Clinton the night before, saying,
``Never underestimate a desperate president.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Representative Brad Sherman, a California Republican,
said: ``Never underestimate a desperate partisan whose lust for the
president's blood causes him to make statements which
unintentionally give aid and comfort to the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and others retreated in part from their assault on
Clinton's motives. But they refused to grant Clinton more than a
one-day truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a crippled, weakened president, and he can't be damaged
any more than he is now,'' said Representative Tillie Fowler of
Florida, vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. ``The
American people want to get this over with.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's leading congressional foes, Representative Dan
Burton, an Indiana Republican, said the House had put off the
impeachment vote as long as it needed to by passing the resolution
praising the US troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting around here is not going to change anything,'' Burton
said. ``We might as well go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and a battery of war veterans held a news conference to
defend the decision to proceed with the impeachment debate
</P>
<P>
   ``As a prisoner of war'' in Vietnam, said Representative Sam
Johnson, a Texas Republican, ``I remember Democrats calling for
Nixon's impeachment. I haven't seen a war of any sort that has
stopped the Congress of the United States from doing its
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats disagreed. Representative Maxine Waters, a California
Democrat, confronted Solomon on the House floor about his comments
the previous night, saying his remarks were ``unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat, drew on
language in the impeachment resolution to denounce some
Republicans. Rangel, who won a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star
during the Korean War, told reporters that the initial GOP
criticism of Clinton over the US military effort was tantamount to
``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel added: ``You can't separate the president from the
commander in chief. You can't salute him in the morning and lynch
him in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rangel and Waters expressed reservations about the
bombing of Iraq. ``I don't like it. I wish it hadn't happened,''
said Waters. ``But I'm not going to question the president. I
support these soldiers because they're in it.''

COUPLE ABANDONS FANCY WEDDING FOR HURRIED VOWS IN BASE CHAPEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCHORD AIR FORCE BASE, Wash. _ Senior Airman Manolito Carrabis
and Faith Schuerch had a lovely wedding planned for Saturday _ but
President Clinton's decision to launch air strikes against Iraq got
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis was told Wednesday night that he was likely to be
somewhere in the Persian Gulf when it came time to exchange his
vows this weekend. So the couple had a hurry-up wedding Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bride wore white.
</P>
<P>
   The groom wore military fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis, a 25-year-old former Las Vegas resident, was one of a
limited number of McChord-based airmen expected to be deployed to
the Persian Gulf as early as Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis and Schuerch decided on a quick wedding at one of the
base chapels after rejecting the idea of putting off their nuptials
until after his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting for a long time to get married,'' his
19-year-old Spokane bride said. ``So it had to be now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis' impending overseas deployment had come with so little
warning and their wedding was rescheduled so quickly that the
couple wasn't even able to reach the bridesmaid to tell her of the
change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerch made do without a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to go through the ceremony without her father
walking her down the aisle. He's still flying in from California
this weekend. But now it will be for a visit, not a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The couple told the chaplain they were ready to tie the knot at
the earliest possible minute _ whenever he was available to perform
the ceremony. And that was early Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplain Gary Ranson married the couple in a simple, double-ring
ceremony in a base chapel decorated with a Christmas tree, 12
poinsettias and eight wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   Then they kissed and hugged in what was to be one of their few
embraces before he was to leave for foreign soil in a time of
military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job,'' said Carrabis, a specialist in defenses against
nuclear biological weapons. ``I promised to defend my country and
that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll miss my family,'' he said, glancing over at the
couple's son nearby. Little Michael Carrabis celebrates his first
birthday on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple now must finish calling this weekend's wedding guests
and tell them the marriage ceremony already had been held.
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis was able to retain the services of his best buddy, Jeff
Berry, as best man. And his mother and several of the men and women
he serves with were on hand for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nothing like what they had planned for this weekend _
lots of Christmas flowers, holiday music and a big spread of food
for the reception attended by lots of family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Those elaborate plans have been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerch, who describes herself as ``a military brat,'' took the
situation with some stoicism yesterday. But that may have been
because she got most of the crying out of her system Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy. And it never gets easier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can I do? I can't go to the president and say, `Don't
take him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis and Schuerch met two years ago in Japan. He was
swearing about something and she turned around and chewed him out
for using bad language in her presence. He immediately apologized.
That chance encounter eventually led to yesterday's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Carrabis, like thousands of military men and women across the
country, was ready to go do his duty for his country last night. He
wasn't happy about going. But he was willing to do his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared or nervous,'' he said. ``In fact, I was fine up
until the 45 minutes of crying she did (Wednesday) night.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1991, the American-led attack on Iraq was perceived the world
round as a wondrous demonstration of military skill. Almost eight
years later, with Saddam Hussein unbowed, unrepentant and untamed,
the high-tech bombings are generating far more questions than awe.
</P>
<P>
   Even setting aside the unavoidable questions about the link
between the bombings and impeachment, foreign policy experts are
asking why the administration has so forcefully changed its mind,
after long arguing that dislodging Saddam could create a dangerous
vacuum, or that serious bombing would endanger the task of UNSCOM,
the U.N. inspectors charged with ending Iraq's development of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   And the experts are asking exactly how the administration
intends to control Iraq's arms programs now that the inspectors
have been withdrawn, and what it will do about Saddam and his
ambitions should he remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from the school that says everyone is a liar, but they
have not convinced me, nor people like me who follow this, why this
makes sense now, and why it didn't before,'' said Leslie Gelb,
president of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a
former columnist for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't convinced me that they can find or destroy the
places where Saddam keeps the chemical and biological stuff, or
that he can't rebuild it rather quickly. They haven't convinced me
that this is better than having UNSCOM there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, military officials said Thursday that they had
deliberately avoided bombing of suspected biological and chemical
weapons plants for fear of unleashing deadly poisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to hit Saddam over the head,'' Gelb added.
``But I want to know the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts argued that the new attacks represent not so much
a change in policy as the latest reaction to a most formidable
foreign-policy puzzle since the American-led alliance stopped short
of toppling Saddam in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Saddam has succeeded in surviving, and in defying
every turn of the economic and military screws, all the while
strengthening his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq policy may not be the most important one,'' said Phebe
Marr, a fellow at the Wilson Center for International Scholars in
Washington. ``Russia, China, the world economy are all much more
important, but Iraq poses some incredibly difficult policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no good answers in Iraq, only ones that are less
good. At every turn we have to plot what course to take now. If we
could get UNSCOM back in and could compel Saddam to comply, we'd
all feel better. But that means UNSCOM has to be doing its job.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's attack was ordered after Richard Butler, the chief
inspector, produced a scathing report that Iraq had failed to give
the cooperation it had promised in November. It was that promise
that prompted President Clinton to abort the attack planned then.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge also insured that this time, the ante would have to
be raised. With every successful defiance of international threats,
force or demands, Saddam has insured that the next action would
have to be tougher. Now at last the administration has declared
that one of its goals is to bring about his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The change is critical. However unpopular Saddam is, ousting him
was never officially adopted as a goal by the Security Council, and
there was a sense in the State Department and among some experts
outside government that without a viable alternative, his fall
would create a chaotic power vacuum that could destabilize the
Mideast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, that argument stands. There is no indication that the
fractured Iraqi opposition in exile is in any better shape today,
nor that the Clinton administration has been actively preparing it
to take power.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the main Iraqi opposition group, the
Iraqi National Congress, said he had met three times over the past
month with Martin Indyk, the assistant secretary of state for Near
East affairs. But Chalabi also said he learned about the current
attacks only five hours before they began.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the administration has evidently concluded that
whatever the consequences, they cannot be worse than Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   This time, as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared
Thursday, ``we have come to the determination that the Iraqi people
would benefit if they had a government that really represented
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this is something that cannot be done
overnight,'' she said, ``and we are working with the various
opposition groups on a longer-range way of trying to help them help
themselves to have a regime that represents them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the history of the past eight years, however, the question
is whether air attacks, however severe, will pry Saddam loose
without an operation on the ground, one that would inevitably
entail casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's a disaster, but will this get rid of him?'' asked
William Quandt, a former National Security Council official under
Presidents Nixon and Carter. ``We know what we want, but we're not
prepared to pay the price to do it. Bombing is the compromise
choice that makes us feel better, that we're somehow punishing
Iraq, though not necessarily Saddam, and we won't take any
significant risks of casualties ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the bombings and the call for Saddam's overthrow
already represent a major risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Arabs have angrily contrasted the pressures on
Saddam to what they perceive as lack of pressures on Israel to live
by its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may feed the feeling, even unfairly, among Arabs _ and
Europeans, too _ that this is domestically driven rather than by a
desire to bring balance to the region,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski,
a former National Security Policy adviser to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest challenge will come when the smoke clears, when
the United States must decide what to do if Saddam is still in
power, or if he is not.
</P>
<P>
   If he remains, argues Robert Kagan, a senior associate with the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Saddam could emerge
greatly strengthened, putting pressure on the United States to take
ever harsher action. And if he does not, the United States would
have to commit a large force to support any new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This requires a very serious commitment of U.S. force,'' Kagan
said, ``to stay as long as it takes to establish a new democratic
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Murphy, a former ambassador to Syria and a senior fellow
at the Council on Foreign Relations, asked: ``Who knows what's in
our interest after all that's happened in the past seven and a half
years? We know that time has been inimical to our interests. As for
the rest, we really have to keep an open mind for some time, until
we get an accurate assessment of what damage has been done, both
politically and on the ground.''

BORAS DEFENDS DEALINGS WITH BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Boras, the agent who negotiated Kevin Brown's
record-setting $105 million deal, said any system that revealed the
nature of contending offers would constitute collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to comments made by the Padres' president, Larry
Lucchino, Boras said such a suggestion is merely a reflection of
``sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, turning down
overtures from the St. Louis Cardinals, the Colorado Rockies, the
Baltimore Orioles and the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the agreement, Lucchino called others
involved in the negotiations and asked rival executives about the
offers they had made to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino suggested Tuesday that Boras was responsible for
``misinformation'' during the negotiations, and that as a result,
the Dodgers, who are owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, paid
perhaps $35 million to $40 million more than the next highest
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino also suggested that baseball owners would discuss a
method by which contending offers could be confirmed _ either
through an independent verifier, announcements to the news media or
a requirement that all offers be made in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about the objective facts about the
negotiations,'' Lucchino said, ``and whether there are flaws in the
structure of the process that allows for blindman's bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a phone interview late Wednesday, Boras attributed
Lucchino's concern to the fact the Padres lost Brown, a top
pitcher, to another team that plays in the same division.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that the Dodgers and Murdoch lack market savvy is
like saying Whitney Houston is tone-deaf,'' Boras said. ``It's a
very arrogant and transparent position to suggest that the Dodgers,
Murdoch and Fox are a willing market patsy.'' Fox is the company
owned by Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Boras continued: ``As to my credibility, Lucchino sought my
counsel before the Padres traded for Kevin Brown, and throughout
the summer he invited me to watch games with him throughout the
summer. All of a sudden my history with Larry Lucchino is in
question, and the only reason it is in question is because Kevin
Brown is now a Dodger.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said he was not surprised that Lucchino would propose a
way for all teams to report their offers, and have a mechanism
through which offers could be verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he should revert to his baseball history; that was tried
under Peter Ueberroth's administration,'' he said, referring to the
former baseball commissioner. ``The clubs did report their offers
to central baseball, and it's called collusion, and they had to pay
$380 million in damages to the players as a result. The suggestion
of such an event is merely a return to activities that are
prohibited in the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no reason for collaborative elements on
this with the players association. This is representing a player,
and you cannot collaborate in negotiation, because it affects the
rights of the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras also represents Bernie Williams, the center fielder who
recently re-signed with the Yankees for a seven-year, $87.5 million
contract. During negotiations, Boras indicated that he had
contending offers of seven and eight years length, and at the time,
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, stated flatly that he did
not believe Boras.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams agreed to terms, the Yankees learned that the
Boston Red Sox had made a seven-year, $91.5 million offer, and the
Arizona Diamondbacks made an eight-year, $100 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Brown negotiations, the Los Angeles
General Manager Kevin Malone said he was entirely satisfied that
Boras negotiated in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't given him that contract,'' Malone said, ``I'm
sure that someone else would have.''

LIVINGSTON DISCLOSES INFIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the most politically sensitive of moments, House
Speaker-designate Robert L. Livingston was forced to disclose
Thursday night that that at some time in the past he had been
unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is set to replace House Speaker Newt Gingrich said a
media investigation of his past had prompted the unusual
announcement, which came as he and other House Republican leaders
were trying to work out the rules for Friday's debate on
impeachment charges stemming from President Clinton's affair with a
former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana Republican made the disclosure to his House
Republican colleagues Thursday night after a Capitol Hill
newspaper, Roll Call, first reported the affairs on its Web site
Thursday. Livingston tried to draw sharp distinctions between his
behavior and the president's, saying in a written statement that
``these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff, and I
have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' He said
the impeachment process would continue with no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers said there was no call for Livingston to
resign at a party caucus Thursday night, and his colleagues had
given him a standing ovation and words of support after he read a
statement about his infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on
occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my
marriage and my family,'' said Livingston, a 55-year-old father of
four daughters. ``I sought marriage and spritual counseling, and
have received forgiveness from my wife and family, for which I am
eternally grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure drew immediate criticism from groups working to
save the president from impeachment. ``The hypocrisy of the
Republican right wing that is driving this impeachment is
shocking,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority
Foundation, a women's rights group. ``Mr. Livingston may not have
lied about his behavior, but he certainly fooled the public,
including voters in his district.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Livingston's announcement would not delay the
impeachment proceedings against the president, which they said are
based on Clinton's alleged perjury and abuse of powers, not on the
mere act of conducting an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts haven't changed,'' said Representative Lindsey
Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the House Judiciary
Committee that drew up the impeachment charges. ``Bob's sins
haven't changed the facts. My sins haven't changed the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas said, ``Previous
mudslinging tactics did not distract this House from its
constitutional duty. This most recent attempt will not prevent this
House from executing its duty to protect and uphold the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's disclosure follows recent confessions of affairs by
Representatives Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee that approved four articles of impeachment last weekend,
Dan Burton of Indiana and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was selected by House Republicans on Nov. 18 to
replace Gingrich, but he does not take office until next month.
Livingston had served since 1994 as chairman of the powerful House
Appropriations Committee, and had emerged as the consensus choice
of Republican members dissatisfied with Gingrich's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he would not discuss details of his affair or
affairs. ``Because these were personal relationships, I have no
intention or desire to reveal any specifics in order to avoid harm
to others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not reveal which media outlet had undertaken the
investigation. In October, Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler and
other sex-oriented magazines, offered up to $1 million to anyone
who provided details of adultery by Repubican leaders and other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston disclosed the infidelity during a GOP caucus that had
been called to discuss Republican strategy for Friday's impeachment
debate. Well into the meeting, according to people at the session,
Livingston rose and said his colleagues would soon be hearing
something unusual about him.
</P>
<P>
   He then read a statement and added: ``My fate was in your
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was applause and support, including encouraging
words from House Minority Whip Tom DeLay, people in the meeting
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus was on our loyalty and respect for Bob Livingston,
and the trauma he and his wife are going through,'' said
Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   She said Livingston was emotional but stoic in addressing the
GOP lawmakers. He spoke with ``the sincerity of apology,'' but ``he
didn't go into any quivering lips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican conference is fully behind him and moving on to
the next piece of business, and the next piece of business is the
impeachment of the president of the United States,'' said one
congressional staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Livingston has struggled in recent days to keep his
Republican colleagues unified behind him. On Wednesday night, he
had presided over a divisive meeting of Republican House members to
debate whether to proceed with impeachment while US forces were
attacking Iraq. Conservative members of the party wanted to vote
Thursday on impeachment, as leaders had originally planned, while
moderate members said it would be better to delay.

   With Gingrich absent, Livingston opened the Wednesday meeting
with a brief statement that his Navy experience told him it was
better not to open the impeachment debate immediately. He then
yielded the floor and listened to his colleagues for nearly three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   When the talking was done, Livingston's light touch had worked.
The Republicans deferred to Livingston, and the impeachment debate
was delayed for a day.

RIVAL SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT

<P>
   The official who headed the Swedish bid that lost the vote to
play host to the 2002 Winter Olympics said Thursday that he wanted
Salt Lake City organizers to reimburse the expenses of their rival
cities if the group is penalized by the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we spent our money in vain,'' said Christer
Persson, the president of the city of Ostersund's bidding
committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Persson acknowledged that stripping
the Olympics from Salt Lake City was impractical at this stage, and
the Olympic committee has already ruled it out. But he said a fine
that would benefit the three other 2002 finalists _ Sion,
Switzerland; Quebec, and Ostersund _ would be an appropriate
punishment for the existence of the scholarship fund that benefited
at least six relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Persson said Ostersund spent about $2 million in its bid for the
2002 Games. He said Sion spent about $3.5 million and Quebec $8
million, which would make for a total fine of $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Persson said he was surprised to learn that his rivals had
resorted to the scholarship fund. ``That was a surprise to
everybody, but I'm quite sure Ostersund would never have won in any
case because Salt Lake was the best candidate for the Winter
Olympics in history,'' he said. ``It's sad there is this component
in their victory now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the chief of Quebec's bid, Rene Paquet, has said he was
approached by an agent offering Olympic committee votes for a
price, Persson said he never heard of such offers until the Salt
Lake City scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 12 years, I never got any requests or saw any indications
that anybody was asking for money to deliver votes,'' Persson said.

BILLS OWNER WILSON A BONUS FOR FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What the National Football League took away, Ralph Wilson gave
back. And then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful day for Doug (Flutie),'' said Boston-based
agent Jack Mula of the Buffalo Bills quarterback. ``He made the Pro
Bowl one day, and then the next, Mr. Wilson really took care of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, the officials took a victory away from Flutie and
the Bills with two admittedly bad calls at the end of the game in
Foxborough that set the Patriots up for a 25-21 comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   The decision dropped the Bills to 7-5 and could have cost Flutie
even more dearly. Assuming he's in for 70 percent of the Bills'
plays on the season, his contract calls for him to get $250,000 in
bonus money for each victory from the ninth to the 12th. So 12 wins
would be worth $1 million to Flutie, and in fact, that would be
doubled, because whatever he makes this year would be added to his
contract for 1999. The Bills now are 9-5, and the best they can
finish is 11-5, meaning Flutie can't reach the maximum bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but not so fast. Enter Bills owner Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with the Bills (Thursday),'' said Mula, ``and they
wanted to rework Doug's contract for this season because the bonus
money we made to date was going to cause them a problem under the
salary cap. We said sure. They said in return for helping them this
year, they would add some money to next year's contract.''
</P>
<P>
   For doing them the favor and rewriting this year's contract now,
the Bills are giving Flutie another $500,000 on next year's pact.
And when Wilson heard about it, he told general manager John Butler
to give Flutie another $250,000 for the ``lost'' win in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Flutie would not have qualified for the bonus the way
this year's contract was structured unless he had been in for 70
percent of the plays, and that won't be the case unless he starts
and finishes the game against the Jets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bills, elated by his performance, his Pro Bowl
selection, and the team's surprising success, have told Flutie not
to worry about the 70 percent. They're giving him the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great story,'' said Mula. ``Doug signed for the
minimum ($300,000) for someone with his amount of time in the
league. We had more than 20 bonus provisions put on the back of his
contract that we didn't know that he would ever have a chance to
earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, he has earned $2,135,000 in bonus money. That inclues
the playing time, wins, passing yards, rushing yards, touchdown
passes. This will be added to his base pay next year, but he could
do better than that. The Bills told us that when the season is
over, they want to talk about a contract extension to make sure
Doug stays in Buffalo as long as he can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 36-year-old Flutie's conditioning and enthusiasm, that
could be another 10 years.

WHITE HOUSE PANEL URGES VOLUNTARY POLITICAL TV ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bipartisan commission appointed by the White House to
recommend what television broadcasters must do in exchange for
their free licenses to use thousands of new channels is to submit
its report Friday with watered-down voluntary measures on political
advertising and on educational or public-affairs programs.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was set up in the summer of 1997 to advise
President Clinton on whether the public-interest obligations of
broadcasters _ to carry news and public-service announcements, for
example _ should be increased with the vastly increased channel
capacity that digital technology will soon give them.
</P>
<P>
   The report stops short of urging mandatory free broadcast time
for political candidates or minimum amounts of educational and
public affairs programming. But it does recommend that free
broadcast time be provided as part of any overall campaign finance
reform law if Congress passes one.
</P>
<P>
   It also urges Congress to establish a permanent trust fund for
public broadcasting and to set aside some undetermined amount of
future channel space for noncommercial educational programs and
services, like distance learning or Internet access for schools and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   It advises that the projects be financed by the auction of space
on the analog spectrum that is returned to the government when
broadcasters convert to digital channels or by fees imposed on
broadcasters that use added spectrum space for money-making
channels, rather than for improved picture quality (high-definition
television) on one channel.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most contentious issues, the report suggests that
giving free time to political candidates be voluntary, even though
14 of the commission's 22 members favored mandatory free time and
wrote dissenting opinions. The report recommends that broadcasters
be encouraged to provide five minutes a night of free broadcast
time for candidates in the 30 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   The report's voluntary recommendations disturb Newton N. Minow,
former commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission who
served on the panel, the Advisory Committee on the Public Interest
Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price paid for this laudable effort to accommodate
conflicting views left us with a low common denominator at a time
when we need a broader vision, equal to the promise of new digital
channels,'' Minow wrote in a dissent. ``Our grandchildren will one
day regret our failure to meet one of the great communications
opportunities in the history of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the report is advisory, Congress or the communications
commission would have to impose any obligations on broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   When digital television technology is complete, each station
will be able to compress as many as five or six additional channels
into its signal, or to use the entire signal for high-definition
pictures (which requires more spectrum space). In 1996 Congress
declined to auction the additional channel space, agreeing to let
existing broadcasters keep it at no charge, and urging the
communications commission to seek recommendations as to what
public-service obligations broadcasters should meet in return for
those public airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Several independent reports by market-research firms have
forecast that providing extra programs or other data on those new
channels could be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory commission's report recommends that those ``who
choose to multiplex, and in so doing reap enhanced economic
benefits, should have the flexibility to choose between several
options.''

MURRAY SETS HIS STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike other KCAL Channel 9 sports anchors who've left the
station in the last decade, Tom Murray doesn't figure to move on
and host ``Entertainment Tonight,'' begin a career as an
infomercial potato-peeling pitchman or scramble around as a weekend
fill-in at another L.A. outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Steines, Joe Fowler and Gary Cruz have their reasons for
doing those things. Murray, who finished a nine-year run with his
last ``Final Quarter'' desk shift Tuesday night, feels he has
personal and professional standards to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to know the job I've dreamed of since I was
a kid, it's to work for `60 Minutes,' '' Murray said. ``Doing that
kind of work, I have a better chance of separating myself from
what's become the `traditional' sportscaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's departure shouldn't be interpreted as something similar
to what happened to KABC's Todd Donoho or Rick Lozano several
months ago. The tradeoff KABC made by not renewing cream-puff
Donoho or Lozano and replacing them with an even creamier puff in
Bill Weir was labeled ``a change in direction'' by the station
decision-makers. KCAL's battle with Murray's not wanting to be a
team player _ for what should be the right reasons _ goes back to
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   KCAL head man Don Corsini wanted to dress up the nightly sports
reports on the Angels _ whose games the station carries _ by adding
a loyal advertiser's logo. He created the ``Angels Toyota
Clipboard'' highlight segment.
</P>
<P>
   To most polished sportscasters, it's a grin-and-bear-it,
I-get-a-nice-paycheck-and-would-like-to-continue-doing-so decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray balked.
</P>
<P>
   When his agent and station lawyers became involved, Murray
finally agreed to do it _ only during the '98 Angels season _ and
then instructed his producer to leave the logo on the screen for as
short a time as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, knowing Murray's contract ran out at the end of this
year, Corsini had a window to hire Alan Massengale, who worked
under him when they were at Prime Ticket. Massengale had been let
go by the Fox Sports News show because of erratic on-air
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Murray clearly saw the writing on the wall. But rather than quit
when he was demoted to two days a week behind colleague John
Ireland, Murray rode out the rest of his contract, freelancing as a
reporter for Fox Sports Net on ``Goin' Deep'' and Jim Rome's ``Last
Word.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's run at KCAL started when Disney bought the station in
1990. He was turned loose to work with seemingly unlimited
resources for extended sports reports and documentaries on the then
three-hour weeknight newscasts. Murray did memorable pieces on the
dark sides of Raiders boss Al Davis, convicted Kings owner Bruce
McNall and USC-fired assistant athletic director Marvin Cobb. This
year, Murray's best piece was on Carson stadium financier Michael
Ovitz _ but that story was done for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Young Broadcasting bought KCAL two years ago but is rumored to
have been trying to sell it ever since. And while the 15-minute
``Final Quarter'' turns out to be the longest weeknight block of
locally produced sports news in L.A., it's seemingly treated now as
nothing more than the lead-in to the 11 p.m. ``Jerry Springer''
show _ and even then, the sports segment usually runs past the top
of the hour, so early Springer viewers are counted in the sports
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a much different place than it was nine years
ago,'' said Murray, trying not to sound bitter. ``Most of the
people there when I began are gone, so I'm just the latest in a
long line.''
</P>
<P>
   In a town where most other anchors _ sports or otherwise _
wouldn't think twice about crossing the line to help a sponsor,
Murray agrees that maybe his journalistic ideals don't fit here.
That's something former KTLA and KCBS sports anchor Keith Olbermann
also discovered before moving into the all-sports and all-news
network world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic about the future of sportscasting here in
the way I've tried to do it,'' Murray admitted. ``It's apparent
L.A. isn't the right place to do it. Here, there are guys who are
not so much trying to inform but entertain. I believe I can do both
but not in the way entertainment is being emphasized. A lot of that
kind of stuff wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hoop it up: Any resemblance between the Lakers' famed
``Showtime'' to what they're calling ``The Game on Showtime''
Saturday night _ live from Atlantic City, N.J. _ is purely comical.
</P>
<P>
   For what's been reported as a $1.5 million rights fee, Showtime
will provide its 18 million viewers with a broadcast of this NBA
exhibition/infomercial that so far includes no Lakers or Clippers
players _ or Michael Jordan. L.A.'s only link will be participation
from famed sports-talk show host and squirrel hunter Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's Jay Larkin, more adept at promoting boxing events for
the premium channel (which is a bit less sports-savvy than HBO),
says other cable outlets and networks were offered the game.
Showtime was able to clear out a movie or two to televise it and is
trying not to appear to be acting as an influential partner in the
NBA-lockout talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for Showtime that we are understood
here,'' Larkin told a group of reporters on a conference call
Wednesday. ``People have been putting a cynical spin on this game
and this is unwarranted and without justification. . . . This event
was going to take place with or without our participation. We are
covering it as an event. The fans, we hope, will appreciate it and
won't watch it with any kind of political agenda. It's a basketball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   However. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving beyond this event,'' Larkin also said, ``it's a great
big question mark. We have to see how it performs as a television
product. If the season is not reinstated and there are more
opportunities to do games like this, we are certainly interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for game highlights on NBC or TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers of the '80s are featured on the
reprocessed infotainment show ``NBA Inside Stuff'' that KNBC will
air on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ The Angels' decision to use Rex Hudler as its one-and-only TV
analyst for both KCAL Channel 9 and Fox Sports West took both
outlets by surprise. Each found out when Hudler blurted it out
during Jim Rome's radio show Wednesday. But the Hud Man's
enthusiasm will be contagious if he does the games as he does
interviews with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   __ I want my HDTV: Check out CBS' special high-definition TV
feed of Saturday's 10 a.m. N.Y. Jets-Buffalo contest at any of the
27 Good Guys stores throughout Southern California. Leave all
credit cards and checkbooks at home unless you can fight the urge
to walk out with an early Christmas gift.
</P>
<P>
   __ John Ireland hopes to have an agreement finished before he
leaves today on two-week vacation (for the holidays and to get
hitched) to remain with AM-1150's morning show for the first six
months of 1999. Partner Steve Mason, already committed to a radio
job in New York, signed off Wednesday. Ireland's new sidekick
hasn't been determined.
</P>
<P>
   __ Set the VCRs, pop in the cassette, recruits pay attention:
Cal State Northridge's basketball team gets a rare double dose of
media exposure Saturday night because it's playing playing UCLA
(7:30 p.m., Fox Sports West 2 and AM-1150). CSUN might want to stop
running those local cable-TV ads touting radio coverage of its game
Tuesday against James Madison. That was a pre-Paul Bubb departure
arrangement that ain't gonna happen now. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Why get rid of Sparky Anderson? And why abandon Jerry Reuss?
Fox Sports West, for one, wasn't thrilled having to learn about it
from the Angels' move this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, we would have liked to keep him on
board,'' said Fox Sports West chief Kitty Cohen of Anderson, ``but
we respect Disney's desire to have the same analyst for both home
and road games.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Anderson understands. ``I never had a disagreement
with the Angels,'' said the future Hall of Fame manager who lives
in Thousand Oaks. ``They've always known I didn't want to do road
games. And for three years, it worked for me. Maybe I was a little
disenchanted thinking about doing 50 games (next season) and
driving an hour-and-a-half each way. But I knew they wanted just
one guy. And nothing against Rexy, but I wish Reuss woulda been the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be discussions soon about Fox using Anderson on its
regional Saturday game-of-the-week package as long as the game is
at Dodger Stadium or Edison Field. &QL; 
__ CBS might consider redefinition television for its ``NFL Today''
heading into the playoffs. Charisma-challenged George Siefert,
missing in action last week, will also be gone this weekend as
``insider'' Mike Lombardi cozies up with Marcus Allen and Brent
Jones. &QL; 
__ And why do we care so much about NFL pregame shows?

TARGETS REVEAL EXPANSIVE AIMS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the second day of Operation Desert Fox, American
and British forces stepped up their airstrikes against Iraq. And
judging from the vast array of new warships and planes streaming
into the Persian Gulf, the third day is likely to exceed the first
two.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, from President Clinton on down, have repeated over
and over that the mission of the campaign is simply to ``degrade''
and ``diminish'' Saddam Hussein's ability to build nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the air campaign's targets suggest that a
larger aim may be Hussein's regime itself, although Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen denied the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced Thursday that over 200 cruise missiles had
struck 50 targets on Wednesday night, when the operation began. He
did not say _ it may be impossible at this point _ how many of
these targets were destroyed. Nor, by Thursday evening, had the
second day's strikes been quantified.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Health Minister Umeed Madhat Mubarak said the strikes
killed at least 25 people and wounded 75 in Baghdad alone. Trade
Minister Mohammed Mahali Saleh said that in Tikrit, Hussein's home
town, a food store stocked with 2,600 tons of rice was demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Clinton allowed, ``There is always the
prospect that . . . missiles will miss'' their targets, and that
people will die as a result. Such a risk, he added, was why he
delayed striking Iraq until now.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen emphasized that all the targets were military in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite photographs of two of those targets, released by the
Pentagon, reveal much about the air campaign's aims, which may be
more expansive than officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The photos showed ``pre-strike'' and ``post-strike'' views of,
in one case, Iraq's military-intelligence headquarters and, in the
other, a row of five barracks occupied by the elite troops that
guard Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a weapons analyst at the Federation of American
Scientists, inferred from this that ``the objectives of the
campaign must also be to weaken his regime.''
</P>
<P>
   William Arkin, a private weapons analyst and former US Army
intelligence officer, found it noteworthy that airstrikes, not only
in Baghdad but across Iraq, have been aimed at Saddam's private
security apparatus and the units responsible for moving Saddam
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things that have made this guy survive for 20 years,''
Arkin said, ``is his security apparatus and his mobility. And we
are trying to rip that apart. . . . We're hoping that when this guy
is naked _ when his transportation is destroyed and his security
apparatus is reeling _ that will precipitate a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin also noted that seven years of UN inspections have
provided a lot of intelligence on where Hussein's network is
vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, officials in 1991 also hoped that the strikes would
topple Hussein. An Air Force report, written a few weeks before the
air war, predicted the assault would trigger ``the systematic
collapse of Saddam Hussein's entire war machine and regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If the destruction of Hussein's regime is not an objective of
Desert Fox, then its official aims seem vague. ``To `degrade' his
capabilities _ that's easy,'' Arkin remarked. ``The first hour, we
`degraded' them. We can't lose, in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   But how then do such strikes make Saddam easier to control or
contain? And how does Clinton know he has degraded Saddam enough?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual goals of the air campaign, it will intensify
greatly over the next 24 hours, as over 80 additional combat planes
join the US arsenal in the region. These include 10 F-117 Stealth
aircraft, which were the stars of the 1991 air war but have not yet
appeared in this operation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of these planes are loaded with laser-guided bombs,
which, while by no means miracle weapons, are much more accurate
than conventional weapons. In the last war, only a small fraction
of planes had these ``smart bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even advanced weapons do not always hit their targets. In the
targets photographed Thursday, the intelligence headquarters _ two
vast complexes of buildings _ was apparently obliterated by the
attack. However, just three of the five barracks appear to be
destroyed. Although one of the others is heavily damaged, the other
is barely scarred.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: Some strikes work better than others.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
made this point. ``Much'' of the attack, he said, was ``as
successful or more successful'' than the results shown in the two
photos, while ``some of it'' was ``not quite as successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not reveal Thursday how many weapons were fired at
various targets, but Pike estimated that the destruction of the
intelligence headquarters might have required a dozen missiles or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk's warhead releases the explosive force of 2,000
pounds of TNT, enough to obliterate small structures, but not
nearly enough by itself to topple a large office building.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks in Baghdad so far have been carried out by
Tomahawks, fired from Navy ships and Air Force B-52 bombers. Since
the missiles have a range of 700 miles, the pilots and sailors can
shoot them while staying far from danger.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 Navy planes have also been involved in attacks
outside Baghdad, though officials were vague about details.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a barrage of Iraqi air-defense fire, Cohen reported
Thursday that no US or British planes have been shot down. He also
said Iraqi fighter planes _ which shot down a few dozen allied
planes in 1991 _ have not been in the air during these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   These airstrikes have been much lighter than their predecessors
nearly eight years ago. On Jan. 17, 1991, the first night of
Operation Desert Storm, allied forces mounted 1,223 airstrikes _
more than three times the 280 launched last Wednesday. There were
811 strikes the second night, again far more than anything seen
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that in 1991, Iraqi troops had invaded Kuwait
and the allied mission was to repel them. Most of the airstrikes
were aimed at Iraqi tanks, bridges, airfields and other combat
infrastructure. Saddam's military machine was much larger than it
is now, and was at full alert.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Fox involves far fewer targets and therefore requires far
fewer weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference in this campaign is the US military's
almost total reliance thus far on Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the attack began with F-117s swooping into Iraqi
airspace,invisible to their radar, to destroy a variety of targets
with laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, the performance of Tomahawks, despite much advance
fanfare, was disappointing. Over 300 were fired throughout the war,
at a cost of over $1 million per missile. The US Defense
Intelligence Agency calculated afterward that there were as many
``no-shows'' _ wide misses _ as there were hits.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how successful the Tomahawks have been this
time, but even their critics concede they must be doing better.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that nearly all Tomahawks are now guided to
their targets by a network of Global Positioning Satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The old Tomahawks were guided by a sensor that compared key
features of the terrain with a pre-programmed radar flight-path
map. The problem was, the Iraqi desert is fairly barren of features
and the missiles often got lost.
</P>
<P>
   GPS guidance, on the other hand, does not depend on set flight
paths. The technology is common these days. Many cars have GPS
receivers that, connected to a mapping system, let drivers know
their precise positions within a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles contain similar GPS receivers. The coordinates
of the target are punched in and the missile simply goes there.
Weather, visibility or terraim features are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, success is not as simple as it might seem. According to
one Pentagon official, the new system's test-program is not yet
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clinton launched a large number of GPS-guided
Tomahawks at alleged terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. It
was never revealed how many missiles were used to achieve what
damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   David Shea, a spokesman for Raytheon Co., which manufactures the
Tomahawk, said Thursday that 400 missiles were fired in that
campaign, of which 343 hit their targets. However, no official has
confirmed these numbers, and it seems unlikely so many missiles
could have hit and exploded, given the modest damage done.
</P>
<P>
   Even with GPS, Tomahawks can still go wildly astray. The Iranian
foreign ministry Thursday night filed a protest with the US and
British governments, complaining that a wayward missile crashed
into a small Iranian town on the southwest border with Iraq,
causing some damage but no casualties.

   Falcons playoff tickets are hot
   By Matt Winkeljohn
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call it Falcon fever.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of the Atlanta Falcons' 29,715 season-ticket
holders have reserved about 35,000 playoff tickets. The remaining
27,000 tickets will go on sale Saturday at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 2,000 fans have reserved playoff tickets by making
a $50 down payment on season tickets for next year, and another
8,000 tickets are handled by Georgia Dome officials and distributed
for other uses, including suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a pretty good rate (of sales),'' ticket
manager Jack Ragsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (12-2) have assured themselves of at least one home
playoff game, either the weekend of Jan. 2-3 or the weekend of Jan.
9-10.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta wins at Detroit (5-9), it will clinch just its second
NFC West title and earn a first-round bye, meaning the first
playoff game will be on the weekend of Jan. 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   Camping out will be useless because fans will have their place
in line determined by a lottery drawing at 8 a.m. Saturday between
Gates A and D.
</P>
<P>
   In the lottery, fans will draw numbers out of a bucket to
determine their places in line. They can buy tickets for the first
playoff game without having to purchase at the same time $72
tickets for the second home playoff game, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum purchase will be 20 tickets per person. Tickets can
also be purchased by phone at 404-223-8000 or 404-249-6400.
</P>
<P>
   The last home playoff game was Jan. 4, 1981, a 30-27 loss to
Dallas. Atlanta's only other home playoff game was a 14-13 victory
over Philadelphia on Dec. 24, 1978.

   Lions' injured Batch may still play Sunday
   By Matt Winkeljohn
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Detroit Lions rookie quarterback Charlie Batch, who
twisted his lower back in Monday night's 35-14 loss at San
Francisco, did not practice again Thursday, but coach Bobby Ross
has not yet ruled him out of Sunday's game against the Falcons
(12-2).
</P>
<P>
   Batch, who has stolen some of Colts rookie quarterback Peyton
Manning's thunder by amassing a 83.3 passer rating while starting
the last 12 games , was a second-round draft choice out of Eastern
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   When Ross benched Scott Mitchell in the second game, Batch took
over.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 16 of 19 passes for 218 yards and two touchdowns in
a 27-20 win over Green Bay Oct. 15, setting an NFL rookie record
with his .842 completion percentage for one game. He has a rating
of 83.5.
</P>
<P>
   The top three rookie passer ratings in history belong to Dan
Marino (96.0 for Miami in 1983), Greg Cook (88.2, Cincinnati in
'69), and Charlie Conerly (84.0, N.Y. Giants in '48).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Batch has completed 173 of 303 passes for 2,178 yards,
11 touchdowns and six interceptions. He had a streak of 107
attempts without an interception and has a current streak of 136
passes without a pick.
</P>
<P>
   Batch also is a threat to run, with 41 carries for 229 yards
(5.5-yard average) and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who has tremendous poise for a young guy,'' Ross
said. ``He has an excellent mental approach to it. He knows where
to go with the ball most of the time, and that's the thing that has
surprised me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Batch said he'll be able to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   In practice Wednesday and Thursday, 14-year veteran Frank Reich
got most of the repetitions with the No. 1 offense. Mitchell has
gotten some reps for the first time since his benching.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves release
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who has been recovering at Piedmont
Hospital since heart bypass surgery on Monday, is expected to be
released today, but will not go to Detroit. He may have a role in
preparing for the Dolphins game on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   For all the fuss over Batch, the right shoulder of Lions' middle
linebacker Stephen Boyd is as big a deal. He's Detroit's leading
tackler, with 112 first hits and 43 assists to go with six passes
defensed, four sacks, three fumbles forced and three recovered _
even though he missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   He reaggravated a strained labrum at San Francisco and will not
play. He is scheduled to visit famed orthopedist James Andrews at
the Alabama Sports Medicine Clinic in Birmingham. Team doctors
anticipate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lions rookie wide receiver Germane Crowell, who has
caught 25 passes for 464 yards, won't play either.
</P>
<P>
   His season may have ended Monday night as well. The
second-rounder from Virginia injured his shoulder in the midst of
his best game (five catches, 83 yards). That figures to take the
teeth out of the Lions' three-wide receiver set.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett to return
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett (sprained knee)
and left defensive end Lester Archambeau (broken thumb) were both
held out of practice again Thursday, but interim coach Rich Brooks
expects both to play.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is waiting on a special knee brace after suffering a
unique tear to the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last
Sunday at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to do surgery, but there is an old tear and a
new tear,'' Bennett said. ``The first tear is ... very, very rare.
I don't know when I did it, but it was sort of frayed. The knee is
stable, but it's sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchups
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan will
match up chiefly with wide receiver Johnnie Morton (65 catches, 978
yards, two touchdowns) rather than Herman Moore (69 catches, 829
yards, four touchdowns in 13 games) because Morton is faster.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, Atlanta often will roll Pro Bowl free safety
Eugene Robinson toward Moore (6-foot-4, 210 pounds) who will be
covered by starter Ronnie Bradford (5-10, 188) or reserve Michael
Booker (6-2, 203).
</P>
<P>
   Moore has caught 20 passes in the last three games for 345 yards
and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Morton is 6-foot, 190 pounds, to Buchanan's 5-9, 198.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could easily be a Pro Bowl tandem if they had a
quarterback who could get them the rock,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers
</P>
<P>
   After combining for 14 catches, 307 yards and two touchdowns
last Sunday against New Orleans, wide receivers Terance Mathis (61
catches, 1,085 yards, 10 touchdowns) and Tony Martin (59 catches,
1,034 yards, five touchdowns) lead all NFL receiving tandems with
2,119 yards. That's more than Minnesota's Randy Moss (1,209) and
Cris Carter (906), who total 2,115.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, and perhaps Martin, could end up catching more passes
than any receiver on a Reeves-coached offense. Steve Watson caught
69 passes for 1,170 yards on Reeves' 1984 Broncos squad.
</P>
<P>
   Lotsa Lions games
</P>
<P>
   This will be the sixth consecutive year the Falcons have played
Detroit, and the fifth game in that stretch in the Silverdome.
Atlanta has lost five in a row in Detroit, including a 31-17 defeat
in 1988. The Falcons last won there in '86 by a 20-6 score. The
Lions hold a 20-6 edge over Atlanta, 12-2 in Detroit. Counting
preseason games in Detroit, the Falcons have played four games
there in two years. Atlanta won there 7-3 on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Be wary of Barry
</P>
<P>
   Lions Pro Bowl running back Barry Sanders hasn't hurt the
Falcons as badly as he's hurt a lot of teams. In last year's
2,053-yard season, Atlanta was one of just two teams that didn't
allow him 100 or more yards in a season during which he set the NFL
record with 14 consecutive games over the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   He had just 33 yards on 15 carries against the Falcons in the
opener, a 28-17 Detroit win.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 30, will continue his assault on the NFL record book
Sunday. He needs just five carries to move past Marcus Allen
(3,022) and into second place behind Chicago Bears Hall of Famer
Walter Payton (3,838) for carries in a career.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently second in NFL history with 15,133 rushing yards,
trailing Payton (16,726), and needs just total 10 yards from
scrimmage to pass Herschel Walker (18,168) and move into second
place behind Payton (21,803).
</P>
<P>
   Sanders also has 76 career 100-yard games to Payton's record 77.
</P>
<P>
   Double reward
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson's received a $25,000 bonus for being
voted into the Pro Bowl.

successful or more successful'' than the results shown in the two
photos, while ``some of it'' was ``not quite as successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not reveal Thursday how many weapons were fired at
various targets, but Pike estimated that the destruction of the
intelligence headquarters might have required a dozen missiles or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk's warhead releases the explosive force of 2,000
pounds of TNT, enough to obliterate small structures, but not
nearly enough by itself to topple a large office building.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks in Baghdad so far have been carried out by
Tomahawks, fired from Navy ships and Air Force B-52 bombers. Since
the missiles have a range of 700 miles, the pilots and sailors can
shoot them while staying far from danger.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 Navy planes have also been involved in attacks
outside Baghdad, though officials were vague about details.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a barrage of Iraqi air-defense fire, Cohen reported
Thursday that no US or British planes have been shot down. He also
said Iraqi fighter planes _ which shot down a few dozen allied
planes in 1991 _ have not been in the air during these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   These airstrikes have been much lighter than their predecessors
nearly eight years ago. On Jan. 17, 1991, the first night of
Operation Desert Storm, allied forces mounted 1,223 airstrikes _
more than three times the 280 launched last Wednesday. There were
811 strikes the second night, again far more than anything seen
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that in 1991, Iraqi troops had invaded Kuwait
and the allied mission was to repel them. Most of the airstrikes
were aimed at Iraqi tanks, bridges, airfields and other combat
infrastructure. Saddam's military machine was much larger than it
is now, and was at full alert.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Fox involves far fewer targets and therefore requires far
fewer weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference in this campaign is the US military's
almost total reliance thus far on Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the attack began with F-117s swooping into Iraqi
airspace,invisible to their radar, to destroy a variety of targets
with laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, the performance of Tomahawks, despite much advance
fanfare, was disappointing. Over 300 were fired throughout the war,
at a cost of over $1 million per missile. The US Defense
Intelligence Agency calculated afterward that there were as many
``no-shows'' _ wide misses _ as there were hits.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how successful the Tomahawks have been this
time, but even their critics concede they must be doing better.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that nearly all Tomahawks are now guided to
their targets by a network of Global Positioning Satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The old Tomahawks were guided by a sensor that compared key
features of the terrain with a pre-programmed radar flight-path
map. The problem was, the Iraqi desert is fairly barren of features
and the missiles often got lost.
</P>
<P>
   GPS guidance, on the other hand, does not depend on set flight
paths. The technology is common these days. Many cars have GPS
receivers that, connected to a mapping system, let drivers know
their precise positions within a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles contain similar GPS receivers. The coordinates
of the target are punched in and the missile simply goes there.
Weather, visibility or terraim features are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, success is not as simple as it might seem. According to
one Pentagon official, the new system's test-program is not yet
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clinton launched a large number of GPS-guided
Tomahawks at alleged terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. It
was never revealed how many missiles were used to achieve what
damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   David Shea, a spokesman for Raytheon Co., which manufactures the
Tomahawk, said Thursday that 400 missiles were fired in that
campaign, of which 343 hit their targets. However, no official has
confirmed these numbers, and it seems unlikely so many missiles
could have hit and exploded, given the modest damage done.
</P>
<P>
   Even with GPS, Tomahawks can still go wildly astray. The Iranian
foreign ministry Thursday night filed a protest with the US and
British governments, complaining that a wayward missile crashed
into a small Iranian town on the southwest border with Iraq,
causing some damage but no casualties.

&HT;        WELDON QUESTIONS TIMING OF IRAQ ATTACK AND WILL IMPEACH,
FATTAH CALLS CRITICISMS OF MILITARY ACTION IRRESPONSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
    By Lisa Fine  
   c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 -- Rep. Curt Weldon announced he will vote
to impeach President Clinton and questioned the timing of the
American attack launched on Iraq Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said President Clinton had several other opportunities to
order an attack on Iraq since November, but chose to do it on the
eve of the scheduled impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement of the attack, House leaders decided to
postpone until Friday the impeachment debate originally scheduled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia, who will vote against
impeachment, called anyone who would criticize the timing of a
military attack, ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon, R-7th District, made a statement in a closed-door House
meeting Wednesday that called the timing of the attack on Iraq
``suspiciously coincidental,'' his spokesman Pete Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah said he thought comparisons to the situation in the movie
Wag The Dog, which is about a president who stages a war to divert
attention from a sex scandal, are ``insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider the U.S. military a dog to be wagged,''
Fattah said. ``There is sufficient evidence that this attack was
needed, that should quell any questions raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Fattah said he felt the military attack wouldn't change any of
his colleague's votes on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans have the votes,'' Fattah said. ``Their
rabid desire for political lynching will have to wait a day. They
are upset about an inconvenience of having to delay the inevitable
partisan impeachment of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fattah said he believed even if the House votes to impeach
Clinton, sending the case to a trial in the Senate, there were not
the 2/3 votes needed there to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said he made his decision to vote to impeach Clinton on
charges of perjury and abuse of power because the president should
not be above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said he was unsure whether Clinton should be removed from
office and viewed the House vote as a public rebuke of the
President's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As difficult as it may be for our nation, I think that the
President must face the consequences of his actions,'' Weldon said.
``To simply overlook any President's violation of the law would set
a terrible precedent for future generations.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ By day, April is a mild-mannered accountant at
J.C. Penney in a suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   But three or four nights a week she becomes a party animal,
driving into a seedy section of Tampa called Ybor City to hear a
band at the Green Iguana or to plunk down $6 for ``sink or swim,''
the all-you-can-drink evening at the Edge, or to watch
cross-dressers perform at the Pleasure Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing, really, that you can't do here,'' April said
one recent Saturday night as thousands of drinkers and gawkers
spilled in and out of 70 bars along a 10-block section of La
Septima, or Seventh Avenue. ``You can sit down and be totally
entertained,'' she said. ``I come here a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why April did not want her last name published
and why, after years of failed urban redevelopment, Ybor City is
attracting millions of dollars from investors.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-screen movie complex, retail shops, a hotel, homes and
chain restaurants have queued up behind the long lines of
X-generation club goers who wait until 3 a.m. to get on techno
dance floors fashioned in brick buildings left over from Ybor
City's heyday as a cigar-manufacturing area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on a Friday night and there were 20,000 people _ you
could feel the energy,'' said Jay Miller, executive vice president
of Steiner &AMP; Associates of Miami, which will begin construction in
January on a $50 million retail-movie project on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the crowds, the City of Tampa is erecting a $12
million parking garage, lending $9 million to Steiner to lower its
retail rents and building a two-mile, $23 million streetcar line to
connect downtown Tampa to Ybor City. Private developers are adding
another $50 million in new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of Ybor (pronounced E-bore), which is named after
Vincent-Martinez Ybor, a cigar baron who built a company town of
10,000 immigrants here in 1886, is based largely on liquor, city
officials say. A decade ago, frustrated by the area's slide, the
Tampa City Council removed zoning fees and rules, created tax
credits and made the old business district a ``wet zone,'' allowing
a high number of bars.
</P>
<P>
   There was no master plan, but when a struggling cafe called
Carmine's tried staying open at night with a band and a bar,
college students poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, 150 new businesses employing 1,500 people have
renovated 800,000 square feet of buildings, and club owners have
invested $50 million of their own money, said Jack Rodriguez, who
runs the Ybor City Development Corp..
</P>
<P>
   While nearly 40 percent is office space, it is the zany mix of
Mediterranean bistros, Cuban sandwich shops, dance clubs, cigar
stores and tattoo parlors that has made Ybor City the nighttime
playground for a 100-mile zone stretching from St. Petersburg to
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday nights, the police block cars from La
Septima, allowing people to stroll beneath bright lights and
security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor City's success is striking when compared with Tampa's $200
million, 20-year effort to create life in its downtown and
waterfront with publicly subsidized projects ranging from a
convention center to an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say 3 million people a year drive downtown to events
like hockey games. But, blocked by freeways and huge structures,
nobody stays to walk around, said John J. Twomey III of the Hogan
Group, which hopes to change that with a $37 million ``retail
entertainment'' zone 1.5 miles from Ybor City.
</P>
<P>
   As 1.5 million revelers stroll through the downtown every year,
they sense the culture and the human scale, said Del Acosta, who
administers the Barrio Latino Commission, an architectural review
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to promenade 10 blocks, to see and be seen _
that's Main Street U.S.A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are problems with too many rowdy youths, skyrocketing
rents, rising crime and lost historical detail. But Ybor City
remains real entertainment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having lunch at the Atomic Age Cafe yesterday,'' Acosta
said. ``In walked a very wealthy bank executive, a couple of kids
with green hair and a guy looking for his next meal. You don't get
that in a mall.''

GEN. HAMILTON HOWZE, 89, HELICOPTER TACTICIAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Hamilton Howze, who began his military career in the horse
cavalry, served in tanks during World War II and then helped change
how the Army fights by developing helicopter-warfare tactics used
in the Vietnam War and beyond, died on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas.
He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Howze would not have surprised anyone if he had been devoted to
the old Army ways. His great-grandfather, Hamilton Smith Hawkins,
was an Army doctor who died in the Mexican War. His father, Maj.
Gen. Robert Lee Howze, won the Medal of Honor fighting the Sioux
and presided over the 1925 court-martial that found Gen. Billy
Mitchell, the crusader for air power, guilty of insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   But the son was hardly shackled by tradition. In 1962, Howze
presided over a military panel, the Howze Board, that issued a
landmark report. It proposed that aircraft, mainly helicopters,
carry soldiers into battle, resupply them, rain firepower upon the
enemy and remove the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The skies over Vietnam were filled with Huey helicopters, and
the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) used hundreds of helicopters
in one of the first major encounters of the war, the Battle of the
Ia Drang Valley, in November 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s helicopter-borne troops cut off Iraqi soldiers in
the Persian Gulf war. ``The Huey was to our riflemen roughly what
the horse was to the old cavalryman, close by and ready,'' Howze
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Hawkins Howze was born on Dec. 21, 1908, at West Point,
where his father was commandant of cadets. When the elder Howze
commanded cavalry at Fort Bliss, Texas, his son shared the family
house with two visitors who presumably left a youngster wide-eyed,
Marshal Ferdinand Foch and Gen. John J. Pershing.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later Howze recalled having seen the two walking down
``our back upstairs hall in pajamas and bathrobe, toothbrushes in
hand, on the way to what I considered to be my bathroom, but from
which, of course, I was temporarily barred.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from West Point in 1930, he joined the cavalry
and spent the Depression in an Army in which officers honed polo
skills while Germany and Japan built war machines.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered World War II, he commanded the
1st Armored Division in Tunisia and then Italy, taking part in the
breakout from Anzio and the liberation of Rome on June 4, 1944. He
carried a thin book with a red cover, ``On War'' by Karl von
Clausewitz.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. James Gavin, an early proponent of helicopters, which
had seen limited use in the Korean War, named Howze as first
director of Army Aviation in 1955. Howze later commanded the 82nd
Airborne, Gavin's old unit.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1962, while commanding the umbrella 18th Airborne
Corps, Howze was sent by the Kennedy administration to the
University of Mississippi to command federal troops that quelled
the violence over the admission of James Meredith, the first black
student in the college.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of October, President Kennedy summoned him again,
for the Cuban missile crisis. Six decades after his father and both
grandfathers had fought in Cuba in the Spanish-American War, he was
ordered to help plan an invasion of the island. Howze, who would
have commanded the invading troops, was awarded the Legion of Merit
by Kennedy for his planning work.
</P>
<P>
   After having presided over the board that carried his name and
set in motion the helicopter-warfare plans, Howze was U.N.
commander in South Korea from 1963 to 1965. He then retired from
the Army, in part, he said, because he had been passed over in
favor of Gen. William Westmoreland as commander in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Howze became an executive and consultant for Bell Helicopter
Textron in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Mary, whose grandfather, Col. Guy Henry,
won the Medal of Honor in the Battle of Cold Harbor in the Civil
War; two sons, Lt. Col. William Howze of Harker Heights, Texas, and
Guy Howze of Austin, Texas; four grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In retirement Howze pondered the Army way of doing things as it
prepared for an all-volunteer force. Writing in Army magazine in
1971 he weighed the claims of the flexibility that he prized and
the military tradition that his family embodied. Finally the old
soldier made his choice, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully agree with the value of frequent talks by the
commander with his subordinates, and the desirability of explaining
why, as well as how, things must be done. But this must not be
carried to the point where a conference must precede virtually
every order. A compelling `why' must remain: because the Old Man
said so.''

GOMEZ MIGHT RIDE INTO ELITE CIRCLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ At Southern California racetracks, it's not
only the horses that go round and round. So do the jockey titles.
</P>
<P>
   They are passed around among a select circle of riders, the same
handful of Hall of Famers and Eclipse Award winners and Kentucky
Derby stars taking turns leading the local standings season after
season.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Gomez won his 21st race of the Hollywood Park season
Thursday aboard Dramatic Gold and will go into the last four days
of the meet with a two-victory lead over Alex Solis. If Gomez holds
on, he'll certainly break the monotony. There hasn't been a
first-time titlist on the Hollywood-Santa Anita-Del Mar circuit
since 1994, when Corey Nakatani broke through at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ideal place for racing,'' said Gomez, 26, an
Arizona native and second-generation jockey who moved west 13
months ago from the shrinking Illinois circuit. ``It's got the
ideal temperature, it has the best horses in the country and it has
the best money.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all those reasons it has the best riders, as many
out-of-staters before Gomez learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who has ridden in a meet-high 114 races, is ahead at
Hollywood in part because perennial local leaders Solis, Nakatani,
Chris McCarron, Kent Desormeaux and Gary Stevens have been out of
town a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to minimize his achievement. He came here without
a big name and has to overcome personal setbacks _ a 1995 divorce
and battle with alcoholism _ that nearly caused him to quit riding.
He went through rehab again earlier this year after a brief slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up,'' Gomez said while eating a bowl of watermelon and
oranges in the jockeys' room Thursday. ``It made me pick up my
head, take a look at myself and not take anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the new house I've bought (in Arcadia) and realize
how far I've come . . . after I pretty much threw everything
away.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Garrett Gomez and 6-year-old River Keen will go
for their second straight win together Sunday. They'll face Puerto
Madero and as many as five others in the Native Diver Handicap, the
highlight of Hollywood Park's closing weekend. The 31-day meet ends
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   River Keen was claimed for $100,000 out of his front-running
victory Dec. 4 by trainer Bob Baffert. The Irish-bred is 3 for 4 at
Hollywood Park, starting with the 1997 Californian, run at this
1[-mile distance.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's biggest contests might be quarterhorse races in
Orange County. The $1,114,605 Los Alamitos Million Futurity on
Saturday will be the richest race in California _ for any breed _
this year. The $350,000 Champion of Champions on Sunday features
six of the top eight quarterhorses in recent rankings, including
defending champion SLM Big Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   __ Risky business: The National Thoroughbred Racing
Association's 11-race series next year will offer some eye-popping
bonus money. Curiously, though, a horse will have to finish in the
top five in the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic at Del Mar or his owners
will collect none of it.
</P>
<P>
   That rule is meant to insure a solid field for the Del Mar race,
which is the series finale and one of five to be televised on ABC.
The rest are being scheduled for Fox Sports. The problem is that it
ensures nothing, and it could inspire an owner to run an injured
horse in the Pacific Classic, hardly the image the NTRA wants to
show the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California fans will remember when an off-form Luthier
Fever was entered in the Pacific Classic a few years ago just so
his owners could satisfy the conditions of a bonus offer.
</P>
<P>
   And the money will be bigger in the NTRA series _ $5 million for
a horse who sweeps the five ABC races, $1 million for winning four
and $500,000 for winning three, as long as one of the wins comes in
the Pacific Classic. Beyond that the bonus formulas get pretty
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The series starts with the Jan. 30 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream
Park and includes the March 6 Santa Anita Handicap and the June 27
Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thumbs up: The surprise about Frank Stronach's statement on
the future of Santa Anita isn't that the new owner plans to remove
the distinctive turf hillside and paddock gardens to make room for
an entertainment and retail complex.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is the mostly positive reaction from horse owners
and trainers, as reported by the Daily Racing Form. It probably
means two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: Horsemen, traditionally fearful of diversification and
seeing it as a step toward the paving over of racing ovals, realize
now that if track owners can't make more profitable use of their
hundreds of acres of peripheral land it will be bought by
developers who don't care about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Stronach, the auto-components magnate and major
thoroughbred owner who bought Santa Anita from Meditrust for $126
million last week, is trusted by the horsemen because they believe
he cares about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach spoke with horsemen en masse for the first time at a
dinner in Pasadena Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita's first season under Stronach opens Dec. 26.

COLTEC QUESTIONS SERIOUSNESS OF CRANE'S INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Coltec Industries, before agreeing to merge with B.F. Goodrich,
never received a formal purchase offer from the Crane Co., raising
serious doubts about Crane's interest in the company, Coltec's
chief executive said Thursday. As a result, Crane's lawsuit seeking
to block the deal is without merit, Coltec said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board remains committed to the consummation of the
announced business combination of Coltec and B.F. Goodrich,'' John
Guffey Jr., Coltec's chief executive, said Thursday in Coltec's
first response to the Crane lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 1995 agreement signed by the two companies did
not require Coltec to notify Crane if a third party expressed
interest in buying the company or prohibit it from negotiating an
agreement, Coltec said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to Robert Evans, Crane's chief executive,
Guffey said the lack of a formal offer and the long lapse between
Crane's initial expression of interest in October 1995 and its
follow-up efforts in September 1998, and other actions by Evans,
caused ``considerable doubts as to the seriousness of your
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Guffey also wrote that the agreement in question ``solely
required Coltec to notify Crane if a third party contacted Coltec
about participating in an attempt to take over Crane, with Crane
having a reciprocal obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Coltec letter, a Crane spokeswoman said:
``Their response is merely diversionary and not substantive. We're
asking the court for a level playing field. We still don't have a
level playing field and the agreement we have with Coltec is
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Crane filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New
York against Coltec and Goodrich, contending that Coltec, by
accepting the Goodrich offer, had broken a 1995 promise to notify
Crane of any offers to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to allow Crane to present its offer, which had
never been publicly disclosed, to Coltec's board. It also asks the
court to prohibit the companies from enacting anti-takeover
provisions that make it prohibitively expensive for another company
to make an offer for Coltec.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich has said it has no plans to drop its offer to buy
Coltec, a maker of aerospace components and industrial products in
Charlotte, N.C. Last month, Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec,
offering 0.56 share of Goodrich common stock for each Coltec share.
The deal also calls for Goodrich to assume about $610 million in
debt and move its corporate headquarters from Richfield, Ohio, to
Charlotte. As of Thursday, the deal was worth about $1.3 billion,
excluding debt.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Crane made an informal offer to buy Coltec,
offering is shareholders 0.80 Crane share for each outstanding
share of Coltec. A formal offer, in a registered letter dated Nov.
20, was received on Nov. 24, one day after the deal with Goodrich
was announced. As of Thursday, Crane's offer was worth about $1.6
billion. On Thursday, Coltec's shares rose 50 cents, to $18.3125.
B.F. Goodrich rose 93.75 cents, to $33.75, and Crane rose 6.25
cents, to $27.75.

U.S. INTENDS TO FILE FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST BROADWAY PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Ill.)  (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal regulators intend to file civil charges
against Livent Inc., the Broadway theater producer, and some former
employees for securities and accounting fraud, according to
documents the company has filed in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan is deciding whether to bring
criminal charges against Garth H. Drabinsky and Myron I. Gottlieb,
the company's founders, said a lawyer representing Gottlieb. The
lawyer, Brian H. Greenspan of Toronto, said that he expects a
decision in the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the U.S. Attorney will review all the information and
will not indict,'' Greenspan said. ``They've done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney said he could not confirm or
deny whether there was an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new management team, headed by Michael Ovitz, the
former president of the Walt Disney Co., dismissed Drabinsky and
Gottlieb from their executive jobs in November, saying the two had
engaged in a widespread fraud that cost the company and its
shareholders more than $60 million. Livent, a Canadian company, is
the producer of ``Ragtime'' on Broadway and other shows in New
York, Chicago and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and his team, who took over in June, said the two men had
directed the company's accountants to manipulate the books so that
millions of dollars of extravagant spending on advertising, actors,
actresses and elaborate sets were never reflected in the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   The new managers have also said that Drabinsky and Gottlieb gave
themselves more than $7.5 million in ``kickbacks'' by funneling
Livent money to another company in Toronto that Gottlieb owned. The
two men have said that the questioned transactions occurred before
Livent sold stock to the public. They call the transactions proper
dealings between two private companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has also begun a criminal
investigation. On Wednesday, officers removed dozens of boxes of
papers from Livent's Toronto headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also turned over more than 140,000 documents to
U.S. government authorities, court papers show.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed in federal Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan on Wednesday, securities regulators have asked the
company to terminate five accountants, including the chief
financial officer, as a step toward settling the securities law
violations that may be brought against it.
</P>
<P>
   The five accountants, who made up most of Livent's accounting
staff, were terminated Dec. 14. But Livent has now discovered it
needs them to complete critical reports, including financial
statements for the third quarter. The regulators have agreed that
the accountants can work for the company as consultants, the court
papers said, as long as they do not work from Livent's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Livent has sought bankruptcy court approval to rehire the
accountants as consultants, and a hearing has been scheduled for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five accountants could be reached for comment. A
spokesman for Livent declined to comment.

GREENSPAN WEARS ROSE-COLORED GLASSES WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bud Greenspan knows what's happening in the real world of
Olympic politics. The film maker knows that Mark Hodler, a Swiss
member of the International Olympic Committee's executive board,
has alleged that agents have offered to sell IOC members' votes for
payments from cities bidding to play host to the Olympics. He knows
that the Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said that during its
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, it paid nearly $400,000
in scholarships for relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard about the realities, but he prefers to make
idealistic films that extol athletic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-buying? Steroids? Human growth hormones? All are topics for
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do controversy well,'' he said Thursday. ``I wouldn't
know how to handle it. I'm thankful I'm not involved in the
bureaucratic or commercial side of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   His new film, ``Nagano '98 Olympics: Bud Greenspan's Stories of
Honor and Glory'' (Showtime, Sunday at 8 p.m.), typifies his style.
There are no disquieting words _ unless you count references to the
awful, event-delaying weather _ just tales of triumph by Bjorn
Daehlie (over a rival, the Norwegian cross-country skier Thomas
Alsgaard); Lu Chen (over self-doubt, loneliness and the intrusive
Chinese figure skating federation); the downhill skier Deborah
Compagnoni (over knee injuries to win her third gold medal in
successive Olympics) and the ski jumper Masahiko Harada (against
the memory of his indelible failure to make a crucial jump in the
1994 Lillehammer Winter Games).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to spend 100 percent of my time on the 90 percent
that's good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than the positive images of victory and defeat that
Greenspan films, the best indicators of his unrepentant Olympic
romanticism are his emotional scripts. As the 17-year-old speed
skater Kirstin Holum took a slow, post-race lap around the rink
with Dianne, her mother and coach, the narrator Will Lyman said:
``Kirstin Holum _ one in a galaxy of distant stars who for a few
moments broke through the clouds for a brief visit and while she
was here, left for those who saw her, lifetime dreams of what might
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: Compagnoni is a ``a woman of uncommon bravery and talent who
for more than a decade has risen to meet every challenge while
living each day by the very simple principle: one who is strong can
afford to be gentle.'' Brian Stemmle's near-victory in the men's
downhill until he missed a gate (losing to Jean-Luc Cretier)
exemplified valor, ``and those who possess it never know for
certain if they will have it when the next test comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan more than admits to being old-fashioned, and
uninterested in muckraking. Even if this film had no official
sanction _ this work is the official film of the Nagano Olympic
committee _ he would undoubtedly ignore the negative to seek
uplift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the lone survivor of idealism,'' he said. ``I might be
from another century. I like the Olympics to be two weeks of
fluff.'' He knows it can't be like that, but he can pretend.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is the blithe-hearted alternative to reports that
presaged Hodler's charges. In a 1996 segment of HBO's ``Real
Sports,'' the correspondent Frank Deford reported allegations that
bidding cities were pressured to give college scholarships to the
offspring of IOC members. Deford confronted an unresponsive Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, with a charge that
Swaziland's IOC member demanded a scholarship for his son in return
for his vote for Falun, Sweden, to be the host of the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Bob Simon of CBS' ``60 Minutes'' described how
Nagano snared the Winter Olympics, and how, during the bidding,
Japanese interests donated $25 million to Samaranch's pet project,
the Olympic Museum, in Lausanne, Switzerland. More broadly, the
report outlined the financial largess cities lay out to bid for the
Olympics. Could a city get the Olympics without spending a fortune?
Simon asked Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will be not easy,'' Samaranch said. ``Will be quite
difficult.''

LIVINGSTON ADMITS TO EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS ON EVE OF IMPEACHMENT
DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest bizarre twist to the impeachment
saga, incoming House Speaker Robert Livingston admitted Thursday
that he has had extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The confession by the Louisiana Republican came on the eve of a
historic debate over whether the president should be impeached for
lying under oath about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston acknowledged his adulterous affairs in a closed-door
meeting with Republican House members who had caucused to finalize
the details of the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have on occasion strayed from my marriage and doing so
nearly cost me my marriage and my family,'' he told stunned
colleagues, who applauded after his confession.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he would not reveal specifics about the
relationships, but the weekly newspaper Roll Call, which broke the
story, said the affairs occurred during his congressional career.
Livingston was first elected in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also told his colleagues that his
``indiscretions were not with employees on my staff, and I have
never been asked to testify under oath about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly drawing a distinction between his case and that
of the president, who allegedly lied under oath about an affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also said he decided to acknowledge the affairs
after he learned that individuals working with the media were
investigating his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler Magazine, in October offered
$1 million to women who would detail sexual affairs with prominent
politicians, and there was immediate speculation on Capitol Hill
that Livingston's statement might have been an effort to pre-empt
Flynt's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday night from Los Angeles, Flynt
said that he had Livingston ``under investigation as a result of
receiving tips from four different women. However, we have not
concluded that investigation and therefore cannot comment further
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston vowed not to be intimidated by those digging up dirt
from his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort will not deter me from doing my sworn duty under
the Constitution as a member of Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston suggested that he has not been dishonest about his
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did an early interview with the media after announcing
my candidacy for speaker, I told a reporter that I was running for
speaker, not sainthood. There was a reason for those words,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming speaker did not specifically offer to resign but
told lawmakers: ``Ladies and gentlemen, my fate is in your hands,''
according to Mike Scanlon, a spokesman for House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were pretty much mum about Livingston's confession,
although they strongly denied allegations by Republicans that they
were the sources of the stories about his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not going to touch this one,'' said one Democratic leadership
aide when asked to comment.``It's just too bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who would comment said Livingston's admission would likely
not change the outcome of the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally united behind Livingston. But a few
conservatives said it was fair to draw parallels between Clinton's
situation and the incoming speaker's.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ``Crossfire,'' Rep. Mark Sanford of South
Carolina acknowledged that while Clinton may be subject to
``legal'' recriminations because he lied about his relationship
with Lewinsky, Livingston must also be held at least morally
accountable for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he lied ... He lied to his wife,'' Sanford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford suggested that some Americans might legitimately
question whether Clinton's accusers in the impeachment process _
the Republican majority in the Congress _ are morally qualified to
pass judgment on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful for everybody concerned, and it does cloud the
issue (of impeachment), there's no doubt about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those who attended the caucus where Livingston
revealed his past indiscretions were supportive.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who has criticized Clinton for committing adultery,
defended Livingston at the meeting, according to Scanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said DeLay reminded those present ``that there are many
in this room who have sinned.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that DeLay talked to them about how to cleanse sin and
said, ``Bob has walked through the steps of contrition, confession
and cleansing, and we should all stand behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the GOP whip was not so charitable when at a
breakfast meeting with reporters he condemned Clinton's
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a president who in my opinion has cheated on his
wife he will cheat on the American people,'' DeLay said last March.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., also defended Livingston, saying
that having an extramartial affair is not comparable to the perjury
and obstruction of justice charges leveled at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Republicans were dumbstruck by Livingston's statement.
``He's so strait-laced,'' said a New Orleans GOP activist who is
friends with Livingston's family. ``It must have been going on in
Washington, because if we'd known we would have been gossiping
about it down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's disclosure of infidelity is the latest in a stream
of confessions by House Republicans caught up in the scandal fever
sweeping Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year it was revealed that House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who presided over the impeachment
inquiry, had an extramarital affair over 30 years ago. And one of
Clinton's fiercest critics, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., admitted to
fathering a child out of wedlock.

MINIMED SHARES HIT NEW HIGH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stock of MiniMed Inc. surged 8.7 &UR;  &LR; percent Thursday
for its fifth consecutive all-time high, buoyed by investor
enthusiasm over a diabetes control device that may hit the market
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares gained $7.25 to close at $90.25 on heavy volume, after a
gain of $3.50 on Wednesday. The recent jump was fueled by the
company's presentation this week at an ING Barings Furman Selz
conference about its microsensor for monitoring insulin levels,
according to Salomon Smith Barney analyst Melissa Wilmoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``MiniMed's been acting like an Internet stock,'' Wilmoth said,
noting that she had set a price target of $83 seven weeks ago when
MiniMed shares slid to $54. ``People thought I was out of my mind
at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's microsensor is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. ``It would be a breakthrough technology in the care
and management of diabetes,'' said Wilmoth, noting the worldwide
market for diabetes monitoring devices is about $3 billion and that
the MiniMed machine could go on sale four years ahead of competing
devices.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Sylmar-based company, which has annual sales of
about $100million, is now perceived as a potential takeover
candidate. ``It's fairly clear to sophisticated investors that
what's driving the stock up is the anticipated approval and
takeout,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, pacemaker producer Medtronic made a $30 million
investment in MiniMed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On another day of surreal split-screen frenzy in
the capital, the Republicans in the House of Representatives
decided Thursday to begin debate on the impeachment of President
Clinton on Friday, when U.S. warplanes will presumably be preparing
for further raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An uproar over the timing of the impeachment debate broke out on
the House floor Thursday afternoon while television screens outside
were aglow with ghostly green images of bombs and missiles
exploding in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no sign that any House Republicans were wavering
on impeachment _ indeed, several more undecided Republicans said
they would vote for impeachment _ it was evident that the party
leadership had been thrown off stride by the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's strategists conceded that the struggle in the
House had been lost, though it was not clear whether the vote would
come on Friday or Saturday, and turned grimly to the task of
preparing for a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also faced bitter criticism on the diplomatic front from
a handful of foreign countries, notably Russia and China, for
resorting to force. The Russians recalled their ambassador from
Washington in protest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected strenuously to moving ahead with impeachment
while the bombing campaign was under way. It is expected to end by
this weekend, a White House official said, when the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan starts.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said debate
would begin at 9 a.m. Friday, with voting on the four articles of
impeachment running into Saturday. No change was conceded by the
Republicans, but discussions about the timetable and the rules,
especially the one governing the time to be allotted for debate,
continued deep into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some significant change, the stage was set for the
spectacle of a House vote on impeaching a president for only the
second time in 130 years, taking place while U.S. military planes
were flying over hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to complete this mission,'' Clinton vowed as allied
bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and other parts of Iraq
with a second wave of punishing airstrikes. Reports from the scene
said that explosions in the capital were louder and more percussive
than those in the first wave on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of casualties among U.S. pilots, but in
Baghdad, officials said that at least 25 Iraqis had died, and
Clinton acknowledged that Iraqi civilian casualties were
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes red and puffy with fatigue, the president forcefully
but without visible rancor rejected suggestions from senior
Republicans that he had ordered the strikes to dissipate momentum
towards impeachment. ``I don't think any serious person would
believe that any president would do such a thing,'' Clinton
commented just before a briefing in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The president was told at the briefing, and reporters were later
informed, that the first volley of more than 200 unmanned cruise
missiles, launched from ships in the Persian Gulf at some 50
targets, had leveled President Saddam Hussein's military
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks of security guards at
weapons sites. But Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, conceded that other strikes were ``not as
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at an aerial photo of one of Iraq's special security
brigade headquarters, Shelton said, ``You don't see anything but
rubble in what was formerly this building.''
</P>
<P>
   The second wave on Thursday, which included British Tornado
bombers for the first time, sent more cruise missiles deep into
Iraq while navy planes with laser-guided bombs went after Iraqi
air-defense sites along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, China and Russia all called for an immediate end to the
attacks, but a divided U.N. Security Council took no further
action. France, whose initial reaction was rather negative, seemed
to be softening somewhat after President Jacques Chirac had what
his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, called ``a good conversation''
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, responsibility lies clearly with the Iraqi
president,'' Chirac said in a subsequent statement. ``The main
point is to settle problems that, without a doubt, will not be
settled by airstrikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans overwhelmingly support airstrikes against Iraq, with
four national polls taken on Wednesday evening after the bombing
began showing that the action was viewed favorably by about
three-quarters of the public. The support figures were 73 percent
in an ABC News poll, 79 percent in a CBS News poll, 75 percent in
an NBC News poll and 74 percent in a poll conducted by the Gallup
Organization for CNN and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   However, a significant fraction of those who support
impeachment, a relatively small minority of the population in
itself, believes that the imminence of a House vote may have
affected the timing of the raids in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans who sharply questioned the honesty of
Clinton's justification of the raids on Wednesday pulled back on
Thursday, though none apologized. Notable in this group was former
Secretary of State Lawrence F. Eagleburger, who said after a
meeting with the present holder of that job, Madeleine Albright,
that he would mute his language in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism from both parties, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, backed away from his charge that the strikes were
linked to impeachment. After overnight reflection, he said, ``I am
satisfied this was a military decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CNN, Lott also confirmed that the Senate
would open a trial of the president if any of the articles of
impeachment were approved, and he said there would be no deals to
cut it short, as a number of Democrats have proposed recently.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of Republican senators, including John McCain of
Arizona, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, John W. Warner of Virginia
and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, voiced support of the
president's decision to strike now. All are prominent party
spokesmen on defense and foreign policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the party worried that proceeding with the impeachment
debate and vote might backfire on the speaker-elect, Rep. Robert L.
Livingston of Louisiana, just as closing down the federal
government a few years ago came to haunt the outgoing speaker, Newt
Gingrich. A Republican senator deeply involved with foreign policy
said, ``It is Bob's call, of course, but he had better watch
carefully where he treads.''
</P>
<P>
   The political future of Livingston himself was called into
question on Thursday when, after being informed that a disclosure
was imminent, he admitted to extramarital indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in what may have been his last speech as speaker, told
the House: ``No matter what our debates at home, we are as a nation
prepared to lead the world.'' Later, the House voted 417-5 in favor
of a resolution expressing support for U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against an impeachment debate now, Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., the House minority leader, said it could be ``misperceived
as a sign of disunity'' by Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Lee Hamilton, a widely respected Indiana Democrat,
said it was ``unwise to weaken the president'' at a time when a new
invasion of Kuwait, a missile assault on Israel or a peace
initiative might be triggered by the allied air raids.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey quoted the president himself in rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the White House Thursday morning whether his authority
would be undercut by an impeachment vote, Clinton said: ``No. I'm
going to complete this mission, we're going to complete this
mission. The Republican leadership have to decide how to do their
job. That's not for me to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also placed calls Thursday to at least two House
Democrats who appeared to be wavering in their opposition to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A vote of support for Clinton came from former President Jimmy
Carter. Though a Democrat, he has never been particularly close to
Clinton, and he has said little about the prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, he said in a statement issued in Atlanta
that charges that the president had launched the attacks ``for
political purposes are both unjust and ill-advised.''
</P>
<P>
   As Saddam visited sites struck by allied missiles, including the
home of the youngest of his three daughters, Clinton talked by
telephone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of
Jordan and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as well as
Chirac, searching for support.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she had called officials in more than 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Russians and the Chinese demanded the
resignation of Richard Butler, the head of the U.N. inspection team
in Iraq, whose report triggered the American attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said the United States would ``fight for him,'' and
Butler defended his report as ``factual, clear, objective and
honest.'' No one had orchestrated it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sought to squelch any
suggestions that Saddam or any members of his family were the
targets of American weapons. ``We are targeting military or
militarily related targets, period,'' the secretary declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that it was sending reinforcements to the
gulf, including 10 F-117 Stealth fighters, Patriot antimissile
units and troops. Military police, communications specialists and
Special Forces are among those to be rushed to the area. More than
3,000 other troops are already on hand in Kuwait in case Saddam
should decide to strike back there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, meanwhile, security was tightened at airports, the
Capitol and other federal buildings, to guard against any
retaliatory terrorist attacks. Up to 40 U.S. embassies were closed
by the State department for two days for the same reason, officials
said.

   Tark tries to forget `terrible' year
   By Jack Wilkinson
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last seen last month in ``Between the Madness,''
a TV documentary that aired on Fox, Jerry Tarkanian _ patron saint
of the wayward point guard and, to some, the Father Flanagan of his
very own Boyz Town _ slouched in a despondent locker room and
muttered, ``Boy, I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the season, not the game. Actually, that loss, a 95-79
rout by Georgia in the NIT consolation game in March, was merciful.
It euthanized one of the most lurid basketball seasons in recent
memory. Between the ``Midnight Madness'' opening practice and the
season-ending ``March Madness'' was the madness that was Fresno
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad year,'' Tarkanian called it. ``The hardest year I ever
had. We never had enough guys to practice. We were like a CBA team.
Three new guys every week.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBA usually loses players to NBA 10-day contracts, European
leagues or waivers. Fresno suffered a litany of ills: academic
ineligibility, failed drug tests, substance-abuse rehab, suspension
for assaulting a girlfriend, one starter quitting the team and
dropping out of school, another arrested for assault with a deadly
weapon _ samurai swords and a loaded gun _ and grand theft. All
chronicled in ``Between the Madness,'' nearly all blistered by Mike
Wallace in a ``60 Minutes'' report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a bad year,'' Tarkanian said. His third season
at his alma mater began with high expectations and ended
disappointingly with a 22-13 record, no NCAA bid and a soiled
reputation nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some really talented kids,'' he said. ``If we had made
better decisions off the court and stayed together on it, we'd have
been really good.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Tarkanian returns to Atlanta, where he first
coached in the 1977 Final Four. He stormed the old Omni that March
with Reggie Theus, three guys named Smith and the rest of a UNLV
outfit that was the most runnin, rebellious in the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real excited. First time I ever coached in the Final
Four. I had a really outstanding team that wasn't real well known
'til the tournament,'' said Tark, whose Runnin' Rebels lost 84-83
to North Carolina in that semifinal. ``At the same time, we were
battling the N-C-2-A. They did everything to make it hard on us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Fresno State reacquaints itself with Georgia at the
Georgia Dome in the opener of the Delta Air Lines Holiday Classic
for Kids. This time, Tarkanian returns to Atlanta as a man who
sounds his age _ 68 _ and seeks to forget last season and forge
this one. He also sounds like a basketball coach with more typical
woes: No height. Little depth. And a severely sprained ankle that
has point guard Chris Herren on crutches and out of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to be a good team,'' Tarkanian said
about his 6-4 Bulldogs. ``Like every year I've been here, a couple
of guys are (academically) ineligible. We're always short
something. We only have eight scholarship players. We're getting
killed on the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Fresno State took its worst beatings off the court.
When the university hired one of its most celebrated alumni in
1995, it knew what it was getting in Tarkanian: a coach who took
UNLV to four Final Fours, winning the 1990 NCAA title; a 695-162
record in his 28th season in Division I-A, five wins away from 700
games; No. 3 in all-time winning percentage (.811), second to
Kansas' Roy Williams (.819) among active coaches.
</P>
<P>
   It also knew it was getting Tark the Shark, the NCAA's most
repellent Shark and most frequent target, whose UNLV program was
the constant target of NCAA surveillance. The Rebels eventually
were put on probation and Tarkanian forced to resign in 1992,
although he later sued the NCAA for harassment and won a financial
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State also was well aware of Tarkanian's longtime
penchant for recruiting talented, troubled kids, giving second
chances to players who were transfers, academic casualties and/or
in trouble with the law. It all boiled over last season and
resurfaced Monday when Tarkanian was a character witness for
Avondre Jones, last season's center, who was suspended twice for
failing drug tests before he was arrested in March on charges of
grand theft and assault with a deadly weapon. On Tuesday, Jones was
convicted on two misdemeanor counts for threatening a man with a
samurai sword, a felony charge of having a gun while on probation
and a misdemeanor marijuana charge. But Jones was cleared of six
other charges and, while he faces up to five years in prison at his
sentencing Feb. 3, he is expected to get probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he straightens his life out,'' Tarkanian said. ``He's a
talented kid. He's as happy as could be; he thought it was
Christmas (on Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' arrest was the most disturbing entry in last season's
tale of woe. ``Terrible,'' Tarkanian called the entire season. ``I
was really down.'' Yet asked what sort of image that season
projected to the public, what picture is left, he said, ``I don't
know. That's not my business. I know this: If other schools had the
same (random drug-testing and athletes' code of conduct) policy we
have, they'd have the same problems. I'm not saying that's bad that
we do. (But) we're the only one that enforced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had two (criminal) incidents. One was Avondre, and he
was acquitted (on some charges). The other was Rafer (Alston).''
</P>
<P>
   A former guard who had been suspended for assaulting his
ex-girlfriend, Alston started last season and was drafted by
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian asked, ``How many other players have problems with
their girlfriends?''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Alexander did at Virginia, where he starred in 1996-97
before being found guilty of assault and battery on his girlfriend
in July 1997. He was set to transfer to Connecticut, but the
university refused to admit him; he went instead to Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has reconciled with his girlfriend. After redshirting
last season, he's now a starting guard and 18th in the nation in
scoring (22.1 points per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Courtney,'' Tarkanian said. ``He got off to a slow
start. He was pressing, trying to do more things than he could. But
he's going to be a great, great player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tark? How long will he coach at Fresno State, where he's
70-40?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any plans at all,'' he said. In March, he reached
a new agreement with the school on a one-year contract with options
on the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd get here and get this thing turned around in a
hurry,'' Tarkanian said. ``And we haven't. I've done a bad job.

   Kentucky gets its man as Evans steps forward
</HEADLINE>
   By Mark Schlabach
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After losing three starters and a key reserve from
last year's national championship team, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith
was looking for someone to step forward and lead the Wildcats this
season.
</P>
<P>
   He might have found his man in senior Heshimu Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Evans has led the team to a 9-1 start and the nation's No. 3
ranking entering Saturday's game against Georgia Tech in the Delta
Air Lines Classic at the Georgia Dome. The 6-foot-6 forward leads
the Wildcats with 15.5 points and 3.7 assists per game. He's also
second in rebounding at 6.2 and has emerged as Kentucky's top
3-point threat.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who redshirted during the 1996-97 season after
transferring from Manhattan College, was the Wildcats' sixth man
last year, averaging 8.8 points and 5.4 rebounds. The emergence of
Evans has been a pleasant sight for Smith, who lost guard Jeff
Sheppard, forward Allen Edwards and center Nazr Mohammed from last
year's team.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mu' has always had this type of potential,'' Smith said.
``We were very fortunate in that we had a lot of depth at the wing
position (last season). This year, (Evans) has really stepped up.
He really worked hard on his ball-handling and passing, and that's
why he leads us in assists and scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Wildcats' 103-91 win over then-No. 2 Maryland in Rupp
Arena Saturday, Evans scored a career-high 31 points on 8-for-17
shooting with six rebounds. Forward Scott Padgett scored 25 and
guard Wayne Turner added 17 as Kentucky's seniors outscored their
Terrapin counterparts 73-31.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had 22 points in a 70-61 overtime win over then-No. 11
Indiana in Louisville on Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also hopes Evans can become the Wildcats' top defender.
Edwards filled that role for Kentucky last season. At 6-5, Edwards
was physical enough to guard larger players but quick enough to
handle smaller guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop someone on our team that has a defensive
stopper mentality,'' Smith said. ``I think Heshimu can do that for
us because he's athletic enough to play multiple positions and he's
versatile enough to guard guys who are bigger and smaller than he
is.

   Stern sends letter to NBA players
</HEADLINE>
   By Jeffrey Denberg
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NBA commissioner David Stern made a bold move in the
lockout Thursday with an open letter to players detailing
conciliatory issues in the league's latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In a direct appeal certain to infuriate union leadership, Stern
wrote, ``It is important that there be no doubt about the precise
terms you consider to be such a 'bad deal' that you would prefer to
lose the entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   The major points are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The league is no longer asking for a hard cap and has included
several salary-cap exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ There will be a Larry Bird exception available to all players,
subject to percentage limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ The league says it is willing to modify its ``timing rule'' to
benefit the league's middle class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limits will be placed on the NBA's version of an
escrow-and-tax system to come into play in the fourth year of a
six- or seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The NBA guarantees its players will remain the highest-paid in
sports. Figures the league used for the 1997-98 season show a
median salary of $1.68 million for NBA players, against $1.05 for
hockey, $430,000 for major-league baseball and $410,000 for the
NFL. The average NBA salary is $2.624 million, $1.375 million for
baseball, $1.1 million for the NHL and $910,000 for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Other key points in the lette:
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``middle-class'' salary exception will be allowed every year
to each team over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bird'' contract players will be allowed 12.5 percent annual
raises, with 7.5 percent raises to other players.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum salaries would start at $250,000, with $50,000 annual
increases to as much as $1 million for 10-year players.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft picks will get three-year scale contracts,
with a team option for a fourth year and right of first refusal.
</P>
<P>
   The league would pay the union 50 percent of the proceeds from
NBA Properties but would eliminate the $25 million flat payment.
</P>
<P>
   Some unspecified salary-cap rules are subject to negotiation,
the league said.

   Moreland makes leap
</HEADLINE>
   By Earnest Reese
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During his high school career in Atlanta, Earthwind
Moreland was known as a talented basketball player with an unusual
first name. Now, he's one of the top defensive backs on a team one
victory away from a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   When top-ranked Georgia Southern (14-0) faces Massachusetts
(11-3) in the Division I-AA championship game Saturday, the Grady
High graduate will be a key player. The road to the brink of a
fifth national title for the Eagles has been a long one for
Moreland, whose mother named him after the R&AMP;B singing group Earth,
Wind and Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 179-pound Moreland, who has a time of 4.31
seconds in the 40-yard dash, joined the Georgia Southern program as
a walk-on and spent the early part of his career as a receiver.
After being switched to defensive back, he has made an immediate
impression, playing well enough at cornerback this season to be
named first-team All-Southern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got here, Earthwind was the fastest player on
the team,'' second-year head coach Paul Johnson said. ``With his
speed, we felt like we should move him from receiver and play him
on the corner. I think he could play on the next level _ at least,
his speed is going making a lot of (NFL) teams look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Moreland believes that basketball has helped him
progress in his football career. Moreland teams with safety Arkee
Thompson, another former basketball player who also played receiver
at Georgia Southern, to form one of the best secondary tandems in
the Southern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has team-highs of 140 tackles (65 solo hits) and eight
interceptions. Moreland has three interceptions, returning them for
102 yards, and also ranks among the team leaders in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think basketball helped both of us develop our leaping
ability,'' Moreland said. ``And playing in the secondary is almost
like basketball. You've got to keep your feet moving and your eye
on the guy you're playing, then when the ball is in the air, you've
got to act like it's a rebound you're trying to get.''
</P>
<P>
   To defeat Massachusetts, a team that had to beat higher seeds
McNeese State and Northwestern (La.) State on the road to reach the
championship game in Chattanooga, Moreland thinks he and his
teammates will have to muster the same kind of effort they did last
week against Western Illinois. Despite the presence of 2,000-yard
rusher Aaron Stecker, the Eagles' first-line defense allowed only
one touchdown en route to the 42-14 victory over the Leathernecks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Minutemen will present a different kind of problem
for the Eagles' defense. Quarterback Todd Bankhead has passed for
3,767 yards and 34 touchdowns; senior wideout Jimmy Moore, with 86
catches for 1,431 yards, and senior tight end Kerry Taylor (70,
832), have been Bankhead's most frequent targets.
</P>
<P>
   That potent passing attack should give the Eagles secondary its
toughest test of the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moreland appears ready for the challenge, especially
considering all the obstacles he has had to overcome to put himself
in this position.
</P>
<P>
   ``(UMass) has a 2,000-yard rusher (in sophomore tailback Marcel
Shipp) and some of the best receivers we've faced all season,''
Moreland said. ``We've got to play equally as hard as we did last
week to beat them and win the national championship.''

   Livingstone seeking vindication
</HEADLINE>
   By Earnest Reese
   c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Livingstone College coach Ruby Abrams has run the
final seconds of last year's inaugural Pioneer Bowl through his
mind perhaps a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, though, the reality is the same _ quarterback Pernell
Wilder fails to score on two tries from the 1-yard line and
Livingstone falls short in a 30-26 loss to Kentucky State. But
Abrams and the returning veterans from the Salisbury, N.C., team
get a chance Saturday for atonement, facing SIAC champion Tuskegee
(9-2) in Pioneer Bowl II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a total of 18 players from that team, and quite
frankly, we didn't think we'd get back,'' said Abrams, whose 1997
squad included All-CIAA running back Wilmont Perry, now a member of
the New Orleans Saints. ``But this was a goal we set at the
beginning of the season _ to get back to the Pioneer Bowl, so we
could redeem overselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Virginia Union in the second game of the season,
and due for a date with conference favorite Virginia State two
weeks later, the Blue Bears' prospects did not look promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had our doubts after the Virginia Union game,''
Abrams said. ``But we beat Virginia State (42-29) and began feeling
good about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the fourth game of the season for Livingstone (7-3),
the smallest football-playing school in Division II. By that time,
such first-year players as running backs Carlton Jones and Ray
Chambers had adjusted. Freshman linebacker Rodney Hunt, the team's
second-leading tackler, and Shavares Thompson, who led the CIAA
with eight interceptions, were making major contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sophomore quarterbacks D'andra Hopper and Anthony
Kilpatrick, operating behind veterans LaTeef Williamson (6 feet 5,
295), Gerald Hilliard (6-2, 282) and Charles Cooley (6-5, 292),
were effectively running a grinding offense.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been Perry's replacement in the Blue Bears' backfield
who has helped bring the team back to Atlanta. Tailback Carlton
Jones, a 5-9, 180-pound freshman, has rushed for 1,220 yards and 21
touchdowns, gaining 7.5 yards a carry.

   ``He's a very exciting runner _ strong and hard to bring down,''
Abrams said. ``Of course, (5-11, 200-pound freshman) Ray Chambers
has done a great job for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, with a 6.0-yard-per-carry average, has 738 of
Livingstone's 2,913 rushing yards. Sophomore Shannon Gainey (5-11,
200) is another offensive producer. Along with his 457 rushing
yards, Gainey leads the running-oriented team in receptions with 17
catches for 232 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get him on the field, because he's such a great
athlete,'' Abrams said. ``The way all of those guys have played for
us, we feel pretty good going into this Pioneer Bowl.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many of the Arab-Americans in the Bay Ridge
section of Brooklyn, Yasser Madbouly said Thursday that he was
sickened to see his adopted country launch missile strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my country now,'' said Madbouly, who emigrated from
Egypt 17 years ago and has owned the popular King Falafel
Restaurant on Third Avenue for 10 years. ``My wife is American. My
five kids were all born and raised here, and I even feel that I am
a stranger now when I go back to Egypt to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But watching television last night and seeing what was
happening to Iraq, it made me feel like a stranger here _ for the
first time,'' he added as he sipped strong, sweet Arabic coffee in
his restaurant on Thursday. ``Innocent children are dying. What we
preach is not what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is no more popular among most
Arab immigrants living in the United States than he is in the White
House. But to those who have lived in the Middle East, have friends
who have lived or worked in Iraq, and know intimately the
powerlessness of people who live in the grip of a dictator, the
latest missile strikes elicited dismay and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``America indirectly allows Saddam Hussein to get more
powerful,'' said Hani Ramawi, a 22-year-old Palestinian-American
student at York College in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein is a dictator,'' Ramawi added as he prepared
for afternoon prayers at the Islamic Center of Bay Ridge. ``He
doesn't care about killing his own people. But this makes him more
desperate and it makes his people more fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Ridge is home to a mix of Arab immigrants, both Muslim and
Christian, from all over the Middle East and Africa, and a
scattering of mosques as well as Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox
churches. While some residents interviewed contended that the
hard-line U.S. policy toward Iraq reflects a bias against Muslims
and Islamic countries, most said that their negative reaction to
the latest attacks stemmed from concern for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam has a big head and he has bombs,'' said John Awd, an
immigrant from Syria who works at a convenience store on Fourth
Avenue. ``But I feel sorry for the people. I am Catholic, but I
don't care about religion. It's a question of human beings. I don't
like to hurt people and I want everyone to live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Osama Elshinawy, an immigrant from Egypt who owns a furniture
store on Fifth Avenue, agreed with that sentiment. ``Saddam Hussein
is guilty,'' he said. ``But his people are paying for it even
though they are against him and against his policies. Women and
children die.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people also expressed anger at the timing of the attacks.
Ramadan, the monthlong Islamic holiday during which Muslims fast
during daylight hours, will begin this weekend. According to Islam,
the month of fasting marks God's revelation of the Koran to the
prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a holy month,'' said Nehal Hussein, a 35-year-old
homemaker from Brooklyn who immigrated to the United States from
Egypt five years ago. ``People are fasting the whole day. It's like
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   She said President Clinton and previous U.S. administrations
have used a double standard in their foreign policy, punishing
Muslim nations with force for resisting U.N. resolutions and
handling non-Muslim countries guilty of the same behavior with
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Clinton do to Netanyahu when he didn't do what he was
supposed to do in the peace process?'' said Mrs. Hussein, referring
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. ``Did he bomb him?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Arab-Americans also expressed the kind of political
cynicism that can be heard anywhere in the country, from the halls
of Congress to the streets of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel the president was doing this now just to
cover himself and delay the impeachment vote,'' said Madbouly, the
restaurant owner. ``And he got what he wanted. But we as Americans
_ and I'm speaking not as an Arab, but as an American _ are really
bothered when we see children being bombed. We all feel it's wrong
because innocent people are dying.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American and British forces are taking care to
avoid hitting Iraqi factories suspected of producing chemical and
biological weapons, Pentagon officials said on Thursday, adding
that bombing and missile strikes had caused extensive damage to
military, intelligence and communications targets.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors to determine whether it
had destroyed its stocks of those weapons led to President
Clinton's order on Wednesday to begin the air assault.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon said on Thursday that although the elimination
of chemical and biological weapons was the ultimate aim of the
United States, the strikes avoided those plants for fear of
unleashing deadly plumes of poisons and causing civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes, which resumed Thursday night after a daytime lull,
were inflicting significant damage to Iraq's air defenses,
intelligence and security headquarters and barracks belonging to
the elite Republican Guards, according to an early assessment
offered at the Pentagon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The initial strikes appeared to catch the Iraqis by surprise,
since they had done little to deploy troops or weapons to avoid
attacks, Pentagon officials said. The Republican Guards, who help
maintain President Saddam Hussein's grip on power, were a focus of
the strike, but the Pentagon could not yet estimate the number of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, who appeared at the
Pentagon with Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said the United States did not intend to destroy
suspected weapons factories that might also make benign commercial
products, even though those plants could be essential to the covert
development of chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to take a chance and try to target any
facility that would release any kind of horrific damage to innocent
people,'' Cohen said earlier on NBC's ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks underscored the fact that even three or four
days of heavy attacks _ as Pentagon planners now envision _ would
not be enough to destroy Iraq's ability to produce even small
amounts of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Having conceded that, Cohen and Shelton outlined a mission with
the objective of weakening Saddam's government and military,
including missile sites and military bases central to launching
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no illusions of how difficult it is'' to destroy
chemical or biological weapons production, Cohen said at the
Pentagon. ``We intend to focus on the military aspects of his
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   To that extent, the first wave of strikes appeared to succeed,
officials said. Nearly 250 cruise missiles launched from seven
warships and a submarine in the Persian Gulf _ followed up by 40
attacks by fighter jets launched from the aircraft carrier
Enterprise _ struck more than 50 targets in the first day of the
attack, Shelton announced.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton unveiled satellite photographs showing extensive damage
to two targets in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad: the military
intelligence headquarters and barracks belonging to Republican
Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building right here,'' Shelton said, pointing to a
photograph of the intelligence building, ``you'll notice down here
there's nothing left but rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Air force bombers and fighters _ including B-52s armed with more
powerful cruise missiles _ and British attack jets based in Kuwait
joined in the assault for the first time just as dusk fell in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Iraqi capital, sirens again sounded and anti-aircraft
fire speckled the dark with flashes and bursts. Afterward loud
explosions reverberated throughout the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf said the attacks
struck civilian areas of Baghdad and inflicted heavy casualties. He
described damage at several targets, including a factory producing
batteries and several government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's health minister said at least 25 people had died and 75
others were wounded in Baghdad alone. One of the strikes also
damaged a palace belonging to Saddam's daughter, Hala, who was
uninjured, Iraqi officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I checked, Saddam had something like 80
palaces,'' Cohen said when asked whether the strikes were
deliberately aimed at Saddam or his family.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon offered few details of the strikes, officials
said that nearly 100 missiles, each with 2,000-pound warheads,
struck targets in Iraq Thursday. They said they were fired by B-52s
based on the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Other American and British pilots flew deep into Iraq on
Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday night, after two days and dozens of strikes, no
American or British pilot had been killed, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bursts of anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad, few of the
fighter jets involved encountered significant challenges from
surface-to-air missiles, though most of the aircraft flew high
enough to avoid low-level threats.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said the initial cruise missile strikes succeeded
in striking their first targets: Iraq's air defenses, especially in
the southern half of the country. ``The cruise missiles softened
things up pretty well,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks Thursday continued through the night. The heavier cruise
missiles launched from the B-52s _ with their 2,000-pound warheads
able to penetrate thick layers of concrete _ were aimed at more
heavily fortified targets in Baghdad, including underground bunkers
used by the Iraqi military and political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton said the objective was to erode Saddam's
ability to threaten attacks against neighboring countries _ like
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or Israel. With the Clinton administration now
advocating the overthrow of Saddam, Shelton conceded that anything
that weakened his grip on power ``would be value added.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and British missiles tore at the heart of
Iraq's military and intelligence operations Thursday, pounding to
rubble more than 50 sites as the strikes rolled toward a third day
early Friday with no sign of let up.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials condemned the attacks, with Foreign Minister
Mohammed Said Al-Sahhaf lashing out at ''corrupt politicians,'' in
London and Washington he accused of using ''cheap lies,'' in order
''to have the pretext to commit aggression against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   With Iraqi defense systems, airfields, military barracks and
communications systems in the crosshairs, U.S. warships, fighter
jets and giant B-52 bombers launched scores of cruise missiles deep
into Iraq as an operation the Pentagon has dubbed ''Desert Fox,''
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the possibility that the attacks could continue through
the weekend, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday
that he does not regard the beginning of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan -- expected to begin on Saturday night -- as a deadline for
halting strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take whatever time is necessary to carry out the
operation,'' Cohen told reporters at a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to complete it as soon as we can without
restricting the military operation,'' Cohen said. ''But we're
sensitive to the Ramadan period and that's all I care to say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In early signs of success, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Gen. Hugh Shelton showed reporters at the briefing military
pictures of two key Baghdad sites -- a military intelligence
headquarters building and barracks for units of Iraq's elite
Republican Guard -- reduced to smoke and ash by multiple cruise
missile hits early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing left but rubble,'' Shelton told reporters, as
they looked on at a shot of what had been military intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad. Thursday's attack began about 11 a.m. EST
and lasted nearly twice as long as Wednesday's six-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton showed shots of the Republican Guard barracks in a
similar state, saying that ''four of the five barracks (targeted)
were destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the country, Shelton said, attacks were ''as
successful or more successful than this was, some of it not quite
as successful.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no U.S. or British casualties reported as of 9 p.m.
EST Thursday night, according National Security Advisor Samuel E.
``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that the Republican Guard units and the agents who
worked at the military intelligence unit in Baghdad were central to
Iraq's efforts to spy on and obstruct the work of United Nations
weapons inspectors in Iraq. The inspectors have been working there
to try to identify and dismantle Iraq's alleged chemical and
biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on air defenses were designed to make it safer for
piloted aircraft to strike deeper into Iraq in attacks that are
expected to continue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 51 combat aircraft from the United States, including F-117
Stealth fighters and F-15 fighters, were ordered to the gulf
Wednesday, along with a Navy carrier and 5,600 Army soldiers from
Georgia, Texas and New York. They will join the 24,000 troops
already in the region and are expected to arrive this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's Al-Sahhaf said the United States was unjustifiably
targeting sites that United Nations weapons inspectors had been
allowed to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference, he noted several that he said had been
hit. He said that some had cameras in place that monitored the
developments of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are examples to show what cheap liars the leaders of the
British and American regimes are,'' Al-Sahhaf said. ``They think
they can get away with their crimes by deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, there were lines at some gas stations Thursday as
residents stocked up on fuel in apparent anticipation of more air
strikes. But for the most part, there was a sense of normalcy in
the capital city of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said the two nights of
bombings had killed as many as 30 people and injured 75 others.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to obtain independent damage assessments.
Foreign reporters are not permitted to roam the city without
government escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton told reporters he had no regrets
about launching the attacks -- criticized by some of his political
opponents as being timed to somehow interfere with a looming
impeachment vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced the decision I made to order this military
action, though difficult, was absolutely the right thing to do,''
Clinton said in remarks before a White House meeting with his
national security team to discuss the ongoing strikes Thursday
morning. ''It is in our interest and in the interest of people all
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With the House set to open debate on four articles of
impeachment against him on Friday, and a vote set for Saturday,
Clinton said the proceedings would have no impact on Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to complete this mission,'' Clinton said. ''And
the Republican leadership have to decide how to do their job.
That's not for me to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, however, took issue with fellow
Republicans who have accused Clinton of ordering military strikes
to divert attention from pending impeachment proceedings and
cautioned that ``there is no alternative'' to U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must carry the burden of leading the world,'' Gingrich said
perhaps in his final floor speech as speaker. ``It does not suspend
for elections. It does not suspend for Christmas. It does not
suspend under any circumstances. The U.S. has to lead. There is no
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. and British forces pressed the attacks, world reaction
to them was deeply divided. As a result, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said President Clinton began a series of calls to foreign
leaders Thursday morning following his briefing on the military
operation by Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein
and French President Jacques Chirac, who had joined U.N. Security
Council members China and Russia in calling for an end to the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Most NATO members generally backed the attacks, however, as did
U.S. Pacific allies Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the attacks,
warning that they could shatter regional stability. Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev canceled his scheduled appearance at a
NATO-Russia consultative session here Friday to protest the air
raids. And Thursday night, Russia pulled its ambassador here, Yuli
Vorontsov, for ``consultations,'' in protest. The gesture is
largely symbolic because Vorontsov has retired and was about to go
home anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, Iran, which fought a 10-year war against Iraq
in the 1980s, denounced the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied West Bank
territories and Gaza protested the strikes, burning American flags
that, in Gaza at least, were waved in support of Clinton only
Monday, when he journeyed there to lend the aura of American
legitimacy to the cause of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqi officials began alleging that the strikes were killing
civilians, Cohen reiterated that the mission had been planned to
reduce such casualties, though he did not rule out further such
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are targeting military or militarily-related targets,
period,'' said Cohen. ''We are not attacking the people of Iraq.''

L.A. COUNTY AMONG TOP 5 IN ANNUAL PAYROLL GAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if more evidence were needed that the local
economy has been booming, government statistics released Thursday
show that Los Angeles County ranked among the nation's top five
counties in the number of new businesses and annual payroll gains
between 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers released by the U.S. Census Bureau are 2 years
old, local business officials say the trend has continued in 1998
and will likely extend into the future as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that we were in a recession and emerging from an
earthquake, it shows the inherent strength of the Los Angeles
economy,'' said John Rooney, president of the Van Nuys-based Valley
Economic Development Center. ``I think it shows the beginning of
significant increases that you're going to see in this year and
probably the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the statistics, Los Angeles County gained 1,271
businesses, to 215,591 in 1996 from the prior year's 214,320 _ an
increase of 0.6 percent, placing it fourth among the nation's
counties in number of businesses added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Los Angeles County ranked third in annual payroll
gains. Payrolls increased by $4.6 billion, or 4.4 percent, to
$109.4 billion from $104.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The county with the loudest business boom was Maricopa County,
Ariz., which was among the top five in terms of business and
payroll gains and topped the list of counties in terms of employee
increases _ a list on which Los Angeles County didn't appear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the census statistics showed a 0.7 percent employment
decline in Los Angeles County, from about 3.494 million to 3.47
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just means that (businesses are) getting smaller and
smaller,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp. ``There's a message here _ the idea is
that larger firms are getting to be endangered species.''

EDITORIAL: A NEW STRATEGY TO RESTRAIN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The American and British air attacks against Iraq should be the
opening move in a new approach for dealing with Saddam Hussein.
Several opportunities may exist, notably through new diplomacy in
the Middle East. Taking advantage of them will require creative
thinking by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the familiar mechanisms employed over the last seven
years to restrain Iraq are unlikely to work when the bombing ends.
U.N. weapons inspectors will probably not return to Iraq any time
soon. A divided U.N. Security Council cannot provide firm
leadership on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should look to the Middle East for leverage against
Baghdad. Iran is one possibility. Larger and more populous than
Iraq, Iran can serve as a counterweight to Baghdad's ambitions.
Since Mohammad Khatami was elected Iran's president, Washington and
Tehran have moved cautiously to end two decades of estrangement.
Better relations between America and Iran would serve both
countries and intimidate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also needs to reinforce its relations with
Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt. That will require redoubled American
efforts to save the Israeli-Palestinian peace, now hostage to
probable Israeli elections next year. Israel's prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, has compounded Washington's problems with his
unjustified suspension of Israeli compliance with the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis, who have themselves begun to repair relations with
Iran, can provide the airfields America will need for long-term
military containment of Iraq. But Saudi rulers are wary of domestic
opposition to such basing arrangements and will be able to move
ahead only if there is further progress on Israeli-Palestinian
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt and Syria both took part in the American-led coalition
against Iraq in 1991 and last month joined the Saudis and the gulf
emirates in publicly blaming Iraq for forcing a military
confrontation with Washington. Both could again become important
American partners, reinforcing Arab diplomatic and economic
pressures on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt's case, partnership depends on advancing the Oslo peace
agreements. Cairo sees economic and political gains for the
Palestinians as crucial to its own security and prestige. Relations
with Syria, never easy, could be improved by encouraging a
resumption of peace talks between Israel and Syria over Lebanon and
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Iran have sponsored terrorism in the past, and harbor
their own ambitions to develop mass-destruction weapons. But a
collective effort to contain Iraq, linked to a firm break with
terror and guarantees on weapons programs, may be possible. America
is not the only nation interested in restraining Iraq. Saddam
Hussein's neighbors have even greater reason to fear his weapons.

CLOSELY FOUGHT TRIAL PREDICTED IN CASE OF MISSING MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The defense lawyer for the mother and son charged
with murdering an Upper East Side millionaire predicted an easy
acquittal Thursday, but legal experts said the trial would be
closely fought, focusing on what prosecutors say is a wealth of
details in an elaborate fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sachs, lawyer for Sante and Kenneth Kimes, said the case
against his clients was based entirely on circumstantial evidence
and irreparably flawed because the body of the millionaire, Irene
Silverman, has not been found since she disappeared on July 5. At a
news conference in front of the Manhattan Criminal Courts building,
he questioned whether Mrs. Silverman was dead, and suggested that
if she had been killed, someone else had done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of people who could have benefited from the
disappearance of Mrs. Silverman,'' he said. ``Where is proof that
the Kimeses had anything to do with Mrs. Silverman's disappearance?
Where is the proof of a murder?''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the proof will be in the details. The 84-count
indictment unveiled by prosecutors on Wednesday provides a
step-by-step description of an elaborate scheme to defraud Mrs.
Silverman, 82, out of her mansion on East 65th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial is going to be, certainly from the prosecution's
point of view, a mass of evidence pointing to the conniving these
people have done,'' said James Cohen, a Fordham University law
professor and defense lawyer. ``By including so many other crimes
in the indictment, it makes it easier for the prosecutor to put all
this circumstantial evidence in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful evidence in the case, legal experts
said, is a detailed account of activities that the Kimeses are said
to have kept in notebooks in a gym bag they stored at the Plaza
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The notebooks contain information and questions for lawyers
about the transfer of property in Manhattan, as well as
calculations on taxes that would be incurred in such a transfer,
the indictment says. They also contain notes about Mrs. Silverman's
bank accounts, her business manager, her accountant, her employees
and the employees' work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a list of instructions on management of the
house for a man the Kimeses hired, according to the indictment. The
notes could be used by prosecutors to explain how the alleged
conspiracy worked.
</P>
<P>
   And in what legal experts said could prove to be pivotal
evidence, Mrs. Kimes wrote down the aliases she used with different
people in phone calls carrying out the scheme, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Zeidman, a professor at the New York University School of
Law, said that if prosecutors could show that the defendants
committed dozens of acts progressing toward a murder, they might be
able to win a conviction without actually proving that the murder
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a circumstantial case is about is building reasonable
inferences and links,'' Zeidman said. ``Documents, reports and
record-keeping by the defendant is valuable evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes and other documents detailed in the indictment could
also prove to be damaging evidence of lesser crimes, like
conspiracy and forgery. Even if the Kimeses are acquitted of
murder, convictions for lesser crimes could result in decades-long
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a prominent defense lawyer, and other experts
predicted that proving that Mrs. Silverman was dead would be
difficult, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bereaved relatives and friends of Mrs. Silverman could testify,
for example, about long-running weekly meetings or phone calls that
abruptly ended after July 5. Close friends could testify about Mrs.
Silverman's attachment to her home. And prosecutors could argue
that Mrs. Silverman would never simply turn over her livelihood to
strangers. The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said
Wednesday that the Kimeses would have had to kill Mrs. Silverman to
get her mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But Brafman, as well as Zeidman and Cohen, said prosecutors
would have to compile a devastating case and present it masterfully
for a murder conviction. ``I don't for a second think this is going
to be a slam dunk for the prosecution,'' Brafman said. ``A lot is
going to depend on how the case is presented.''

STEPHENVILLE, LA MARQUE SET FOR THIRD TITLE-GAME CLASH OF '90s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ In 1993, it was the Clash at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, it was the Dual in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   So what should Stephenville-La Marque III, Saturday's 4 p.m.
Class 4A Division II state championship matchup, be remembered as?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Stadium Tussle?
</P>
<P>
   The Joust at Jerry's Place?
</P>
<P>
   No M s: Yellow Jackets-Cougars III?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the third championship game meeting between
Stephenville (14-1) and La Marque (13-0) is billed, the teams now
seem inexorably linked as two of the top 4A programs of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Between them are five state championships, impeccable
reputations on offense (Stephenville) and defense (La Marque),
towns draped in football tradition and a general fear factor both
bring to most opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about them?'' Stephenville coach Art Briles
said of the Cougars. ``Six times in a row in the state finals.
That's unheard of in any era. They're a tremendous program, and
it'll take all we have to have a chance to beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to Stephenville, 26-13, in the 1993 4A championship
in Austin and 32-17 in the 1994 title game in Houston, the Cougars
have been on a three-year steamroll. For Stephenville, the playoffs
ended in 1995 and '96 in the state quarterfinals and in last
season's second round.
</P>
<P>
   If a return to the final for Stephenville was imminent, La
Marque always seemed the most logical opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends who have been coaching a lot longer
than I have and just want to go to \Ra title game\S,'' La Marque
coach Larry Walker said. ``I've been in this business long enough
to know the cycle runs out and picks up. A case in point is
Stephenville. They bowed out and now they're back. We are going to
enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a La Marque assistant from 1990 to '96 who became the
head coach at Port Arthur Jefferson for one season in 1997 before
returning to lead the Cougars, said La Marque's program has been
``blessed for six years with good athletes.'' But he added that the
school's cycle will also run its course eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, La Marque is ``the'' 4A team of the Gulf
Coast and South Texas regions, as well as most of the rest of the
state. Stephenville, though, might feel otherwise if Saturday goes
as planned.
</P>
<P>
   A Stephenville victory would give the Yellow Jackets three
titles, tying La Marque for the most by a 4A team this decade.
Sealy's four consecutive titles in 3A are the most by any team in
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since Stephenville-La Marque II. The teams'
current players were in eighth grade or younger. Walker replaced
his former boss, Alan Weddell, who became a Texas A&AMP;M assistant.
Stephenville's offense looks more futuristic than it did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things Coach Briles is doing are innovative,'' Walker
said. ``They're mind-boggling and good for the game. The young man
throwing now \RKelan Luker\S is throwing just as good as Branndon
Stewart did.''
</P>
<P>
   Where both coaches are concerned, the past is the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids now can't really identify with what happened in '93
and '94,'' Walker said. ``They don't have a recollection.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not as players. Several current Yellow Jackets have
recalled a deafening Astrodome in 1994's convergence of both towns
for the championship rematch. As much as Stephenville-La Marque is
about the teams, their fans have built reputations of being rabid
and noisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these players and fans helped elevate our program back
into the upper echelon,'' Briles said. ``It's everybody working
together to have a chance to turn a dream into reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Denison's three championship losses to La Marque (1995, '96,
'97) bred a postseason rivalry between the teams. This year,
Smithson Valley broke a five-year string of semifinals matchups
between La Marque and Corpus Christi Calallen.
</P>
<P>
   If familiarity breeds contempt, a third Stephenville victory
against La Marque might push the Cougars into a realm to which
Denison and Calallen can relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was coming back to,'' Walker said of his return
to La Marque. ``I didn't treat it as a big challenge. I knew the
expectations were very high here, not just from the school, but the
community as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A third title would meet similar expectations in Stephenville.
Win or lose, the Yellow Jackets' offensive theatrics and
state-record 8,267 total yards this season won't be soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna do the best we can to bring a state championship
home,'' Briles said.

RUNNING BACK ROUNDS OUT STEPHENVILLE ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ Watching defenses chase after Zac Hunter
sometimes reminds one of those pig-chasing contests at rural family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Some of the pigs probably outweigh Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-8, 170 pounds, Hunter, a junior running back, is one
of the smallest Stephenville players on the football field. He's
also one of the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's 1,542 yards and 10 touchdowns rushing this season have
caused more nauseous moments for defensive coordinators than their
pregame meals. It's not simply that Hunter can shoot through the
narrowest holes or dart to the outside like a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   As if the state's top passing game wasn't difficult enough to
defend, Hunter's speed makes a dizzying attack even moreso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the linebacker's eyes to see what he's thinking,''
Hunter said of trying to read the defense. ``They're looking for
the pass, but they don't really know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter began outrunning everyone in about the seventh grade. He
improved his leg strength in the weight room and sprinter's speed
(4.4 seconds in 40 yards) in track season, where he runs the 100
meters and 200 meters and 400-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's natural,'' Hunter said. ``A lot of it had to do
with making my legs stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, Hunter said he ran mostly on instinct and
breakaway ability. This season, he was expected to block more and
learn the finer points of running routes as a fifth receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really, really quick,'' Stephenville coach Art Briles
said. ``The thing that makes Zac so good is he's so strong and
carries his pads well. His strength is what saves him from getting
beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also stays fresh in Stephenville's system, one with
numerous no-back sets. Backups Jimmy Ferrazas and Matt Tinklenberg
are bigger backs _ both close to 200 pounds _ who give Stephenville
different looks on short-yardage downs.
</P>
<P>
   Like 100-catch teammate Cody Cardwell, Hunter's open-field
ability is a dagger. He lines up about anywhere; shotgun back,
either slot, far or inside wideout, blocking receiver, fullback,
tailback _ anywhere he can trip up a defense. As a receiver, Hunter
has 16 catches for 183 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zac and Cody are a lot alike,'' Briles said. ``They're just
different types of players.''
</P>
<P>
   On counter and trap plays, Hunter can be easy to miss. Against
Wichita Falls Hirschi, he shot through a hole before anyone saw him
and went untouched for 81 yards to break open a 42-21 Stephenville
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also won a 9-yard footrace to the left pylon against a
pack of closing Hirschi defenders, none of whom were exactly slow.
He finished with 177 yards for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's at the peak of his game,'' Briles said. ``He's
improved on reading his blocks and has really complemented our
passing attack. He's a speed guy, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   With several offensive starters graduating, Briles said Hunter's
role could increase next season. His understanding of
Stephenville's system has improved weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what to expect next year,'' Hunter said.
``Last year, they said to just take the ball and run. This year
they've had me blocking and catching. It's a lot of work, but it's
been worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you're rarely caught, like those pigs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans raised the ghosts of Watergate
and Vietnam on Thursday to justify their decision to move ahead
with the impeachment debate on Friday in the face of Democratic
protests and continuing U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinarily bitter day that seemed to relive the
cultural wars of the 1960s and 1970s and a quarter-century of
grudges between the two political parties. Democrats vehemently
condemned the Republicans' plans, announced on Thursday, to return
to the impeachment of President Clinton without waiting for the
military action to conclude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way protecting the interests of the people
of the United States,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, said on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said that the House should consider how ``Saddam
Hussein will receive the idea and information that while he is
under physical attack from the United States and its people, we are
having a debate in our House of Representatives to remove the
commander in chief from his office.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Republicans eager to push forward with impeachment,
Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, whom Republicans have chosen as
the next House speaker, said, ``There's no way to know when the
troops will have completed their mission.'' He added, ``We cannot
anticipate what Saddam Hussein will do, and yet we cannot refrain
from advancing the people's business on this critical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first floor speech since he was chosen to be speaker,
Livingston looked back to the Watergate scandal. He said that
impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon began when ``troops,
American troops were deployed in the field in Vietnam and yet the
Democrat Congress at the time undertook the responsibility of
impeaching Richard Nixon.'' In fact, the last American combat
troops left Vietnam on March 29, 1973, and Democratic leaders first
asked the Judiciary Committee to look into impeachment nearly seven
months later, on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The battle on the House floor, amplified in a series of
competing news conferences across the day, set the stage for the
first House debate on impeaching a president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats now say that Clinton will be impeached, after a
stream of moderate Republicans came out against him in recent days.
On Thursday, Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., said that she too would
vote for impeachment. ``I was looking for an explanation, a
rebuttal of the facts, some justification to spare the country from
impeachment,'' she said. ``I could not find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., a Republican, said, ``Are all
Americans, including the president of the United States, equal
before the law? My answer to that question is yes and so I will be
voting for the articles of impeachment of President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats all but conceded that Clinton was now going to face a
Senate trial. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., said that he expected two of
the four articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary
Committee to pass and he thought that about six Democrats would
vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty bad,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who
has been one of the stalwarts in the Judiciary Committee against
impeachment. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the only thing she
could conceive of that could stop impeachment now ``is if Saddam
Hussein is taken out this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if they were resigned to Clinton's impeachment, the
Democrats fought the Republican plan to move ahead while air
strikes continue in Iraq. In fact, they were almost openly gloating
at the political opportunity the Republicans had handed them to
change the impeachment drama into a debate over whether the
Reopublicans were so eager to run Clinton from office that they
would undercut the military in a time of combat.
</P>
<P>
   So the Democrats rebuffed a proposal by Livingston for 16 to 18
hours of debate beginning Friday and ending in votes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look down on any activity of this body to go forward
with impeachment while American men and women are engaged in armed
conflict,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House
minority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said of Livingston, ''I think he's a fool to proceed in
spite of all this and to go ahead while we're still striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Under House rules, the impeachment articles are a ``privileged
resolution'' entitled to one hour of debate, unless both parties
agree to extend the time period and no one objects. Republican
leaders were still looking on Thursday night at parliamentary ways
to extend the debate hour by hour if the Democrats would not
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious that Clinton had timed the air strikes against Iraq
to stop the impeachment proceedings, Republicans on Thursday argued
that impeachment would not weaken Clinton any further and that men
and women in the armed services would not be affected. ``That
ladies and gentlemen is why our democracy is so wonderful,'' said
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. ``As we engage
in conflict, democracy does not stop in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed at being the ones accused of failing to show support for
the military, the Republicans also tried to relive party divisions
over past wars in the Persian Gulf and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, they showcased several of their members
who served in Vietnam to rebut the Democrats. ``When we were over
there the thing that demoralized us wasn't the fact that Congress
was doing its work,''said Rep. Joseph R. Pitts, of Pennsylvania,
who served in the Air Force from 1963 to 1969. ``The things that
disturbed us were the protesters like Jane Fonda and Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., who had a 22-year career in the
military, said, ``When I was in Vietnam and coming down in a
parachute, I didn't give a rat's rear what Congress did.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, who had questioned the president's timing as the air
strikes were announced, criticized Democrats for circulating
statements he had made dating to the Persian Gulf War in 1991,
supporting attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the vote in the House and the Senate on Desert
Storm, I don't believe there was a single Democrat that voted for
it,'' Lott said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott later said that he was wrong. In fact, 10
Democrats in the Senate and 86 in the House supported the Gulf War
resolution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the White House, the president answered questions from
reporters and said he did not think the impeachment proceedings on
the House floor would undercut his ability as commander in chief to
carry out the air strikes. ``I think that, first of all, I'm going
to complete this mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moved toward impeachment, several thousand
supporters of Clinton, rallied on the steps of the Capitol, waving
signs calling for censure or asking Congress to heed the popular
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people do not view Bill Clinton as a bad man,''
the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the crowd. ``They see him as they see
themselves _ as flawed, as less than perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the House floor, Livingston acknowledged that citizens
and interest groups were demonstrating and jamming the
congressional switchboard to register their opinion on impeachment.
``Let us disregard the outside influences,'' he said, calling for
members of Congress to vote their conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior replied that when Congress was dealing with ``two most
profound issues'' _ combat and impeachment _ ``the country has the
right to be involved in the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and a few Republicans have called for Clinton to
be censured instead of impeached for his efforts to conceal his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. But Livingston has said he will
refuse to allow a censure proposal on the House floor. While
Democrats were still looking for parliamentary procedures to allow
them to bring up censure, they had stopped believing that they
could use such a proposal to draw moderate Republicans away from
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members have argued that the Senate ultimately will
not have the stomach to go through with a full trial of the
president. Bob Dole, Clinton's 1996 presidential opponent, has
argued that the Senate should avoid a trial and instead pursue a
strong censure measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said Thursday that the Senate would proceed to a trial
if the House impeaches Clinton. ``There won't be any deal-making,''
he said.

IRAQ BOMBING ADDS TO POLITICAL RISKS OF GOP PARTISANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Ga., Ohio, La., Miss., Va.)  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-JOHNSON, IMPEACH-IRAQ-LOTT,

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The polls show Americans do not want President
Clinton impeached. And they show that the public is squarely behind
the president's bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republican leaders are not only questioning
Clinton's motives in attacking Iraq, but are rejecting pleas by
Democrats to put off the House debate on impeachment, even by one
more day.
</P>
<P>
   By pressing forward, even brazenly, against the president,
Republicans are inviting attacks that they are so impatient to
exile Clinton that they are rushing heedlessly forward to conduct a
public vote on an unseemly scandal while American troops are in
harm's way. Some Republicans worry that their party is increasingly
perceived as motivated by a ferocious partisanship and a desire to
cripple Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In their zealous pursuit of Bill Clinton are they doing
long-term damage to their political interests?
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats hope so and some Republicans fear they are right.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the Republican Party insist they must press
forward at any cost. Not only do they believe, fervently, that
Clinton should be impeached, they are determined to act quickly
before he somehow finds a way out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., said that when his party's caucus met
Wednesday night, members expressed fears that a delay would give
the president time to find a way out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who backed impeachment before anybody
heard of Monica Lewinsky, put it this way: ``The administration
will try to pull anything out of a hat. Whether it's a rabbit or a
red herring remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others are confident that by the next elections in 2000,
the events of this week will be long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they have grown so distrustful of Clinton that
they cannot help but question his motives. That is why many
Republicans say they were unapologetic about their accusations that
Clinton's order to bomb Iraq was an attempt to put off the
impeachment debate, which originally had been scheduled to begin
Thursday. It was rescheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster, said, ``Very few
Republicans are willing to give this president the benefit of the
doubt.'' Ayres said it was Clinton who appears suspect because the
attack on Iraq ``deepens the cynicism among people who already
think this guy will say anything or do anything to retain power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said of Clinton: ``He's manipulated
our military and his advisers for his own preservation. You'd have
to be basically retarded not to think there was some manipulating
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans argue that Clinton has lost such credibility
and is so mistrusted that most Americans would not blame any
Republican for questioning his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in the party warned privately that the party's
lawmakers should show more restraint because they risk being viewed
as obsessed with impeachment at any cost. The admission Thursday
night by Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the incoming House speaker,
that he ``on occasion strayed from my marriage'' could only further
weaken the Republicans' efforts to undermine Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Already, polls show that the Republican Party's image has
suffered in recent weeks; the long-term risk for the party would be
if it was unable to shed an image of naked partisanship before the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans questioned Clinton's motives in bombing
Iraq, many in the party said they were particularly stunned that
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, asserted on
Wednesday that ``both the timing and the policy are subject to
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have often denounced a president's military
operations, but they usually do not do so at the moment of attack.
More commonly, senior members of Congress in both parties rally
behind the president to display a united front and out of deference
to the fact that the administration has more access to confidential
information.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, at least, the comments by Lott _ and the
Republican push to open the impeachment debate _ gave Democrats
grist for trying to shift the discourse to the insensitivity of
Republicans while American troops are in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days ago, the White House was struggling in an uphill
battle to save Clinton from being impeached. While that threat
seems undiminished, Republicans were on the defensive Thursday.
They found themselves responding to attacks by Democrats that they
were so single-mindedly out to get the president that they dared to
question his motives _ and refused to postpone the impeachment vote
for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lott backed off from his statement on Wednesday night, and
insisted Thursday that he himself had not questioned the
president's motivations but that he was responding to the concerns
of others.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Herbert Bateman, of Virginia, reminded fellow Republicans
that they might regret the political fallout of rushed action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be perceived as doing things too precipitously
by going ahead as if none of this had happened,'' he said.

MARSHALS SEIZE PIANO, ROLLS ROYCE FROM MICHAEL JACKSON'S PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB AND LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The grand piano that Michael Jackson used to
compose songs from ``Thriller'' and a classic Rolls Royce were
seized Thursday from the superstar's parents' home on orders from a
bankruptcy judge.
</P>
<P>
   A locksmith and U.S. Marshals broke through a wrought-iron gate
in order to haul away property from Joseph and Katherine Jackson.
It was at least the second time since a $1.7 million judgment was
levied against them and all but the most famous member of the
Jackson 5.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson family attorneys said the seizure was improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things belong to Michael. He's written songs on this
piano, including from the `Thriller' album,'' said attorney Brian
Oxman. ``He owns everything in the house. ... Michael wants his
piano back, and we're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   HVV Corp. of New Jersey claims it sold part of Kramer Guitars to
the Jackson family and is owed $1.7 million. HVV declared
bankruptcy in 1996 and received a judgment against the Jacksons,
although the family attorney claims they never got a chance to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.7 million is owed by Joseph, Katherine, Jermaine, Tito,
Randy, Rebbie and Marlon Jackson, said attorney Steven Fernandez,
who is representing HVV. But he said it has been very difficult to
collect because family members have either declared bankruptcy or
kept their assets in someone else's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, a lot of these Jacksons have financial
problems and IRS problems,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire Michael Jackson, 40, is not one of the siblings
liable to HVV Corp. Oxman said that both seized items belong to
Michael Jackson and that he will get them back.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-room home on Hayvenhurst Avenue has been in the
superstar's name since 1993, Oxman said. But property records
indicate that both Michael and his sister La Toya jointly own the
home.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals took action after a Dec. 10 court order from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Kathleen March directing them to ``use whatever
reasonable force necessary to break open and enter the premises of
the Jackson family home.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshals had a locksmith break through a black towering gate
that hides the 10,476-square-foot home nestled south of Ventura
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   A woman inside the home allowed officers in the front door to
seize a grand piano and an inoperable white 1963 Rolls Royce Silver
Cloud, said Robert Sainburg, who also represents HVV.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and onlookers had the same question Thursday as they
watched marshals seize property from the estate: Can't the Gloved
One hand his parents a check?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think Michael would cut them some money,'' yelled out
one neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said she's grown accustomed to the commotion
over the Jackson's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen this happen before, so I figured it was happening
again,'' said Mary Giltner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't made any efforts to pay it. ... We had to
forcefully collect,'' Sainburg said as a towing company hauled away
the classic 4-door vehicle with large white-wall tires on a flat
bed at about 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But Oxman argued that the Jackson family had no idea about the
default judgment because when court papers were served at the home
in 1996, the family had moved out for two years for the home to
undergo earthquake repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They learned about the case in September, when marshals came to
seize another Rolls Royce at the home, he said. &UR; !end! &QL;

NEW TRACKS PUT BURDEN ON NASCAR SCHEDULE, PROMOTERS SEEKING
REVENUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Gossage admittedly is running out of
options to ``feed the monster'' that is Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of TMS,
has upgraded the track's schedule for 1999 with the additions of
the Pep Boys Indy Racing League season-finale and a second NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series night race in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in 1998, TMS will offer three major race
weekends to its ever-expanding base of season-ticket holders. That
figure, Gossage said, is approaching 50,000 fans. But a coveted
second NASCAR Winston Cup/Busch Grand National Series weekend
continues to elude Gossage and developer Bruton Smith, the chairman
and CEO of Speedway Motorsports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario confronting and confounding Gossage is not unique
in the industry. The superspeedway building binge of the 1990s has
seen new facilities rise and shine nationwide, their promoters
banking on landing at least one Winston Cup race as a can't-miss
cash-cow.
</P>
<P>
   Like any superspeedway, Smith's $110-million rendition of
Gargantua residing in north Fort Worth has a voracious appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge we have is to hold more and more events _ and
feed the monster,'' said Gossage, borrowing a phrase coined by H.A.
``Humpy'' Wheeler, the president of Smith's Charlotte Motor
Speedway and motorsports' premier promoter. ``I have zero feel for
when that second date is coming \Rto TMS\S. Brian France \RNASCAR's
senior vice president\S has promised me that there will be two
dates in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was something else out there that made economic sense
to do, we'd do it. But I don't see it on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's 1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway and Roger Penske's 2-mile
California Speedway played host to their first Cup dates in 1997.
Both high-profile owners will operate with a single Cup race for
the third consecutive year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex in Homestead, Fla.,
whose ownership group features NASCAR president Bill France Jr. and
Penske, will stage its first Cup race on Nov. 14, 1999. The
addition of Homestead's 1.5-mile oval will bump the Cup schedule to
34 points-paying dates.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway International Raceway, located five minutes from St.
Louis in Madison, Ill., underwent a $25 million renovation in 1996.
The 1.25-mile oval has played host to NASCAR Busch Grand National
races the past two years, perhaps paving the way for a Cup event in
the manner that saw Bob Bahre steer his 1.058-mile New Hampshire
International Speedway onto the Cup schedule in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   New racetracks are either under construction or in various
stages of planning near Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, Sacramento,
Calif., Baltimore and in Kentucky _ all with visions of hosting
``NASCAR-style'' oval racing. But even if every new facility is
successful in landing one Cup race _ a highly unlikely scenario
given the wall-to-wall, 10-month season booked by NASCAR for 1999 _
promoters will need alternative events to fill gaping vacancies on
their event calendars.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR star Jeff Burton said, sorry, the quest for a second Cup
race is not a major concern among his driving brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the interest of the majority of the fans is what
we've got to be concerned about,'' Burton said during a Goodyear
tire-test at TMS, the track where he scored his first Cup victory
in April 1997. ``I'm at Texas Motor Speedway saying this and I'll
say it about any racetrack _ if a racetrack can't succeed on racing
one Winston Cup race a year, then you'd better not build it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the value of adding races needs to be seriously
reconsidered. That could mean TMS might never receive a second Cup
date from NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we race too much now,'' Burton said. ``I don't think
California needs a second date. If we are going to grow this sport,
and we are going to make it a true nationwide sport, we cannot
devalue the quality of a race. To give a race to Texas and then to
give a race to \Rfor example\S St. Louis and the next racetrack
that's being built, don't we get more impact from going to a new
market in St. Louis than coming to Texas twice? That goes the same
for Darlington, Daytona and all the racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't the sport better-served by going more places? I think it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gossage has been charged with filling and
re-filling TMS' 150,061 seats _ and the 4,800 being added in front
of the still-under-construction Speedway Club _ with paying
fannies.
</P>
<P>
   The season's main event at TMS is booked for the last weekend in
March. The inaugural Winston Cup Primestar 500 _ successor to the
Interstate Batteries 500 and Texas 500 _ is scheduled for March 28.
It will be preceded by the Coca-Cola 300 Busch Grand National race,
featuring reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon in one of only five
series starts, on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage plans to aggressively promote the BGN race as a
one-on-one between Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., the reigning
series champion and its hottest property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't that surprise me?'' said Gordon, a veteran of
several SMI promotional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's True Value 500K night race _ the first series event
after the 83rd Indianapolis 500 _ is booked for June 12. It will be
preceded by the Pronto Auto Parts 400K Craftsman Truck night event
on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year's worth of lobbying _ and an impassioned, three-page
letter written by Gossage in September _ convinced the IRL's
management to move the season-closer from Las Vegas to TMS as the
Lone Star 500K on Oct. 17. The companion event will be a second
Craftsman Truck race, the Bluebonnet 300K, on the evening of Oct.
15. TMS landed the IRL finale, in part, based upon its record of
gonzo promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to keep feeding the speedway with events,''
Gossage said, ``and keep revenue coming in the door.''

LONE STAR PARK OFFERS $1 MILLION DAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ There are a million new reasons to come
to Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie next year.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials yesterday announced that seven stakes worth a
combined $1 million would be conducted at Lone Star Park on May 31,
making next year's Memorial Day the richest day in the history of
Texas thoroughbred racing.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the centerpiece of a $3.75 million thoroughbred
stakes schedule next year at Lone Star Park, where live racing
returns on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to make an impact,'' Corey Johnsen, vice
president and general manager of Lone Star Park, said of the new
Lone Star Million Day. ``We wanted to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Star Park Handicap, which has been increased in value
from $200,000 to $300,000, headlines the Lone Star Million Day.
Supporting stakes include the $250,000 USA Stakes; the $150,000
Prestonwood Distaff; the $100,000 Lone Star Turf Sprint; and the
$100,000 Wild Flower Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The races are scheduled to be televised on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Star Derby, scheduled April 18, has been boosted in
value to $300,000 from $250,000 and is scheduled to be broadcast
live on ESPN along with the $250,000 Texas Mile. The Texas Mile was
recently awarded Grade 3 status from the North American Graded
Stakes Committee, which meets annually to select the most important
stakes races.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a graded stakes is a major accomplishment,'' Johnsen
said of the honor, which is a first for the state. ``We're really
pleased that \Rthe committee\S recognized Lone Star Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notable events on the schedule include the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association All-Star Jockey Championship,
scheduled for June 25, and the $125,000 Mesquite Mile Breeders'
Cup, one of 16 stakes races on the schedule worth six figures.
Mid-South Championship Day, a series of stakes for horses bred in
Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas, has been dropped from the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Purses during the thoroughbred meeting at Lone Star Park would
average about $220,000 daily, track officials said.

TOE KEEPS SANDERS OFF FIELD AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The chances of Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders
finally returning to action for Sunday's crucial matchup with the
Philadelphia Eagles were reduced yesterday when he did not
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey refused to rule out Sanders playing
but said it's unlikely he would play if he is unable to practice
today.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has missed the past three games with a sprained left big
toe. He tried to practice Wednesday, but limped off a few minutes
into the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a setback,'' Gailey said. ``He's not out here. It's
something we hoped would happen. Looking at the facts, I'm more
pessimistic now. But listening to him, I'm optimistic because he
wants to get on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is better for receiver Michael Irvin (strained lower
back) and running back Emmitt Smith (sprained ankle), who each
missed practice on Wednesday. Smith returned to practice, while
Irvin did some conditioning drills. Both are expected to be ready
for the Eagles game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better,'' Irvin said. ``I'm moving around a lot
better. There's been some pain but that's to be expected.''
CORNERBACK SWITCH Gailey declined to say whether Kevin Mathis has
replaced Kevin Smith as the starter at left cornerback. However,
another indication of the expected change was evident on the
practice field yesterday when Smith worked at Sanders' right
cornerback spot and Mathis worked at left cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the lineup if Sanders is unable to start against
the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Of Smith working at right cornerback, Gailey coyly said: ``He's
best at that position right now.'' EYEING THE PLAYOFFS The Cowboys
could clinch a playoff spot before they take the field against the
Eagles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A loss by Tampa Bay (7-7) against the Washington Redskins on
Saturday guarantees a wild-card spot for the Cowboys, who can
finish no worse than 8-8. The Cowboys hold the tie-breaker edge
against an 8-8 Tampa Bay team.

REDONE ACURA TL RATES TLC  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 CORRECTING MODEL DESIGNATION OF ACURA SLX IN 3RD GRAF 
  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Welcome back, Acura. All is forgiven. Well, maybe not
all. Some of the boneheaded mistakes that have blurred Acura's
image are still just a little hard to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: taking the aggressive, sparkling Legend that first
came out in the late '80s and turning it into a dull-witted luxury
barge. Or ditching great names like Legend and Vigor in favor of
the nonsense letters RL and TL.
</P>
<P>
   Or taking a midstream, outsourced sport-utility vehicle like the
Isuzu Trooper and selling it as an upscale Acura SLX. Or letting
the sharp little Integra languish like an unloved runt of the
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Acura still manages to build excellent cars, noted
for comfort and reliability, just like its proletarian stablemate,
Honda. That's what keeps 'em coming to the showrooms and ensures
Acura's continued success.
</P>
<P>
   And for '99, there's the TL 3.2. This completely new version of
Acura's middle-size sedan brings back much of Acura's old spark,
with the kind of engine performance and responsiveness that we
should expect from an automaker that calls itself ``a premier
luxury/performance nameplate.''
</P>
<P>
   The big news for TL is that along with added power, refinement
and a new body and interior, there's an even bigger plus: a price
break. Not just a modest dip but a significant one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a TL would set you back $30,700 in full luxury trim,
and $33,000 for a TL with a video-enhanced Global Positioning
System for navigation. For '99, the decked-out TL costs $27,950
(not including dealer prep and other add-ons) and $2,000 more for
the GPS, the only option.
</P>
<P>
   That's good value, considering the high level of features that
come standard. And it undercuts the competition by a fair chunk.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a shortened Honda Accord chassis, the TL's body is
somewhat generic, looking very Honda-like and barely
distinguishable from the run of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is very nice, trimmed in leather, loaded with power
and comfort features and quite spacious, despite the compact
exterior dimensions. A real clinker is the wood-grain plastic trim.
C'mon, guys, this is the '90s. Toss that junk.
</P>
<P>
   The low dashboard is set far forward, in Honda's typical style,
adding to the feeling of roominess, while the back seats have
decent headroom and legroom.
</P>
<P>
   The TL is a bit soft sprung to be considered a sports sedan, but
it is a finely executed car that benefits greatly from Honda's
wonderful VTEC V-6 engine. The VTEC engine, named for Honda's
innovative valve system that adjusts according to engine speed, is
standard on all TLs.
</P>
<P>
   Engine power is smooth and seamless, with a discreet little
growl under acceleration that lets you know it's serious. The V-6
takes the sedan from standstill to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds.
It also turns in decent gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission is automatic, with the SportShift feature that
allows drivers to shift for themselves, which is OK, but still a
poor substitute for real stick shift. Honda and Acura continue to
offer manual transmissions only in their four-cylinder cars.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS is the only option on the TL, which otherwise arrives
slathered with a hedonistic array of power and convenience options,
and a superfine stereo. The closest competitor is the Lexus ES300,
with the TL well-priced in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS, which uses a video screen on the dashboard to map your
route and lets you watch yourself skitter across the map, works
with compact discs assigned to specific areas of the country, and
controlled by a satellite system. A pleasant female voice helps
guide the way, sounding alarmed if you miss a turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to use, though driving around familiar Phoenix terrain,
I almost always could think of a better route than the one picked
by the computer. We actually used it to find a place on the other
side of the Valley that we otherwise might have struggled to
locate. It worked great.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, though. The video screen is fun to watch, and,
therefore, very distracting to the driver. Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   I also question the basic value of these things, especially when
it boosts the price tag by two grand and requires a specific
compact disc for each area of the country. Besides, I know how to
refold a map.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the navigation system, the TL has the style and
driveability to become a pack leader in the midrange luxury cadre.
</P>
<P>
   Well-designed, well-engineered and well-finished, the TL escapes
one of the big raps against Honda and Acura, that their cars are
good but generic. The redone sedan is enjoyable to drive and
displays enough character to avoid being boring.
</P>
<P>
   And it marks a welcomed return to interesting cars for Acura.
OK, I didn't mention the high-performance, high-priced NSX sports
car, but that's a whole different trip, and well beyond the
reasonable expectations of most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I'm expecting the arrival of a revamped RL, which has been
given a personality implant, an Acura spokesman told me. Hopefully,
it will be as well-realized as its smaller sibling, TL. &QL;

OPPOSING TEAMS HAVE DISCOVERED IT'S FUN TO RUN AGAINST COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Charlie Williams and George Teague were sitting
at their lockers the other day when someone asked what they thought
about Bam Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' Williams said, ``I don't even want to talk about Bam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me neither, bro,'' Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in too many of his highlight films,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defensive backs have not been alone in a horror
show _ call it The Cowboys' Rundown Run Defense _ that has been
feature length. Part of the reason the Cowboys are mired in a
three-game losing streak is because the Cowboys have yielded 100 or
more yards rushing to each of their last three opponents when their
run defense has plummeted from fifth in the league to 13th.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown came to a boil last week as Morris, the Kansas City
Chiefs running back, rushed for 137 yards against the Cowboys.
After a look at the film, Cowboys coaches and players estimated
that there were 20 missed tackles, including three on Morris' final
17-yard run that let the Chiefs run out the clock on a 20-17 defeat
of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to get more physical,'' linebacker Randall
Godfrey said. ``Now, I can say that, but everybody knows how to
tackle. We've been playing this game a long time. I know I need to
wrap up better. I missed five tackles last week. You can't have
that many in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor execution when tackling has not been the only problem.
Injuries and the club's propensity for trailing at the end of games
have also conspired to send the Cowboys' run defense spiraling down
the NFL charts.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles will attempt to extend the Cowboys'
misery. Coach Chan Gailey contends that the Eagles are not the same
team that had 96 yards rushing in a 34-0 drubbing by the Cowboys on
Nov. 2. In the six games since, Philadelphia is averaging 130.2
yards rushing. Running back Duce Staley has been the power gear in
the Eagles' 14th-ranked rushing attack. He is eighth in the NFC
with 901 yards. He had a career-high 141 yards on 30 carries
against the Arizona Cardinals last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 goal is to stop the run,'' Gailey said. ``That's
something we've got to get back to. Our players realize we've got
to get back to stopping the running game, and it will be another
challenge this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' free fall against the run has occurred as
cornerback Deion Sanders has been on the inactive list. Sanders'
All-Pro talents in pass defense allowed strong safety Darren
Woodson to line up closer to the line of scrimmage as an extra run
defender in an eight-man front. With Sanders out, the Cowboys have
not been able to employ as many eight-man fronts, as Woodson has
often lined up away from the line of scrimmage in pass support.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Vikings, for example, Woodson spent the beginning of
the game lined up deep off the line of scrimmage to help in double
coverage on Randy Moss or Cris Carter. With the Cowboys' leading
tackler out of the fray, Vikings running back Robert Smith began
the game with carries of 15, 13, 6, and 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to stop teams with our front seven,'' Godfrey
said. ``We were bringing Woody down earlier in the year, and we had
success. We're getting away from that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-game losing streak has meant that the Cowboys often
have played from behind. To keep the lead, teams run the ball. No
one would call the New Orleans Saints' 113 yards rushing against
the Cowboys dominating. But they protected the lead by rushing 36
times. They held the ball for 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the same scenario from occurring Sunday, the Cowboys
must take the lead early and force the Eagles to pass. Philadelphia
has the 30th-ranked passing offense in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In situations where the Cowboys are trailing, they often try run
blitzing to create a big play. Too often, this strategy has led to
a big play for their opponent. The Cowboys have allowed nine runs
of 10 yards or longer during this three-game losing streak. When
the Vikings caught the Cowboys blitzing midway through the fourth
quarter on Thanksgiving Day, Leroy Hoard popped free for a 50-yard
touchdown run. Morris' longest runs, of 25 and 17 yards, also came
as the Cowboys blitzed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have worked this week on all their problems. They
talked about playing with power and holding their gaps. They talked
about making sure tackles and carrying out their assignments. And
most of all, they talked about playing with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking what has happened to us personally,'' Godfrey said.
``We've got to go out and play the way we are capable of playing.
If we do that, we'll be OK.''
</P>

STARS WINGING IT IN ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE JOE JINX DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars won't be able to rely on their bullet-proof alternate
sweaters tonight. They won't have the magic of Friday the 13th to
comfort them. And, truth be told, Sister Eileen Marie Hunter never
performed the exorcism that Stars winger Pat Verbeek jokingly asked
for at Joe Louis Arena the last time he was there.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Stars have to win on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're looking forward to it,'' winger Dan Keczmer said
of the challenge of winning once again on the home ice of the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars sauntered into Detroit on Nov. 13 _ Friday the 13th _
and made like the cinema's Jason. Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk
stabbed home a goal seven seconds into the game that night, and the
Stars rambled to a 5-1 victory, breaking a seven-game winless
streak in Detroit. Interestingly, the Stars were wearing their
``green star'' jerseys for the 13th time and ran their record in
those alternate sweaters to 11-0-2. They also were playing their
13th game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in their second and final trip to Detroit during the
regular season, the Stars are intent on proving the first victory
wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big steppingstone,'' center Mike Modano said. ``We know
that later on if there comes a time that we have to win in that
building, we want to know we can. We're going to have to sooner or
later in our journey to get to where we want to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey would end with the Stars clutching the Stanley Cup,
which has the Red Wings' fingerprints all over it. And although
neither team can win the Cup in December, a victory by the Stars
seemingly could help in the mental battle against the Red Wings.
The Stars are 2-0 against Detroit since being eliminated, four
games to two, by the Red Wings in the Western Conference finals _ a
series Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman called the toughest his team
has played in the past two seasons. A victory tonight will give the
Stars the season series with the Wings for only the second time in
the past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with the Stars' 2-17-2 record in their past 21
trips to Detroit and that Modano, Keczmer, Verbeek, Derian Hatcher
and Shawn Chambers all grew up in the Detroit area, and there still
is a need for the Stars to prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to have to play well in that building to
win,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``And I think every one of
our players has taken the 5-1 game and thrown it out the window; it
was an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not all players. Keczmer, a defenseman who has been
converted to a part-time left wing, got in a fight with Red Wings
captain and leading scorer Steve Yzerman that night after a Keczmer
hit caused the normally placid Yzerman to start throwing his fists.
While Keczmer has been a healthy scratch for the past five games,
he is expected to play against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan played a great game the last time and kind of got under
their skin. They were more worried about him than they were the
rest of us,'' Modano said. ``I think it's a distraction for the Red
Wings for Dan to be in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Stars on a six-game unbeaten streak (4-0-2) and the
Red Wings winners of their past six games at The Joe, there will be
some pressure. With the Stars (17-5-5) and Red Wings (17-10-1)
ranking second and third, respectively, in Western Conference
winning percentage, there will be pressure. And with the game
televised nationally on ESPN (locally on Fox Sports Southwest),
there will be pressure.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Verbeek could ask Sister Eileen, his high school
teacher who watches him play every time he's in Detroit, if she
might want to try that exorcism after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave the exorcisms to the priests,'' Sister Eileen has
said.
</P>
<P>
   So it looks like the Stars are going to have to do it the hard
way this time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tell me again about NFL quarterbacks. Tell
me why Kordell Stewart teared up on the bench, why Kerry Collins
said, ``bench me, coach,'' why Ryan Leaf turned out to be a punk.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, by the way, to that ready-for-stardom
quarterbacking group of Dilfer, Brunell, Bledsoe and McNair? The
next wave of great ones never hit the beach this season.
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody heard lately from Scott Mitchell, Elvis Grbac or Rob
Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Why, out of nowhere, did the 1998 season turn into an
Oldies-but-Goodies festival for quarterbacks? The Pro Bowl squads
announced this week had its fraudulent vote-getters, like Nate
Newton, but all the QBs were most deserving.
</P>

   Except please give me the August odds on a foursome of Vinny
Testaverde, Doug Flutie, Randall Cunningham and Chris Chandler
being Pro Bowlers. Somebody should make a movie and call it
``Revenge of the Retreads''.
</P>
<P>
   There's no Favre, no Aikman, no Marino going to the Pro Bowl.
They have been replaced, at least this season, by guys once
considered lightweights, failures or has-beens.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought _ did Babe Laufenberg retire too soon?
</P>
<P>
   Old dependables like John Elway and Steve Young continue to hum
along, but overall, a case can be made that the NFL has never seen
a season like 1998 when it comes to quarterback roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Entire franchises rise and fall on this one postition.
Quarterbacks are coach-makers or coach-killers. There is probably
not a better quarterback teacher than Norv Turner, but Turner's
head-coaching career in Washington has been quicksanded by his
inability to find the right, yes, quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches, however, caught lightning in a jar this season
with a Testaverde, a Flutie, a Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without doubt, it's been a very strange season for
quarterbacks,'' said Laufenberg, who also wanted to stress that his
retirement was perfectly timed. Babe, of course, has moved on from
career quarterback backup status in the NFL to Channel 11 sports
guy and Cowboys' radio network commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing worth noting,'' added Laufenberg, ``is if you
take the six quarterbacks in the Pro Bowl, we aren't talking about
just 30-something in age. This is more like 35-and-over. There is a
reason for that, and it's called the zone blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same theme Troy Aikman was talking about yesterday
at Valley Ranch. ``Quarterback is a position that demands
consistency,'' he said. ``The defensive strategy of today has
advanced so much, it takes away from that consistency. As a result,
a premium is being placed on those who have had some form of
exposure over a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   As surprising as the emergence of a Cunningham or a Flutie has
been, these guys did have a lot of football mileage. Even while
once being labeled NFL failures, they obviously learned well from
the tough times.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the retreads is mere reinforcement that
quarterbacking is not a young man's game, not at the moment. The
same Kordell Stewart who helped take the Steelers to the AFC
Championship game last January is the same Stewart who is a
confused, tear-stained wreck this season. And then there's Collins,
who two years ago was hailed as a star for guiding the Carolina
Panthers into the playoffs. Since then, it's been a long fall for
Collins, among others.
</P>
<P>
   No quarterback has ever had a rougher NFL introduction than
Aikman in '89, then again in '90. ``But I think it's tougher to
learn the position now than it was then,'' he said. ``The NFL went
through a period in the early nineties when the so-called West
Coast offense changed things. Because it was a quick release
system, defensive coordinators went to more coverage, thinking they
couldn't get to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things changed back due to the zone blitz _ guys coming at
you from areas you least expect _ and for the last few years, the
name of the game has been get the quarterback. They come after you
with bigger, faster people and with very smart schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors figure in, however. ``Some of these young
quarterbacks don't have, or didn't have, an appreciation for just
how tough the position is to play,'' said Aikman. ``They were
oversold on themselves and undersold on what they would be facing.
And then some who had success, they thought it would be easier the
next season. It never is easier. The defense you saw last season,
will change on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacking success is based on many factors, but mainly it
comes down to mental toughness, health and, most important, the
players you have around you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that how a young quarterback handles the tough times
will define how his career will eventually go,'' added Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, 1998 has given us a boatload of test cases.

RINGMASTER BREAKS NEW GROUND IN THE CIRCUS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ To appreciate the subtle tension underlying the
arrival of Johnathan Lee Iverson at Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Circus, it helps to know something of the insular little
world of the Circus Winter Quarters in this sun-bleached
vacationland by the bay.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that an exotic assembly of been-there-done-that
circus aristocrats gathered in early December to create a $12
million extravaganza, the 129th edition of the Greatest Show on
Earth. The performance-hardened group of aerialists, wire walkers,
acrobats and tiger trainers _ many of them from multigenerational
performing families _ are, like all elite circus people, grudging
in their approval of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had no circus pedigree. He grew up in New York, the son
of a postal worker and a firefighter, and had seen the Ringling
circus only a few times in his life. And now, at the age of 22, he
would become the youngest ringmaster in Ringling history.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for his in-house debut, Iverson stepped to the
ringmaster's platform, virtually unnoticed amid the hurly-burly of
the rehearsal arena. On cue, he sang for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   And cast members did what they rarely do: They stopped to listen
to the lyric tenor voice issuing from the 6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound
singing ringmaster. And when Iverson finished his opening number,
the performers did what they never do. They applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't matter what Johnathan had done up to then,''
said Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer and chief executive. ``The
voice was all.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iverson, whose voice was molded at the age of 11 in the
famously rigorous Boys Choir of Harlem, and then refined at the
Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing
Arts in New York, it was a gratifying moment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the youngest ringmaster in Ringling's
history, Iverson also happens to be its first black ringmaster. But
this fact was pretty much ignored by the 222-member cast and crew,
which is about as multinational, multicultural, multiethnic and
multiracial a work force as can be encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my race to be the focus of attention, but the
truth is that we are not a nation of the color-blind,'' Iverson
said during an afternoon rehearsal session in the Florida State
Fair Expo Hall and Arena. ``Race still matters, and I suppose it
raises the pressure about something that will be viewed as
historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Feld insists that making a great circus, not history, was the
only reason for selecting Iverson. ``We hired the most talented
performer, and skin color had absolutely nothing to do with it,''
Feld said. ``That said, I suppose his selection as ringmaster is a
symbolic moment for the Ringling circus. He is the ringmaster for
today.''
</P>
<P>
   According to officials of the circus, Iverson is the 31st person
to be designated ringmaster since the merger of the Barnum and
Ringling circuses in 1919. Historically, the ringmaster has been
not only the lord of the ring for ladies, gentlemen and children of
all ages, but also the focus of their attention during the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Iverson's task to announce each act and control the
pacing of the show. He will sing four songs. He must also become
adept at the impromptu segue, to cover animal and human glitches.
And it will be Iverson's urgent duty to reassure the crowd and send
in the clowns when there is a fall or an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ringmaster takes full command of the temple of the show,''
said Greg Parkinson, a circus historian who is the executive
director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. ``So for
Ringling, naming the first black ringmaster is very significant
socially and culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ringling ``was pretty much a segregated show when my
father bought the circus in 1967,'' said Feld, 50. His father,
Irvin, who died in 1984, made his considerable fortune as a
producer by touring black performers in the 1950s and '60s
including Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and Harry Belafonte. ``The first
thing my father did was to put a black act, the King Charles
Troupe, in both Ringling units.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the circus people had to deal with the idea that a Jewish
owner had taken over what was then an anti-Semitic organization,''
Feld said, ``and had to face the fact that this new owner was
bringing black performers into the show. We had people leave the
circus because blacks were traveling on the circus train.''
</P>
<P>
   After the public has its first chance to see the show in Tampa,
on Christmas Day, Iverson will preside over the Red Unit, one of
the two Ringling traveling circuses in the United States. The show
will migrate northward, landing on March 26 at Madison Square
Garden in New York, the traditional opening-night venue for Big
Bertha, as the performers call the Ringling show.
</P>
<P>
   If to many Iverson will be a living symbol in a shiny top hat
and spangled tail coat, he sees himself as ``one piece of the
puzzle,'' which includes 132 performers, 90 crew members and 217
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's mother, Sylvia, a secretary for 26 years in the Postal
Service's mail-processing plant in New York who raised Johnathan
alone, said she long expected to see her son on stage in something
as grand as this. ``He was on, from the earliest age,'' Ms. Iverson
said, adding that ``he'd say, `Mommy, I've got to perform.'''
</P>
<P>
   His training ground was the Boys Choir, which each year
auditions about 1,500 children who hope to be among the 100
accepted into the Choir Academy of Harlem, a public school. Iverson
was 11 when he passed the audition for the choir, which has long
served as an urban lifeboat for its young members, about 75 percent
of whom come from single-parent households headed by women, many
with incomes below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to La Guardia, and then won scholarships for voice
training at the Hartt School of Music in Connecticut, where he
received a Bachelor of Music degree in May.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a ringmaster was far from his career objective. But
during the summer he landed a role in ``The Fireside Christmas
Show,'' directed by Phil McKinley at a dinner theater in Fort
Atkinson, Wis. McKinley happened to be the director of the 128th
Ringling show and told Iverson about the ringmaster audition.
Thirty performers threw their hats into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question when we saw Johnathan that he was the
one,'' Feld said. ``It was his presence and his phenomenal voice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's youth, his size and his voice training should serve
him well, other ringmasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally and physically, ``the ringmaster role is very difficult,
because for two and a half hours you never leave the floor,'' said
Jim Ragona, a k a the Voice, who for 13 years has been the
ringmaster of Ringling's Blue Unit, the circus's other touring
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my first six months in the job,'' he said, ``it was so
physically draining that after the performance I'd go home and fall
in bed fully clothed, and sleep until it was time to do the show
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Iverson relishes his work. ``They spoil the ringmaster;
I won't lie,'' he said, explaining that Ringling's costume director
has made three magnificent ringmaster suits for him, and has custom
made all his ringmaster boots. ``It's like I'm in the NBA,'' he
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the clothes don't make the ringmaster,'' Ragona said. His
advice to Iverson would be to avoid ``performing an imitation of
some ringmaster character that isn't him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His task,'' Ragona said, ``is to find the ringmaster named
Johnathan.''

COMMENTARY: PROTESTING CRITICS' ZEAL ON CLINTON

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To find out how the Holocaust and Bill Clinton's sex
life could wind up in the same thought, you will have to climb into
the mind of Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. This man who would bring down the president actually
made the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been to Auschwitz?'' Hyde asked during committee
hearings on impeachment. ``Do you see what happens when the rule of
law doesn't prevail?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't leap from the Oval Office on a Saturday afternoon
to Auschwitz,'' he said, ``but there are similarities when the rule
of law doesn't obtain, or where you have one law for the powerful
and one for the nonaristocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   So astonishing was this statement that it begged reaction from a
New Yorker who certainly has been to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death
camp and seen evil from the belly of the Nazi beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, how dare he!'' said Elie Wiesel, Auschwitz survivor,
Holocaust chronicler and 1986 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
``What a comparison! Do you use the Holocaust to describe this
affair?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside obvious doubts about the moral equivalence between
Clinton's grand-jury performance and the state-sponsored crime of
the century, the chairman turned completely upside down the reality
about Nazi Germany and the rule of law. ``It was the law to put
Jews in concentration camps, to kill them,'' Wiesel said.
</P>
<P>
   To him and perhaps also to the large majority of New Yorkers
shown by polls to oppose impeachment, the tortured Auschwitz
analogy was a graphic and dismaying example of the chronic
overreaching by Clinton's pursuers. Hyde &AMP; Company keep attaching
to their campaign a lofty moral purpose that others fail to detect.
``It is,'' Wiesel said, ``so banal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether with disgust, rage, sadness or disbelief,
anti-impeachment New Yorkers have begun speaking out loud and clear
on what to them is a crusade, with rightist zealots at its core, to
ignore the popular will and undo the results of the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   They flocked to protest rallies this week at the New York
University Law School and at the New School. Maybe they were too
late to save Clinton from a Senate trial. But they were in time to
add their voices to the many New Yorkers outraged by what they see
as an attempt to steal their vote, which they had cast for Clinton
in full knowledge, if not approval, of his sometimes cavalier
approach to truth and to ways of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost tempting to leave the last word to, of all people,
Jerry Seinfeld, who was not among the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Clinton crusaders insist over and over that this is all
about lies under oath, not sex. But it still boils down to lying
about sex. ``Everybody lies about sex,'' Seinfeld has observed.
``People lie during sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd be no
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the matter is too grave to end with a joke. There is
dead seriousness about White House mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to think of an American president in my
lifetime who didn't lie to the American people,'' E.L. Doctorow
said at NYU. When Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon told
lies, Doctorow said, many tens of thousands died in Vietnam and
Cambodia. ``Perhaps the problem with President Clinton's lie,'' he
added, ``is that it lacked grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   You could even go deep into antiquity, said Paul Moore Jr., the
retired Episcopal bishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read your Bible,'' he admonished anti-Clinton moralizers. King
David not only committed adultery with Bathsheba but he also sent
her husband to be killed in battle. Yet David remains ``one of the
greatest kings of Israel,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seemed necessary to mention that Clinton's fiercest
accusers in Congress and the news media include confessed or known
adulterers. But NYU protesters made the point anyway during remarks
by Elizabeth Holtzman, the former congresswoman and Watergate
impeachment veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake,'' Ms. Holtzman said, ``is the right of the
American people, by majority vote, to elect a president of the
United States and not have it undone by moralizing, sanctimonious
_.'' Then she paused.
</P>
<P>
   Voices from the audience filled in the blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypocrites,'' they said.

STUDY RATES CALIFORNIA ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As the nation's economic engine slows,
California's economy will cool down as well in 1999, but not enough
to trigger a recession, according to a study by an economic
forecasting group.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA Anderson Forecast, a widely followed economic report,
predicts that the continued impact from the Asian economic crisis,
a slowdown in Silicon Valley, moderate cooling off in the
entertainment sector, aerospace layoffs and other factors will
conspire to slow California's growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's economy should pick up again in 2000 and 2001,
as Asia recovers and other problems abate, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is really reaching a peak about now,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. ``There
are more negatives in the outlook than there have been for a while
. . . but this downturn should be relatively mild and not
particularly long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2000, we should see resumption of stronger growth in
California and nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy already has seen a shift: Southern California is now
outpacing Northern California in economic growth, a trend that
should continue, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley has been growing sluggishly, a victim of the
Asian crisis, an overheated housing market and a scarcity of
commercial space. The UCLA study predicted the labor market in the
San Jose-Santa Clara area will not resume its growth until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the study indicated corporate earnings growth will
be worrisome next year and that stock market volatility will weaken
investments and purchasing patterns, leading to a gross domestic
product slowdown from 3.7 percent in 1998 to 1.8 percent by
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the slowing economy should lead the Federal Reserve Board to
cut interest rates by 0.5 percent to keep the economy rolling, the
study showed. The economy should end 1999 up 2.5 percent, rising
2.8 percent in 2000 and 2.7 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The national unemployment rate should rise a little, from 4.4
percent at present to 5.1 percent by mid-1999 before dropping to 5
percent by early 2001, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, nonfarm job growth is expected to slow from 3.2
percent in 1998 to 2.4 percent next year and pick up again to 2.6
percent in 2000 and 2001, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Slower job growth will keep the unemployment rate close to its
current level of 6 percent, the UCLA study said. Real personal
income, which is adjusted for inflation, should moderate from a 5.4
percent pace this year to 3.1 percent in 1999 and 3 percent in
2000. Taxable sales, minus inflation, should drop from 4.2 percent
in 1998 to 3.9 percent and 2.8 percent for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace industry will be weaker as well, the study
predicted, with employment dropping 3 percent next year and 0.9
percent in 2000, mainly due to the Boeing layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth in the motion-picture and television industries was
flat this year due to layoffs, the Asian crisis and loss of
production business to Canada. But it's still a strong industry
overall, according to the study, which forecast a gain of 17,000
jobs in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Business services jobs, which include information technology
positions, should grow by 6.5 percent this year, the smallest
expansion in the last five years, the study showed. However, even
with the cool-down, job growth in this area still should expand at
almost three times the rate for the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services jobs won't continue their double-digit growth
of the recent past, as mergers and layoffs continue, the study
predicted. Wholesale trade employment, which had been fueled by
booming international trade, should average a 2.4 percent gain
yearly in the next three years, down from 3 percent during 1993 to
1998. But retail job growth should rise a respectable 2 percent to
2.5 percent a year until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot is the real estate market, according to the
study, which indicated historically low mortgage rates should give
rise to robust sales and job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Residential building permits should rise from 125,000 units in
1998 to 150,000 next year and 182,000 in 2000, the study showed.
While home building should be strong, it still is not keeping up
with population growth.
</P>
<P>
   As such, home prices will stay up, the study predicted, with
construction jobs increasing by 61,000 in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   But even with an overall slowdown, the state's economy will grow
faster than the nation's, concurred the UCLA study and a report on
California's fiscal outlook prepared by the state Legislative
Analyst's Office in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the nation as a whole is losing manufacturing
jobs much faster than the state. It's also because California began
its economic recovery later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect California to do better than the rest of the
country,'' said Brad Williams, chief economist for the state
Legislative Analyst's Office.

MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF POLICE OFFICER 21 YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 21 years, police have kept open the murder case
of Officer Ronald Stapleton, who was ambushed by two men outside a
Brooklyn disco, stabbed in the eye and shot twice in the stomach
with his own revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, police officially closed the case with the
announcement that a Jackson Township, N.J., truck driver had been
arrested Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, Manny Gonzalez, 40, was picked up by New
Jersey State Police as he left his home for work shortly after 5:30
a.m. Gonzalez has been charged with three counts of second-degree
murder and would face up to life in prison if convicted, said
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is being held without bail, pleaded not guilty to
the charges during his arraignment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between making an arrest and making a
case that can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' said his
lawyer, Jeffrey Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   A second suspect in the killing died of AIDS in January 1997,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that Gonzalez and his accomplice were lying in wait
for someone to rob when they saw Stapleton _ who was off duty _
leave the Tradewinds Bar and Grill in the Sheepshead Bay section of
Brooklyn shortly before 4:30 a.m. on Dec. 18, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the men approached, Stapleton identified himself and
drew his off-duty revolver. The other man jumped him from behind
and stabbed him in the right eye with a longshoreman's hook,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   With Stapleton on the ground, Gonzalez picked up the officer's
.38-caliber handgun and shot him twice in the stomach, after which
both men fled, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer died on January 3, 1978. He left a wife and two
children.

<P>
   Reached by telephone Wednesday, Stapleton's 30-year-old son,
Ronald, said that the shooting had devastated his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 9 years old and I watched my father go off to work and
never come back,'' he said. ``It affected my life more than I can
put into words. This man took away my opportunity to know my father
and left my mother in a very hard place. That was pretty hard to
handle, and it made me grow up pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation remained dormant for years until the police
received a tip in mid-1997, said a law enforcement official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official said the
informer pointed to Gonzalez, who has a history of convictions for
grand larceny auto, burglary, weapons possession and criminal
impersonation dating from 1976. But he said there was not enough
evidence for an arrest until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you kill a New York City police officer, it doesn't matter
how long it takes and doesn't matter where you go. We will find
you, track you down, and you will be punished,'' Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said Thursday.

EDITORIAL: FUNDS FOR SMALLER CLASSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Board of Regents has proposed spending $394
million in additional state aid next year to help students
primarily in impoverished and rural school districts reach the
state's more rigorous learning standards.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants $491 million more for operating and building aid
to schools throughout the state. The plan is sound. But the Regents
are misguided in recommending that $75 million of the increased aid
come from money that would otherwise be used for reducing class
sizes in kindergarten through third grade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Legislature approved spending $225 million over
three years to cut class sizes, beginning in 1999. This fall
Congress also approved legislation that will provide New York state
$104.5 million in the coming year to hire more teachers, an
essential ingredient for smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law that would pay for 30,000 new teachers across
the country says the money can be used only to supplement state and
local class-size reduction efforts, not to supplant them. The
regents' proposal to redirect the $75 million to other important
uses such as tutoring and after-school sessions could run afoul of
that prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   The state's goal is to reduce the class sizes in kindergarten
through third grade to no more than 20 students, a sharp drop from
the current average of 27 in New York City. Even using both federal
and state money, city classrooms are not expected to meet the goal
fully until 2007. New York children should not have to languish in
large classes when more funding can solve the problem sooner.

EDITORIAL: CLONING A HUMAN CELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that South Korean scientists have cloned a cell
from a woman to make an embryo that is genetically identical to her
has yet to be verified. Few details have been made public, and no
scientific paper has been reviewed by experts. But the announcement
ought to provoke a gasp at how rapidly cloning has been surging
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Only some 20 months ago, the world was astonished when
scientists in Scotland reported cloning a cell of an adult sheep to
produce a lamb, showing for the first time that it is possible to
make a genetically identical younger twin of an adult mammal. That
achievement took substantial effort to confirm. But in recent
months, advances in cloning have tumbled forth rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Hawaii reported in July that they had created
dozens of clones of adult mice, and scientists in Japan reported
this month that they had cloned cow cells to produce eight calves.
Whether or not the Koreans have cloned a human, there seems little
doubt that it could be done.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean researchers moved cautiously through some ethical
minefields. Their experiment was terminated after the embryo had
divided into four cells. That is too soon, some experts say, to
determine whether development of the embryo was really being driven
by genetic material from the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the Koreans made it unmistakably clear they had no intent of
implanting the embryo into a woman's uterus so that it could
develop into a child. They thus avoided the step that troubles many
ethicists and citizens, who fear cloning will inevitably undermine
human individuality.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has only begun to debate the ethical pros and
cons of cloning humans, secure until now in the belief that there
is time for such ruminations. The lesson from recent studies is
that time is fast running out.

BAYLOR EXPECTED TO HIRE CAROLINA ASSISTANT AS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Carolina Panthers assistant Kevin Steele is
expected to be introduced today as the new football coach at
Baylor, ending a lengthy search process that began when Dave
Roberts was reassigned on Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baylor officials would not confirm the decision
yesterday, Steele informed the Panthers organization and players
that he was leaving to take the Bears job. A news conference is
scheduled for 11 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do a great job at Baylor and I'm happy for him,''
Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein said. ``The players will
respect him and play hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jeff Brady said he was upset that Carolina is losing
Steele, who has coached the linebackers for the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality coach, and there aren't enough of those
around,'' Brady said. ``Losing him will hurt, and I'm very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, 40, a former Tennessee linebacker (1976-79), has had a
lengthy career as an assistant _ with stints at New Mexico State,
Oklahoma State and Nebraska (1989-94), in addition to Carolina.
This is his first head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had an eventful week. On Sunday, the day before he
interviewed at Baylor, he was attacked on the sideline by Carolina
linebacker Kevin Greene, who drew a one-game suspension and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he was described by a source close to the team as
``a good man and a really outstanding people person; the players
really liked him a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also has a great personality, and the alums will love him;
from what I've heard of that situation down there, they're in for a
welcome and dramatic change.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's emergence as the choice for the job came after former
Alabama coach Gene Stallings _ considered the leading candidate for
more than a week _ withdrew his name from consideration late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad for him that he was able to get some sense of
resolve in his mind and glad that we had taken his advice that we
go on with the search,'' said Baylor President Robert Sloan. ``It
was a really good experience, not only to interview a man like him,
but he gave us a lot of good advice. He was a good consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates included Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower,
Arkansas defensive coordinator Keith Burns and Highland Park High
School coach Scott Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making a strong impression in his interview,
Steele was strongly recommended by Dal Shealy, executive director
of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy is also a former Grant Teaff assistant at Baylor with
close ties to Smith _ reopening speculation that the Highland Park
coach may yet land a job with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   After going through consecutive 2-9 seasons under Roberts,
Baylor players seemed pleased with the choice _ and impressed with
Steele's NFL experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to put coach Roberts down, but to have a coach here that
everyone wants to play for, would be a big change,'' safety Rodney
Smith said. ``This team has really been down, and now we'll have a
coach that everyone respects. The fact that he has NFL experience
is really important, because that's what we all want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ben Gay] said he felt ``blessed to have a coach
come in with some NFL experience. We needed somebody with some
toughness, and this is going to be good for us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They talked about the ornate ceilings (the work of a
second-rate architect from the 1920s, declared one woman with a
champagne glass in her hand, but a landmark even so).
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the caviar being served. And served. And
served.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the people at a party for Daniel, DANIEL BOULUD'S
newly resuscitated restaurant, were not talking about the twin
``I'' words, Iraq and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Boulud's party on Wednesday evening began an hour after the
first flashes of exploding missiles were seen in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bombed Baghdad?'' Boulud said a couple of hours later, when
he was asked whether the president had stolen the party's thunder.
``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   True, a few people in the crowd had been following the events in
the Persian Gulf and Washington. ``I've been at CBS all day,
talking about nothing else but,'' said CARL BERNSTEIN, who with Bob
Woodward in The Washington Post unraveled the Nixon
administration's abuses of power in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was chatting with the writer GITA MEHTA and her husband,
SONNY MEHTA, the president and editor in chief of Alfred A. Knopf.
``It is frightening when that sort of firepower is unleashed and it
doesn't disturb anybody's drink orders,'' Mrs. Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd seemed more interested in the transformation of
the first-floor space that once housed Le Cirque, in the old
Mayfair Hotel at 65th Street and Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel is larger than Le Cirque was. Daniel's tables will be set
in what was the Mayfair's lobby, where there was talk about the new
wall-to-wall carpet _ all 950 yards' worth, which might not sound
like a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does when they're all handmade,'' said STEPHANIE ODEGARD,
who designed them. ``One hundred hand-tied knots per square inch.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman with the champagne glass, who was standing a few
square yards away, said, ``This is a wall-to-wall ego trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick Contract
</P>
<P>
   DAVID STERN, the commissioner of the National Basketball
Association, has been doing some negotiating. But not with the
players union.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only 30 minutes on Wednesday to wrap up a deal for the
vacant land next to his home in Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Stern agreed to pay the Village of Scarsdale $78,000 for a
26,000-square-foot parcel next to land he already owns. Stern plans
to use the vacant land as a buffer, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a beautiful slice that's got old trees and the
like,'' Stern said. ``We offered to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-party Party
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ KEITH RICHARDS, who has written and performed rock
anthems for several generations as the lead guitarist of the
Rolling Stones, still leads a spur-of-the-moment life. He does not
bother with restaurant reservations when he and 12 friends go out
to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   They showed up one night last week at Nirvana, a restaurant on
Central Park South, for a head start on the celebration of his 55th
birthday, which is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them the same table John Lennon used to sit at,'' said
Nirvana's owner, SHAMSHER WADUD, who was celebrating his own
birthday that night and soon referred to Richards by his first
name, as in ``I'm delighted Keith is a Sagittarius, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The group ordered something called the Badshahi Feast, which
consists of 35 dishes. As if that were not enough, they also
ordered the Nawabi Feast (27 dishes) and three bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was $1,200, including a $216 tip.
</P>
<P>
   Wadud did not hurry things along. The restaurant stayed open
until 1 a.m., an hour past closing time.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker-elect Bob Livingston said at a meeting of
his fellow Republicans Thursday night that he had carried on
adulterous affairs in his past, but he stopped just short of
offering to resign his House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fate is in your hands,'' he said, according to members who
said the party conference rallied to his defense, giving him a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning admission was made just hours after Livingston led
Republicans in a decision to press ahead on Friday morning with the
impeachment charges against the president for perjury and other
alleged wrongdoing in covering up his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are
individuals working together with the media who are investigating
my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may
be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming
historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement
after appearing before a shocked House Republican conference to
head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the president's fate would go forward,
Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions between the
speaker-elect's revelations and the scandal that has put Clinton on
the brink of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered no immediate comment. Republicans were braced,
however, to hear Democrats allude to Livingston's admissions when
the debate begins on Friday. All along, most Democrats have decried
the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and
unfair rummaging through his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's reluctant admission underlined growing anxieties
haunting the impeachment showdown, with members of Congress far
from certain that the private lives of additional lawmakers will
not become subject to disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who are investigating me or others of my colleagues,
please understand that I will not be intimidated by these
efforts.'' Livingston declared. ``These efforts will not deter me
from performing my sworn duty under the Constitution as a member of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had
received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several times
told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that ``I was
running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There was a
reason for those words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on
occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my
marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his brief prepared
statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations
against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure everyone that
these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have
never been asked to testify under oath about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities,
disclosed in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt
of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous
debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in office and
whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the
impeachment charges against the president, was revealed to have had
an extramarital affair in his past. And Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., a
frequent critic of Clinton, acknowledged that he had a child out of
wedlock years ago and said he was compelled to disclose this
because Vanity Fair magazine was investigating his background.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic
defenders of the president instigated media investigations in an
effort to embarrass the Clinton's principal accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But no proof was offered as Republicans left their conference,
facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised to be
bare-knuckled in its partisanship. In a subsequent television
report, Cokie Roberts said on ABC World News Tonight that ``someone
close to the White House did tell me a rumor along those lines a
couple of weeks ago.'' But she offered no further details, adding,
``I was shocked to have that person spreading that rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman categorically denied that administration
officials were using the media for retaliatory rumor mongering.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston left the conference surrounded by Capitol police, not
taking questions from reporters. His chief leadership aides
immediately rallied in support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional
question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly
investigation of private lives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the
Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not
reveal its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex
magazine. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year
advertised an offer of a $1 million bounty for the disclosure of
members of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Allan MacDowell, executive editor of Hustler, confirmed the
magazine was working on the article but said that ``no information
came from the White House'' and added that one source was ``someone
involved in Republican politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the magazine was working on articles about other
lawmakers to expose ``Republican hypocrisy.'' Speaking of
Livingston, MacDowell said, ``He is not the only one with a gun to
his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Republicans expressed sympathy for the
speaker-elect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart because we're all subject to human
frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as he left the
conference. ``This is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone,''
he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented
two separate issues. ``We've got a duty to do under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans seemed even more dedicated to the impeachment
effort. Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., said the indiscretions were
``extraordinarily different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One is between Speaker Livingston and his wife,'' Frank said.
``The other involves felonies committed by the president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who was informed of the news
on the CNN show, ``Crossfire,'' said, ``It makes for a horribly
confused jury setting'' in the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   While Livingston acknowledged his infidelities, he said he would
offer no details in order to spare innocent parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chapter was a small but painful part of the past in an
otherwise wonderful marriage,'' he said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
For all the successes of Dave Williams' University of Houston golf
teams and the men who played on them, Williams will leave an even
greater legacy for the school he loved so much and for which he
worked so diligently.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Williams, whose 16 NCAA golf titles at UH are more than any
coach of a team sport in major-college athletics, died Thursday
morning in Wharton after a lengthy illness. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won in the beginning, in the middle and at the end,'' said
Steve Elkington, one of Williams' squadron of PGA Tour products.
``Most of the great coaches go out on a low note. Not Dave. He
brought the goods at the start, in the middle and at the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who came halfway around the world from Australia to
play for the only American collegiate coach who recruited him,
added, ``You always came away from coach with a stronger belief in
yourself. He was a strength-builder. He had a way of making you
believe in yourself, that you could do on or off the golf course
whatever you set your mind to.''
</P>
<P>
   Long after his retirement in 1987, no NCAA coach of a Division I
team sport has matched Williams' 16 golf championships, recorded in
four decades, during his 36 years as the Cougars' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the numbers _ and they include eight NCAA
individual championships won by seven golfers, 14 conference
championships, 340 tournament wins and 41 players who won 66
All-America honors _ Williams will be remembered best by colleagues
and former players for the energy he brought to the task.
</P>
<P>
   And for his most enduring greeting and most familiar farewell,
``You're the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams arrived at UH in 1946, one week after his discharge
from the U.S. Navy, to join the school's engineering faculty.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Guy V. Lewis, fresh out of the Army Air Corps,
came to play basketball. ``He hadn't been here but a week,'' Lewis
recalled recently during their induction into the UH Hall of Honor,
``and Dave came up and introduced himself like he had been around
here for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Dave, and his enthusiasm for the school and for the
Cougars.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nantz, a former UH golfer and now lead sportscaster for CBS,
referred to the innate ability Williams possessed that was his
greatest strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved him like a second father,'' said Nantz, ``and not a
day goes by that I didn't think of coach Dave. None of us ever saw
him hit a golf shot, but he had that ability to find your strength
and make you believe in yourself. His greatest attribute was his
energy to make people excel and become better than perhaps even
they thought they could become.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Jimbo, one of these days you're going to be
president of the United States.' The point is, he made me think I
could do anything I wanted, and he gave me and all his players that
inner confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who came to be called ``The Father of College Golf''
because of the changes he instituted in the college game, coached
NCAA champions in the 1950s, '60s, '70s and '80s after he was urged
by athletic director Harry Fouke in 1952 to take over the duties
Fouke was then handling.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 34, began using stroke play _ instead of the
match-play format then common _ in the All-America Intercollegiate
Invitational in 1955. That method eventually became standard in
college golf.
</P>
<P>
   What did not become standard was the way Williams could recruit,
in those days of no scholarship limits, from around the nation and,
in the case of Elkington and others, from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He convinced my mother that even though I was going thousands
of miles away, that I would be looked after, because that's the
kind of person he was,'' said Elkington, who won the 1995 PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   John Mahaffey, the 1970 NCAA titlist at UH and the 1978 PGA
champion, said: ``Playing in the number of tournaments and team
qualifying that he put us in came from his own competitive nature.
He wanted to win every time, and he also wanted to make sure he was
picking the right guys. He's a legend, like John Wooden (whose UCLA
basketball teams won 10 NCAA titles in 12 years).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have been part of a dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1918 in Randolph, Williams was a 1939 graduate of East
Texas State College.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his retirement, the Golf Coaches Association of
America began honoring the NCAA men's coach of the year with the
Dave Williams Award.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Fergus, a three-time first-team All-America pick (1974-76)
and later Williams' successor as UH coach, topped the list of his
former coach's talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, he had a passion for UH and UH golf,'' Fergus said.
``He loved that university. He always told you that you were No. 1,
and sooner or later you started to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all of his former players, Fergus described
Williams' own golf talent: ``I never saw him swing a club. He used
to say that he would beat his own players and that he didn't want
to discourage us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington made the point that, ``I'd get sick and tired of
people who said Dave couldn't have been a great coach because he
wasn't a great player. When's the last time you saw Joe Paterno or
Bobby Bowden throw a pass? He was the best golf coach who ever
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is survived by his wife, Virginia, son Joel, daughter
Peggy and four grandchildren. Services are scheduled for 2 p.m.
Sunday at the Wharton Civic Center. Visitation will be from 5 to 7
p.m. Saturday at the Wharton Funeral Home.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ After five operations on his left knee and another on a
ruptured Achilles' tendon, Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino
walks with a slight limp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why he continually hears that he's wearing down,
that he can't keep pace with another 37-year-old quarterback, John
Elway of the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, who visit the
Dolphins on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But while legs were once a major part of Elway's game, they
never did much for Marino, strictly a thrower even when he was
playing for the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   If he's less nimble than ever, Marino is still adroit at eluding
sportswriters. He's usually polite but brief: ``Just a couple more
questions, guys. Gotta go, nap time.'' He meets with the media only
after games and on Thursday afternoons, and then only for five to
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks carefully, trying to avoid offending his coach, Jimmy
Johnson, who isn't so careful not to offend his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Johnson praises Marino, it's faint: ``I still think
Dan is in the upper half of the league's quarterbacks, even at this
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson makes Marino a scapegoat for much of what goes wrong for
the Dolphins, who are 9-5 but fighting for a postseason life and
close with the Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons _ teams that are a
combined 25-3.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was at it again after Miami's 21-16 loss to the New York
Jets last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson blamed an opening-drive stall on ``an overthrow,'' when
actually Marino was trying to throw the ball away to avoid a sack.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson couldn't resist pointing out the one time in 57
passes that night on which Marino was intercepted. ``We get down
there later in the game,'' the coach said, ``and Dan wants to throw
to O.J. McDuffie and it got picked off.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson became coach of the Dolphins in 1996, he let
it be known he wasn't entirely comfortable with Marino. Johnson
wanted an offense based on power running, like he had with Emmitt
Smith and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried for an instant personnel makeover in Miami,
shifting the focus from passing to running. And this year, he
completely rewrote the playbook he inherited from Don Shula.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's new offense left little room for Marino to make
adjustments at the line of scrimmage. Johnson, with another of his
subtle digs, claimed that of the 70 audibles Marino called last
season, 55 resulted in gains of three yards or less and three
resulted in interceptions that were returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be at the line of scrimmage with the
offensive linemen back on their heels waiting for a play to be
called,'' said Johnson, who fired the offensive coordinator, Gary
Stevens, ``because of the problems we've had running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes, Miami still has problems running the
ball. The Dolphins are 19th in the NFL in rushing and average just
3.6 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson, the team's general manager as well as head
coach, has provided Marino with pedestrian receivers _ no Mark
Duper, Mark Clayton or Irving Fryar in this bunch.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie is a fine pass catcher, but he lacks separation speed.
The No. 2 wideout, Oronde Gadsen, is in need of rest, having played
arena football before stepping into the NFL this season. ``He's got
two turf toes,'' Johnson said, ``and it's starting to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Troy Drayton has a broken bone in his right hand. And
Karim Abdul-Jabbar and fullback Stanley Pritchett, besides being
sluggish runners, are not adept at catching passes or picking up
blitzers. In Sunday's game, Pritchett twice failed to look back for
passes that whizzed by his ear.
</P>
<P>
   So while Marino's passer rating has declined each year Johnson
has been in Miami (to its current 77.5), there is debate over who
is to blame: the coach/GM or the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe, Pro Bowl tight end for the Broncos, apparently
sides with Johnson. Last summer, Sharpe said Marino, unlike Elway,
``is no longer the player he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino avoids firing back insults at those who criticize him,
but he concedes little to age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I can throw it as good as anyone who ever played,'' he
said. ``My arm strength is just as good as it has ever been,
although I do notice the endurance factor sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him if Johnson's coaching limits him, and he tiptoes
delicately, as he did in his Thursday media session: ``I was pretty
lucky early on (in his career) because I had a great group of
receivers and a coach who was very willing to open things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running an offense now that's a little more controlled.
The passing game is not as sophisticated as in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino and Elway will be facing each other for the first time
since 1985. ``It's kind of weird that we've only played once and it
was 13 years ago,'' Marino said. ``You'd think the way the schedule
is, we'd have met more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Marino has had the better career. He holds NFL
records for passing yardage, 58,238, and touchdown passes, 403.
Marino also leads Elway in completion percentage (.596-.569) and
yards per pass (7.36-7.10).
</P>
<P>
   But Elway has a Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat jealous, but I was very happy for him,'' said
Marino, who played on the losing team in the 1985 Super Bowl.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ Almost 16 seasons since the greatest quarterback draft in
NFL history, only two remain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the six quarterbacks drafted in the first round in 1983, Todd
Blackledge (Pittsburgh) is a college football television analyst.
Jim Kelly (Buffalo) is part of ESPN's broadcast team. Ken O'Brien
(New York Jets) is the quarterbacks coach at Southern California.
Tony Eason (New England) works for a company in Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, the first pick (by the Baltimore Colts) in a draft
that was called the deepest and most talented in history, forced a
trade to Denver soon after he was picked.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino, who owns almost every NFL passing record, was
selected last among the six, taken 23rd by the Miami Dolphins in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Elway and Marino will face each other for only the
second time in their illustrious careers. Their only other
encounter on the field was on Sept. 28, 1985, at Mile High Stadium.
The Dolphins escaped with a 30-26 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw for 390 yards and three touchdowns that day. Elway
threw for 250 yards without a touchdown and failed to engineer one
of his now-patented comebacks. He had a chance but was intercepted
on the last drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice to go play on the same field, because it's
amazing that in 16 years we've only played each other one time,''
Elway said. ``I look forward to seeing Dan play, but even more
important, we've got to get back on track ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Broncos and Dolphins are coming off losses, the game
is much more than an intriguing confrontation. And because Denver
lost to the Giants to ruin its chance to join the 1972 Dolphins as
the league's only unbeaten and untied champions, the game has lost
some of its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Elway-Marino angle on Monday Night Football is
getting a lot of attention _ as it should _ because both are headed
for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Because they were drafted the
same year and are two of the greatest ever, their careers have been
entwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comparison has been there since we were seniors in high
school,'' Elway said. ``He went to Pitt, and I went to Stanford,
and being the same age and the same year in school and as well as
coming in the NFL the same time, I think we've paralleled each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got a great deal of respect for him. Early in our
careers, he had more success than I did. Now, because of the teams
we've played on, it's kind of evened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway is 38, Marino 37. Because Elway played for Dan Reeves, a
conservative coach who believed strongly in the running game and a
more controlled passing game, he has not compiled the massive
numbers of Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was fortunate Don Shula redesigned his offense to take
advantage of Marino's strong arm and quick release.
</P>
<P>
   In their first three seasons, Marino threw 98 touchdown passes
and 44 interceptions. Elway's comparable figures were 47 and 52.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Elway-Marino comparisons affected him early in his
career, Elway said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot to it because we were both young. It was
difficult because I came to a team that was 2-7 the year before. He
went to a great team. He hit the ground running, and I kind of went
the other direction and had to climb my way out of a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone else in the NFL, Elway couldn't believe it
when Marino threw 48 touchdown passes in 1984, his first full year
as a starter. ``Pretty amazing,'' Elway said. ``I was hoping I
could do that in three years, but he did it in one.''
</P>
<P>
   But things change. Now, Elway works in the more wide-open
offense of coach Mike Shanahan. And Marino is being restricted by
the conservative Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, the Class of '83 had a combined Super Bowl
record of 0-9. Elway, who was 0-3, finally earned a ring when the
Broncos defeated Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After going so long without winning a Super Bowl, Elway feels
for Marino, who has played in just one _ in his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dan gets tired of answering those questions,'' Elway
said. ``No matter what he does, that's going to be the thing that
everybody goes back to. That's what happened to me after we lost
our last Super Bowl in '89. No matter what you do, numbers-wise or
anything else, it still goes back to how many Super Bowls you've
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``By us winning it last year, I no longer had to answer all
those questions. That's a big burden. I have got a great deal of
empathy for Dan, especially with the career he's had and what he's
done for the NFL. It's unfair, but unfortunately that's a way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fouts didn't play in a Super Bowl. Warren Moon hasn't. Kelly
played in four but lost them all.
</P>
<P>
   Elway has never been shy about speaking out about the injustice
of judging quarterbacks by Super Bowl victories. He still doesn't
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is you don't have to talk about it (not winning
a Super Bowl) anymore,'' he said. ``The biggest burden got to be
that once I got into my 13th, 14th, 15th year, it no longer
mattered what we did on the field as far as wins and losses. There
was only one thing that counted _ winning a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mind-boggling and frustrating to realize that you are a
cog in the machine but everybody wants to point the finger at you
and say you hadn't won the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos don't repeat, Elway would like to see Marino win
a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about that,'' Elway said. ``He's worked
hard. He's a team guy. His main mission is to win a Super Bowl. To
get the credit he deserves, I sure hope he can win one. I hope he
has to go through us. If we can't get it, I'd like to see him get
one.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Kevin Steele, the Carolina Panthers linebackers coach who
was a late addition to Baylor's coaching search, will be introduced
today as the new football coach for the Bears.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steele resigned from the Panthers on Thursday, telling Carolina
officials he needed to start recruiting at Baylor. The Panthers
(2-12) have two games left, but they are tied for the worst record
in the NFL and are out of the playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments after Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton held a
media briefing Thursday morning to say something could be finalized
within 48 hours, Carolina officials announced Steele had resigned
to take the Baylor job.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor officials have refused to comment about Steele, but
sources say a news conference is expected at 11 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an emotional week for Steele, who found himself in
the national spotlight when Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene
grabbed him by the jacket during a sideline altercation in Sunday's
game against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment, you probably couldn't find half a dozen
Baylor fans who had heard of Steele, who never has been a head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, 40, joined the Carolina staff in 1995 after five years
as an assistant coach at Nebraska. Sources say Steele was so
well-liked at Nebraska, many fans were upset he was not selected
last year to replace coach Tom Osborne, who retired and chose
longtime assistant Frank Solich as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's selection by Baylor officials will come as a surprise
to many Baylor backers, who expected former Alabama coach Gene
Stallings to get the job. But Stallings withdrew his name from
consideration Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower was
Baylor's second choice if Stallings declined, but sources close to
the program said Bower's interview did not go well in comparison to
Steele's. One Baylor official said Steele ``knocked their socks
off'' during his interview Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, who attended high school in Dillon, S.C., played
linebacker for Tennessee from 1976-79. Friends say his lifelong
dream was to become a head coach at a school in a major conference.
His coaching stints include stops at Tennessee (1981-82 and
1987-88), New Mexico State (1983) and Oklahoma State (1984-86)
before going to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Others who interviewed for the Baylor job include Bears
offensive coordinator Eddie Williamson, Arkansas defensive
coordinator Keith Burns and Dallas Highland Park coach Scott Smith,
a former Baylor player who might be hired as an assistant on
Steele's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Steele will replace Dave Roberts, who was reassigned Dec. 6
after posting back-to-back 2-9 seasons. Roberts, the former
offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, replaced Chuck Reedy, who was
fired by Stanton after the team went 4-7 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though Steele is not the big-name hire Stallings would have
been, some longtime Baylor fans compare it to the situation when
Grant Teaff was hired in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Baylor alumni at that time hoped the school would
hire well-known and well-respected Johnny Majors instead of the
little-known Teaff, but Teaff would become the most successful
coach in school history over his 21 seasons at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor players seemed excited about Steele getting the job.
Baylor freshman running back Ben Gay was asked if it meant
something to the players to have a coach who has worked in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it does,'' Gay said. ``We're blessed to have a coach
coming here with experience in the NFL. That gives us a lot more
confidence because he knows what it takes to get to the next level.
I also hear he's somebody with some toughness, and that's what we
need. Now, it's time for us to come together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Baylor players approached Stanton last month saying they
would transfer if Roberts wasn't replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to put down coach Roberts, but having a coach everybody
wants to play for will be a big change here,'' junior safety Rodney
Smith said. ``The morale of this team has been pretty low, to tell
you the truth. To have a coach that everyone respects will be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (Steele) coming from the NFL, that's probably the best
credentials you can have because everybody is trying to get there.
Now, maybe my last year can be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina players were disappointed to hear Steele was
leaving, but they understand why Baylor officials want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset,'' Panthers linebacker Jeff Brady said. ``He's
a quality coach. We lost Kevin, and it's going to hurt this team.
There are not enough good coaches in this business. Kevin is an
outstanding coach, and Baylor is lucky to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do a great job at Baylor,'' Carolina quarterback Steve
Beuerlein said. ``The players will respect him and play hard for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Steele would have been out of a job at Carolina.
Charles Chandler, who covers the the Panthers for the Charlotte
Observer, reported Thursday that head coach Dom Capers might be
fired at the end of the season. But Chandler believes Steele will
be a success at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man and a good coach,'' Chandler said. ``He's a
real people person, and all the players liked him a lot. And he has
such a good personality that the alumni there will love him. From
what I've heard about the previous situation there, you all are in
for a welcome change.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA, Calif. _ At quarterback . . . Dennis Quaid.
</P>
<P>
   Which presents some peculiar challenges for the person directing
the stunts for Oliver Stone's new football drama, ``On Any Given
Sunday,'' which will begin shooting in Miami next month.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid stands 6-foot-1 and is 170 pounds. That's a healthy
physique in most walks of life but a bit scrawny when measured
against unemployed jocks who are capable of throwing tight spirals
_ the available pool of stunt doubles. Quaid is also left-handed,
further complicating the search. What's more, the filmmakers will
need not one of these stunt players but three.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The stuntman, says Allan Graf, ``has got to know going in that
he's going to take some hits. He's going to get !ital!nailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the 360-degree propeller ride that John Elway was sent
on at the last Super Bowl? Well, they're going to try to re-create
it in this movie. And it won't be Quaid going airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Graf relates all of this with a devilish chuckle over breakfast
at a deli near his home in Agoura.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Hollywood's football guru, the man who has delivered
astonishing realism as second-unit director and stunt coordinator
on such films as ``Jerry Maguire,'' ``The Program'' and a
made-for-TV movie on Dennis Byrd, the former New York Jets player
who suffered a serious spinal injury. ``The Waterboy,'' Hollywood's
recent box-office success? Yep, that was his handiwork, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the man (for football action sequences),'' said
Frank Coraci, director of ``The Waterboy.'' ``I watched a bunch of
his movies. I was, like, `I like that. I like that. I like that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What was kind of cool, I saw different movies he did, and
stylistically they weren't all the same. `Jerry Maguire' has an NFL
Films look. `The Program' uses more wide angles on the field, so
you felt more like a player. I saw he could work with all different
kinds of (directorial) visions and still come up on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf got into the stunt business shortly after completing his
playing career as an offensive tackle on USC's 1972
national-championship team. (His son, Derek, out of Agoura High, is
a freshman for the Trojans at the same position.)
</P>
<P>
   Allan was like a lot of people who have spent time around elite
football and wince at the often-clumsy attempts to bring the action
to the big screen. He found the scenes bordering on laughable. (You
know the footage: Defenders mysteriously sprawl onto the ground,
unblocked, as the hero breaks off an absurd weaving run for a
touchdown.)
</P>
<P>
   So after doing football stunt work in such movies as ``Gus'' and
``Heaven Can Wait'' (``I pick up Warren Beatty in the end zone
after he scores,'' he said), Graf nearly tumbled over himself a few
years ago when given his first opportunities to coordinate football
stunts, notably in ``Oklahoma City Dolls'' (a TV movie) and
``Necessary Roughness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw movies where (the football action) takes you right out
of it if it's not realistic,'' Graf said. ``I wasn't going to be
laughed at. I'm going to make my football real. It goes back to my
football playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `The Waterboy,' I told them, `You're not going to make the
football comedy. We're going to make it real. The comedy is going
to come out of Adam Sandler's character.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That coincided with Coraci's plan. The football sequences, the
director said Thursday, ``were treated like full-on real stunts,
with real pain. Pain lends itself to comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Hollywood hokiness is inevitable in other aspects of
the movies Graf works on, however. He says he cringed when Cuba
Gooding Jr. broke into a seemingly endless celebration after rising
to his feet after a vicious hit in ``Jerry Maguire.'' And some
directors insist that opposing linemen jaw at each other even when
the quarterback has begun his cadence, which would draw a flag in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he is thrilled to be working with Stone, who has
assured him ``On Any Given Sunday'' won't deviate from NFL realism.
</P>
<P>
   Graf welcomes invitations to deliver teeth-rattling authenticity
to the cameras. Throughout this month he has been conducting a
training camp in Miami, working with 200 potential stunt players _
refugees from the NFL waiver lists, the Canadian Football League,
Arena ball. Once he has selected his roster for the movie, he'll
cut the squad, just as they do in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also draw up plays and assignments and carefully
choreograph each highlight-reel completion and collision.
</P>
<P>
   When shooting starts in January, the stuntmen will really start
earning their money.
</P>
<P>
   That scene in ``Jerry Maguire'' in which Gooding's character
gets toppled on his head in the end zone? It required 29 takes,
with three different stunt players rotating as Gooding's Arizona
Cardinals wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Watch it closely the next time you see the movie. The director,
Cameron Crowe, wanted the scene to look just like a Monday-night
telecast on ABC. So the injury scene is one continuous shot from
the snap of the ball, with no cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while it is not unusual for players to get hit in the legs
and flipped while reaching up for a pass (they can usually break
their fall with their free arm), in this scene a second defender
shoves the receiver in the back while he is upended.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week before we shot that, we rehearsed that,'' Graf said.
``We put a portable pit (the kind used for high jump competitions)
out there. We rehearsed and rehearsed, so the two defenders come
in, they hit him, he knows where he's going to land.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the actual movie scene, stuntman Horace Knight ``hit
right where we knew it was going to be safe,'' landing on the top
of his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Graf recalls another harrowing moment _ involving himself. In
``The Program,'' the filmmakers had been granted the field for 20
minutes during halftime of a Tennessee-South Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   Graf had a camera rigged inside a helmet, so the audience's view
would be out through the mask, and he was to simulate a touchdown
punt return.
</P>
<P>
   First problem: The punter was nervous and shanked the first
three. After the third, Graf screamed, ``Just throw the (expletive)
ball!'' The ball was passed in his direction, and he took off
running, wearing no pads, gingerly holding the camera in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Second problem: The presence of a real stadium crowd had caused
the adrenaline of the stunt players to soar. All the blocks and
near-miss hits were rehearsed in advance, but ``I start running and
all these players are flying at me,'' Graf said. ``I'm totally
vulnerable with that camera. If something doesn't happen just
right, I get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He's never been shy about taking risks, though.
</P>
<P>
   Graf gave up football after a brief stay in the World Football
League in the early 1970s. During one pro offseason, he got a stunt
job on ``Gus,'' the Disney movie about a mule that kicks field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   When the WFL folded, Graf gravitated to the Stuntmen's
Association, and soon was getting steady work as a stunt double for
Dick Butkus (the facial resemblance is uncanny).
</P>
<P>
   Because of his body type and background _ and high pain
threshold _ he got a lot of opportunities to play bodyguards,
bouncers, assorted heavies. ``When I started out,'' Graf said, ``I
did things everyone else didn't want to do. `Hey, let Allan run
through that wall.' I did the tough stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes voluntarily. He beams proudly while announcing that he
was the first stuntman to cannon-roll a bus, in the movie ``Another
48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Not familiar with the technique? Picture this: Two five-foot
lengths of telephone pole encased in steel, positioned in vertical
cylinders inside the left wall of the bus, with an eight-ounce
black-powder bomb atop each pole. Drive the bus 60 mph, activate an
oil sprayer on the left tires as you turn sharply left. Activate
the bombs. The poles fire out of their cylinders, propelling the
bus into a sharp roll onto its right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus went 17 feet in the air,'' Graf said. ``We made two
full rolls. They'd wanted to set up a crash camera (in a cage,
remotely controlled) and asked where I thought I'd end up. I said,
`I have no idea.' Well, the bus landed right on top of the crash
camera. Perfect shot.'' (It was used in the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the occupation isn't for everyone _ just ask those
poor saps who will stand in for Dennis Quaid when the blitz comes
roaring in.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf delights in this work, and apparently the passion is
reciprocal. Coraci said the stuntmen refer to Graf as ``Coach,''
adding, ``The players really give it up for him. We had some really
hard hitting in our movie. I think it's because they respect him as
a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain an appreciation of his chosen course, Graf need only
think back to when he left San Fernando High for USC and was
scraping up whatever summer work he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year,'' he said, ``it was one of the hottest summers
in the Valley, and I was putting in pools in the hills, in Encino,
Tarzana. I would wheel(barrow) concrete, dig footings for walls. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Another year, I worked with (then-USC tight end) Charle Young
building high-rise parking structures in Beverly Hills. Hanging
60-70 feet over, tying steel, pouring concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incentive to me to find something that I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Something he could do and relish.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt that Allan Graf accomplished his
objective. &QL; 
CAMEO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing stunt work, stunt coordination and
second-unit direction in more than 50 Hollywood movies, former San
Fernando High and USC tackle Allan Graf has had several bit-acting
parts _ mostly heavies. ``I've been beaten up by the best of
them,'' he said good-naturedly. Here are some examples: &QL; 
__ Golf coach: Opening sequence of ``Jerry Maguire.'' Gets a golf
club thrown at him by bratty prodigy. &QL; 
__ Prison-bus driver: Transports bad guy in ``Another 48 Hours.''
(Then rolls the bus in a stunt assignment.) &QL; 
__ Wife-beater: Opening scene of ``L.A. Confidential.'' &QL; 
__ Killer: Donut-shop scene in ``Boogie Nights.'' &QL; 
__ Convict: Beats up his cellmate, Kiefer Sutherland, in
``Flashback.'' &QL; 
__ Biker: In ``Cannonball Run,'' gets kicked in the crotch by
Farrah Fawcett and beaten up by Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds. &QL; 
__ Limo driver: Chauffeurs Mr. Big in ``Wayne's World.'' As stunt
man, wheels limo into 180-degree spin on Woodley Avenue in the
Sepulveda Basin (quite a feat considering the movie is set in
Illinois). &QL; 
__ Bartender: In ``Fighting Back,'' gets beaten up by Tom
Skerritt. &QL; 
__ Baseball player: In ``Brewster's Millions,'' gets into a brawl
with John Candy and Richard Pryor. &QL; 
__ Bank customer: Holdup victim in ``The Long Riders.'' In same
movie, is also seen as train engineer. &QL; 
__ Next-door neighbor: Just wants to watch TV with his buddies in
``Poltergeist.'' &QL; 
__ Short-order cook: Gets into an argument, then a fight, with
Jean-Claude Van Damme in ``Universal Soldier.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN Los Angeles, there is now a third player in the NFL derby. It's
almost to the point where you can't tell the wannabe expansion
owners there without a scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Bob McNair and Steve Patterson are becoming experts
in revolving stadium signs and giant video screens.
</P>
<P>
   LA has gone from two contending stadium sites to three. Houston
is fine-tuning the detail work on state-of-the-art amenities. For
all we know, Mrs. McNair might be picking out wallpaper for the
family's 50-yard-line luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not to be interpreted as arrogance or
overconfidence. McNair knows his fight isn't won. No matter how
many clamoring, issue-clouding factions try to enter the fray in
Los Angeles, he won't underestimate the city's immense clout. But
he wants the NFL's existing owners to understand, in no uncertain
terms, that he will be ready when they are.
</P>
<P>
   Something LaLa Land can't promise.
</P>
<P>
   With a ``yes'' vote for Houston in the spring, construction on a
21st-century Astrodome can begin right after the millennium, in
time for a 2002 debut. McNair's i's will be dotted and, knowing
him, the kicking tees purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Further, when completed, there won't be a finer football venue
in the kingdom. If a bell or whistle can be had, Bob wants it. He
also wants his would-be peer group of owners to understand that he
wants it. Truth is, the way the NFL works, stadiums are more
important than markets these days.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Patterson, McNair's right-hand man and the guy doing
most of the grunt work for Houston NFL Holdings Inc., spent his
weekend perusing the many wonders of Baltimore's new edifice,
accompanied by the rodeo's head honcho, Leroy Shafer. And why
McNair joined up with Patterson for a Monday-Tuesday tour of NFL
stadiums in Tampa, Miami and Jacksonville. McNair hopes to hit 20
league cities before he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the current season, Patterson has traveled to
12, where he shakes hands, takes notes and looks behind as many
doors as his hosts open for him. These visits have served a dual
purpose. The schmoozing with NFL people, reminding them of
Houston's preparedness, enthusiasm and intensity level, is as
important as what can be gleaned from up-close observation of the
myriad fun stuff the thoroughly modern sports venue has to offer
the customer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the latter Patterson finds fascinating. His favorite?
No question about it _ the two 100-foot-by-20-foot video screens in
Baltimore that permit the showing of three games per, or six games
at once.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ravens have a late start, their fans can come out and
theoretically watch every one of the early games simultaneously. Or
vice versa, staying afterward to enjoy what the Ravens are
marketing as ``the fifth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Patterson said, noting that, yes, the screens have
been added to Houston's shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   Again, while it might sound like the cart is being put in front
of the horse, that's not the case. Because the McNair team can't
outglitz LA's unholy trinity, it must attack in other ways. The
NFL's owners need to be blown away by how thorough and how together
Houston's total package is. That's McNair's game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a great reception from all of the owners,'' Patterson
said of the east-by-southeast swing. ``Everybody was very helpful,
very positive. They want Houston back in the National Football
League.''
</P>
<P>
   But they want Los Angeles as well, assuming that sprawling,
diffuse metropolis can get its act together. The latest addition to
the city's franchise free-for-all is Jack Singer, a Canadian real
estate tycoon who has put the oft-discussed Hollywood Park complex
back in play.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, whose only sporting credentials are failed bids to buy
the Toronto Blue Jays and the Kansas City Royals, is negotiating an
option on 30 acres of the Inglewood horse-track site adjacent to
the Great Western Forum. It's not a paradise locale by any measure,
but it's more highly thought of by most Angelenos than Michael
Ovitz's former toxic-waste dump plot south of LA proper in Carson
or Ed Rosky's pie-in-the-skyish Coliseum redo.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners love or hate Ovitz, depending on how they perceive
his Hollywood connection. Rosky, they have begun to fear, is
underfinanced as well as geographically misguided, given the
league's antipathy toward the Coliseum area. As for Singer, he
might bring the best package to the plate, but isn't he a bit of a
Jack-come-lately?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still open to meeting with any other people who are
interested in bringing a team to LA,'' says Greg Aiello of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Figures. But the Houston group, plowing headfirst into the
details, doesn't have time to fret over the multiple-choice options
on the West Coast. The more the merrier. Divide and conquer always
has been a sound military strategy.

   NEW YORK _ Security was on high alert at all government
buildings, airports, bus and train terminals, bridges, tunnels and
other public places across the New York metropolitan area on
Thursday to guard against acts of terrorist retaliation for the
American air strikes against Iraq, federal and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away from the missiles raining down on Baghdad, New
York was hardly an armed camp, and the officials said it was not
being singled out among American cities for special security.
Similar precautions, they noted, were in effect at government and
transportation hubs across the country, particularly at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Defense Secretary William Cohen warned Thursday
of a generally increased threat of terrorist attacks in the United
States at any time, other federal officials said they had no fresh
intelligence reports that conveyed specific threats against New
York or any other city in America.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged at a City Hall news
conference that additional security measures were being taken. He
noted that since the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in
August, as well as the detention of suspects here, security in
general has been heightened, and he called the latest response a
``slight'' increase that many people might not notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had increased security throughout the city at significant
places,'' the mayor said, ``so the increase that's taken place now
shouldn't be felt by people. It's fairly subtle, but people should
understand we were already at a fairly high level of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the mayor, police officials declined to divulge details for
fear of compromising the measures. But they acknowledged that
hundreds of extra officers were being deployed at the United
Nations headquarters; at the World Trade Center, which was hit by a
terrorist bomb in 1993; and at government buildings and
transportation centers across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security procedures were evident at major
transportation centers. At Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark
International Airports, curb-side check-ins were canceled so that
baggage would not be left unattended. Similarly, vehicles standing
even briefly unattended near passenger terminals were being towed
away, officials said. And bomb-sniffing dogs were being used where
suspicions were raised.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, at the George Washington and
Triboro Bridges, and at the other bridges and tunnels linking New
York, New Jersey, Long Island and the regional suburbs, extra
officers were on watch, and scores of vehicles, especially trucks
and vans, were being pulled over at random and checked, Port
Authority officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bus and train terminals in New York and New Jersey also were
being watched by additional officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even some regular government employees known to security
officers were not allowed to pass freely. One official employed at
26 Federal Plaza, for example, said that officers of the Federal
Protective Service were opening and examining car trunks at random
at the garage entrance, even when they knew the driver, to guard
against any bomb planted surreptitiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' one official said, ``in order to get into any
government building in New York, you have to show identification
and explain your reason for being there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carlos Abraham Foster, a real-life urban cowboy who
toured the rodeo circuit around New York and started a program to
teach city children about riding as a way to counter the dangers of
drugs and AIDS, died on Saturday at his home in Scarsdale. He was
76 and had let it be known in August that he was hanging up his
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster was raised on a cattle ranch in Oriente Province, Cuba,
where he became an expert rider and cowboy. After years of raising
cattle and breaking horses, he joined the Mexican rodeo circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he came to the United States. After learning English,
he worked first at the drug-rehabilitation center Horizon House and
then for 10 years as director of community relations for the New
York City Drug Addiction Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But he still considered himself a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I was a janitor because I couldn't
speak English right,'' he said in 1983. ``But I bought a horse
right away, before I bought a car.'' (His family listed his beloved
palomino horse, Santiago, as one of his survivors.)
</P>
<P>
   By then he had started the Urban Western Riding Program, renting
horses at a stable on Pelham Parkway and rewarding children with
riding lessons if they did their homework and stayed away from
drugs. On the theory that youngsters did not see black cowboys like
him very often, he brought in other black rodeo performers for
parades and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   A tall man who liked to wear a Stetson hat and full cowboy
regalia, he organized rodeos under the auspices of the Federation
of Black Cowboys throughout the New York City region. He talked to
children about black cowboys during school appearances and programs
observing Black History Month in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major point is that black cowboys helped build the Old
West; there were 5,000 of them,'' he said in 1983, citing the book
``The Black West'' by William Loren Katz. ``It was a mean, dirty,
low-paying job.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster eventually had a theater-dance presentation dedicated to
him. In 1984, an improvisational off-Broadway happening, ``Cowboys,
Dreams and Ladders,'' by Ishmael Houston-Jones and Fred Holland,
invoked Foster's name, exploring images of the West, from real
cowboys to dream versions.
</P>
<P>
   Foster was also honored in August at the Mind-Builders 10th
annual Community Folk Arts Festival in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his
wife of more than 30 years, the former Gladys Coombs; five sons,
Roland, of New City, and Carlos Jr., Eduardo, Pablo and Ruben of
the Bronx; four daughters, Jeraldine Ocasio of the Bronx, Diana
Elena Matsoukas of Hackensack, N.J., Miriam Clark of Montclair,
N.J., and Marcia Luisa Foster of Guantanamo, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by two brothers, Rodolfo and Pedro, of
Miami; a sister, Catalina McCook, also of Miami; 21 grandchildren,
and six great-grandchildren.
