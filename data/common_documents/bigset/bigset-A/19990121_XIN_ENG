<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese leader said here
today that the primary task of the united front work is to unite
the majority of the people so as to bring their initiatives into
full play.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on united front work, Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said our cause
represents the interest of most of the people that needs their
concerted efforts to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
The wishes, sentiments, opinions of the majority are the
starting point as well as the end of all our efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we bring together all the people that we can and
tap potentials of all positive factors can we fulfill the Party's
general tasks and goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The criteria to judge the correctness of our policies and the
competence of our cadres lie on whether we can draw the majority
of people together.
</P>
<P>
Li urged united front departments at various levels to go to
the grassroots and acquire sound understanding of the concerns of
the general public and to do a better job in the new year.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Suggests Currency Should Be Devalued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Wednesday moved to devalue the currency, the won, in a
bid to boost exports and kickstart economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
At a business meeting, Kim said that, in principle, the
government should not intervene in the foreign exchange markets,
but devaluation of the won -- which stands at 1,175 to the U.S.
dollar -- would help recovery through expanding exports.
</P>
<P>
"We should devalue the won to increase exports. The government
will take proper steps to devalue the won," the president told a
meeting attended by some 200 experts and foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to continue to lower interest rates
in order to reduce the amount of borrowing from overseas
institutions, adding that the differences between the borrowing
and savings rates must be lowered.
</P>
<P>
"The differences in the rates in this country is 4.5
percentage points, much larger than 0.9 in Japan and 2.8 in
Taiwan. We cannot compete with the others under these
conditions," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Banks here are under fire because they are reluctant to lower
borrowing rates despite the rapid stabilization of the local
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates, which soared to around 30 percent at the peak
of the economic turmoil in 1997, now stand at around eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the government will encourage local
businesses to borrow money from domestic lenders instead of
foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to push the borrowers to clear
foreign debts with unfavorable terms and to try to raise foreign
exchange reserves to 55 billion U.S. dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Miracle Short-lived as Rockets Blow Sharks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharks, blessed by a miracle in the seventh round when they
turn the tables by scoring a final-minute win over Jiangshu
Dragons to snap their three-loss streak, were destroyed by
Rockets 96-115 in a one-sided match.
</P>
<P>
Until the half of the lackluster match Rockets did not allow
any chances to the host which were embarrassed by low shooting
percentage and lack of board control, trailing 39-63 in the
halftime.
</P>
<P>
The host managed to claw back to the game in the third
quarter, cutting the gap to 17 points after Rockets' inside
attack force blunted with forward Wang Zhizhi substituted.
</P>
<P>
But Sharks failed to find effective ways to further narrow the
gap, having to trail the reigning champion 19 points at the final
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Other two teams from Northeast China also smiled to last.
Promoted Jilin Northeast Tigers slammed Zhejiang Cyclone 105-98
while Liaoning Hunters edged past Jinan Army Pegasus 109-103.
</P>
<P>
The two teams of Beijing also tasted the sweetness of victory
as Beijing Aoshen finished off Sichuan Pandas 97-84 and Beijing
Ducks destroyed Guandong Tigers 96-73 at home.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other game, Shandong Flaming Bulls eased past
lowly Jiangshu Dragons 110-84.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Urges Peaceful Settlement in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Wednesday expressed concern over the tension in Kosovo, saying
that the situation must be settled "exclusively by peaceful
means".
</P>
<P>
In a statement unanimously backed by the deputies in the lower
house of parliament, the Duma reiterated that "NATO's
interference in the Balkan conflict is inadmissible".
</P>
<P>
They said that NATO's siding with the Albanian separatists
would bring about extremely negative consequences, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in the breakaway Yugoslav province after
the weekend killing near the village of Racak of 45 ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yugoslavia declared William Walker, head of the
OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the Racak victims and the expulsion of Walker
have prompted Western threats to use force against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Duma's statement said that the current wave of tension in
Kosovo "was preceded by provocations, including the murder and
kidnapping of Serbs by the Kosovo Liberation Army".
</P>
<P>
The deputies said that the absence of an "adequate
international response to these actions caused the conflicting
parties to treat one another with even greater suspicion and
enmity, all of which led to a tragedy near the village of Racak".
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community to "approach
the situation in Kosovo with special responsibility, and rebuff
provocations and crimes no matter who commits them".
</P>
<P>
"All hasty and biased judgments and unilateral moves will only
complicate the situation and undermine trust in a peaceful
settlement," the document said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Calls for Retaliation to U.S. Sanctions on Research Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian lawmakers on Wednesday
called for measures to counter U.S. sanctions on three Russian
scientific research centers for alleged cooperation with Iran in
missile and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
In a statement approved by 320 to one, the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, denied as "groundless" the charges
against the Research Institute of Energy Technology, the Moscow
Aviation Institute and the Mendeleyev Chemical Technology
University.
</P>
<P>
Checks have confirmed that the three institutions had not
violated the international rules for the non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction or missiles for their delivery, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is rigorously observing international standards in
this sphere of activity, and it is not going to give in to the
dictates of outside countries concerning the development of its
cooperation with its partners," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Duma categorically disagrees with the attempts by the
United States to use this issue as a means of putting political
pressure on some countries," the document said.
</P>
<P>
"The inability of Washington to normalize relations with Iran
or other countries should not be a reason for Russia to curtail
its friendly relations with these countries," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said
Wednesday that Washington had no information to substantiate its
charges that the Russian institutions were involved in
transferring nuclear technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Adamov said his ministry "does not want to use the
situation and derail the constructive dialogue with the U.S.
Energy Department", Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States had not produced any materials on violations
of international agreements by Russia's nuclear and atomic
enterprises over the past year and a half, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia did not want its neighboring or nearby states to
acquire nuclear arms, he said. This position involved Israel and
Palestine, and Iran, he said. "It is in our security interests,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Takes Precautionary Measures on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO ambassadors decided on
Wednesday to put the alliance's military forces on standby as a
precautionary measure against the deteriorating situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO sources said that the alliance had instructed shortening
the readiness time from 96 hours to 48 hours for its warplanes in
the area and mustering warships to an Italian port. It had also
started maneuvering the NATO Strike Force South which includes
the United States Sixth Fleet and its carrier Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said after the council meeting of
ambassadors that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had to
"take certain precautionary measures" as Yugoslavia disregarded
the calls of the international community and showed unwillingness
to honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
NATO's two top generals, Military Committee Chairman Klaus
Naumann and Supreme Commander Wesley Clark, who went to Belgrade
on Tuesday, reported to the NATO ambassadors that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic remained defiant on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shea said NATO fully supported the verification mission chief
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), William Walker, who was expelled by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman demanded that Yugoslavia grant immediate and
unrestricted access to the chief prosecutor of the International
War Crimes Tribunal, Louise Arbour, and identify and hand over to
the tribunal those responsible for the killings of 45 ethnic
Albanians in Racak, a village in southern Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that nothing had been ruled out by the ambassadors,
who sat in the permanent decision-making North Atlantic Council
throughout the week to watch the development of situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But NATO wanted to first exhaust political means before
resorting to military means which Shea said was a back-up for
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that NATO urged all sides in Kosovo to show
restraint and start political negotiations for a peaceful
solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO called off an air strike against Yugoslavia at the
eleventh hour last October when Milosevic struck a peace deal
with the U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke on a military pull-out from
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Germany to Honor Contracts on Nuclear Recycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- France has again asked Germany
to respect the contracts on recycling of nuclear waste it signed
with France in 1990, in spite of the change in nuclear policy by
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
French minister for relations with parliament, Daniel
Vaillant, said at the National Assembly on Wednesday that the
contracts signed between governments should not be jeopardized by
a change of policy.
</P>
<P>
The new left-wing government in Germany, which consists of
ministers from the Green Party, announced last week the
abandoning of nuclear energy and said it would stop sending
nuclear waste to the French nuclear plant in La Hague in Normandy
for recycling.
</P>
<P>
The French state-owned nuclear company Cogema said that the
decision would result in a loss of some six billion francs (1.2
billion U.S. dollars) for France and it has asked for
compensations, which was rejected by Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Vaillant said that the French government had been in contact
with Germany since the December Franco-German summit in Potsdam
over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that negotiations between Paris and Bonn
would bring results.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States of America and
Zimbabwe Wednesday signed in Harare an updated investment
incentive agreement to encourage more American investment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa said the need for the revised agreement was realized
following an investment mission to the U.S. last year, where the
American business community expressed interest in investing in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it had become necessary to revise the 1990
agreement which guaranteed projects or activities by U.S.
investors registered with the government in view of the extensive
economic liberalization in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the new agreement will eliminate the specific project
by project approvals and will extend programs to include direct
loans to U.S. private companies that may want to invest in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"It also provides security and a legal framework an investor
can rely on, " he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Tom Macdonald said: "The renewal of
this agreement is a key step toward increasing opportunities for
U.S. investment in Zimbabwe and building upon the already solid
partnership between our governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation
in Zimbabwe includes support for agricultural and manufacturing
projects, while potential projects involve privatization, value
added manufacturing, infrastructure development,
telecommunications, mining, and tourism.

As a result of U.S. President Bill Clinton"s "Africa

<HEADLINE> Canada's Mutual Fund Sales Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's mutual fund sales
dropped by 32 percent in 1998 from a year earlier as a result of
global market volatility, according to a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canadians put 35.4 billion dollars (23.1 billion U.S. dollars)
into mutual funds in 1998, down from a record 51.9 billion
dollars (33.9 billion dollars) in 1997, according to the
Investment Funds Institute of Canada.
</P>
<P>
An industry official described the year 1998 as a nervous year
for investors. "We had a huge first half and it looked like it
might break the record, but as the market underperformed, net
sales tailed off very dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Canada's mutual fund assets, which stem from new sales
and market appreciation, rose 15 percent to 326.6 billion dollars
(213.1 billion dollars) by the end of 1998 compared with 283.2
billion dollars (184.8 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Canada's mutual fund net sales this year are expected to
remain at the same level as last year, ranging from 30 billion to
40 billion dollars (19.6 billion to 26.1 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on CIQ Dispute With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Foreign Minister S.
Jayakumar Wednesday reiterated his country's sovereignty over
Tanjong Pagar, an inside-Singapore railway station where Malaysia
has maintained a Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ)
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions to the parliament Wednesday afternoon,
Jayakumar said, "Singapore rejected Malaysia's claim that they had
a legal right to operate their CIQ at Tanjong Pagar."
</P>
<P>
"We have stressed that any negotiations on the location of the
CIQ could proceed only after Singapore's sovereignty over Tanjong
Pagar and Woodlands has been acknowledged and not disputed,"
Jayakumar stated.
</P>
<P>
As a legacy left behind by the British colonial rule, Malaysia
has owned a railway running from Malaysia to Tanjong Pagar via
Woodlands at the northern border of Singapore and Malaysia has
maintained a CIQ at the end terminal of Tanjong Pagar.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Singapore demanded that Malaysia's CIQ be relocated
to Woodlands and Malaysia dismissed the demand, saying it had a
legal right to keep its CIQ in Tanjong Pagar.
</P>
<P>
Singapore first demanded that Malaysia submit written legal
arguments to substantiate its position within three months ending
October 31, 1998, and then it extended the deadline to December
15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told the parliament that "Malaysia has to
date not submitted its written legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar also said, "We have informed Malaysia that if they do
not produce their legal arguments in one month's time, we will
assume that they no longer wish to pursue their legal claim to be
at Tanjong Pagar."
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysian Government's operation of CIQ facilities here is
not on the basis of legal right or extra-territorial rights. They
are here on the leave and consent of the Singapore government," he
stressed.

cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal
investigating the massacre of 45 Albanians in Racak, Kosovo, last
week.

Two major French dailies, Le Figaro and Le Monde, expressed

<P>
Belgrade, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A team of Finnish legal
medical experts are expected to arrive in Pristina, capital of
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, to examine the corpses of 45
ethnic Albanians, the official news agency Tanjug reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dragoljub Jankovic, justice minister of the Republic of
Serbia, met in Belgrade Helen Ranta, head of the Finnish expert
team, and Finnish Ambassador to Yugoslavia Hani Mantivaru in
Belgrade to discuss the possibility of autopsies.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish experts will arrive on Wednesday and Thursday,
according to Jankovic.
</P>
<P>
The 45 corpses were found last Saturday on hillsides and
gullies around the village of Racak, some 25 kilometers south of
Pristina, prompting grave concern from the international community
 over the tension in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday adopted a presidential
statement, saying that the massacres of the Albanian civilians
threatened the efforts to settle conflicts through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav authorities, however, said that the initial
postmortems by Yugoslav legal medical experts showed that the
corpses belonged to members of the Kosovo Liberation Army killed
in fighting with Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish experts will examine the bodies again in the
Forensic Medical Institute of Pristina with the involvement of
Yugoslav counterparts, Jankovic said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean FM Defends Involvement in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge Wednesday dismissed as misguided and dangerous arguments
that Zimbabwe should not be involved in the war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) because it is not the country's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The minister said proximity was not a mere function of
geography but included such considerations as shared assets,
environment and destiny.
</P>
<P>
He was outlining Zimbabwe's foreign policy to members of the
Zimbabwe Defense Forces attending a joint command and staff course
at the Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have the Southern Africa Power Pool which brings
electricity from the giant Inga Dam in the DRC. This is an asset
to the whole region although it is located in the DRC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Allowing aggression and rebellion in the DRC to succeed would
set a bad precedent with very negative consequences for the entire
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, Southern African Development
 Community member states agreed to form the Organ on Politics,
Defense and Security in Gaborone in 1996 with the sole objective
of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and political cooperation at
regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
He said the media and academics should not be sensationalist
and destructive for the country's foreign policy to succeed,
instead, they had to be patriotic even if they had their
differences with the government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets Measures to Stabilize Local Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) Wednesday announced new measures to stabilize the ailing
Zimbabwean Dollar but denied reports that it had given a directive
to fix the exchange rate saying this should be determined by the
market.
</P>
<P>
RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba told reporters that the new
measures included arrangements for the central bank to share
information with authorized dealers, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
This would result in the identification of possible surpluses
and shortages of foreign exchange during any given trading day and
ensure that the foreign exchange position was matched throughout
the day.
</P>
<P>
"The new measures will also require that the Reserve Bank
determine whether some banks may be unnecessarily bidding for
foreign exchange thereby artificially depreciating the currency,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the even, the bank will recommend suspension of the
individual banks' authorized dealer's licence and or impose
penalties as provided for by the exchange control provisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The governor dismissed as untrue press reports that the central
bank had given banks a directive to peg the exchange rate between
39 and 40 zimbabwean Dollars to the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We never gave a directive. We have not pegged the currency.
The rate should be determined by the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency's fall to new lows of 44 to the greenback,
72 to the Pound Sterling and seven to the South African Rand early
this month meant that it was undervalued by 51 percent, 53 percent
and 22 percent respectively against these currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsumba said there was no need for the market to panic
as the economy's prospects to the end of this year would look
better particularly with the good rains realized so far.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the country's GDP growth for this year at around
three percent.

<HEADLINE> Bonn: War And Violence Unacceptalbe in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- "Germany wants everything possible
to be done for a political solution (in Kosovo)," German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, told
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the German government warned Wednesday that "other options"
would have to be used if Belgrade refused to allow a political
solution for the worsening Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"So, it is up to Milosevic himself in which way this issue will
develop in the international community," said Heye, adding that Bonn
could only push for a political solution if Belgrade gave it the
opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
On the same day German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer warned
that war and violence were not acceptable means in Kosovo and
called Yugoslavia to "return to negotiations, cooperation and full
compliance with the agreement" which prevented NATO air strikes
last year.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) suspended its
threat of air strikes on Yugoslav military targets last October
after peace deal was made by the Yugoslavia government and
American envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as foreign minister of Germany's European Union's
presidency, Fischer told reporters that Germany and the EU
would do everything possible for a peaceful solution in Kosovo, but he
also stressed: "We cannot accept a path of violence and war."
</P>
<P>
NATO's activation order, which cleared the way for alliance
attacks, has not been lifted and remains a military threat to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.

<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Wednesday that he does not "rule out the
possibility" of using British troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question in the House of Commons on his policy
towards the Serbian province, Blair warned Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that he would risk "a rapid military response
from NATO" if Milosevic failed to comply with assurances he gave
last Autumn in the terms of ceasefire.

<P>
"We have to move with the rest of our allies but we remain
ready to act," Blair said, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.

Defense Secretary George Robertson said later that Britain is
sending four additional ground attack aircraft and a refuelling
tanker to Italy to bolster NATO forces preparing for possible
action in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Report of Cuban Counsels in Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of Angolan armed
forces Jose Manuel "Jota" Wednesday denied reports that there are
Cuban military consultants in the government army.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made as a response to a report carried Tuesday
on Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias.
</P>
<P>
The report said at present there are over 200 Cuban military
advisors in Angola who are offering strategic assistance to the
government army in its fighting against the forces of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"These are sheer fabrications to play down the series of
victories recently achieved by the government forces in the battle
field. Besides, they are carried out in order to find excuses for
(Jonas) Savimbi to seek for foreign intervention," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the southern African country gained independence in 1975,
Cuba deployed a large number of troops to support the Angolan
government in its civil war, with the highest being 50,000 in
1988.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel UNITA movement got the support of South
African army and obtained large sums of financial and military aid
from Western countries in the excuse of Communist threat.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Cuban army completely withdrew from the country.
</P>
<P>
Jota admitted that there are many Cubans now in Angola, adding
that they are experts in health, education, catering industry,
trade and other sectors and their activities "have always been
public".
</P>
<P>
"There are Cubans in Angola just like they are in the U.S.,
Portugal and other cities in the world, only that the Cubans here
provide no service for the armed forces," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims No Party Behind Political Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian judicial
official claimed on Wednesday those involved in the recent
political murders have no links with any political faction or
party in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Niazi, the prosecutor of the military court in charge
of the political murders, told the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) that the accused in the case might have various political
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
"But the investigations indicate they are not affiliated to
any political group or wing in the country," he said amid rampant
rumors that two rival political factions in the country are
cooling down their quarrels over the killings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the conservative-dominated Intelligence
Ministry conceded some of its own agents were involved in the
killings of an opposition leader, his wife and three dissident
writers.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the powerful conservatives, who dominate the
country's main organs, claimed the killers were convinced
supporters from the left-wing of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The rival factions ran into such white-hot a wrangling that top
Iranian leaders stepped in to prevent further escalation of the
factional struggles in the country.
</P>
<P>
Both the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani have urged parties to stop their
quarrels.
</P>
<P>
Niazi stressed the elements of the Intelligence Ministry
involved in the serial killings had acted independently and with
no knowledge of the top brass in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested have not claimed to have acted upon a
religious decree in carrying out the murders, he said, adding
that with vast authorities for the supreme leader, no one can
issue a decree outside of the judicial system, law and Sharia,
or religious law.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said Khatami and the special committee in charge of
investigating the murders both agreed to send the case to the
military court, which deals with "all cases involving special
administrative crimes or carrying confidential military
information."
</P>
<P>
He said 10 people were originally arrested in connection with
the murders but some have turned out to be innocent and thus were
released.
</P>
<P>
The accused are not exclusively from the Intelligence
Ministry, the official said. He declined to reveal details about
the arrested.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said the trial will be public unless the judge decides
that being so it will damage the national security.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official did not rule out involvement of
foreign agents in the murders, saying "some elements
outside of the Information (Intelligence) Ministry have been
identified and measures have been taken to investigate their
possible links to abroad."
</P>
<P>
The investigations revealed the murders were well
planned and executed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Revenue Collection Above Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has collected taxes amounting to 272.5 billion Shillings (about
400 million U.S. Dollars) between July and November last year,
surpassing the target by 10.5 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, income tax accounted for 66.9 billion Shillings,
2.8 billion more than the target, media reports Wednesday quoted
Minister of Finance Daniel Yona as saying.
</P>
<P>
The customs and excise taxes comprised 100.1 billion Shillings,
well above the target of 93.7 billion Shillings, he said in Dar es
Salaam last weekend.
</P>
<P>
On the value added tax (VAT) which was introduced on July 1
last year, the minister said 105.3 billion Shillings were
collected from this sector, which is above the target of 104.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam took the lead in revenue collection with 211.3
billion Shillings, followed by Arusha Region, northern Tanzania,
16.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Urge PNA to Delay Declaration of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is likely
to call on Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat not to declare a Palestinian state until the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The call might come in early March following a summit of EU's
15 member nations scheduled in late February, Israel Radio
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel's parliament decided early this month to advance
elections to May 17 this year from late 2000, Arafat has been
brought under mounting pressure to put off a declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on several occasions repeated his pledge to declare a
Palestinian state on May 4, when the five-year interim period set
by the Oslo accords expires, with or without an agreement on the
part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt, the U.S. and the EU recently tried to convince
Arafat that it is in the interest of the Palestinians not to
declare a statehood on that date.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that such a unilateral declaration will
help boost the election campaign of hard-line Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who staunchly opposes Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the dovish opposition Labor Party have also called
on Arafat to postpone his declaration.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz said earlier this week that Arafat is
ready to delay the announcement until December 31 if Washington
backs the new date.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited sources close to Arafat as saying the December
31 date is symbolic because it will usher in a new millennium with
the declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Also, since many dignitaries from all over the world are
expected to come to the Palestinian town of Bethlehem, the
birth-place of Jesus, to greet the new millennium, Arafat
believes the timing will be appropriate, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat also knows that a postponement on statehood
declaration can serve as a double-edged sword since Netanyahu is
likely to tout such a move as proof of his tough position, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether Arafat will postpone the
declaration if he fails to win the U.S. support for the new date.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington in March or April to discuss the troubled peace
process. The Palestinian statehood is expected to be one of the
major topics.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was once more derailed in early December
after Israel suspended the implementation of the latest
U.S.-brokered Palestinian-Israeli peace deal signed in Washington
last October.

<P>
GENEVA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi
is in the lead of the four candidates running for the new chief of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), said WTO spokesman Keith
Rockwell here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 133 members of the WTO, 40 delegations stated that their
first preference was Supachai, he said. Morocco's Hassan Abuyoub
is in the second with support from 23 delegations. 15 delegations
support Canada's Roy MacLaren and 13 delegations support New
Zealand's Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
There are still dozens of members which have not yet made their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rockwell told reporters that the United States would
possibly make an announcement in 24 hours if it would recommend a
fifth candidate.
</P>
<P>
The General Council is scheduled to meet on January 26 to go on
with the process of selecting the new WTO director-general.
</P>
<P>
WTO members have missed several deadlines for reaching
consensus in choosing their new leader.
</P>
<P>
Current WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has said that he
will not run for the position again when his term expires on April
30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A large majority of the members hold that the new WTO chief
should be selected by consensus, saying that recourse to a vote,
whether a straw ballot or a final election vote, must be ruled
out.

ATHENS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The state telecoms of seven
southeast European countries signed here Wednesday an agreement
for the construction and maintenance of a Black Sea undersea fibre
optics telecommunications system linking their countries.
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed by representatives of the
telecommunications organizations of Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus,
Greece, Russia, Slovenia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated to reach 51 million

Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE), which adopted the
scheme as a strategic target in 1994 when it signed notes of
intention with Cyprus, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-kilometer system is expected to take 16 months to
construct.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Transport and Communications Minister Tassos Mantelis

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Reaffirms Adherence to Nonproliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia "firmly stands for the
observation of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,"
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the principled stance which we follow in our relations
with all countries, including in our relations with Iran," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The comment came after the United States imposed sanctions on
three Russian institutes for allegedly providing nuclear and
missile weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone should have any questions about Russian-Iranian
cooperation in certain spheres we are ready to discuss them
constructively and provide explanations where any doubts may
arise," Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the spirit in which this matter was discussed during
his Wednesday talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, in
Moscow, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia supports all initiatives on the creation of zones free
of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia "is interested in the establishment of lasting peace in
the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Wednesday, the Russian State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly endorsed a statement
calling President Boris Yeltsin and the government to come up with
measures to counter the U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that checks have confirmed that the three
institutions had not violated the international rules for the
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles for
their delivery.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is rigorously observing international standards in this
sphere of activity, and it is not going to give in to the dictates
of outside countries concerning the development of its cooperation
with its partners," the document said.

<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom on Wednesday
again refused Argentina over the sovereignty of Falklands, saying
that there could be no talks on sovereignty over the disputed
South Atlantic islands.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Ministry officials said Argentine Foreign
Minister Guido Di Tella had raised the question of the Falklands
in his one-hour-long talks with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in
London.
</P>
<P>
"The matter of sovereignty was raised, (but our) Foreign
Secretary made it very clear our well-known position on
sovereignty, that it is just not negotiable," a Foreign Office
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday's talks are just a routine one held in a
"very friendly mood".
</P>
<P>
Britain and Argentina restored diplomatic relations in 1990
after a brief war in 1982 over the islands, which Argentina calls
the Malvinas and claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Argentine President Carlos Menem paid a state visit
to Britain. Britain lifted its arms embargo on Argentina after the
visit.

Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, is scheduled to

<HEADLINE> Dolly's Creator Set to Clone Human Embryo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The scientist who helped create
Dolly the cloned sheep is preparing to move into making human
embryo clones for therapeutic research, according to a BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ian Wilmut, from the Roslin Institute in Scotland who
created Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an adult animal cell,
is in negotiations with U.S. company Geron Corporation to fund a
research team, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
The embryo project may begin within weeks. The idea is to use
the nuclear transfer technology pioneered at the Roslin Institute
to create embryo clones for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
"I personally would be prepared to do that (human embryo
cloning) because these are frightening diseases." Dr Wilmut has
told BBC One's Newsnight program.
</P>
<P>
The development comes after significant encouragement was given
to British scientists in last December to produce human embryo
clones for medical research.
</P>
<P>
Experts from two high-powered committees urged British
government to change the law so that the work could go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The embryos would not be allowed to develop into foetuses, but
could help research into disorders such as Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's Disease, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> UK University Develops Pioneering Explosive Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the University of
Leeds in northern England said Wednesday that they had developed a
new explosive detector which could soon revolutionize air safety
and anti-terrorism measures worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It "can detect the equivalent of a pinhead of explosive
material in Wembley stadium, while the current techniques would
struggle to find it inside a squash court." the university said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The pioneering apparatus is also said to be cheaper and
thousands of times more powerful than anything currently
available.
</P>
<P>
The equipment uses the principle that every material vibrates
at a unique frequency. The distinctive vibration of different
types of explosive can be picked out using beams of laser light.
</P>
<P>
Its extreme sensitivity allows even a single molecule of
explosive to be detected under favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
The suitcase-sized instrument identifies the tell-tale traces
of vapour given off by the hidden cargo and can also be used to
check large freight containers, which are often inaccessible to
most sniffer dogs and impossible to X-ray.
</P>
<P>
"As well as being extremely reliable, the test is completely
non-destructive so the evidence could be stored and re-examined
whenever necessary," said Dr Webster, one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Field trials of the prototype machine will take place in the
Summer. If all goes well the device could be available in air and
seaports in a few years.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges Burundians to Speed up Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) - The international mediator
Julius Nyerere Wednesday urged the warring factions in Burundi to
reach a quick solution to the conflicts in order to earn an
immediate humanitarian aid by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The expedient arrival of such help will depend on how quick
the parties in negotiation reach an agreement," Nyerere, former
Tanzanian president, told the delegates of all factions who are in
their fourth round of peace talks in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, quoted by sources from Arusha, said that two meetings
have been held, one in Canada in 1997 and one in the United States
this month, on aiding the war-torn Burundi once a long-lasting
peace is realized.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere warned Monday at the starting of this round of talks
that parties taking part in the talks should not prolong the talks
simply for having more rounds.
</P>
<P>
According to a time frame given to the donors, Nyerere
suggested that while the current round to end on January 31, the
fifth is planned for April and the sixth for June to conclude the
negotiations which started last June.
</P>
<P>
"Others would say we want to have Arusha seven, Arusha eight
and so forth. Then we will end the century without giving the
people of Burundi the real hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Nyerere said significant progress has been achieved
 during the three rounds of talks and that he will suggest to the
regional leaders a debate on lifting the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Eight heads of state from the Great Lakes region are expected
to meet in Arusha Saturday to discuss mediation progress on the
Burundi conflict, and sources said big decisions, including
lifting or easing of sanctions, might be announced.
</P>
<P>
Those expected to attend are the presidents of Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions were imposed on July 31, 1996, a week
after Pierre Buyoya seized power in a bloodless military coup
which toppled an ethnic Hutu president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. White House Attacks Perjury Charge in Senate Trial </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. White House special
counsel Gregory Craig Wednesday attacked the impeachment article
accusing President Bill Clinton of perjury, asking senators to
take the time to read his grand jury testimony and "see the
president is truthful."
</P>
<P>
Opening a second day of arguments in the impeachment trial
against Clinton in the Senate, Craig told the impeachment trial he
had come "to tell you how really bad this article is, legally,
structurally and constitutionally."
</P>
<P>
Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly lumped charges
together -- he denounced it as "dubious prosecutorial practice" --
and failed to identify any specific statement Clinton made before
the grand jury that was false.
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening thing about article one, it alleges
perjury generally but it does not allege a single perjurious
statement singly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Craig said Clinton's vindication could be found in the grand
jury transcript, and he encouraged senators to read it carefully.
</P>
<P>
"You will see this president make painful, difficult
admissions," he said. "You will see that the president is truthful
and after reading, seeing, hearing and studying the evidence for
yourself... we believe you will conclude that what the president
did and said in the grand jury was not unlawful and that you must
not remove him from office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a team of 13 House prosecutors spent three days
making the case that Clinton is no longer fit to hold the
presidency and must be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in
two articles of impeachment approved on December 19 last year by
the House along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
He is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected to a
trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators must

<HEADLINE> Former General Joins Labor Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Matan Vilnai, former deputy
chief of general staff of the Israeli military, Wednesday
announced his joining of the opposition Labor Party ahead of the
May elections.
</P>
<P>
Vilnai, a childhood friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he chosed to join the Labor because of its right
policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the achievements made by former Labor prime ministers
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres have proved that the Labor can
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Graduated from Harvard University of the United States, Vilnai
was named as brigadier-general at the age of 34 and had been an
army star.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Vilnai left the army in a rage, after Shaul Mofaz,
who has close ties with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, was
chosen as the chief of general staff instead of him. Since then he
has been trying to enter into politics.
</P>
<P>
In a country where the national security is the No. 1 issue,
Vilnai has been seen as an political asset by all the parties.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has also made efforts to bring Vilnai to the ruling
Likud Party, but Vilnai did not accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
In a related development on Tuesday, Labor Knesset
(parliament) member Amir Peretz, who heads the Labor Union of
Israel, announced that he was quitting the Labor Party to
establish a new party named "One Nation."

<HEADLINE> Feature: UNICEF Uses Camel Caravans in Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- For the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), reaching the world's remote population
is a crucial step in its global immunization campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, the campaign meets with untold difficulties in Africa.
For instance, few places are as inhospitable as Djibouti, in the
horn of Africa. Mainly desert and mountains, temperatures there
can reach more than 50 degrees Celsius in summer.
</P>
<P>
In desert and mountainous areas, this is the end of the road as
far as modern transport is concerned. So something different is
needed.
</P>
<P>
Camels, used for thousands of years by desert travellers, are
the perfect choices. The animal is the only form of transport
completely adapted to the climate and terrain in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
It is indispensable for the mobile immunization teams, said
Aden Dilletya, UNICEF's program officer.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to deal with areas that are inaccessible by
vehicles, and reach populations which have fled into mountains to
flee the civil war," he said, "The only way we have to reach these
people is by using camels."
</P>
<P>
In 1980, only five percent of infants in the developing
countries were immunized. Today the rates have jumped to 80
percent. The task now is to reach the remaining 20 percent, most
live in isolated areas, UNICEF officials said here.
</P>
<P>
The expendition's first major challenge is the heat. Vaccines
need to be stored at temperatures between zero and eight degrees
Celsius. The only way to keep them cool is to put them in fridges
linked to solar panels, and strap the whole rig onto the camel.
</P>
<P>
The camel caravan's journey is long and arduous. Armed bands
still roam these parts. Finding the nomads is never easy. Days
before, local runners had been sent out to notify the nomad camps
to expect the immunization team.
</P>
<P>
When the nomads are finally located, the team sets to work
vaccinating and administering other life-saving health supplies.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the major childhood killers -- diphtheria,
tetanus, whooping cough, polio and measles -- killed large numbers
of these hard to reach populations. The mortality rate for
children under five in Djibouti is high, at 157 deaths per 1,000
live births.
</P>
<P>
The nomads appreciate this service -- many say they would
rather die than live in the cities where such health services are
easier to obtain.
</P>
<P>
The camel caravan moves on in search of another camp. For the
nomads, these familiar animals and their precious cargo are a
lifetime, helping to preserve their ancient way of life by saving
the lives of their children.
</P>
<P>
The resort was prepared by Patricia Chan for the United
Nations, UNICEF officials added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Liberal Democrat
leader Paddy Ashdown announced on Wednesday he will step down from
the current post after elections to the European Parliament later
this year.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement to a meeting of Liberal Democrat MPs
at Westminster, saying he had now done all the things he had set
out to do for the party, the third largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter which he read to them, he said: "Though I love
being an MP, I don't want still to be one at 65.
</P>
<P>
"And that means not standing at the next election when I shall
be 60."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair praised Ashdown as "one of the
outstanding party leaders of his generation."
</P>
<P>
Ashdown's decision comes less than a week after stronger
cooperation was announced between Labor and the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman stressed that the links - a subject
of much personal criticism directed at Ashdown -- were "not
dependent upon personalities" but on the desire for "a more mature
and modern politics".
</P>
<P>
Ashdown said announcing his plan now would let the process to
elect a successor go ahead in an orderly fashion, rather than the
usual "uncomfortable mixture of haste and surprise" that
accompanied such events.
</P>
<P>
Ashdown added: "This has not been an easy decision to make. I
would not, for anything, have missed the privilege of leading the
Liberal Democrats for the past decade or so."
</P>
<P>
Ashdown was elected leader of the Liberal Democrats in July
1988, and was appointed as a privy councillor in the following
year.

</P>
<P>
Opening a second day of arguments in the impeachment trial
against Clinton in the Senate, Craig told the impeachment trial he
had come "to tell you how really bad this article is, legally
structurally and constitutionally."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly lumped charges
together -- he denounced it as "dubious prosecutorial practice" --
and failed to identify any specific statement Clinton made before
the grand jury that was false.
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening thing about article one, it alleges

yourself... we believe you will conclude that what the president
did and said in the grand jury was not unlawful and that you must
not remove him from office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Craig accused House prosecutors of trying "to twist the scope"
of the perjury case to include allegations that Clinton had
wrongly denied under oath his relationship with Lewinsky in the
Paula Jones case even though the House rejected that charge in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
Craig also assailed the prosecutors' assertion that Clinton had
lied when he testified before the grand jury that "I wasn't paying
a great deal of attention" during his earlier testimony in the
Jones case and also believed at that time that he could give
unhelpful but still truthful testimony about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills will follow Craig to
argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to the Senate Tuesday, White House
counsel Charles Ruff offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the
House prosecution's case. Clinton, he said, did not lie under oath
and did not try to obstruct Jones' case by trying to keep Lewinsky
from testifying.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend the president on the facts and on the law and
on the constitutional principles that must guide your
deliberations," Ruff declared.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a team of 13 House prosecutors spent three days

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Tries to Create Jobs by Building Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African cabinet
Wednesday ratified a presidential project that will bring
thousands of new jobs by building between 50,000 and 150,000
houses, Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi- Mahanyele said.
</P>
<P>
One permanent and three temporary jobs would be created for
every house built, Mahanyele told reporters after the cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of any housing project, in turn, stimulates
the creation of jobs in other related fields," she said.
</P>
<P>
The program, dubbed the National President Lead Project on
Housing, was adopted by the government, business and labor at a
job summit in Midrand, Gauteng Province, in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Mahanyele said that the project aims to produce a minimum of
50,000 and maximum of 150,000 houses, using different delivery
methods and promoting labor-intensive construction methods.
</P>
<P>
A national agency would manage the project and detailed plans
to put it into action would be completed by the end of February,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Construction would start in the first half of this year, and
was expected to be completed by December 2001.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Pull out of Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Namibia said Wednesday
that it wanted to disengage from the ongoing war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), South African Broadcasting Corporation
(SABC) television reported.
</P>
<P>
This was made clear by Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob,
who said his country needed the money spent on the war for
development and poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
To date, Namibia's support for Congolese President Laurent
Kabila has cost the country 10 million U.S. Dollars and has tied
up more than 2,000 soldiers, a quarter of its defense force, SABC
said.
</P>
<P>
Ten Namibian soldiers have been killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
Last week, five countries involved in the Congo conflict
drafted a cease- fire agreement in Windhoek, which has yet to be
ratified.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Announces Radical Shake-Up of Lords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government
officially announced the most radical reform of the House of Lords
this century Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Leader of the Lords, Baroness Jay, introduced the Lords
Reform Bill, or the White Paper, in the parliament which signaled
the end of over 600 years of history as the government moves to
honor its manifesto commitment to banish hereditary peers from
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a packed house, she said, "This white paper marks
another significant step in the government's attempts to reform
the constitution."
</P>
<P>
She added that the proposals would ensure a "modern parliament
for a modern Britain."
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals as many as 759 hereditary peers could leave
the Lords before the next general election although the government
is minded to leave around 90 hereditaries in their place during
the initial stages of reform.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same time in the Commons, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said, "It was a clear commitment in our manifesto to get rid
of the hereditary peers -- and that is what we will do."
</P>
<P>
Banishing hereditary peers is just stage one of government
plans to reform the upper house of the UK parliament.
</P>
<P>
A Royal Commission is being set up under former Tory Cabinet
Minister Lord Wakeham to examine proposals for a fully-reformed
second chamber.
</P>
<P>
The commission will report by 31 December 1999. In between the
removal of the hereditaries and the second stage of reform, there
will be an interim house.
</P>
<P>
Further proposals outlined by Lady Jay will see the public able
to nominate "people's peers."
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to counter Conservative Party accusations
that the upper chamber will come to be filled with the prime
minister's appointees, mockingly known as "Tony's cronies."
</P>
<P>
A seven-member Appointments Commission would initially consider
the "special qualities" of up to 20 publicly-nominated peers to
see what they "could bring to the law-making process."

<HEADLINE> Iran's Caviar Exports on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's caviar exports have been
on decline in recent years due to a government policy to cut
sturgeon fishing to save the species from possible extinction,an
Iranian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khodakaram Jalai, Managing Director of Iran's Fisheries
Organization , said Iran exported 111 tonnes of caviar in the first
three quarters of the current Iranian calendar year ending March
20, earning 29.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jalai said the country earned 34 million dollars from caviar
export last Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
But Iran's sea creatures export receipts in the first three
quarters of the current Iranian year amounted to 40.8 million
dollars, a rise of 11 percent compared with the same period last
Iranian year, the director said.
</P>
<P>
He added Iran's fish output will reach 1 million tonnes by
the end of the third five-year development plan in 2004 from the
current 400,000 tonnes, with an income of 400 million dollars and
150,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said production of caviar bearing fishes
fell by one third after the collapse of the former Soviet Union in
1990, bringing the total annual output in the five Caspian states
down to 1400 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian littoral states comprise Iran, Russia,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.

WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will visit London and Paris Thursday and Friday
next week for talks on Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also visit Russia and the Middle East, starting

Asked if this meant the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

<P>
The United States wants Belgrade to reverse a decision to expel
William Walker, the U.S. head of a monitoring group in Kosovo, and
allow an investigation into the death of 45 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"The response of President (Slobodan) Milosevic is not
acceptable," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Belgrade announced it would allow Walker to stay
longer in Yugoslavia.

NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people were killed in
southern Burundi during an attack by unidentified gunmen, the
state-owned Burundi Press Agency (ABP) said Wednesday.

<P>
The gunmen opened fire on people in two villages, Mabanda and

<HEADLINE> Romania, Greece Vow to Change Image of Balkan Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, 20 January (Xinhua) -- Romania and Greece believe
that they have the task, just like other countries in the region,
to change the international image of the Balkan region, where a
wholesome cooperation too, has to be possible, instead of an
endless train of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu and his visiting Greek
counterpart Theodor Pangalos expressed their belief on Wednesday
in a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Greece considers that this orientation may be supported also by
an intensified collaboration in the Black Sea region and in
south-eastern Europe, stated the Greek Foreign Minister, adding
that Greece will support the European and Euro-Atlantic
orientation of Romania, targets that concur also with its own
strategic interest. Pangalos encouraged Romania to concentrate on
the performance required in order to remain a consequential
candidate in the race for adhesion to the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Greece advocates more flexible negotiations and the elimination
of a false competition among the candidate countries, the Romanian
Foreign Minister said. Pangalos reiterated Greece's specific
support for Romania to get the OSCE presidency in 2001, one of the
country's main diplomatic goals in the current year, Andrei Plesu
added.
</P>
<P>
The Greek party hopes that the bilateral economic exchanges,
that develop at a very high rate, should reach half a billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, said Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Minister arrived in Bucharest Tuesday evening
on an two-day official visit. On Wednesday, he held talks with the
Romanian head of diplomacy about European integration, NATO's
enlargement as well as about bilateral relations and regional
cooperation. Pangalos was received on the same day by Romania's
President Emil Constantinescu, Prime Minister Radu Vasile and
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Ion Diaconescu.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Prefers Some Presence in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council, Celso Amorim of Brazil, told reporters
Wednesday that the Security Council members prefer some U.N.
presence in Angola, where fierce fighting is going on.
</P>
<P>
"We think there should be some sort of the U.N. presence" in
the southwest African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement after the Security Council met
behind closed doors to discuss a report by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who recommended the world body withdraw its
peacekeepers from Angola due to the worsening security situation
and the non-cooperation from the nation's warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will convene a meeting of experts to
ponder over the latest developments in Angola and the role the
United Nations is going to play in the nation's peace process,
Amorim said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a new (U.N.) representative" in Angola, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told Xinhua
that Annan planned to appoint one from the U.N. Secretariat here
his new special representative in Angola to replace the present
one, Issa Diallo.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, the Security Council was briefed by
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet and
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira
de Mello, Amorim said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council is scheduled to meet Thursday to
resume the discussion on the current situation in Angola, he
added.

ADDIS ABABA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Investment
Office announced Wednesday that 152 projects with a total
investment capital of around 8.3 billion U.S. Dollars have so far
been approved in the country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is made by general manager of the office

the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
and International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) aimed at capacity
building and preparation of an investment guild for Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, Tadesse said that the number of foreign investment
approved in the country to date is still low.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this low record of foreign investment is
achieved despite the availability of generous incentives for
private investors and the enabling investment climate created by
the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
He said that a liberalized investment code has been enacted and
marco- economic stability achieved, adding that enormous
investment potentials and opportunities are also available in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said the UNCTAD in cooperation with the ICC has planned
to prepare investment guild containing information on the
investment climate and opportunity of least developed countries
including Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of the investment guild is envisaged to be
undertaken in consecutive phases and Ethiopia, Bangladesh,
Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda have been selected for the
preparation of the guild line during the first phase, according to
Tadesse.

<HEADLINE> Cohen says NATO Credibility on the line in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Wednesday the credibility of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was on the line in its dispute
with Belgrade over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Pentagon, Cohen said any
alliance military action would be aimed at reducing Yugoslavia's
ability to threaten the region.
</P>
<P>
"I believe NATO credibility remains on the line." Cohen said,
noting that a NATO order authorizing military action has been in
effect since October 1998 when air strikes were narrowly averted
after a last-ditch agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Cohen claimed that Milosevic had violated that agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear NATO has the ability not just to threaten
air strikes but to carry them out. The ACTORD (activation order)
remains in effect and we are prepared to execute that if that is
the will of the NATO membership." he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in October NATO had been ready to mount "a phased
campaign designed to reduce the ability of Milosevic's forces to
threaten those in the region itself."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I do not want to speculate at this point on which
targets would be involved should any action be taken (now), but it
would obviously be NATO's decision to reduce his ability to pose
that kind of threat to the region."
</P>
<P>
Cohen reiterated that NATO, while backing the cause of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority for autonomy within Yugoslavia, did not
support the Albanian majority's call for independence.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO must avoid becoming "the air force for the UCK,"
the pro-independence guerrilla force.

<HEADLINE> EU Economic Growth to Be Lower: Annual Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's executive
branch, the European Commission, said in its 1999 annual economic
report that the financial crises and risks hanging over the world
economy are affecting economic activity in the EU.
</P>
<P>
This is likely sending the output growth in 1999 to a lower
level than the 2.4 percent predicted last autumn, it said.
</P>
<P>
EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs
Yves-Thibault de Silguy said at a press conference here Wednesday
that things will not be quite well in 1999 since international
financial crises have been affecting Europe. "It's a spillover
effect all over the world, not only in Asia and Russia but also in
Brazil."
</P>
<P>
"Europe in its turn has been affected because the world trade
is slowing down, and exchange rates of European currencies
appreciated in 1998 while export growth and industrial output have
also slowed down."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "indicators of industrial confidence last November
are not quite so good, though confidence of consumers is holding
up at a quite high level. Therefore, the economic prospects are
not so good as compared with that of last autumn," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission's forecasts predicted a growth deceleration to
2.4 percent in the EU in 1999. However, the report said, there is
now evidence that the deterioration in corporate confidence has
been large enough to potentially scale down investment projects
and to trigger downward adjustments of inventories. "It is
therefore likely that a downward revision will be necessary in the
next forecast in the spring."
</P>
<P>
De Silguy also said the report presents the commission's
analysis of the current economic situation in the EU and examines
the main challenges for the future.
</P>
<P>
Although overall economic activity is largely unfolded as
expected, the report said, short-term economic prospects in the
European Union have become less promising during 1998. "Since the
underlying economic fundamentals are sound in the EU, prospects
until some months ago augured well for a successful transformation
of the recovery into a sustained, non-inflationary,
employment-creating growth process over the medium term."
</P>
<P>
"The financial crises and risks, which continue to hang over
the world economy, have started to affect economic activity in the
union and are jeopardizing this transformation process. Indeed,
the adverse external shock comes at an unfortunate moment since
domestic demand has not yet fully taken over from exports as the
major engine of the cyclical revival," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The annual report was adopted by the commission at the
initiative of De Silguy in a bid to create a proper economic
debate on the policy options for the 1999 broad economic policy
guidelines, which will be finally adopted by the European Council,
the EU's policy-making body, in June.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that we have this in place and this is
the first step in the whole process that is going to lead to the
big debate on economic policy, which is of essential importance to
the future of economic and monetary union of the European Union,"
the commissioner said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has retaken the port in Sierra Leonean capital
Freetown from rebels, reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces took
control of the port area Kissy in east Freetown Tuesday after
heavy fighting with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel
forces.
</P>
<P>
Scores of dead bodies littered the area after the fighting,
reports said, adding that some bodies, remnants of earlier
fighting, were also seen in the area.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops had Monday taken the main ferry terminal linking
Freetown to a neighboring peninsula, where the Lungi International
Airport is located.
</P>
<P>
The terminal is now used by ECOMOG to ferry across arms and
ammunition, along with humanitarian supplies, a spokesman for the
ECOMOG said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources also said that the peace-keeping force would
forge ahead with its offensive Wednesday, with the aim of taking
Hastings and Waterloo towns to the southeast of Freetown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Jumps to 11-Year High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce
Department said on Wednesday that housing construction rose to
11-year highs in December as well as in all of 1998, propelled by
record home sales.
</P>
<P>
It said housing starts on new units at a seasonally adjusted
1.72 million units last month, the most since March 1987.
</P>
<P>
Unseasonably warm weather during the early part of December
helped boost housing starts, particularly in the Midwest, where
they soared 25 percent to a seasonally adjusted 414,000, the most
in nearly 12 years.
</P>
<P>
But,it said, the key factors of the rise are the fundamental
economic conditions -- plentiful employment,rising income and low
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1998, builders began work on 1.62 million units, up
9.6 percent from 1997 and the most since 1987.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, however, housing was supported by mortgage rates
holding below 7 percent for much of the year, the lowest sustained
level since the 1960s, and by an average unemployment rate at a
29-year low of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, record stock-market levels helped some home buyers with
down payments, particularly for trade-up and vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
Regionally in 1998, starts increased 10.5 percent in the South
to 741,000, 9.2 percent in the Midwest to 331,000, 8.6 percent in
the Northeast to 149,000 and, in the West, also 8.6 percent, to
395,000.
</P>
<P>
Starts of single-family homes rose 12 percent to 1.27 million
and starts of apartments increased 1.7 percent to 346,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 more Congolese have
fled to the Central African Republic as the war blaze spread to
the two countries' common borders.
</P>
<P>
According to a news letter by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) available here Wednesday, the refugees claimed
they left the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) because of  the
menace of rebel advances.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion also expelled almost 3,000 refugees into Uganda
in early December, said the UNHCR news letter. By December 29, a
total of 857 refugees had been transferred to a camp in Kyangwali.
</P>
<P>
However, local authorities reportedly forced 2,000 Congolese
back to Congo (K) at the beginning of this month, while some
scattered inside Uganda to avoid being repatriated again.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has protested against the Ugandan action, saying it is
concerned with little information about the expelled refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR also announced it has decided to reestablish a U.N.
office in Congo (K) under some specific conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Spend More Money on Missile Defense Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States planned to
spend an additional 6.6 billion U.S. dollars on a National Missile
Defense (NMD) program to counter a growing threat, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are affirming that there is a growing threat and that it
will pose a danger not only to our troops overseas but also to
Americans here at home," Cohen said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He cited Taepo-Dong I missile tested by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on August 31, 1998, as a strong indicator
that the United States faced a "rogue nation missile threat".
</P>
<P>
Deployment of the NMD system would require amendment of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty negotiated with Russia, Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
"While our NMD development program is being conducted
consistent with the terms of the ABM treaty, our deployment may
require modifications to the treaty and the administration is
working to determine the nature and scope of these modifications,"
Cohen added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Wednesday called upon all Afghan warring factions
to stop fighting without delay.

cease-fire and resume negotiations with the aim of creating a
broad based and fully representative government.
</P>
<P>
The council urged all Afghan groups, in particular, the
Taliban, to put an end to discrimination against girls and women

<HEADLINE> Nestle Group Sales Up 2.4 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss-based food giant,
Nestle Group, consolidated its sales in 1998 with a total 71.7
billion Swiss francs (52 billion U.S. dollars), up 2.4 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The group saw the gain in sales despite a 5.6 percent negative
impact due to the changing exchange rates of most foreign
currencies against the Swiss franc, said the Nestle Group here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company regarded the growth as "satisfactory" considering
the "difficult economic environment". In 1997, a positive
variation of exchange rates contributed 8.1 percent to the
increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide food group said that sales prices increased by
1.8 percent in spite of the prevailing economic difficulties in
1998, while acquisitions, net of disinvestment, contributed 2.9
percent to the increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
Although real internal growth reached 3.3 percent for the full
year, a slight rise against the 3.2 percent in 1997, the
ambitious target of four percent which the group had set for i
tself was not met.
</P>
<P>
Nestle's full results for 1998 and its dividend proposal are
expected to be released on March 26, following the meeting of the
board of directors a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> New SAARC Chief on Challenges in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- In the new millennium, the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) needs to
respond to global changes as well as to focus on regional
cooperation, new SAARC Secretary-General Nihal Rodrigo said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These are basically the two important things SAARC has to deal
with in the new century, the secretary-general, whose tenure will
last into the next century, told Xinhua in an interview at the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a regional group, SAARC has to see how the
global changes are going to affect the region while focusing on
regional cooperation particularly in economic and trade matters.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new millennium, the trend is toward
globalization, but much more regional integration will also take
place.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for SAARC to be able to understand this
development and to get the best possible deal for the members of
the South Asian community," said Rodrigo, who began his three-year
term on January 1.
</P>
<P>
SAARC comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka was formed in December 1985 to
promote economic and social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) went into operation, under which three rounds of trade
negotiations have been concluded, offering more than 5,700
commodities for preferential treatment in the SAARC member states.
</P>
<P>
"The movement has been a little bit slow," Rodrigo said. "At
the moment, the intra-SAARC trade is very poor."
</P>
<P>
The intra-SAARC trade accounts for about 5 percent of the
region's total foreign trade, the Sri Lankan diplomat noted.
</P>
<P>
But it is not possible for a regional organization to advance
very much in 13 years, he said, adding that it took a very long
time for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the
European Union to reach where they are now.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that all that work has accumulated and it has
built up the momentum which can be developed for the future as
well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "free trade is something that is not that
easy to achieve" given the particular situation in the South Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the region has a very large economy, namely India, and
a number of other economies of different sizes and different
orientations.
</P>
<P>
At their ninth summit in May 1997 in Male, the Maldives, SAARC
leaders preferred to set up a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)
by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
At the following summit held in July 1998 in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, the leaders decided to draft a comprehensive treaty regime
by 2001 for creating SAFTA, which will decide on how to push
forward the process.
</P>
<P>
But an actual free trade zone will take a little longer to be
established because each country has its own problems, the
secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that we'll have one date for all countries," he
said. "Smaller economies will need a little more time and big
economies perhaps will make their trade open much earlier."
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in May
1998, he said that this is a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think that has really affected in a bad way the
process of regional cooperation in South Asia," he added. "It does
not prevent us from cooperating regionally."

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's surprise proposal to link the fate of
Social Security more closely to the stock market began to stir
doubts Wednesday about how his initiative would affect the U.S.
economy and prompted potent criticism from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
-- Key Senate Democrats said Wednesday they will try as early
as Monday to force a final up-or-down vote on the two articles of
impeachment against President Clinton, hoping to short-circuit a
trial that they say has already gone on too long.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration announced that it was inviting
Russia to begin negotiations to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to permit a limited national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is planning to push American allies for a
NATO ultimatum telling President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
that he must back down in Kosovo or face air strikes within days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Brazil's Congress passed a long stalled reform to the
nation's pension system, a key step for the country to regain
credibility in world markets. Stocks rose 4 percent before the
vote.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon, facing up to technical problems that have
plagued its missile-defense efforts, said it plans to delay the
likely deployment of a national antimissile system and to
restructure its two major battlefield antimissile programs.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen: Cambodia Needs Both Peace and Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen reiterated Thursday that both peace and justice must be
considered before taking any legal action against Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks in his aide-memoire sent to U.N
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"National reconciliation and peace are indispensable
requirement of the Cambodian nation and people, and the trial of
offenders to find justice for Cambodia are the goal and
obligation to be fulfilled," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
But "there must be due consideration before taking any action,
avoiding any action that would jeopardize national reconciliation
in Cambodia. We need both peace and justice", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's statement came after international calls for the
arrest and prosecutions of the Khmer Rouge leaders who defected
to the government including Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
</P>
<P>
The pair surrendered to the government last month and now live
in Pailin, a so-called autonomous region controlled by former
Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary who defected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen maintained that the Royal Government of Cambodia now
controlled all corners of the country and Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea had returned to the fold of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to whether the court should be international,
national or a combination, Hun Sen stressed that it had to look
into related causes and effects from the beginning of Khmer Rouge
rule to the end.
</P>
<P>
"If it is a mixed court, there must be legal provision
approved by the National Assembly, and joint training among
lawyers to guarantee the legal effectiveness. Should there be an
international court, it will be established by the United
Nations. Would the United Nations Security Council be able to
establish it?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
But Thomas Hammarberg, special representative of U.N.
Secretary General on Human Rights in Cambodia, said during his
twelfth visit to the country that the tribunal for Khmer Rouge
leaders should be set up at international level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen pointed out that "since instability or
peace is the vital issue for the Cambodian nation and people, the
National Assembly that represents the will of the people has an
important responsibility to decide what to do to reflect the
sovereignty of Cambodia and let Cambodians to decide their
destinies by themselves.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Plane Crashes in Upstate New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- United States Military
investigators are trying to determine what caused an Air Force
fighter jet to scream over the rooftops of homes in upstate New
York of the U.S. before crashing into a gigantic fireball.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the 8.8-million-U.S.-dollar A-10 ejected before
the jet crashed Wednesday night in a swampy area near Kasoag Lake,
about 50 kilometers north of Syracuse, said reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot suffered only minor cuts and bruises, said R.D.
Murphy, a spokesman for Fort Drum Army base.
</P>
<P>
About 20 homes near the crash site were evacuated because of
fuel from the crash, said Williamstown Fire Chief Chip Hamblin. No
one on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
The pilot had been on a training run at a Fort Drum gunnery
range, said Murphy.
</P>
<P>
The jet is the first Air Force plane designed specifically for
close air support of ground troops. The twin-engine plane was
based at Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts
State, Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Balgimbayev Re-elected Kazakh Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Nurlan Balgimbayev was
re-elected Kazakhstan's prime minister in a vote during a joint
session of the two chambers of parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marat Ospanov, chairman of the lower Mazhilis house announced
the results, saying, "One hundred and two voted for, one
abstained."
</P>
<P>
Newly re-elected President Nursultan Nazarbayev had proposed
earlier in the day that Balgimbayev remain in office as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Balgimbayev and his government resigned when Nazarbayev was
inaugurated as president on January 20, in accordance with the
constitution. Balgimbayev succeeded to the premiership in October
1997 after Akezhan Kazhegeldin.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev had reportedly indicated his wish to have
Balgimbayev and other major cabinet members reappointed prior to
the vote. He urged the lawmakers to make little government
changes, considering the strain on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Balgimbayev, 51, built up his career in the oil business and
has remained influential in the sector since he assumed the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is pinning its hopes for economic revival on
revitalizing its oil industry early next century with the big
capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
Balgimbayev has adopted a more cautious approach to the
privatization of resources-based industries than his predecessor
Kazhegeldin.

<P>
JINAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yantai Economic and
Technological Development Zone in east China's Shandong Province
reported stable operations for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The zone had a GDP of 3.1 billion yuan, 720 million yuan in
industrial output, and 630 million U.S. dollars worth of foreign
trade last year, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
It also had 60 million U.S. dollars worth of overseas
investment contracts, 253 million U.S. dollars worth of paid-in
overseas investment, 2.5 billion yuan in investment in fixed
assets, and 175 million yuan in revenues.
</P>
<P>
The zone was approved by the State Council in October of 1984
on a 36-sq.km. area. So far, construction work on 12 sq. km has
been completed at a cost of 11.4 billion yuan, 1.6 billion yuan
of that spent on infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reports 40% Cut in Troops in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday announced a
cut of over 40 percent in troop numbers in the country's
northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's Main Department
for International Defense Cooperation, said Russia no longer had
multi-purpose armies in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There are no divisions left in the Leningrad Military
District," he said. "The composition of the military group, its
purposes and the purpose of its training are merely defensive.
They do not pose a threat to our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The cut served as one of Russia's unilateral goodwill gestures
to foster "friendly relations" with neighboring countries,
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced support for the updating of the Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. "On the one hand, we should retain
the positive potential of this document. On the other, it needs
to be brought into line with the new military and political
realities in Europe," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose for updating the CFE Treaty should be
guaranteeing European security, taking NATO expansion eastward
into account, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The zonal limitations envisioned by the present treaty permit
uncontrolled transfers of arms among the NATO member states. An
updated treaty should replace these limitations with territorial
restrictions and preclude the creation of military groups in
Europe intended for surprise, large-scale offensives with the use
of conventional armaments," Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> Millions More Chinese Get Away From Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 million poor
people in the western part of China were able to get away from
poverty by the end of 1998, thanks to a national
poverty-elimination drive.
</P>
<P>
Over two million poor farmers in rural parts of the city of
Chongqing have escaped poverty since the city was upgraded to
municipality status, meaning that the number of poor rural people
in Chongqing went down to 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
A local government official attributed the reduction to help
from all parts of society. Industrial and commercial enterprises,
universities, and scientific research institutes formed 21
aid-the-poor groups to offer technical guidance and economic
assistance to 21 poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Guizhou Province, there was success in reducing
the number of poor people from 10 million in 1993 to 2.74
million. The number of poor counties is down from 48 to 11, but
the task of meeting the goal of eliminating poverty throughout
the province in the next two years is still difficult because
most poor people live in mountainous or remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shangluo area in the southern part of Shaanxi Province had
1.2 million poor people in 1985 and the local government has
allocated 126 million yuan and organized economic co-ops, br
inging the number of the needy in the region down to 160,000.

SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in
Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial city in east
China, said here today that the city will strive for a domestic
product growth two percentage points higher than the national
average to keep its status as one of the strongest local
economies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's vice mayor Chen Liangyu said the city government

revenues totaling 81.43 billion yuan last year, representing a
year-on-year increase of 11 percent. Within those figures,
revenues handed over to the local treasury amounted to 39.22
billion yuan, up 11.3 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said public spending in 1999 will concentrate on large
urban utility projects and sectors that would boost consumption,
investment and export.
</P>
<P>
He said the city will tighten auditing and supervision to
ensure the funding is used effectively and efficiently.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The first automatic car for
family use in China was launched today by the Sino-German joint
venture automotive manufacturer FAW-VW which is expected to
create a lot of interest.
</P>
<P>
The Jetta City Pioneer uses an automatic gearbox developed by
Volkswagen of Germany. This is the first mid-price level
automatic in China and the car is expected to cost 186,000 yuan,
about the same as similar family cars.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Tappe, vice-president of FAW-VW, said that the automatic
has been launched to meet increasing demands in the private car
market in China. He pointed out that Chinese consumers are now
looking for cars that are more comfortable and environmentally
friendly.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the Jetta City Pioneer has a brilliant future
in China market and expects the company to sell 20,000 automatic
Jettas every year.
</P>
<P>
FAW-VW Vice-President Zhou Yongjiang said that in face of
increasing competition in China's luxury car market, the company
is also developing a new Audi model. He said it will bring the
technology and quality of China's car industry to a new level.
</P>
<P>
FAW-VW is a joint venture between the First Automobile Works
(FAW) in northeast China and Volkswagen of Germany. It produced

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a
nationwide campaign against pornographic products and illicit
publications, in an effort to ensure a happy and healthy Lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that priority will be given to the crack
down on rampant smuggling activities as those activities have
become major channels for illicit audio and video products, and
politically incorrect and pornographic publications.
</P>

South China's Guangdong Province has now drawn up a plan of
action to smash the channels, improve the management of printing
factories and strengthen supervision on the domestic publication
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of January, police in Beijing confiscated
more than 20,000 pirated publications and over 80,000 compact
discs. In the meantime, police also publicized a series of hot

Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, however, emphasized that
people's supervision and media reports are crucial to the success

<HEADLINE> Primakov Urges Crackdown on Crime, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia cannot overcome its
current difficulties without intensifying the struggle against
crime and corruption, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
told a cabinet session on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The efforts should center on economic crimes "without playing
down the role of other manifestations," Interfax quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He called for special attention to tax evasion, a problem that
is "beginning to snowball," noting that offenders use legal
loopholes and any opportunity to circumvent the laws without
breaking them.
</P>
<P>
Primakov drew the State Property Ministry's attention to the
fact that accelerated bankruptcy procedures have resulted in "the
seizure of government property" in some cases.
</P>
<P>
He gave the Tax and Trade Ministries, the State Customs
Committee, and the State Property and Finance Ministries two
weeks to come up with ideas on how to fight schemes involving
lawful methods of circumventing the law within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Primakov suggested the formation of a special council under
the Arbitration Court to deal with economic crimes based on the
use of flaws in legislation. He said the council may bring
together officials from the Property and Tax Ministries.
</P>
<P>
He said the time for investigation should be reduced, str
essing that "the investigation cannot be procrastinated for
years, because this creates favorable conditions for the
criminals, who 'work' with witnesses and plaintiffs, urging them
to change their testimony."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet session approved a corruption-fighting program
for the next two years "to retain control over the criminal
situation in Russia," Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said.

<HEADLINE> Four Criminals Sentenced in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Four men convicted of drug
smuggling and theft on trains were today given prison sentences
ranging from five to 18 years by the official Railway Court in
Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiqiang, Yin Guomin and Wang Xiangdong were found
carrying heroin weighing 49.58 grams, 49.35 grams and 10.31 grams
in August, October and December last year and were jailed for
terms of 18, 13 and five years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Their sentences are light, compared to other similar cases
because they were quick to confess their crimes, according to
court officials.
</P>
<P>
In China, the death sentence is automatically handed down for
smuggling drugs weighing 50 grams or more.
</P>
<P>
Xu Simao, a peasant from Jiangsu Province, stole a suitcase
containing stamps and other valuables worth 43,000 yuan on the
Shanghai to Guangzhou train. After also being found guilty of
causing grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to 14 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally held here this afternoon, the court also
imposed fines on the four convicts from 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan
along with the stripping of their political rights.
</P>
<P>
Rail authorities said they hoped the sentencing would have a
deterrent effect on potential criminals, especially as the annual
rail transport peak for the Chinese lunar new year is imminent.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged those involved in ideological and publicity work to
sharpen their "political conscientiousness" and work diligently
to create a favorable social environment for reforms and opening

</P>

"This year carries special significance for our Party and our
country and we will have several major events to celebrate while
also having quite a number of tough issues to tackle," said
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of

</P>
<P>
Ideological and publicity activities must uphold the principle
of "playing up positive factors" to guide and influence public
opinion, Jiang told the national conference on publicity work.
</P>
<P>
"We should remain sober-minded towards negative factors and
not highlight them, nor let them interfere with the overall
strategies of our Party and government," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"We must take a clear and firm stand on matters relating to
political direction and principles and must not turn a blind eye
to wrong-doings" said Jiang. "Efforts must be made to guarantee
control on the publicity front and in the mainstream media."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the media must not go for sensational news
but instead make its reporting conducive to social stability and
unity.

<HEADLINE> Australian Exports Value Falls in Last Quarter 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The value of Australian
exports had fallen on the back of a stronger local dollar and
lower prices for wool, wheat, coal and iron ore -- the main export
products, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said its export price index fell by 5 percent in the
December quarter and it was down 2.3 percent over the year to the
same quarter.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S.
dollar contributed to the decrease, it said.
</P>
<P>
Wool and cotton fibers fell by 12.4 percent on the index, while
base metals dropped 7.7 percent, live animals by 2.7 percent,
vegetable products by 9.3 percent, gold, diamonds and coin by 2.2
percent and machinery and mechanical appliances by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said lower auction prices led to the fall in the price
of wool, while world market conditions sparked a falling price for
coal.
</P>
<P>
It also noted falls in wheat, iron ore and metal prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ABS' price index of materials used in house
building increased by 0.3 percent in the December quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the main contributors to the small overall
increase were higher prices for plaster products, cupboards and
fittings and aluminum windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
That was partly offset by decreases in prices for plastic pipes
and fittings and ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
The price index of materials used in building other than house
building rose by 0.3 percent in the quarter, with the ABS
attributing the increase to higher prices for imported components
of elevators, escalators and travelators and for aluminum screens
and doors.
</P>
<P>
Offsetting those increases were falls in prices for non-ferrous
pipes and fittings and plastic pipes and fittings.
</P>
<P>
Another indicator, the price index of articles produced by the
manufacturing industry, fell 0.6 percent in the December quarter
and 0.4 percent over the year to the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The main contributors to the fall were price decreases for
basic metals and refined petroleum products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese literary Giant Gains Global Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- British heritage authorities
are planning to erect a special memorial plaque outside the
former London home of the famous Chinese writer Lao She in 1999,
the centenary year of his birth.
</P>
<P>
Lao lived in England's capital in the 1920s and the writer's
son Shu Yi has just been informed by British Ambassador to China
Mr. Anthony Galsworthy about the honor, the first for a Chinese
writer.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Shu Yi, Mr. Galsworthy said: "This will be a
lasting tribute to your father and to his relationship with
Britain."
</P>
<P>
It was while living in the three-story house in St.James'
Garden, Holland Park in London, that Lao She, then a lecturer in
Chinese at the School of Oriental Studies of London University,
began his literary career and helped his house mate Clement
Egerton to translate the controversial Chinese classic, The
Golden Lotus into a 4-volume English language version, which was
published by George Routledge and Sons LTD. in 1939.
</P>
<P>
The City of Cat, Lao She's science fiction novel which is
little known in China, had a first-time print run of 700,000 in
the former Soviet Union and has subsequently been translated into
many major world languages.
</P>
<P>
Once, when a Soviet official asked Russian poet Tvardovsky to
recommend books to read he was simply told: "Just read the City
of Cat, it mirrors all our weaknesses in an imaginary kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Lao She's literary portfolio includes a rickshaw boy,
Beijingers in a lane during the invasion of China by Japanese
troops, and tea-drinkers who eye-witnessed the vicissitudes of
more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
With these characters, Lao conveyed his profound understanding
of life's pains and his heartfelt concern for these miserable
people whose lives were dictated by fate, says Fan Jun, a
researcher at the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that Lao She is also famous for his humor, which is a
relief from the tragedy of life.
</P>
<P>
Severely tortured at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution
which began in 1966, Lao chose to end his life in a Beijing lake
on the early morning of August 24 of the same year.
</P>
<P>
Shu Yi still remembers what his father said to him three days
before his death. "Again, some are destined to die, especially
pure and uncompromising souls."

SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Audit departments in Shanghai
have been reinforcing their efforts to ensure the supervision of
the local economy in every field.
</P>
<P>
This helped increase local revenue to 1.84 million yuan,
reduce 265 million yuan in local expenditure and subsidies, and

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Says End of DRC War Is Not for Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
grown pessimistic about a rapid settlement of the five-month-old
conflict rocking the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a report
reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a press briefing late Wednesday, members of
the government committee on information indicated that parties to
the conflict in the DRC, namely President Laurent Desire Kabila
and rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), remain far
apart in terms of conceptualizing what they need to solve the
crisis, said the report .
</P>
<P>
Anastase Gasana, Rwandan Foreign Minister and chairman of the
committee was crystal clear about the need for the Kinshasa
government and the rebels to sign the ceasefire first, because
they are the main players in the conflict while countries backing
both sides have just a marginal role.
</P>
<P>
For the minister in the President's Office, Patrick Mazimhaka,
there is still a long way to go before getting President Kabila
agreeing to engage in direct talks with the rebels who have also
declared that they will not be part of an agreement they have not
negotiated themselves.
</P>
<P>
''Considering that Congo has known crises since its
independence, a ceasefire within three, four months is not
expected soon,'' Mazimhaka underscored. He said more talks will
take place in a bid to have the belligerents reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the summit last weekend in which both
Kabila and the rebels were excluded, and which has been hailed as
an important step toward the signing of the ceasefire, Mazimhaka
indicated that there is growing impatience to see the conflict
resolved because the countries involved are weary of the
five-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
''The insistence on the signing of the signature, which is a
symbol, and not the content of an agreement is definitely
symptomatic of an impatient world that wants to run away from the
problem, not to solve the problem,'' Mazimhaka explained.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Kabila's allies can no longer cope with
the cost of keeping their troops in the DRC. Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe faces a growing domestic pressure to withdraw the
6,000 troops deployed in DRC, while Namibian Prime Minister stated
that his country will pull out the 2, 000 soldiers from Congo.
</P>
<P>
It is said Namibia has so far spent 10 million U.S. Dollars on
its troops fighting alongside the Congolese government troops.
The Namibian Prime Minister declared that his country is going to
use the money spent on its soldiers in Congo for development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resuming of intense fighting between the Angolan
government troops and UNITA rebels, as well as the renewed clashes
between government troops and opposition militia in
Congo-Brazzaville have put Angola in an awkward position to
maintain troops in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka indicated that Rwanda is ready to sign the ceasefire
agreement once the main parties to the conflict, Kabila and the
rebellion will sign. However, he said Rwanda will not put
pressure on the rebels to agree with the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that so far, Kabila has not shifted from the
position he had in August when the rebellion broke out in the east
of the country, calling it an invasion from Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
''If you listen to the government of Congo today, it sounds
exactly the way it sounded in August,'' Mazimhaka told reporters.
He accused Kabila of pursuing a campaign of repression against
political opponents in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
''We are very far from reaching a settlement, but then there
are signs of hope,'' he noted. He recalled secret talks in
Tripoli, Libya, last month between Kabila's delegation led by his
director of cabinet Abdoulaye Yerodia, and the Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
These are signals that Kabila is maybe awakening to the reality
that he must engage in direct talks with the rebels, he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Hits Record Height in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite the damaging influence
of the financial turmoil in Asia, Beijing saw a record high 6.51
billion U.S. dollars of imports and exports in 1998, rising 12.6
percent on a yearly basis and 13 percentage points higher than
the national average growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The total volume included 2.83 billion U.S. dollars of
exports, up 14.7 percent on 1997 level, and a record 3.68 billion
U.S. dollars of imports, up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1998, Beijing's exports to Asia edged
down month by month, with the total volume for the whole year of
1998 rising only 0.7 percent over 1997 to reach 1.52 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the national capital's exports to the U.S. grew by 24
percent over 1997 to hit 395 million U.S. dollars in 1998, with
the volume to Europe climbing 44 percent to top 708 million U.S.
dollars and that to Africa soaring by 170 percent to reach 63.78
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Beijing's exports in 1998, or about 1.26
billion U.S. dollars, were secured by local overseas-funded
enterprises, which also contributed 75 percent of local imports
of the year, or about 2.82 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronics products rose 21.7
percent over 1997 to hit 1.11 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, with
the volume of hi-tech items growing by 43 percent to hit 380
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Customs Office also reported 6.287 billion yuan of
tariffs in 1998, rising 17.84 percent on a yearly basis.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Urged to Sue Tobacco Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Anti-smoking group Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH) has called on Australian federal and
state governments to follow the United States in suing tobacco
companies to recover the costs to health caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Despite smoking being the single largest preventable cause of
death and disease in Australia, it kills over 18,000 people each
year and puts enormous pressure on hospitals and waiting lists,"
ASH Chief Executive Officer Anne Jones said in a statement
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement during Wednesday's State of the Union
speech, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the Justice Department is
preparing to sue tobacco companies for the damage done by smoking.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling upon Prime Minister John Howard to follow the
lead set by President Clinton and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair
who last month announced a 100-million-pound campaign against
tobacco," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia used to be a world leader on tobacco control but
since the end of the 1980s it has fallen behind other countries
including the U.S., Canada and U.K.
</P>
<P>
"We need political leaders to support well-funded tobacco
control programs, tougher legislation and legal actions to recover
health costs and bring an end to the misleading and deceptive
conduct of the tobacco industry," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the prime minister and state premiers need to
act now against the three tobacco companies operating in Australia
-- WD &AMP; HO Wills, Philip Morris and Rothmans -- to reduce the
costs and human misery caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November 1998, 46 U.S. states, the District of
Columbia and five U.S. territories had endorsed a settlement with
four tobacco companies, which will pay 205 billion U.S. dollars in
compensation over 25 years.

<HEADLINE> New Jobs To Be Created in Next 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong may be facing some
difficult times in the immediate future but its employment
prospects for the next two years remain encouraging, with new
jobs still being created at a reasonable rate, a government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Around 122,000 new jobs would come on stream in the local
market during the next two years, said Joseph Wong, secretary for
education and manpower of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), at a media session here after chairing a Task Force
on Employment meeting on behalf of Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force on Employment was formed in earlier 1998 with
Tsang as the chairman to tackle the increasingly serious
unemployment problem in Hong Kong as a result of the Asian
financial turmoil. It convened its first meeting in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
The new jobs will be created as a result of major government
initiatives and projects, including those announced by SAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa in the 1998 Policy Address.
</P>
<P>
The latest assessment shows that of the 122,000 new jobs,
about 113,500 fall within the non-government sector while the
remaining 8,500 are civil service posts to be filled during the
1999-2000 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The major infrastructure projects over the next two years will
generate some 53,500 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, major public works building projects will produce
20,400 new jobs in 1999 and 2000. The housing program, aimed at
providing 50,000 public housing units a year, will give rise to a
further 9,000 job opportunities in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 30,000 new non-government jobs spread over a
wide range of sectors, including tourism, social welfare,
telecommunications, building management, industrial promotion and
development, education, environmental protection, hospital
services and minor works projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the last eight months of 1998, 33,000 jobs were created,
which was in line with the earlier forecast, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
"Some positive signs have emerged more recently, including
easing liquidity, cuts in interest rates and rebound in share and
property prices from their earlier lows, but it will probably
take some time for these to be translated into increased economic
activity," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will continue to explore measures to boost
employment opportunities and help the unemployed re-enter the
labor market, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia repeated its assertion
Thursday that the Kosovo conflict can only be settled through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only reliable way of resolving the problem. Any
use of force may only drive the problem further into deadlock,
which was convincingly shown by the U.S. and British air strikes
against Iraq," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement
carried by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The comment came after NATO forces were assembled under
heightened alert in tentative preparations for possible military
action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The preparations include moving military ships, including the
U.S. aircraft carrier Enterprise, to the Adriatic Sea, and
putting NATO assault aircraft on an increased level of combat
readiness. NATO planes would be ready to strike within 48 rather
than 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
NATO maintains that it has a mandate to launch air strikes
against Serbian targets both in and outside Kosovo, but some
members are expressing serious doubts that the use of force would
help to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest standoff between NATO and Belgrade followed the
killing last weekend of 45 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the
expulsion by Yugoslavia of William Walker, head of the
international monitoring mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia said that these 45 ethnic Albanians are terrorists.
But the West insisted that they are civilians.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Reports of Plot Against U.S. Consulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Foreign
Ministry Thursday denounced allegations in the Indian press
recently about Pakistani complicity in a plot to blow up the U.S.
Consulate in India.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Altaf, Foreign Office spokesman, described in a press
release the Indian press reports as "the most sinister
fabrications designed solely to malign Pakistan by exploiting the
international sentiment against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Such reports by Indian official agencies were carried out
almost every year on the eve of the Indian National Day, said
Altaf, adding that this time the tendentious reports had been
"particularly reprehensible" as they were aimed at undermining the
relations between Pakistan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Indian government had never
officially raised the reported allegations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Also, a U.S. State Department spokesman, in a press briefing
Wednesday, denied any knowledge of the alleged Pakistani
complicity, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said the Indian press allegations were "no more than
vicious propaganda and a crude attempt to damage Pakistan's image
and create misunderstanding in our relations with the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms in the strongest
terms, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a victim of terrorism, Pakistan was determined to fight this
menace and its cooperation with international efforts including
those of the United States was well known, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean, Namibian Officers Were Gunned Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) - - Rebels of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) claimed that they have shot down the two
Namibian helicopters in which four Zimbabwean, two Namibian
officers, and one Congolese colonel were killed early last week,
the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''(Laurent) Kabila's allies had announced that the helicopters
had crashed because of bad weather,'' the spokesman of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) rebels, commander Sylvain
Mbuki, told RNA on a satellite phone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''But this is not true, we shot them down,'' Mbuki said,
adding the incident took place between Kabalo and Kitenge, in
northwest Katanga Province.
</P>
<P>
The names of the Zimbabwean officers killed have been given as
Col. Nale, Col. Bruno, Major Cibanda, and Lt Tichine. The
Congolese officer has been identified by the rebels as Col.
Gaston. The two Namibian officers are Captain Ersashu Dura, and
Lieutenant Gilbert (one name).
</P>
<P>
The pilots of the two copters were also killed, but their names
were not given by the DRC rebels.
</P>
<P>
The DRC rebels claimed that since the beginning of the
counter-offensive by government troops and their allies from
Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Angola three months ago, they have
inflicted heavy losses to the enemy forces.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have indicated that they killed over 100 Zimbabwean
soldiers, captured 17 others. They also seized two tanks, and a
lot of weapons, while five other tanks were destroyed. Up to now,
they said, four enemy helicopters were shot down.
</P>
<P>
''It is not surprising that Namibia has announced that it is
withdrawing its troops out of Congo,'' one rebel commander
commented. ''The declaration hides a growing difficulty to cope
up with the losses on the battlefield,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
''We are yet to see the reaction of Zimbabwe which has suffered
far greater losses than Namibia and Angola,'' the commander said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Olympic Committee to Release Bid Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The endorsement contract, dating back to May 1991, sets out
the New South Wales state government's commitments to the AOC in
seeking and winning the bid.
</P>
<P>
AOC president Joan Coates said in a statement Thursday that
the board resolved on Tuesday to grant a Freedom of Information
request for the contract, which was entered into by the then
Greiner government with the AOC and the city of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the documents comes in the wake of bribery
allegations that have rocked the International Olympic Committee
(IOC).
</P>
<P>
The AOC will also release amendments to the contract by the
Fahey government in October and December, 1993, and the current
government in October 1995, Coates said.
</P>
<P>
To put the endorsement contract and related documents into
context, the AOC would also make public an extract from the
minutes of the AOC executive meeting on November 16, 1990, which
endorsed Sydney's candidature and summarized the creation and
structure of SOCOG (Sydney Organizing Committee for Olympic
Games).
</P>
<P>
Copies of the document could be obtained from the AOC's Sydney
office after 1:00pm Friday, Coates said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the
government was happy to agree to the release of the contract.
</P>
<P>
"The government is relaxed about the AOC making it available,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> China to be Strict with those Fighting Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Specialist teams of police set
up to tackle smuggling are to be subjected to a series of special
internal investigations by China's General Administration of
Customs and Ministry of Public Security to guarantee that they
are free of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Supervisory units will be set up in every level of the
departments launched to combat smuggling to carry out
disciplinary inspections, said Mou Xinsheng, vice-administrator
of customs.
</P>
<P>
Those organizations will also be monitored by special units
from departments within the customs authorities to whom they are
affiliated and from people's procuratorates, Mou said, adding
that those found violating laws and regulations will be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that staff recruited to fight smuggling are
usually brought in from relevant departments in customs, public
security and the army, as well as graduates from colleges and
special secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Mou added that they are chosen through a strict selection
procedure to ensure that the teams are highly professional and
well trained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no one is above the law in a socialist
country, which takes "ruling the country with law" as its basic
principle. Those found guilty of corruption will be dismissed
from the service and punished in accordance with the law.

<HEADLINE> HK to Establish Regulations for Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China will introduce a bill which
seeks to provide for the establishment of a statutory regulatory
framework to control the practice, use, manufacture and trading
of Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the bill has been approved by the Chief
Executive in Council of the SAR, said Katherine Fok, secretary
for health and welfare, here today.
</P>
<P>
The framework will include registration of practitioners in
Chinese medicine, licensing of traders in Chinese medicines and
registration of proprietary Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
Fok said that the proposed regulatory framework would enhance
public health protection and safety and greatly improve public
confidence in the use of Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the Chinese Medicine Bill, which will be gazetted for
public information Friday, a Chinese Medicine Council will be set
up to be responsible for implementing various control measures.
</P>
<P>
Two boards will be established under the council. They are the
Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board which will be responsible
for regulating the practice of Chinese medicine, and the Chinese
Medicines Board which will focus on controlling the use,
manufacture and trading of Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
A number of committees will also be set up to assist the two
boards in pursuing their functions.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that all applicants for registration as
practitioners will be required to take a licensing examination
and only those who pass the examination will be allowed to
register.
</P>
<P>
Some transitional arrangements are proposed to facilitate the
registration of the existing 7,000 Chinese medicine
practitioners, Fok said.
</P>
<P>
The bill also proposes a control mechanism for the licensing
of retailers and wholesalers of Chinese herbal medicines, the
licensing of wholesalers and manufacturers of proprietary Chinese
medicines, and the registration of individual proprietary Chinese
medicines.
</P>
<P>
To minimize disruptions to the existing Chinese medicines
trade, some transitional arrangements would be made so that the
manufacturers and traders could continue with their business,
pending the completion of the concerned licensing and
registration procedures, Fok said.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council for
first and second readings on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a sound and credible regulatory framework
will lay a solid foundation for the future development of Chinese
medicine within Hong Kong's health care system and strengthen
Hong Kong's potential to develop over time into an international
center for research, manufacture and trading of Chinese medicine,
Fok stressed.

<HEADLINE> Oil Company Issues 1998 Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua)-- China National Star Petroleum
Corporation (CNSPC) announced today that its 1998 taxes and
profits hit 245 million yuan (29.5 million US dollars), up 12.9
percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The company's turnover grew by 28.9 percent to 5.03 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
CNSPC President Zhu Jiazhen said the company's oil and gas
reserves hit an estimated 93.27 million tons equivalent during
the year, or 186.54 percent more than the state target. The
company's proven reserves hit 38.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the company effectively adopted state-of-the-art
technology to offset the natural decline in crude production.
CNSPC produced 1.885 million tons equivalent of crude oil and gas
during the year, up 19.66 percent on 1997. Crude oil production
stood at 860,000 tons, with gas production ending the year at
1.15 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
He said the company will continue to prioritize oil and
natural gas exploration and will attempt to substantially lower
exploration costs. Projections call for 1999 sales revenues of
between 6-6.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
CNSPC plans to increase its proven oil and gas reserves by 100
million tons this year. Oil output is expected to hit 1.4 million
ton, with gas output rising to 1.4 billion cubic meters. The compa
ny also plans to increase its total oil production capacity by an
additional 1.35 million tons and will reduce production costs to
10 US dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
CNSPC operates 23 oil and gas fields in the western Sichuan
Basin, northern Tarim Basin, northern Jiangsu Basin, southern
Songliao Basin and northern Shaanxi Province. The company and its
partners are also developing the Pinghu Gas Field in the East
China Sea. Two oil fields have annual oil production of 300,000
and 200,000 tons, with the capacity for two gas fields standing
at 800 million and 100 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The company, one of the four state-owned oil companies, was
established on the basis of the marine geology branches of the
former Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. CNSPC fills out
the sector which includes the China National Petroleum
Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation and China National
Offshore Oil Corporation.

<HEADLINE> China Shows Grave Concern Over NMD, TMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China expressed grave concern
for the enhanced efforts made by the United States to develop two
missile defense systems, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi
here this afternoon at a routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced the plans for
the development of National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems and advocated to revise the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (AMT) for such developments on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the United States, the country armed with
the world's most powerful and advanced nuclear and conventional
arsenal, now made enhanced efforts to develop NMD and TMD. "Such
move goes against the trend of the times and is detrimental to
the international efforts for arms control and disarmament," he
said, adding that it will also have extensive and far-reaching
negative effect on the global and regional strategic balance and
stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China considers that the development, deployment
and transfer of anti-missile systems with potential strategic
defense capabilities can not ensure security or prevent missile
proliferation. "Such action, on the contrary, will damage
security and boost the missile spread, not even mentioning it is
in violation of the AMT," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the AMT should be strictly abide by as it is of
great importance for safeguarding the global strategic balance
and stability and maintaining the momentum of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"China also considers that joint development of advanced
anti-missile systems by the United States and other concerned
countries will have serious impact on the security and stability
of the regions concerned," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Any country's supply of any weapons system, including TMD, to
China's Taiwan Province will be considered a move that seriously
infringes on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he
stressed, adding that such action will certainly meet with
"strong opposition from the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to observe the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and relevant commitments and not to spread TMD and
relevant military know-how by any means to Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Angola Expels 2 Portuguese Reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
demanded two correspondents with Portugal's Diario de Noticias
newspaper leave Angola within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The two Portuguese identified as Ivone Ferreira and Ana Gloria
Lucas fabricated a story claiming that there were still Cuban
military advisors in the Angolan government troops, Jornal de
Angola newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a statement issued Wednesday by the Angolan

would not be allowed to enter Angola "under any circumstances"
because their article is a libel against both the Angolan people
and the Angolan army.
</P>

"Cubans Return to Angola", saying that there were some 200 Cuban
military advisors in the Angolan armed forces, who were providing
strategic support for the government troops to fight the forces of
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Information Ministry pointed out in its statement
that the rumor had come after the Angolan government troops won a
series of victory in the battle fields. The report was aimed to
change the international community's attitude toward the situation
in the war-torn country and to find excuse for UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi's attacks against the government.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Angolan armed forces, Jose Manuel also said
Wednesday that the report by the two Portuguese correspondents was
a sheer lie.
</P>
<P>
Manuel admitted that there are many Cubans staying in Angola
but he said that these Cubans are experts in health, education,
catering industry or trade.
</P>
<P>
None of them is serving the Angolan government troops and all
their activities in various areas are "open", said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
After Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, Cuba sent a
host of troops to the African country to support the
newly-established government to fight in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the number of the Cuban troops in Angola amounted up
to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA movement also invited to Angola the troops of the
apartheid South African government and it got great financial and
military assistance from some Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Cuba recalled all its troops from Angola in 1991.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China will mark the new
century one year later than most countries in the world if the
Chinese Government adopts a suggestion put forward by a group of
Chinese scientists,.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese astronomers have declared that the new millennium
would not begin until January 1, 2001, which other scientists and
experts worldwide have concurred.
</P>
<P>
"The first century starts with the year 1 according to the
Western definition of 'century', and the second century starts
with the year 101," said Lu Benkui, director of the Purple
Mountain Observatory in eastern Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, which
indicates that the 21st Century should start with the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Mountain Observatory has set China's national
calendar since 1928 and is the only observatory in the country
dedicated to such research.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that as early as the year 525, astronomers decided the
year of Jesus' birth to be the beginning of the western calendar.
</P>
<P>
"If the new century starts with the year 2000, the beginning
of the calendar should be changed to the year 0, and that loses
the original meaning of the calendar's beginning."
</P>
<P>
The United States Navy Observatory and the British Greenwich
Observatory also hold the same views, Lu said, adding that he has
already submitted his team's formal decision on the date to the
central government and is waiting for a reply.

<HEADLINE> Interference of Internal Affairs Unacceptable, FM Spokesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
voiced its opposition against interference of its internal
affairs with issues of Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"No nation has the right to interfere in China's internal
affairs," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here
today at a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the appointment of a special
coordinator for Tibetan affairs by the U.S. government on January
20, Sun said that Tibet is an integral part of the Chinese
territory and Tibetan affairs are purely internal affairs of
China.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government strongly opposes the U.S.
move to install and appoint the so-called "coordinator for
Tibetan affairs."
</P>
<P>
While asked to comment on the criticism by U.S. congressmen on
China's human rights situation, Sun said that the human rights
situation in China is "better than any period in the history".
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people enjoy a better life with more democratic
rights than ever. The Chinese government has also adopted lots of
measures to improve the human rights situation," he said, adding
that the human rights situation will witness better improvement
thanks to the efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that people with different views on China's human
rights situation should pay visits to China and see themselves
the real situation in China. "I believe their opinions will
change after their visits," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Sun also said that China will positively
participate in the work in the two working groups launched for
the four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"China will strengthen its efforts for the establishment of
the peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula and relaxation of
tensions on the peninsula after thoroughly listening to opinions
from all sides concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, China hopes to take a fair and flexible
attitude in the discussions with all sides on relevant issues and
expects all parties to make common efforts so as to keep the
current momentum and score constant progress on the basis of the
already achieved results.

Sun also noted: "China has expressed grave concern for the
enhanced efforts made by the United States to develop two missile
defense systems."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced plans for the
development of National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) systems and advocated to revise the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty (AMT) for such developments on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States, the country armed
with the world's most powerful and advanced nuclear and
conventional arsenal, now made enhanced efforts to develop NMD
and TMD.
</P>
<P>
"Such move goes against the trend of the times and is
detrimental to the international efforts for arms control and
disarmament,"
</P>
<P>
He said that China considers that the development, deployment
and transfer of anti-missile systems with potential strategic
defense capabilities can not ensure security or prevent missile
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"Such action, on the contrary, will damage security and boost
the missile spread, not even mentioning it is in violation of the
AMT," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Any country's supply of any weapons system, including TMD, to
China's Taiwan Province will be considered a move that seriously
infringes on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he
stressed, adding that such action will certainly meet with
"strong opposition from the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to observe the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and relevant commitments and not to spread TMD and
relevant military know-how by any means to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerned with Macao, Sun said that
the preparatory work for the return of Macao to the motherland
witnessed steady progress and the Chinese government is fully
confident about Macao's smooth return.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) approved the methods of creating the
Selection Committee and choosing the candidates for the first
chief executive of the Macao SAR. And the first chief executive
of the Macao SAR will be elected by the Selection Committee in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
On the differences in some issues between China and Portugal,
he noted that the problems should be solved through consultation
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sun also said that China attaches great importance to the
social order in Macao, and hoped that the Portuguese Macao
authorities should bear the responsibility for maintaining the
social order in Macao to guarantee social stability and smooth
return.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to provide strong support
for Portugal's efforts to maintain social order, he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching up China's financial situation, the spokesman said
that the Chinese government will stick to the policy of
maintaining the stability of the yuan, the currency of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is carrying out a series of reforms on
the financial system in order to regulate the financial order of
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic cooperation
between China and the Netherlands has been growing rapidly over
the past few years and the two sides have agreed to strengthen
relations.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign trade and Economic
Cooperation, met with his Dutch counterpart Gerrit Ybema on
Thursday and noted the rapid development of trade relations and
economic cooperation between the two countries. He also noted
that the Netherlands is an important EU partner in trade and eco
nomic cooperation arenas.
</P>
<P>
Ybema arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a week-long visit
which will include trips to several Chinese cities, including
Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Dutch trade witnessed major progress in 1998 in spite of
financial turmoil engulfing Asia. We should be delighted that
last year's bilateral trade volume grew 10 percent," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the Netherlands are complimentary in many
aspects. For example, the Netherlands offers advanced technology
in various fields, while Chinese products can fulfill Dutch
demand in terms of quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
He added that China offers Dutch investors a vast potential
market, as well as a large low-cost labor force available.
</P>
<P>
Ybema said China, including the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), is the largest Dutch export market
in Asia, with exports growing by 26 percent annually in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Dutch investments in China have grown by 70 percent annually
since 1994. The Netherlands ranks as China's 4th largest source
of foreign investments coming from EU nations.
</P>
<P>
The trade ministers agreed to promote cooperation between
small- and medium-sized enterprises, and a Chinese entrepreneurs
delegation from the sector will visit the Netherlands next year.
</P>
<P>
Ybema said the Netherlands will open new trade representative
offices in Tianjin and Guangzhou during his visit. The
Netherlands will have six related offices in China.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Set to Become Knowledge-Driven Industry Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Economic
Development Board (EDB) has launched a blueprint for the next 10
years with an aim to turn Singapore into a leading center of
competence in knowledge-driven activities and a choice location
for company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which will contribute 40 percent of Singapore's
annual GDP and create some 25,000 jobs a year, was unveiled at a
seminar Wednesday that was attended by 800 private and public
sector participants.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, called Industry 21 of I 21, the economy will be
powered by the manufacturing and services sectors that will be
further developed with strong emphasis on technology, innovation
and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint is also designed to make Singapore more
attractive for multinational corporations to undertake their key
knowledge-intensive activities and to encourage local companies to
embrace more knowledge-intensive activities, with an aim to turn
promising local companies into world-class players.
</P>
<P>
The strategies identified by the EDB to achieve the goal are to
develop a balanced and robust mix of industries and markets, to
build up world-class capabilities and global coverage, to promote
innovation, to develop local talent and attract foreign talent as
well as to create a conducive business environment.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan told
the seminar that the emphasis of the plan will be on "quality,
high value-added and knowledge-driven industries."
</P>
<P>
It is critical to develop human and intellectual capital as a
key competitive edge and to leverage on science, technology and
innovation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that growth can no longer be driven by the
traditional factors of production, namely, capital and labor.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sees Stable Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt saw a stable rise in oil
output in the first half of 1998 after a steady decline in the
past five years, a magazine on the Mideast economies reported.
</P>
<P>
The average oil production of the period stood at 800,000
barrels per day (bpd), compared with a peak of nearly 900,000 bpd
in 1993, the latest issue of the Middle East Economic Digest
reported.
</P>
<P>
The output started to edge up towards the end of the period,
reaching 816,000 bpd in June and 827,000 bpd in July, said the
London-based magazine which focuses on the economy of the Mideast
countries.
</P>
<P>
The rise is mainly attributed to the successful performance of
the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (Gupco), a joint venture by the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the U.K./U.S. BP
Amoco, in reversing the decline in output.
</P>
<P>
The development of the new Gulf of Suez fields has pushed
Gupco's output up to over 330,000 bpd, from around 300,000 bpd at
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Gupco also saw a rosy future with the announcement by BP Amoco
of what it said as its largest crude oil discovery in the Gulf of
Suez since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The well drilled in the South Ghareb concession in early 1998
flowed at 18,800 bpd, and reserves are estimated conservatively at
25 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt's solid oil production was not matched in crude
exports in 1998, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the EGPC have shown that the country's oil exports
totaled just 631 million U.S. dollars in the first half of 1998,
compared with 1,316 million dollars in January-July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decline in oil products imports was smaller, leaving Egypt
with a surplus of just 81 million dollars on its petroleum and
products trade in that period.
</P>
<P>
The value of crude oil exports is bound to have fallen further
in the second half of 1998 when prices tumbled to historic lows of
about 10 dollars a barrel, suggesting that the oil trade account
was probably in deficit for the full year.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi has responded to the
problems by announcing a policy of shifting to exporting refined
products rather than crude oil.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say it will take time to put this into
practice as Egypt's refineries are operating at full capacity and
selling all their products at the domestic market, and the country
still has to import significant quantities of expensive light
products.
</P>
<P>
New hydrocrackers are being built in Alexandria and Suez to
plug this gap, but the first will not be on stream until 2001.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Solve Pressing Housing Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (xinhua) -- Zambia plans to counstruct more
than 100, 000 houses a year in the next 10 years to resolve the
current pressing housing problem, said President Frederick
Chiluha.
</P>
<P>
The government-run newspaper, Times of Zambia, Thursday quoted
Chiluba as saying if the houses are not constructed as projected,
the majority of Zambians will be condemened to living in squalor.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks when he laid the foundation stone at
the site for the Presidential Housing Initiative (PHI) at Chainama
here Wednesday, where about 12,000 low, medium and high cost
houses are expected to be built under the program.
</P>
<P>
" We need to construct more than 100,000 dwelling units each
year for the next 10 years or so if we are to make any
significant impact on the housing problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zambian government was forced to embark on
the housing initiative to counter the inertia in the building
industy which had culminated in the constrction of houses built
only by owner-occupiers.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the housing initiative was not a
whimsical scheme but it was part of the national housing policy
formulated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We must find the appropriate technology to make the houses
affordable. we are worried about the Zambians who don't have
houses," he said.
</P>
<P>
" Everybody should be targeted in this initiative," Chiluba
added.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Boundary Disputes on Rise in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Increasing regional conflicts
have led to a sharp rise in boundary disputes between Chinese
administrative regions since 1990, a Civil Affairs Ministry
official revealed today.
</P>
<P>
There were only a few dozen provincial border disputes in the
1950s after the founding of the New China in 1949, but the number
went up to 1,000 in the 1990s, according to Song Jihua, deputy
director of the ministry's Boundary Demarcation Office.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, the government is pushing for the
clear demarcation of all provincial and county level
administrative boundaries, Song told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to a State Council plan, the work is to be completed
by the end of the century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Demarcation work began 10 years ago, and 25 boundary lines
have been decided, 10 are almost finished, and 13 are being
decided, Song said, adding that 68 percent of all provincial
boundary lines have been decided together with 300,000 of the
470,000 km. of county lines.

<P>
Before the demarcation work began, 77 percent of the
provincial boundary lines followed traditional lines, five
percent were recognized by law, and the rest were disputed, Song
explained.
</P>
<P>
Those red and green lines on China's administrative region map
are only expedients and carry no legal weight, he said, adding
that this means endless troubles for the future.
</P>
<P>
Because of the vagueness, disputes have kept appearing,
especially with the introduction of the market economy and with
pressure from resources, population growth, and self-interest.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Affairs Ministry set up a special body to handle
boundary disputes in 1986 but found out just how hard it was to
solve them, which was when the demarcation drive idea came up.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, administrative region boundaries were
never specific or marked by stone, and regional border lines in
the modern age were inherited from practices that started in the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and under the Nationalist Government
(1912-1949).

<P>
The city's state-owned and collective enterprises laid off
169,600 workers during the year, with 102,100 people, or 60.2

Over a million workers in the nation's capital were laid off
between 1995-1998. The city has opened 938 reemployment service
centers to assist unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports indicate that an additional 100,000 workers

</P>
<P>
The horticultural exposition will run from May to October.

site, with 5 large indoor exhibition halls and 6 special gardens
has been completed, according to Li Jiating, Yunnan's governor
and the vice-chairman of the Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have spent more than a billion yuan (120
million U.S. dollars) on the 200-hectare area in the northern

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Debt "Not Excessive": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
South African Finance Department refuted the saying that the
country's debt is excessive, noting that South Africa's debt is
not excessive by any standards.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's debt, which is about 55.5 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), is not excessive by any
standards, said Maria Ramos, director-general of the department.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have less debt, but we are not in the same
position of what we call highly indebted poor countries," the
Sowetan daily newspaper Thursday quoted Ramos as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The debt to GDP percentage of a lot of the member states of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was in the
range of 80 to 90 percent, the director-general added.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said of about 343 billion Rand (57 billion U.S. Dollars)
debt which South Africa would register during the end of its
financial year in March this year, about 95 percent would be
local debt.
</P>
<P>
"This debt is Rand-based, meaning that the government is
borrowing from its citizens," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic prospects, Ramos conceded that last year
was a bad year for South Africa and the world, particularly the
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
She predicted South Africa's economic growth for 1998 to be
around 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that in 1999 South Africa's GDP growth rate
could be about two percent.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Dies of Organ Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Luwen, a female elephant
born in Myanmar, died of organ failure, pancreatitis and other
complications today in this capital of central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed that the massive body weight of the 2
5-year-old elephant and the fact that the animal remained in a
prone position for some 31 days interrupted normal blood
circulation and caused organ failure.
</P>
<P>
Large animals such as elephants normally die after two to
three days in the prone position. Thirty zoo staffers attempted
to relieve Luwen's suffering by helping the animal stand.
</P>
<P>
Luwen was moved from Hubei Province to Zhengzhou some 12 years
ago in hopes she would mate with a male elephant housed at the
Zhengzhou Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Elephants normally live between 50-60 years. The zoo
attempted to save Luwen by recruiting the help of veterinarians
throughout the nation and allocating over 200,000 yuan (24,000 US
dollars) on related treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We provide sick animals with fresh fruit and fresh vegetabl
es," said one animal keeper, adding that local residents donated
food and money.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people visited the zoo over the past 31 days.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Confident about Macao's Smooth Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory work for the
return of Macao to the motherland witnessed steady progress and
the Chinese government is fully confident about Macao's smooth
return, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said here this aftern
oon.
</P>
<P>
Sun said in the weekly press conference that the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao in
December this year. He described the power transfer as "another
historic event after the return of Hong Kong", saying the return
marks a stride towards China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China and Portugal have been
cooperating since the two governments signed the China-Portugal
joint declaration on the Macao issue in 1987. Since then, the two
sides have held frequent talks on the smooth return of Macao and
the transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) approved the methods of creating the
Selection Committee and choosing the candidates for the first
chief executive of the Macao SAR. And the first chief executive
of the Macao SAR will be elected by the Selection Committee in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
All this demonstrated that progress has been made in preparing
for the return of Macao, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of differences on some issues between China and
Portugal, he noted that the problems should be solved through
consultation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that with the joint efforts of the
two sides, Macao will return to China smoothly, and become a
bridge for Sino-Portuguese friendship and cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Sun also said that China attaches great importance to the
social order in Macao, and hoped that the Portuguese Macao
authorities should bear the responsibility for maintaining the
social order in Macao to guarantee social stability and smooth
return.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to provide strong support
for Portugal's efforts to maintain social order, he added.

<HEADLINE> Housing: Major Concern Form Chinese Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's housing reform has
become an area of interest for China's urban youth, according to
a China Youth Research Center and China Youth Development
Foundation survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey on the "situation of modern urban Chinese young
people" was conducted in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and
Chongqing, and Henan and other provinces, involving more than
6,500 people between the ages of 14 and 28.
</P>
<P>
When asked about which of the reforms they are most concerned
with, 28.3 percent of the students, workers, teachers, and civil
servants asked said that housing gets more attention than any
other reform.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 19 percent said the labor system reform
is important, 17.5 percent chose the ownership system, 15.2 per
cent said financial reforms are a major concern, while 11.9
percent said that medical reforms are needed, and 4.7 percent
said labor security.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that young people's concern about housing is
related to the housing shortage. The housing reform made a big
leap in 1998 when it was announced that the welfare-related
housing system will gradually be replaced with a market system.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that modern youth care less about guarantees
for a stable life than do the elderly and that only a small
percentage showed much concern for pensions or job security.

<HEADLINE> Rotary Clubs Launch Program in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Rotary clubs from Entebbe, Uganda,
and Chicago of the United States launched a micro-credit loan
project Thursday in the Rakai District in southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
President of Rotary International, James Lacy, said this at a
press conference here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at providing vital economic assistance to
residents in the district, mostly female, who have been gravely affected by
the ongoing AIDS crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit poor children and the elderly adults
in the rural Rakai District. It issues loans ranging
from 50 U.S. Dollars to 200 Dollars to residents allowing them the
opportunity to start an income-generating activity, thus freeing
them from poverty and dependency.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Barkley, a Rotary member from Chicago of the United States,
said: "What is great about the project is that it is about
empowerment. A 50-Dollar loan can give a woman with 10 children a
way to buy goats and chickens, sell the eggs and milk, feed and
clothe her family."
</P>
<P>
Rotary International, a non-governmental organization founded in
Chicago in 1905, provided a grant of 322,000 Dollars to help fund
the project for the initial three-year implementation stage. As
residents repay loans, funds will be recycled to assist additional
residents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 737 Rotary members in Africa will convene in Kampala
this week to exchange solutions to pressing problems facing the
region.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria '99 Worries FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a report Thursday by the Lagos-based Daily Times
newspaper, FIFA was particularly concerned about the state of
infrastructure meant for the championship, including some of the
stadia, hotels and television coverage.
</P>
<P>
While accepting an interview by the newspaper at FIFA's
headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, FIFA Secretary General
Michel Zen-Ruffinen said authorities in Nigeria must upgrade the
facilities to meet international standard before the games kick
off in April.
</P>
<P>
He said a FIFA delegation to be led by Jack Warner will be in N
igeria next week for the final inspection of the venues and
facilities that have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen was quoted as saying: "We have received different
reports on Nigeria, some positive, some negative. Some are still
alarming. We are worried about the safety of the stadia. There
are still problems with TV coverage and the hotels. These issues
would be checked by our visiting delegation."
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen, however, said that the hosting rights may not be
taken away from Nigeria, expressing confidence in what he called
"the enthusiasm of the Nigerian people for the game of football".
</P>
<P>

items in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The 45 Albanians found to be dead in the village of Racak
last week were surely killed by Serb forces, but numerous question
s remain as for whether they were executed or killed during
combat. Moreover, there was a time span of more than 12 hours
between the end of the combat on Friday and the discovery of the
corpses on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
-- Since it presented itself by claiming some attacks against
Serb police in 1995, the Albanian separatist force in Kosovo, the
KLA, has become a force which one cannot get away from in the
conflict of the Yugoslav province. The Western countries are
frightened by the radicalism shown by the KLA and prefer to
refrain from launching air strikes against Serb forces in fear of
aiding the KLA in the field.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi revealed the 45 events of
celebration in the program for welcoming the advent of the year
2000 on Wednesday. Among the programs are the decoration of the
Tower Eiffel by 20,000 flashes of lightning on the night of
December 31, 1999, a historical fresco on the Seine River, and
the turning of the Concorde Place into a gigantic sundial with
the Obelisk marking the fleeing of time.
</P>
<P>
-- While the killing in Racak continues to raise questions
about the situation around it, the United States said on
Wednesday that it is ready to strike Serb forces in Kosovo if the
NATO gave the green light. The U.S. aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise is on its way to the Adriatic Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures indicating the great changes that have taken place in the
Tibet Autonomous Region since the Democratic Reform was carried
out there in 1959:
</P>
<P>
Before the Democratic Reform was launched, the serfs and
slaves, making up 95 percent of the total population of Tibet,
were completely deprived of personal freedom and political
rights. The serf owners considered serfs and slaves their private
property, so they could trade and transfer them, present them as
gifts, use them as mortgages for debts and exchange them. It was
not until 1959 that the 13-Article Code and 16-Article Code,
which had been practiced for several hundred years in old Tibet,
were abolished, by which codes the Tibetan people were
classified, in explicit terms, into three classes and nine ranks
and put on an unequal footing in legal status.
</P>
<P>
The serf owners safeguarded the feudal serfdom with savage
punishments; they would frequently punish serfs and slaves by
gouging out their eyes, cutting off their ears, arms or legs,
drowning them or inflicting other terrible penalties.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Reform abolished the feudal serf system,
the Tibetan people, as the people of all other ethnic groups
throughout the country, have become the masters of their own
destiny and society, and won the political rights enjoyed by all
citizens as stipulated by the Chinese Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
All citizens in Tibet reaching the age of 18 have the right to
elect and to be elected, regardless of ethnic group, race, sex,
occupation, family background, religious belief, education,
property status or length of residence.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1993 when the township, county,
prefectural (city) and autonomous regional people's congresses
were elected, Tibet had 1,311,085 voters, making up 98.6 percent
of all citizens at or above 18 years of age, 91.6 percent of whom
participated in the elections. In some places 100 percent of the
voters took part.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tibet has 20 deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress, 80 percent of whom are from the Tibetan or
other ethnic minorities. Though the Moinba, Lhoba and other
ethnic minorities in Tibet have small populations, each of them
has its own deputies to the National People's Congress as well as
to the people's congresses at all levels in Tibet. The Living
Buddha Phabala Geleg Namgyal is vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since its founding in 1959, the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Tibet Regional Committee has
recruited large numbers of people of the Tibetan and other ethnic
minorities, as well as religious figures. Now several hundred
ethnic-minority people and religious figures are members of the
CPPCC Tibet Regional Committee. Even some people who were nobles
in old Tibet, such as Lhalu Tsewang Dorje and Domed Konchok
Palmo, are currently vice-chairmen of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional Committee of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
The legal codes of old Tibet stipulated: "Women are not to be
granted the right to discuss state affairs." This situation is
now no longer to be found in new Tibet. In 1998 female deputies
to the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress made up 20.09
percent of the total. Now Tibet has 573 women cadres at or above
the county level, and some Tibetan female judges, procurators,
police officers and lawyers for the first time in Tibetan history.
</P>
<P>
Both the crime and imprisonment rates of the Tibet Autonomous
Region are lower than the nation's average. The legal rights of
criminals are protected by law, and those who belong to ethnic
minorities or religious sects are not discriminated against, but
due consideration is given to their lifestyles and customs.
</P>
<P>
The government guarantees the provision of food, clothing,
shelter and articles of daily use for prison inmates. Each prison
in Tibet has separate dining facilities and diets for inmates of
different ethnic groups and provides for them Zanba (roasted
highland barley flour), buttered tea, sweet tea, etc. every
month.
</P>
<P>
Every prison has a clinic, and the number of prison doctors is
higher than the nation's average. Criminals enjoy rest days,
holidays and traditional ethnic festivals, in accordance with the
state's unified regulations. Prisoners may see visitors every
month, may win a reduction of penalty or be released on parole,
and may be given various awards according to law.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Fighting Between Taliban, Local Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were
killed Wednesday in fighting between the Taliban militia and a
local tribe in Afghanistan's southern province of Khost.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out when the Gurbuz tribe refused to obey
the militia's order to stop playing a traditional "egg fighting"
game, according to a report by the News Network International
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The game, in which two persons hold eggs and strike them until
one is broken, is very popular among Afghans, especially youth and
children, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the youth of the tribe were playing the game as
part of their celebrations for Eid, the holy Islamic festival,
when they were told by the Taliban that the game is prohibited in
the Islamic Sharia.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out when the youth refused to stop the game, in
which five Taliban fighters and seven young Gurbuz people were
killed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A women calling for an end to the fighting and two other people
received serious injuries, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Tension gripped the area after the fighting. No comment was
available from the Taliban who enforced strict Islamic laws in the
areas controlled by them which account for are some 80 percent of
the total area of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to Solve Outstanding Issues with Singapore in Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday spelled
out its stand that all outstanding issues with Singapore be
settled as a package as agreed on earlier by the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding issues include the dispute over Malaysia's
customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) facilities at the
Tanjong Pagar rail station in Singapore. The dispute broke out
last August when Singapore shifted its CIQ facilities from the
Tanjong Pagar station to its northern Woodlands checkpoint on
August 1, while Malaysia's immigration continues to operate from
there.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the CIQ facilities took a new twist when
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar reportedly told the
Singapore Parliament Wednesday that Malaysia must recognize
Singapore's sovereignty over the Tanjong Pagar issue first before
the two countries could proceed to resolve all outstanding
bilateral issues as a package.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his Singapore counterpart S. Jayakumar's
statement, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said here
Thursday the question of Malaysia disputing Singapore's
sovereignty and the setting of preconditions over the dispute did
not arise.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid told reporters at his residence that Kuala Lumpur's
position on the dispute was in accordance with the agreement
reached by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his Singapore
counterpart Goh Chok Tong during a meeting on the sidelines of the
Sixth ASEAN Summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, last month, who agreed then
that all bilateral issues, including water supply to Singapore,
would be settled as a package.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has never disputed Singapore's sovereignty, Syed Hamid
said, adding "The fact that we are staying in that place (to
operate our CIQ in Tanjong Pagar) doesn't mean that we are having
territorial claim over that property. We have no claim whatsoever
on that property. We are not saying that Singapore has no
sovereignty. It was never an issue."
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said he would respond to Jayakumar's letter to him
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian and Singapore officials would discuss the matter
after Eid al-Fitr, Syed Hamid said, adding "Let the officials sit
down and resolve all the issues."
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was no need for the matter to be
referred to the International Court Of Justice (IJC) in The Hague,
the Netherlands, as it was not a territorial dispute. Jayakumar
was quoted as saying that the dispute could not be taken to the
ICJ "unless both governments agree".
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid also referred to Goh's statement that all bilateral
issues should be resolved in a manner that would result in a
win-win situation for both countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we are trying to focus our position on," he said.
"I want it to be understood that here, we want to move from a
position of confrontation between the two countries, to a position
that we want to find solutions."

<HEADLINE> Inflation Hits Hard on Zimbabwe's Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The current high inflation has
negatively affected Zimbabwe's capacity to generate savings,
which are crucial for domestic investment, the Zimbabwean
central bank chief said.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here Wednesday, Governor of the Reserve
Bank, Leonard Tsumba said that the highly inflationary environment
had caused people to move away from holding on to money and other
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office quoted the latest inflation
figure for last December at 46.6 percent, an increase from that
of the previous month, which was 45.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are no prospects for a slowdown in the rate of inflation
because of the continued increase in the prices of food products
which are the largest contributor to the consumer price index,
Thursday's Herald newspaper quoted Tsumba as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most people are afraid of keeping their resources
in the form of savings or other financial assets because their
value will be eroded by inflation.
</P>
<P>
The savings ratio has not improved much to desired levels in
excess of 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), said
Tsumba.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Office, the savings ratio
has fallen to 9.3 percent of the GDP from 22 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Our investment initiatives have, thus, not generated much new
investment," said the central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
"This is really bad news for those who are unemployed.
Addressing this requires that we correct the prevailing high
inflation environment," he added.

for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's tough austerity policy.

The controversial measure that has already been voted down f

the pensions of some 300,000 federal retirees, cutting down their
benefits and saving the government an estimated 2.5 billion U.S.
dollars. Wednesday's vote of 352 against 143 approving the urgent
bill sent a clear message to foreign investors that Brazil is

<HEADLINE> Large Stores in Beijing Suffer Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Some one-third of the 109
large and medium-sized stores in this Chinese capital suffered
losses in 1998 because of stiff competition and poor management,
according to Zhang Qiubai, an official with the city's commercial
department.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the municipal statistics bureau show that
the retail sales volume for these stores reached 116.72 billion
yuan last year, an increase of 12.9 percent after price
adjustments, the highest growth rate in ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, the average profit per sale in these large stores was
only 2.9 percent, and 30 of them operated at a loss while 19
broke even, according to one statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, three large stores were forced to close in Beijing
due to severe competition and poor operations. Commercial experts
attribute these closings to too many department stores in the
city.
</P>
<P>
To date, the capital, with a population of 13 million, has 54
department stores with annual sales volumes of at least 100
million yuan, and another 120 of these giant shopping centers are
under construction.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested
Wednesday that a series of breaking-ins happening in the offices

Washington may be a scheme designed to embarrass him. But
Netanyahu did not explicitly accuse the Labor of staging the
burglaries.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern Wednesday became the
first world leader to fly into Gaza International Airport on an

Earlier, Ahern said the Palestinians should seek an overall
peace settlement with Israel rather than a quick declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Amir Peretz, leader of the Israeli Labor Union, said on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Find Fast Way To Detect Salmonella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the U.S.
Agriculture Department have developed a technique to rapidly
detect a deadly strain of salmonella bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Wednesday that the
researchers were now able to find the gene sequence of DT104, the
most dangerous strain of salmonella.
</P>
<P>
"This important research cuts identification time from six
weeks to two hours," Glickman added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said U.S. government hopes to develop test kits
that could detect the strain in blood samples or in runoff water
from animal production.
</P>
<P>
Salmonella has been linked to as many as 3.8 million illnesses
annually in the United States and was the second-most common
bacteria found in food poisoning cases in 1997, according to U.S.
Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria is estimated to cost billions of U.S. dollars in
lost productivity and medical costs in the United States every
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Telephone services were
interrupted throughout Zimbabwe Wednesday when engineers and
technicians from the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(PTC) staged a sit-in, demanding a salary increase.
</P>
<P>
The strike rendered telephone repairs and installation ceased

increment. But the PTC management refused it and agreed to award
an allowance of between 22 and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>

stations, said Wednesday that they would continue with the action

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Major Enterprises Granted Contract, Labor Trade Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- On January 8, 1,000 major
Chinese enterprises were granted the authority to engage in
foreign contract and labor service dealings in their own sectors,
according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
An Official at MOFTEC said this allows more businesses to take
part in the international labor market and raises China's share
of the international contract market, the International Business
Daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before this authority was granted, China had roughly 900
businesses that were permitted to engage in such activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China signed new contracts involving 14.4 billion
U.S. dollars and sent 350,000 people to work overseas, while
trade volume from this sectors reached 8.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to expand exports, the government has given more room
to exporting enterprises, as China's private firms were for the
first time given export and import license, while large
state-owned industrial enterprises now need only register rather
than having to apply for trade licenses.

<TEXT>
<P>
The agricultural, forestry, tobacco and military sectors have
ordered 36 million tons of chemical fertilizer to date.

<P>
Final figures are expected to show that China's chemical
fertilizer output for 1998 hit 29.25 million tons, up 7.3 percent

</P>
<P>
The structure of the chemical fertilizer industry continued to
improve in 1998, with the proportion of carbamide, sodium nitrate
and other high density chemical fertilizer products rising to 50
percent. The increase played an important role in achieving last
year's bumper harvest in spite of heavy summer flooding.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's traditional medicine
(TCM) administration has called for a crackdown on quack doctors.
</P>
<P>
Local TCM administrations are being asked to thoroughly check

Government organizations and institutions are no longer

Illegal medical practices have threatened people's health and
have damaged the reputation of Traditional Chinese medicine, the
administration says. The move follows the arrest of Hu Wanlin,
who was practicing medicine illegally and was involved in the
deaths of more than 100 people in central China's Henan Province.
</P>

HANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has already
seen more than half of its laid-off workers find reemployment
with the aid of society.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 179,000 laid-offs in the province
have found new jobs, of whom about half have entered the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
As the enterprise reform deepens, an increasing number of
workers become redundant, putting growing pressure on the
government and society.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the provincial governments at various
levels issued a series of regulations calling for practical
measures to tackle this problem.
</P>
<P>
Now, every state-owned enterprise with laid-off workers has
set up its own reemployment service center to provide help for
job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
Government departments and educational institutions have moved
to open technical training courses throughout the province, and
in about 140,000 laid-off workers have attended these courses and
have acquired one or more new skills.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China has authorized a number
of military academies to grant more advanced degrees in military
science.
</P>
<P>
Some 18,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers have
earned Master's and Doctor's degrees from military academies such
as the PLA Institute of International Relations, PLA Institute of
Electronics Engineering, Nanjing Artillery Institute and PLA
Institute of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
The new degree will mainly involve military science and
weapons engineering. Thirty-four military academies currently
grant doctor's degrees, with 65 offering master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
China introduced post-graduate education in military science
in 1985. The University of National Defense and 12 military
academies were authorized to award master's degrees in 1990, In
addition, three military academies, including the University of
National Defense, were authorized to granting doctor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
This year will witness the greatest increase in the number of
military science degrees awarded since 1986. The increased number

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean FM Urges to Sign SADC Defense Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge has urged Southern African Development Community
(SADC) member states to sign a mutual defense pact to ensure
peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to sign the proposed mutual defense
pact and establish a regional peace-keeping brigade if the region
is to effectively police all its flash points, Mudenge made the
remarks here Wednesday when addressing some regional military
officers.
</P>
<P>
About 50 regional military officers were attending a joint
command and staff course at the Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare,
the Herald daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a task that now brooks no delay and will have to be
accomplished soonest to ensure peace and stability in our region.
It is now our intention to pursue this matter with all the vigor
and urgency it deserves," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a strong SADC organ will be useful, not only
to SADC countries, but also to Africa as a whole and to the
entire world. A permanent elite squad should be kept on standby
ready to be deployed anywhere in the region at a moment's notice,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing a peace-keeping brigade was
recommended by military experts last year after visits to Denmark
and Bosnia where they familiarized themselves with peacekeeping
brigades there, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The proposed peace keeping brigade will be tasked to attend to
situations such as the prevailing one in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, he said, because the region does not have a brigade to
quell such disturbances, DRC President Laurent Kabila had to
invite Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe to send their troops to
help his soldiers fight the rebels, the Zimbabwean foreign
minister noted.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Waterpipe Unearthed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian archaeologist has
disclosed that he has unearthed the oldest aqueduct of its kind in
Egypt in the Nile Delta, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Manfred Bietak told reporters that the 3,500-year-old water
channel, half a meter in diameter, was discovered during
excavations beneath an ancient royal citadel in Tell El-Daba'a in
the east of the Nile delta,
</P>
<P>
Bietak, head of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo,
described the finding as "sensational," saying it was the only
known pre-Roman example of such an underground water channel.
</P>
<P>
"The waterpipe is very well built with covers and inspection
shafts," he said, adding that inscriptions are still visible at
some points.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologist expressed hope that the aqueduct would lead
him to a long sought-after palace.
</P>
<P>
In theory, the channel was built to carry water from the Nile
to the Palace of the Hyksos, who ruled in Egypt from about 1640
B.C. to 1530 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Bietak said his team were now trying to trace the course of the
aqueduct to the palace.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Gives Housing Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern China's Tianjin
Municipality will complete the demolition of another 1.2 million
square meters of one-storey houses which are in a dangerous
condition this year, with total investment estimated to be 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang Dehui, vice-mayor of the city, insisted that the
municipal government attaches great importance to new housing
construction and encourages investment, especially as the real
estate sector has been playing an important role in increasing
domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from last year show that three to four percentage
points of the nine percent of Tianjin's economic growth rate last
year was due to housing and infrastructure construction, with the
growth rate of real estate last year exceeding 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The living space per capita in Tianjin, one of the four China's
municipalities, is only 7.9 square meters. Therefore, the
municipal government made a promise in 1994 that all the
one-storey houses in a dangerous condition in the city would be
demolished within five to seven years. So far, 6.4 million square
meters have been cleared and renovated, and five of the six urban
areas have accomplished their assignments.
</P>
<P>
Officials stress that economical housing construction is their
core task this year, with a target of 4 million square meters, 3
million of which will go onto the open market. Investment by Hong
Kong entrepreneurs will be the main financial source.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Maluku Governor Calls for Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Maluku Governor Moh
Saleh Latuconsina has called on residents of Ambon, capital city
of the province, to restrain themselves, and not be easily be
provoked by the situation following riots on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Let us restrain ourselves and not be easily provoked by the
situation to take revenge and other violence actions," he told
reporters Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the call as the situation in Ambon remained
tense on the third day of riots.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that he was shocked by the riots, the first
ever in Ambon, which have claimed at least 20 lives and injured
more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the violence, the first after the end of
the Islamic fasting month, was sparked by Tuesday night's clash
between Muslims from Batumerah village and a bus driver from the
neighboring Christian-dominated village of Mardika. The ensuing
quarrel escalated into an open clash between the two villages.
</P>
<P>
"In order to control the situation, I call on the people to
remain at home during the night, except for something urgent,"
Latuconsina was quoted by Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although no curfew is imposed, the governor called on security
authorities to launch patrols in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, religious leaders in Ambon have also called on the
communities to introspect.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the situation in Ambon
remained tense and the city was paralyzed as there were no traffic
and social activities in this provincial capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were activities in government offices, while markets and
shopping complexes remained closed. This has in turn made it
difficult for people to buy things, particularly foods.
</P>
<P>
Due to technical reasons such as the impact of the riots, local
newspapers were not published and local radio stations were also
off the air on Thursday. The Ambon airport was closed to all
except military flights.
</P>
<P>
Police and military centers in Ambon were packed with thousands
of people, including ethnic Chinese, seeking refuge.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed last Thursday's rioting in Dobo on the
island of Aru, Southeast Maluku, in which eight people died and
dozens more were injured and 58 houses were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Sabbang, Luwu, around 470 kilometers north of the
South Sulawesi provincial capital of Ujungpandang, local Muslims
were unable to celebrate Idul Fitri (feast celebrating the end of
fasting period) in the normal fashion because of continued
sporadic clashes between different ethnic groups in the area. The
clashes first began in the area on January 11.
</P>
<P>
In a separate riot in the West Java city of Cirebon, about 200
kilometers east of Jakarta, rival gangs fought each other and
threw rocks at riot police on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of serious injuries after the clash. The
cause of the riot was not immediate clear.
</P>
<P>
The Ambon, Dobo and Cirebon rampages were the latest in a
series of religion-related clashes to hit Indonesia as it wrestles
with its worst financial crisis in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Soaring inflation, unemployment and poverty rates fuel social
tensions.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, President B.J. Habibie, government and
military officials, as well as religious leaders have called for
tolerance among followers of different religions after dozens of
churches and mosques were attacked and set on fire by members of
rival faiths in several areas.

SHENYANG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A rescue team has recovered
the body of one of the 10 miners missing since a gas explosion
rocked the Magu Coal Mine on January 18 in the suburbs of
Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Provincial Administration of the Coal Industry
offered little hope today that the remaining nine miners survived
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The body was recovered in a heavily damaged shaft, with
rescue efforts proceeding slowly due to the extensive destruction
caused by the explosion. The pace of rescue effort is expected
to quicken with the completion of repairs on ventilators by noon
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Monday's explosion killed one miner instantly, with six
miners sustaining injuries and another 10 men listed as missing.
The cause of the accident is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned mine operated by the Shenyang Coal
Corporation has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Rains Allay Dar es Salaam Residents' Fear of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Water in Tanzania's Ruvuma
River has risen slowly due to rains in the past few days, giving
relief to three million residents in the capital Dar es Salaam who are
gripped with fears of water shortages.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the level of water at the Upper Ruvu pump station had
moved above the normal level of 16 meters, compared with 15.80 meters
last week, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water,
Idriss Mtulia,was quoted by media reports as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has suffered a drought since last October due to the adverse
effects of La Nina weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA) last week
said that the water pumps at the station would be forced to shut down
when water dropped to 15.55 meters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the blessing of rains, Mtulia said, DAWASA will continue to
practise water rationing system. He advised residents in the city to
store water with tanks.
</P>
<P>
Inconveniences caused by water shortages for nearly ten days in May
last year still remain fresh in local residents' memories. After
flooding damaged a delivery pipe outside Dar es Salaam, citizens had
to queue up waiting to fetch water from wells, while sanitation was
badly affected with no water to flush toilets.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa said the
government plans to use wells to solve an imminent water crisis in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He called on residents in the city to save water by using
treated water for gardening and car washing, and appealed to people
to understand the current situation and avoid being selfish in using
water at will.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a lasting solution to water shortage in Dar es
Salaam is to build more dams. However, implementing the projects is
hindered by lack of money.

<HEADLINE> General Motors' Profit Rises To Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp., the
world's largest automaker, said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter
earnings jumped 13 percent, a record fourth-quarter profit, said
a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
GM's October-December profit rose to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars,
compared with the previous fourth-quarter record of 1.7 billion
dollars set in 1997. Revenues totaled 46.4 billion dollars, down
two percent from 47.1 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
For the year, the GM had less to cheer about. Last summer's
strikes left it with a profit of three billion dollars, compared
to 6.3 billion dollars earned in 1997. Revenues for the year
totaled 161.3 billion dollars, down from 171.2 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
GM's home market was largely responsible for the big gain in
the fourth quarter, the report said, adding that its North
American operations earned 1.6 billion dollars, a record for any
quarter. The previous record was 841 million dollars in the last
year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said GM's earnings were boosted by lower
spending on rebates and other incentives, down to 1,161 dollars a
vehicle from 1,732 dollars during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said GM's latest financial report indicated the
industry's long-lumbering giant was finally awakening after years
of restructuring, labor unrest, cost-cutting and overhauling its
vast line of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
GM chairman Jack Smith, however, warned that the weak market
conditions in Asia and Latin America will continue to pose
challenges to the GM this year.

<HEADLINE> Oil Giant Announces Natural Gas Production Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC), one of the country's industry leaders, plans to produce
16 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fucai, general manager of CNPC, told reporters today that
his company also aims to verify 94 billion cubic meters of
natural gas reserves this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that although China has huge development potential,
its utilization of natural gas resources remains at a low level
and should be improved.
</P>
<P>
According to an oil and natural gas resources survey, China
has an estimated 38 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, and
verified reserves stand at 1.25 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The output of the four leading natural gas zones of Xinjiang,
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Sichuan-Chongqing, and Qinghai amounted to
10.42 billion cubic meters last year. It has been predicated that
in the year 2000, these four major zones will reach a combined
production capacity of 16 billion cubic meters, and that by 2010,
capacity will be raised to 45 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Since natural gas resources are located in the central and
western regions of the country while the market is mainly in
eastern region, China is now drawing up a plan to lay pipelines
linking east and west, Ma disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary proposal, trunk pipelines linking
Sichuan-Chongqing with Shanghai, and Qinghai with Lanzhou will be
completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The second step will be to lay pipelines connecting Xinjiang
with Qinghai, which will be eventually connected with the
pipelines between Sichuan-Chongqing, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and
Shanghai, and between Qinghai and Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Against Modern Influences on World Heritage Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Many World Heritage sites in
China are facing damage from modern industries, commercial
centers, mass tourism and urbanization, the Guangming Daily
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China now has 21 World Heritage sites, including the Temple of
Heaven and the Summer Palace in Beijing which were added to the
list by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But UNESCO specialists have urged China to protect these sites
completely and maintain their original appearance, the
Beijing-based national newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Xie Ninggao, a professor with the World Heritage Research
Center at Beijing University, said that all the sites must be
preserved, and called urbanization, commercialization and
modernization "destruction" to this effort.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the building of some infrastructure
features and deluxe guest houses near these historic sites, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Experts have urged that all preservation activities be in line
with international conventions governing World Heritage
protection, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Private Higher Vocational Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 Chinese high
school graduates will enter colleges this autumn to receive
non-government-run vocational education, adding a new element to
the country's educational system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will increase enrollment quotas by
100,000 this year for private higher vocational education, and
give more freedom to some provinces and municipalities for
enrolling students, said Ji Baocheng, director of the Development
and Planning Department under the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new feature of this program is that students
will pay their own tuition fees, and the government will no
longer be responsible for providing jobs for graduates.
</P>
<P>
Non-government-run higher vocational education will train
special technicians and thereby lessen enrollment pressure on
high school graduates while allowing more freedom to
provincial-level education departments.
</P>
<P>
China now has 110 colleges responsible for training
technicians, and candidates must pass the national college
entrance examination.
</P>
<P>
Ji said the Ministry of Education has begun higher vocational
education on a trial basis in Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
Fujian, Shandong and Hubei provinces, and in Beijing and
Shanghai, with each locality enrolling between 3,000 to 10,000
students. Colleges can only enroll students who live within their
provinces.
</P>
<P>
China's colleges will enroll 1.3 million students this year,
220,000 more than last year and the largest number since 1
986.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials Give Warning to IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One government official said on condition of anonymity that the
Thai government shared the view that the IMF had underestimated
the extent of the crisis when it worked out a bailout package to
help Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The official echoed the view of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
who said earlier that the IMF had taken a "narrow view" of the
crisis and failed to predict the crisis to expand into a full
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said: "They made many forecasts in many areas, but they
had a narrow view and assumed that the situation would be similar
to Mexico, which had a crisis that was limited to just one
country."
</P>
<P>
The IMF, in its report available here Thursday, admitted for
the first time that it had misjudged the severity of the slump.
But it insisted that under its guidance the three worst-hit
countries were now poised to emerge from recession.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved about 100 billion U.S. dollars in rescue funds
for Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia following the baht float.
</P>
<P>
"The program projections badly misgauged the severity of the
downturn," the IMF report said.
</P>
<P>
"Very few foresaw the severity of the downturn -- neither the
authorities, the private sector, nor academic observers," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials said the IMF risked making the same
mistakes again in Brazil, which has recently floated its currency.
The IMF also rushed to Brazil's rescue.
</P>
<P>
The officials suggested that the IMF reform package be
flexible and able to bend to circumstances as every problem was
different, case by case.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Thailand's Senate Speaker Meechai
Ruchuphan called on the government to review its commitments to
the IMF in the wake of the organization's admissions.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, should learn to gradually step out of
the IMF's shadow now that economic recovery is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should not toe the IMF line for too long, he said,
suggesting that the government negotiate with the lending agency
to relax some economic rescue measures next time it renews loans.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Boost Australian Economy by 4.1 Bln U.S. Dollars:Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's Olympic Games in
2000 would boost the nation's economy by 6.5 billion Australian
dollars (4.1 billion U.S. dollars), a comprehensive study
released Thursday revealed.
</P>
<P>
However, serious cost over-runs or significant wage rises as a
result of the 2000 games would threaten the benefits, a study by
Arthur Andersen (AA) and the Centre for Regional Economic
Analysis (CREA) found.
</P>
<P>
The study assessed the effect of the games on the national and
New South Wales economies between 1994-95 and 2005-06, AA partner
Philip Anderson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the Olympics would add about 6.5 billion Australian
dollars to Australia's gross domestic product (in present value
terms) over the 12 year period.
</P>
<P>
About 2.5 billion Australian dollars (1.6 billion U.S.
dollars) of the increase in GDP would go towards a rise in real
household consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this boost to the economy annually 7,500
full-time equivalent jobs will be generated (on average) over the
full 12 year period," according to Anderson.
</P>
<P>
"The study reports very positive impacts resulting from Sydney
hosting the games, benefits which will impact on almost every
sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits are realistic because they take account of
resource constraints."
</P>
<P>
CREA director John Madden said the construction, transport,
communication, restaurant and accommodation industries would do
best from the games.
</P>
<P>
Madden said the study also looked at a range of economic
conditions which may prevail at the time of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said one scenario looked at the effect of the Asian crisis,
which could reduce the number of overseas tourists visiting the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Even a worst-case reduction in expected tourist numbers would
reduce the Olympics' impact on economic activity by only a
quarter."
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of the Olympics are dependent, however, on the
games not experiencing serious cost over-runs or inducing
significant wage rises," he said.

<HEADLINE> Polish Vice Premier Warns Economy May Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy could be
devastated by reform which would also lead to a worsening of
living conditions, warned Polish Vice Prime Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz in a report published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Memorandum of Pre-warning, was handed to
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on January 18.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Balcerowicz, who is also the country's finance
minister, said the lack of supervisory measures over public
finance and the slow pace of privatization carried out by the
last government, which was replaced by the current governing
union in late 1997, are the main threats to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The policies of the new government and the financial chaos in
world markets have only made the economy worse, he added.
</P>
<P>
Balcerowicz warned that despite the progress in the
privatization of banking and telecommunication systems and the
emerging reforms in retirement pensions, education and
agriculture, the problems unresolved by the previous government
have become more serious.
</P>
<P>
He especially criticized the public health department for its
"most inefficient" management, saying its debt hit more than 6
billion zloty (1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the future, many more people will be entering the job
market, but Poland's economy is not prepared and there are not
enough jobs available, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Inspector
General of Police Lucky Kodituwakku has directed all police
stations to take action against ragging in schools and
universities, police sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the anti-ragging law passed last year, those accused of
ragging face jail terms with hard labor for five to ten years if
found guilty of sexual harassment or physical harm to victims.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the management of institutions who do not take
adequate preventive measures are also liable for punitive action.
</P>
<P>
A suspected ragger can be detained by the police for six months
without bail.
</P>
<P>
The law became necessary last year as ragging had run rampant
in schools and universities, leaving two undergraduates died
following ragging at their institutions.
</P>
<P>
A student or staff member of an institution convicted of
offenses under the law will be expelled from the institute and
will not be admitted to any other institution, said the sources.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombian troops
detained five alleged paramilitary gunmen on Wednesday, one day
after the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
suspended peace talks with the government in protest against the
continued existence of pro-government paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
The detainees had in their possession a blacklist of about 100
alleged supporters of the FARC, Colombia's top leftist guerrilla
group, whom the detainees targeted for execution or death
threats, a usual practice of the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
The detentions came one week after President Andres Pastrana
ordered the eradication of the ultra-right groups, that
assassinated some 140 people during the three days between

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, U.S. Sign Garment Quota Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and the United States
trade delegation signed a garment quota pact Wednesday evening at
the Ministry of Commerce, ending a four-day negotiation.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact, the two sides reached an agreement on
quotas for 12 different kinds of textile exports to the United
States. In most categories, the limits are the same as or higher
than current export levels.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia demanded four exemptions from the ceilings. The
quota-free items are dresses, pajamas, women's suits and
synthetic-fiber apparel, the Cambodian Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sets ceilings on exports of cotton trousers and
shorts, knit shirts and blouses, gloves and mittens and nine other
items.
</P>
<P>
The ceilings apply to exports starting this year. In most
categories, the limit on exports will be eased six percent each
year for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that represents a victory for Cambodia, which had
feared lower quotas might hurt the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important milestone in trade between Cambodia
and the United States," Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh, head of
the Cambodian negotiation team, said after the signing ceremony.
"We are happy to secure more jobs for Cambodian workers and more
opportunities for foreign investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the agreement also contains a provision
requiring the Cambodian government to improve labor conditions at
garment factories.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has benefited from special trade privileges from the
United States since 1996 when the later granted Cambodia the Most
Favored Nation status. Garment manufacturing has since been the
fast-growing industry in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports from Cambodia in 1998 have been estimated at
360 million U.S. dollars from 26.5 million in 1995, with
three-fourths of the total going to the United States.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 110 garment factories in Cambodia which
employed a total of more than 72,000 workers. Another 139 new
factories, 180 million worth of investment, have been approved.

<HEADLINE> Science to Help China Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China will try to help people
in poor and remote areas get out of poverty by teaching them more
scientific knowledge, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper has learnt from the Ministry of Science and
Technology that ministries and commissions under the State
Council, and governmental and non-governmental institutions will
make a determined push over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will focus on Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces,
and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions -- frontier
or remote areas in northwest China which contain the bulk of the
country's ethnic groups and poverty-stricken population, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will help introduce dozens of advanced
agro-techniques each year into the regions. These techniques
include the cultivation of high-yield crop seeds, more efficient
utilization of fertilizers, water-saving irrigation and advanced
growing technologies, said vice-minister Xu Guanhua.
</P>
<P>
Another important task is publishing more video and books on
topics of sanitation and health, environmental protection and
scientific knowledge dissemination, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
These publications will be given to people living in these
regions and help them gain scientific knowledge, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He added his ministry has already presented more than 2,400
scientific video documents to 400 counties in five regions.
</P>
<P>
A campaign of "introducing culture, health and science and
technology to the countryside,' which was launched three years
ago by the Publicity Department of the Central Party Committee
and several other departments, has won acclaim from regional
people, according to the China Association for Science and
Technology (CAST) -- China's largest non-governmental institution
focusing on scientific knowledge dissemination.

<HEADLINE> Thai Pushs to prevent New Non-Tariff Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preventing the rise on non-tariff trade barriers was essential
for Thailand as the country's agricultural products are less
competitive in other markets, said Somkiati Ariyapruchya,
director-general of the Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
Somkiati made the comment Wednesday after the national APEC
committee, chaired by Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, met to work
out Thailand's proposal to the 21-member grouping this year, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have agreed to open up trade with tariff
reductions to zero and 5 percent in priority areas by the year
2005, accelerating the pace from previous agreements which set a
time-frame for removal of tariff by 2020 for developing countries
and 2010 for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Non-tariff barriers, including sanitary and environmental
standards, have not yet been substantially addressed by the
grouping. Thai exporters, however, are facing more intense
pressure to ensure their products comply with standards set by
importing countries.
</P>
<P>
Somkiati said Thailand would push the grouping to further
support small and medium enterprises, which account for 35 percent
of exports and create 80 percent of job opportunities within the
region.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Urges Belgrade to Revoke Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe Wednesday urged Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to revoke its decision to expel the OSCE's
Kosovo Verification Mission chief William Walker.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE also condemned last week's killing of 45 ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government Monday ordered William Walker to leave
the country within 48 hours after he claimed that Yugoslav police
had killed 45 ethnic Albanian civilians. Belgrade said the ethnic
Albanians killed were terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE demand was raised in a statement issued after a
troika meeting attended by the current OSCE chairman Norwegian
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, his predecessor Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek, and the next OCSE chairman Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Yugoslavia to allow the International
Criminal Tribunal in the Hague to carry out investigation into
the killing. U.N. war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour has been
refused entry at the Yugoslav border to go to Racak for probe.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said that the OSCE is still making efforts to seek a
political settlement of the Kosovo crisis and avoid NATO's
military attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said he will go to Belgrade to talk with Yugoslav leaders
but did not disclose the date.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo. They have been fighting for Kosovo independence from
Yugoslavia, where Serbians are the dominant ethnic group.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry has accounted
for 30 percent of the rise in income for China's farmers in the
last several years, according to a recent report by the Ministry

In some less-developed regions, half the per capita income
comes from animal husbandry, which has also become the most

Because it can be developed relatively fast and with a smaller

<HEADLINE> Mexico Can Avoid Effects of Brazil FinanciaL Turmoil: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico was able to avoid
the affects of the financial turmoil in Brazil because of
policies implemented by the government after the Mexican economic
crisis in 1994, said World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn was quoted by Mexican newspapers Wednesday as
saying that Mexico and Argentina, the two countries hit hard by
the 1994 Mexican peso crisis, or "tequila effect," have insulated
themselves from Brazil's turbulence due to their improved fiscal
and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Latin American ambassadors in
Washington, Wolfensohn said he was optimistic that Brazil's
currency would stabilize after last week's devaluation of the
real.
</P>
<P>
But after-effects of the turmoil will be felt in Latin America
and could lead to the slowdown of economic growth in 1999, he
said, noting that Mexico could also be influenced by a worldwide
slump in prices of crude oil, the export of which now makes up
nearly 40 percent of the Mexican government's revenues.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of stabilizing the economy through
sound monetary and fiscal measures by a clean government, the
reforms of the justice system, and a strong social infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) President Enrique I
glesias was also quoted as predicting a nearly one-percent real
growth of gross domestic product in Latin America this year,
while the index in 1997 stood at an average of 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Iglesias said Mexico should improve its wealth redistribution
policy to narrow the widening gap between the richest and the
poorest citizens.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was hit by the so-called "tequila effect" just before
Christmas in 1994, when the administration of then President
Ernesto Zedillo devalued the peso and later allowed it to float
freely, which brought about a flight of capital and a loss of
confidence in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Demand for Refined oil Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's demand for refined
oil products slipped year-on-year by 10.3 percent from January
through November 1998 period, amid a 5.3 percent increase in the
use of indigenous natural gas, according to Figures released by
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of refined oil products stood at an average of
652,920 barrels a day, while demand for natural gas in lieu of
fuel oil was the equivalent of 215,900 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown reduced demand for oil products, while
increasing replacement of fuel oil with natural gas led to growth
in gas consumption.
</P>
<P>
Overall, total petroleum demand, excluding consumption by the
petrochemical sector but including natural gas, declined by 6.8
percent to 868,820 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
during the 11-month period, Thailand's crude oil import volume
dropped by 8.1 percent to 670,900 barrels a day while imports of
refined oil products plunged by 58.7 percent to 26,090 barrels a

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- There are at least 2,726 hot
springs with temperatures above 25 degrees C in China, according
to statistics from the Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Investigations indicate that most of the high-temperature hot
springs are in Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said that among 86 high
temperature hot springs in China, over 44 are located in western
Tibet, and that Tibet has established several large geothermal
power stations.
</P>
<P>
China also has many hot springs with moderate and lower
temperatures located in more than 20 provinces including
Guangdong and Fujian, and at the cities of Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
China expects to introduce more funds into the development of
geothermal resources at lower temperatures, which can be used for
central heating in urban areas and for the breeding of rare fish
species.
</P>
<P>
Pang Zhonghe, director of the Geothermal Energy Department of
the Geological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
today told Xinhua that some companies in south China's Guangdong
Province and east China Fujian Province are making hefty profits

NANJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- In 1978, a student in the
Chinese Department of prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai
bought a shirt with a checkered pattern but "had no guts" to wear
it himself. Instead, he offered 20 yuan to anyone in his class wh
o dared to put the shirt on and take a walk on campus.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, 20 yuan was a very large sum of money, but none
of us would dare do it. We all believed we would be accused of
having the decadent thoughts of the petty bourgeoisie if we put
that shirt on," recalled Lu Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Lu, now in his 40s, went to the United States in the late
1980s and is now a naturalized citizen there.
</P>
<P>
When Lu had a reunion with his former classmates at their alma
mater last year, they made fun of each other with this anecdote,
which now sounds ridiculous to modern-day Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Tremendous changes have taken place to the minds of the
Chinese people over the past two decades," said Lu. "I call it a
revolution of the heart and soul."
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the Chinese people lived in a
relatively-confined ideological environment, and practically
there was no emancipation of mind then despite the fact that
every one has a brain of his own, said Ren Yi, a self-employed
businessman in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
When he was young, Ren wrote a long poem complaining about the
government policy of sending young urban students to the remote
and poor countryside for hard labor and so-called "farmers'
reeducation," and he almost lost his life for it.
</P>
<P>
"Now things are totally different. Everyone is entitled to
think and air his views freely without limits or intervention,
and ordinary people can openly express opinions different from
government policy. Some good suggestions can even reach the ears
of the top state leadership," Ren observed.

<P>
Hu Fuming, a professor at the University of Nanjing in east
China's Jiangsu Province, attributes the great change in the
mentality of the Chinese people to the great debate on the
criterion for judging truth, which raged through China in 1978.
</P>
<P>
This debate, which was ignited by an article written by
Professor Hu and later earned the full support of late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, finally reached the conclusion that
practice is the sole criterion for judging the truth.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the Communist Party of China (CPC) restored and
carried forward its fine ideological principle of seeking truth
from facts. This principle is just like a key, which over the
past two decades has gradually opened the gate of free thinking
for the Chinese people," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Shen Rongfa, secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee of the
city of Wujiang in Jiangsu, noted that as a result of the cult of
personality, the Chinese people used to take great men's words
and theories as the only criterion for judging what is right and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Now they have realized that everything, including major
government policies and decisions, must stand the test of their
own practice before it can be accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen's opinion was echoed by Xu Jinmu, a farmer in Wujiang's
Badu Town, who found that the top Party and government leaders in
China are attaching increasing importance to the successful
experiences in practice of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that our fine ideas and practices will have an
impact on the policy decisions of the central authorities," he
said confidently.

<HEADLINE> Chewing Gum Found Effective in Preventing Mouth Ulcers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have found
that chewing gum can be effective in preventing mouth ulcers, a
common disease that often occurs among cancer patients following
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Clinical research suggests that patients who chew gum for half
an hour after meals and before sleeping every day run a 50
percent-lower risk of suffering ulcerative stomatitis than those
who do not, according to a report in Health News.
</P>
<P>
Mouth ulcers can lead to stomatic bleeding or even infections
in other parts of the body, and they often occur after the mucous
membrane of the mouth is damaged by chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, according to researchers at the Tumor Hospital
under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
This special property of chewing gum was discovered by a nurse
at the hospital who then advised cancer patients to brush their
teeth and chew gum before undergoing chemotherapy and
radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
"Cleaning the teeth is vital for preventing mouth ulcers,"
said nurse Gao Yunyue.

<HEADLINE> UK Ministers to Visit Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- British ministers will pay a
series of visits to Middle East countries in the near future for
talks on what way to take with Iraq, a Foreign Office official
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to talk to our allies and friends about the situation
after Desert Fox," Junior Foreign Minister Derek Fatchett told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be opening up our own diplomatic contacts with the Arab
world after the Ramadan holiday," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that British Defense Secretary George
Robertson would next week be visiting Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates and Qatar, while Foreign Secretary Robin Cook planned to
visit the Middle East soon.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said he himself would meet members of various Iraqi
opposition groups over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain last month launched
four-day-long air strikes, code-named Operation Desert Fox,
against Iraq. The operation was suspended on December 20, after
the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
As Ramadan will end in most Muslim countries on Tuesday, it is
believed that British ministers' visits to the Gulf region would
be a new step taken by the country to seek support from Arab
countries for its position of toppling Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Britain vowed last month to give more support to
various opposition groups trying to oust Saddam Hussein.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has borrowed 600 million yuan from the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China to reinforce the Yangtze River Dikes within the
province.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to consolidate the 211 km-long levees
between Jianli city and Wuhan city, a part that is crucial to the
safety of the capital of Hubei and Beijing to Guangzhou Railway
line. Work will begin on May 1st.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the central government had announced
plans to spend more than 1.6 billion yuan in Hubei's water
conservancy projects between last winter and this spring, but
only one-tenth of the fund can be used for reinforcing the
Yangtze River levees, hence the loan.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A joint inspection team has
been created in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
to check the quality of the boilers there after an explosion
killed one person and injured a number of others on January 14 in
a Shizuishan Coal Mine Administration mine here.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors, who are staff personnel from the regional
economic and trade, labor and personnel, technical supervision,
and public security departments, will rectify boiler production
and supervise operations while helping to train qualified
operators.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the regional government's efforts to carry out
the instructions of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who called for
tight safety control on boilers on January 16, after the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,177 industrial boilers and 3,974 high-pressure
containers throughout the region, and about 87 percent of the
boiler explosions that occurred in the region over the past few
years were caused by illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
Two other boiler explosions have occurred in Ningxia already
this year, leaving one dead and two injured.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Supreme Court Approves Plan for Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Supreme Court said
Wednesday that it has approved President-elect Hugo Chavez' plan
to call a referendum to create a popular assembly with the power
of rewriting the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The court based its ruling on two requests to determine the
legality of a referendum. The requests were presented by a group
of lawyers in October 1998 and in January this year.
</P>
<P>
During his electoral campaign, Chavez proposed the creation of
a National Constituent Assembly to draft what he called a new,
more democratic constitution.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition parties were opposing Chavez' plan,
claiming the existing 1961 constitution should first be changed
through reform in Congress, a process that could take more than
one year.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who takes office on February 2, threatened to disband
Congress if it blocks his plan, saying he would order a
referendum by presidential decree on February 15 to create the
assembly of about 100 elected members.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, called on to make a decisive ruling, judged
that Chavez would be within the law to call a referendum, "Since
it deals with a matter of great national importance."

SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Chongming Green
Food Zone, China's first state-level pollution-free food
production center, has greatly improved its infrastructure and is
now ready for both Chinese and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
An official from the local government said that foreign-funded
enterprises will enjoy tax breaks and other favorable policies.
He told that the area is well equipped with power, irrigation,
telecommunications and other facilities. All its former low-yield
land has been upgraded.

The 32,000-hectare zone, set up two years ago, is located on
Chongming Island, China's third largest island at the mouth of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The zone is divided into six parts, concentrating on rice,
special aquatic products, vegetables, food processing,
eco-agriculture and breeding of fine strains respectively.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Parts of Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A severe drought has hit the
winter-spring crop in the northern provinces, and similar problems
are expected to afflict the southern provinces in upcoming growing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports here, rainfall in the northern
provinces during the first few months of the winter-spring crop is
expected to be 20-40 percent lower than in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The winter-spring crop in the northern region is considered the
anchor of the country's agricultural productivity in this growing
season, but northern rivers, which are vital for irrigation, are
currently at levels 20-50 percent lower than the average level of
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the southern region's weather bureau has predicted
that the southern provinces are expected to face more fresh water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The lack of fresh water is clearly manifested in the high rate
at which sea water is invading rivers, both north and south.
</P>
<P>
The salt percentage in all southern river mouths has reached
its highest level in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's government has ordered to scrutinize their
reservoirs and irrigation systems while closely managing the use
of water.
</P>
<P>
Other measures in the works include guarding river mouths
against sea water invasions and helping farmers transplant their
crops to avoid drought damage.

LHASA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An air route linking Lhasa,
capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, and Xining,
capital of the northwestern Qinghai Province, will open on
February 1, the Tibet Regional Civil Aviation Administration
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-km air route, which traverses the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau known as "the Roof of the World," will become the sixth
air corridor between Tibet and the rest of the country.

An official with the China Southwestern Airlines, which will
operate the route, said it will use only Boeing 757s for the
twice-a-week flight of 2 hours and 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"As complicated weather patterns and flying conditions pose
great challenges for this flight, we have selected a highly
competent crew with vast flying experience to ensure passenger
safety and comfort," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new air route will also be coordinated with
the Xining-Beijing route, to become the third direct air link
between Lhasa and the Chinese capital, following the
Lhasa-Chengdu-Beijing and Lhasa-Xi'an-Beijing routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is soon to adopt a
master plan to combat alcohol, drugs and tobacco on the
recommendations of a Presidential Task Force, the official Daily
News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A special unit under President Chandrika Kumaratunga will be
set up to monitor the implementation of the plan, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Community level support systems and regional police enforcement
will be mobilized to implement the plan. Samurdhi (Welfare)
animators will be used to identify community problems regarding
alcohol, drugs and tobacco and suicides, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said non-alcohol zones will be declared in the
vicinity of sacred places and schools. Smoking and the use of
drugs will also be prohibited in these zones.
</P>
<P>
The display of brand names of alcohol and cigarettes will also
be prohibited in these zones, said the reports, adding that
schools will not be able to obtain the sponsorship of liquor and
tobacco manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Last November the Ministry of Education and Higher Education
had issued a circular prohibiting any act that would promote
smoking, alcohol consumption or use of drugs inside the schools.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reportedly imposed the ban in accordance with the
government's policy with regard to smoking, alcohol consumption
and drug abuse.

McDyess, 24, was acquired by Phoenix in a three-team trade in

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Operating Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that in 1998 China's stock market operated smoothly and
continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of companies listed on
domestic markets had reached 851, an increase of 106, or 14
percent, for the year, according to Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of
the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual national stock and futures regulatory
working meeting held today, Zhou said that by the end of the year
the total market value had exceeded 1.95 trillion yuan,
accounting for 24.46 percent of the gross domestic product; and
the number of registered investors reached 39 million.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, a total of 120 Chinese enterprises listed
stocks on both domestic and overseas markets, 157 enterprises
offered A shares, and two companies issued convertible bonds, all
with an aggregate capital-raising volume of 84.14 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, six securities investment funds were listed on
domestic markets with a combined volume of 12 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of both domestic and international
factors, the secondary market was comparatively bearish, but the
fluctuations of stock indices were clearly reduced and the
stability of market operations further improved.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year the CSRC actively promoted securities
regulatory system reform and reinforced efforts to rectify stock
and futures markets in a bid to prevent stock market risks.
</P>
<P>
Effective efforts were also made to support the development of
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, including the
listing of 30 key state enterprises, nine new and high-tech
enterprises, and 16 infrastructure companies.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC also encouraged listed companies to acquire or annex
state-owned companies which are suffering losses but have good
prospects, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stated that last year good results and experiences were
achieved in both the supervision and development of the
securities industry, which is critical to the long-term steady
development of the securities market.

<HEADLINE> Experts Cite Dangerous Levee Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Areas along the Yangtze River,
especially areas ravaged by last summer's record flooding, are
engaged in the extensive construction of levees and water
conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that a number of localities simply raised
the height of levees rather than focusing on the project quality
might "do more harm than good", according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Some localities have raised the height of levees while
ignoring design and engineering standards, as well as requireme
nts. The fact that others have altered designs without notifying
experts and relevant departments has resulted in substandard
engineering quality.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xueying, deputy chief engineer for the Yangtze River
Water Conservancy Committee under the Ministry of Water
Resources, pointed out that the weakness of levees along the
Yangtze rests principally with the substandard engineering
quality of embankment bases and the outdated seepage control
technology used during construction.
</P>
<P>
"The problems led to a number of breaches during last summer's
heavy flooding and threatened the integrity of levees throughout
the Yangtze River Valley," said Chen, adding that "blindly
raising the height of levees does more harm than good in terms of
water conservation projects.'
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that levees should be designed in accordance
with local conditions. Local governments should strengthen
engineering quality supervision and promote the use of new
technology for water conservancy projects.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Company Discovers New Black Sea Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania's petroleum company
Petrom has discovered a new oilfield in the Black Sea, which is
believed to be the largest ever discovered in decades in the
country, Petrom Chairman Ioan Popa announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new oilfield has a commercial potential value of 2-5
billion U.S. dollars, the Romanian news agency quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted the oilfield can meet the country's
demand for petroleum for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The new oilfield, jointly discovered by Petrom and the U.S.
Western Atlas petroleum company after four years of survey, is
located 3,000 meters deep in the sea, somewhere on the Histria
plate in the western area of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The new field is only 10 kilometers away from Romania's Black
Sea oil platform, and some 90 kilometers away from Constanta, the
largest harbor on the Black Sea
</P>
<P>
Due to its favorable geographic location, the new oilfield is
expected to be producing oil within three years. Construction of
the new field is estimated at about 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the number one oil producer in central and eastern
Europe and produced 6.3 million tons of petroleum last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has four Black Sea oil platforms,
which are yielding 1.5 million tons of crude oil yearly, which is
more than 12 percent of the country's total crude output.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Export Drops Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chile's export volume dropped
to 13.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11 months of 1998, 14.6
percent lower than the same period in 1997, said a top official
of Chile's National Exporters Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit totaled 2.6 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most affected sectors were wood products with a 13.99
percent decline over the same period in 1997, followed by fishing
with a drop of 11.21 percent and agri-industrial products were
down 6.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fish flour, a major export for Chile as the world's second
largest producer after Peru, also went down in export volume.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing sectors were wine making, with a 20.09
percent increase in sales abroad. The export of flowers and
fruits registered a 5.86 percent growth and the export of
manufactured products climbed by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics did not include copper, Chile's main export
product, which is controlled by the state-run Copper Corporation
(Codelco).
</P>
<P>
Chile's exports are expected to be stable this year, though a
trade deficit may appear in the first half of the year due to the
slumping price of copper and other raw materials on world
markets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The expected volume of export in 1999 is about 15.5 billion dol
lars, 4 percent higher than last year.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sector Posts 9.6 Percent Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's retail sector, hit
hard by sluggish domestic market, saw a 9.6 percent growth of its
sales volume last year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure still contributed to last year's 7.8 percent
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We would have done more, but the sluggish domestic slump
hurdled our pace," said Yang Shude, director of the State
Administration of Internal Trade, at the sector's yearly
conference in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented floods last summer, although it caused
serious losses, stimulated consumption demand during the
restoration period.
</P>
<P>
The internal trade sector handled 300 million tons of
vegetables and more than 200,000 tons of pork to supply
flood-striken areas.
</P>
<P>
The catering industry hit record sales of 500 billion yuan
(60.2 billion U.S. dollars) last year, a hefty increase of 15
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sales of capital goods grew 3.2 percent to 3,660 billion
yuan (441 billion U.S dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The second-hand product sector achieved a transaction volume
of more than 7 billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) in 120
centers nationwide last year.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wu Yi, in a letter to the conference, urged
the retail sector to go in for a new and market-orientated retail
network, led by the expansion of chain stores.
</P>
<P>
Although many large department stores nationwide continued to
lose money last year, the pool of chain stores and large
warehouse-styled stores may be a driving force in the retail
sector.
</P>
<P>
The total sales achieved by chain stores stood at some 60
billion yuan last year, 2 percent of the country's retail volume.
</P>
<P>
However, the booming of chain stores was limited in China's
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with its chain store sales of 18.5 billion yuan last
year, gave way to the country's two largest groups, Lian Hua and
Hua Lian, which have opened 359 outlets and 360 outlets
respectively.

YINCHUAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A hot-spring well was dug
recently in this capital city of northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region and has now come on stream serving the local
community.
</P>
<P>
The 3,100 meter deep well can provide 1,680 cubic meters of

for domestic central heating, in medical facilities and in
greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by the regional Department of Geology and
Mineral Resources shows that Ningxia has vast reserves of
geothermal energy resources.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a sustainable development, China has drawn up a

<HEADLINE> Argentina Meets 1998 Goals Set by IMF, Says Economy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Economy
Minister Roque Fernandez on Wednesday said the country has met
the 1998 financial goals set by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The financial deficit totaled 3.8 billion U.S. dollars last y
ear, 10.2 million below the IMF figure, enabling the country to
avoid requesting a waiver, Fernandez said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
In mid-1998, Argentina requested a waiver from the IMF in
order to increase the ceiling of the public deficit account to
3.8 billion dollars from 3.5 billion dollars agreed upon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the treasury's deficit decreased by 9 percent
in 1998 compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's current accord with the IMF ends in 2000 and
includes possible access to loans for 2.8 billion dollars in case
of an economic emergency.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has not yet been affected by the crisis in Brazil,
its main partner in the Mercosur trade bloc, which also includes
Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez and other members of the cabinet have said they will
not intervene and that measures will be taken only if the
Argentine economy is affected by the devaluation of the Brazilian
currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted the Brazilian crisis could cause a
recession and decrease earnings from the sale of Argentine
products. The country exports 30 percent of its products to
Brazil.

"We will take measures to promote the expansion of chain
stores in rural areas," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
He said that related administrations should not approve the
construction of new large department stores in central cities
where they have become abundant.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of last year alone, the country's 260
leading department alone hit a total retail sales of 42.05
billion yuan (5.07 billion U.S. dollars) while profits plummeted
7.5 percent to 1.5 billion yuan, said a report from China
National Commercial Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Yang admitted that there are difficulties related to rural
markets. The farmer's dwindling incomes force them to restrict
their consumption budgets although household products are cheaper
than before.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are also dissatisfied with currently oversupplied
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial sector should produce rural-fitted products
rather than simply peddling stockpiles," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The central government has listed the expansion of domestic
demand as top economic task this year since exports are unlikely
to rebound under the gloomy financial situation in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
China's internal trade sector, controlling the country's
retail and distribution network, will strengthen its function of
serving the rural market, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Yang's administration hopes that this year's retail growth
will reach 9 percent and the inflation will be controlled within
2 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Major advances are expected
this year in meteorological modernization and related research,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A satellite-based weather data collection and transmission
system will come on-line this year, the paper quoted Wen Kegang,
director of China Meteorological Administration (CMA), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Known as Project 9210, the satellite system has been in
operation on a trial basis at provincial and prefectural levels
since last year, Wen said, adding that it played a key role in
the battle against last summer's catastrophic floods.
</P>
<P>
This year, in time for the flood season, CMA is expected to
complete the installation of the world's most advanced Doppler
Radar, the first generation of its kind to be used in
professional operations in China.
</P>
<P>
An anti-disaster system has been established in several areas
in the country, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Fujian and
Guangzhou, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
These systems, experts said, are expected to play a growing r
ole in minimizing damages resulting from weather-related
disasters, such as last summer's devastating flood toll.
</P>
<P>
CMA is also about to conduct a series of studies on
catastrophic floods such as those which ravaged the Yangtze and

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Reject Disarmament During Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's leftist rebels
will not disarm during peace talks with the government, a rebel
representative said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Rojas, an international commissioner for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), was quoted by the
weekly Universidad as saying that the rebels "will not make the
same mistakes as others did before."
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that thousands of leftist rebels had been
assassinated by Colombian authorities after they left their
jungle hideouts and returned to the society.
</P>
<P>
Political, economic and social changes should be carried out
by the government to end the conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We propose that Colombia, with its enormous natural
resources, develop an independent social and economic policy
providing basic services like education and health care for
everyone," Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the FARC started talks with U.S.
State Department officials in Costa Rica, thanks to the mediation
of a former Colombian government official, Alvaro Leyva.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has also volunteered to be a go-between in the
peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government.

<HEADLINE> Report Reveals Diversified Views on Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Different opinions on the
prospects of China's economic growth have resulted in diverging
speculations on the rate for 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are three major schools of thought, according to a
report written by a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lianzhong of China's State Information Center says that
optimists think the rate will be higher than last year's figure
to reach nine percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China's economic growth was
7.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Those in this school believe that while the external situation
is not likely to deteriorate in 1999, central government polices
aimed at stimulating domestic demand will have their effect on
the national economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Xu's report also presents a pessimistic view which sees the
general economic situation in 1999 continuing to slow down to a
rate of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
They reason that a new growth cycle has not started.
</P>
<P>
The investment increase in 1998 was largely generated by the
government rather than enterprises and investments from
non-state-owned businesses were at an historical low.
</P>
<P>
Those who hold the pessimistic view are convinced that the
fast growth in the last quarter of 1998 was not a result of the
market mechanism and that the government is not likely to
maintain such financial policies in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The third theory predicts that the growth rate in 1999 will be
around eight percent, Xu wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
People who believe this think that China's economy will be
boosted by international demands and a strengthening of domestic
stimulation. But a much higher growth rate is not likely because
of the limit of the global environment China has grown more and
more dependent on. Their projections is a moderate one.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The petrochemicals agency
of the state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) will
invest 720 million U.S. dollars in upgrading its plants in the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to maintain the existing infrastructure
of the plants, while improving their capacity to make products
such as ethylene, polyethylene and ethylene oxide, said Armando
Leal, head of Pemex.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at an industrial meeting in Villahermosa in
the southeastern state of Tabasco, Leal said the company's 1999
budget was 139 million dollars, 61.3 percent of which would be
used for reparations.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, the agency will complete three
strategic projects and start 18 new ones, he said, adding that
the company's eight petrochemical plants are capable now of
producing only 11.6 million tons a year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China To Cut Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China will make every effort
to control its coal production this year, and try to cut the
annual output to 1.1 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information released by the State
Administration of Coal Industry, the efforts would include
holding back production of 250 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of coal sales is expected to be 1.2 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The general trend of the international and domestic markets is
one of over supply. And China's coal industry is faced with
slumping profitability due to insufficient demand and its
extremely large workforce.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to cut output have been basically successful; the
coal production in 1998 stood at 1.2 billion tons, which is 130
million tons less than 1997.
</P>
<P>
The administration vows to step up its export promotion. The
projected coal export for 1999 is 38.5 million tons, and the
administration will try to go over to 40 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show last year's coal exports reached 32 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The administration announced last November that it will close
25,800 coal mines that were opened illegally or against operation
rules by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
A total of 400,000 coal industry employees will be laid off
this year.

<HEADLINE> Report Reveals Diversified Views on Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Different opinions on the
prospects of China's economic growth have resulted in diverging
speculations on the rate for 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are three major schools of thought, according to a
report written by a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lianzhong of China's State Information Center says that
optimists think the rate will be higher than last year's figure
to reach nine percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China's economic growth was
7.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Those in this school believe that while the external situation
is not likely to deteriorate in 1999, central government polices
aimed at stimulating domestic demand will have their effect on
the national economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Xu's report also presents a pessimistic view which sees the
general economic situation in 1999 continuing to slow down to a
rate of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
They reason that a new growth cycle has not started.
</P>
<P>
The investment increase in 1998 was largely generated by the
government rather than enterprises and investments from
non-state-owned businesses were at an historical low.
</P>
<P>
Those who hold the pessimistic view are convinced that the
fast growth in the last quarter of 1998 was not a result of the
market mechanism and that the government is not likely to
maintain such financial policies in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The third theory predicts that the growth rate in 1999 will be
around eight percent, Xu wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
People who believe this think that China's economy will be
boosted by international demands and a strengthening of domestic
stimulation. But a much higher growth rate is not likely because
of the limit of the global environment China has grown more and
more dependent on. Their projections is a moderate one.

<HEADLINE> China's Metallurgical Industry To Scrap Outdated Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
is to take drastic action to scrap outmoded equipment and
technology, in order to boost the sector's growth and modernize
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, all blast furnaces with a total annual
production capacity of about 20 million tons, electrified
furnaces with a production capacity of no more than 4.6 million
tons, and open-hearth furnaces of 1.82 million tons will be
scrapped from this year onwards.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, no open-hearth furnaces will be used in
China's metallurgical sectors, with other furnaces becoming
outdated by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The government body also instructed Chinese metallurgical
businesses with an annual production capacity of one million tons
should complete their technological upgrading before May 1, 1999,
with those of 300,000 to one million ton capacity completing
these tasks by the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC), one of the country's four largest commercial banks, says
it expects savings deposits to increase 18 percent this year, or
by 210 billion yuan (25 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bank officials say that loans will increase by 180 billion
yuan, and bad debts will be down 2 percentage points, fixed
assets will be down, and profits are expected to increase 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also trying to solve the Y2K problem and speed up

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Congress Adopts Key Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Congress
overwhelmingly passed a key pension reform measure Wednesday in
what was seen as a triumph for President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's tough austerity policy.
</P>
<P>
The controversial measure that has already been voted down
four times will impose taxes of between 11 and up to 25 percent
on the pensions of some 300,000 federal retirees, cutting down
their benefits and saving the government an estimated 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote of 352 against 143 approving the urgent bill
sent a clear message to foreign investors that Brazil is willing
to take on tough austerity measures essential to get the economy
back in shape, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The world financial crisis hit Brazil five months ago and
investors started withdrawing their money fearing the government
would not be able to cover a 65 billion dollar budget deficit and
might default on its debts.
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the flight of capital continued, Brazil devalued
its currency and later let it float against the dollar, leading
to a loss of about 24 percent of its value since then.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, the country's currency, the real, was
trading at about 1.58 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The United States fears that if Brazil, the largest Latin A
merican economy, is affected by an Asian-style currency crisis,
its economy could drag other countries down and hurt the U.S.
economy, as about 2,000 U.S. multinational corporations are doing
business here, the analysts said, adding that it could also lead
to a reduction in U.S. exports.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Tighter Control on Explosives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior police officer from
the Ministry of Public Security has called for stricter control
on explosives, in a bid to ensure a safe and happy Spring
Festival, China's Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The officer stressed that greater attention should be placed
on the management of explosives in China's vast rural area which
is comparatively underdeveloped and suffer from a shortage of
efficient management methods.
</P>
<P>
China Public Security Daily reported yesterday that the
general situation on the management of explosives across China is
very stern owing to the fact that a large number of small
enterprises in rural China still cannot meet state-set safety
standards in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that in recent years, China's police forces
have contributed quite a lot to the management of explosives, the
prevention of explosive cases, and insisted on the routine
inspection of small enterprises which engage in the manufacturing
and trading of explosives.

<HEADLINE> Karl Malone to Re-Sign Deal with Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone apparently will
be finishing his career with the Utah Jazz after all.
</P>
<P>
According to today's New York Post, the superstar forward has
agreed to a four-year contract extension with an option year,
worth an average of $16.5 million pers season to stay with the
Jazz. Malone is in the final year of a four-year, $20.2 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
Jack Tiernan, a representative for Malone's agent, Dwight
Manley, would not confirm the report, but indicated a deal was
close.
</P>
<P>
Malone said he had played his last game in Salt Lake City and
that it was time for him to leave the team. He said he would
demand a trade at the end of the lockout two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Malone, who led the Jazz to the NBA Finals
each of the last two seasons, expressed disappointment with owner
Larry Miller and blasted the Utah media, calling them "cowards"
and vowing never to do another interview in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Malone later softened his commendts and apprently changed his
tune following a generous deal from Miller. According to today's
Salt Lake Tribune, Miller offered the maximum allowed under the
new rule -- $14 million next season plus annual 12 1/2 percent
raises over the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
An 11-time All Star and one of the NBA's greatest power
forwards of all-time, Malone averaged 27 points and 10.3 rebounds
in 81 games last season, his 13th in the league. He edged Jordan
for his lone NBA MVP award following the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
Malone may have his best chance of winning an elusive NBA
championship in Utah, with Michael Jordan retiring.

WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The NBA lockout was
officially settled today after 204 days of labor dispute, and
teams can immediately begin talking to their players.
</P>
<P>
"We have an agreement, and we expect to have the deal signed
tonight," league spokesman Chris Brienza said.
</P>
<P>
The NBA is expected to release a new schedule this week,, the
season was set to be kicked out on February 5. The teams can
begin signing players, making trades and opening training camps
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main point preventing the sides in reaching an agreement
was focused on the middle-class contracts. The league's
contention was the middle-class exception can be used only for a
three-year contract, while the union suggested a six-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
It was learned the union won this argument finally. The
lockout is the longest and costliest work stoppage in the league
history.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that the per
capita income of 700,000 poverty-stricken people in Luliang
mountainous area in north China's Shanxi Province increased by
150-160 yuan in 1998 thanks to the construction of roads in the
area over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 183-kilometer roads, which run through
four counties and 25 townships in the southwestern part of the
province, began in April 1996 and was completed in 1997. The
roads which cost 232 million yuan made it possible for local
people to sell and transport their products nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a large number of farm produce and by-products of
Luliang, one of the country's poorest areas, were stockpiled and
could not be shipped to other parts of China due to the
inconvenience of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The date output of Linxian, Liulin and Shilou counties, for
example, totaled 90,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Local special products such as potatoes, walnuts and soybean
are now also able to be shipped to northeast China and coastal
areas.

and boys, aged between 14 and 16, did not know who elects the
country's chancellor or which two big superpowers were rivals in
the Cold War, the results of a new survey issued Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The survey carried out by the Cologne-based Institute for
Empirical Psychology considers that German youths have a poor
general knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the pupils on average were only able to
give the correct answer to about 15 out of a total of 40 questions
related to politics, history, arts and natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
Only about a third knew that 19th century statesman Otto von
Bismarck (1815-1898) was the architect of the German Empire, only
17 percent said they had an idea what a "light year" was, and only
8 percent knew the seat of the European Parliament is Strasboug in
France.
</P>
<P>
But three-fourths of them knew pop star Michael Jackson and
knew that he has released the pop album "Thriller."

<HEADLINE> German Economy to Grow 2 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy is expected to
grow by 2 percent in the current year, German Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine said at a press conference announcing cabinet
approval of his 1999 federal budget Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that there were many variables facing
Germany this year, and told reporters, "The German economy has a
25 percent share of exports. This means world economic shifts hit
German exports more or less strongly."
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said the German government approved a draft German
federal budget for 1999 which was due to increase to 290.5 billion
dollars from 272 billion dollars in 1998 -- a 6.8 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming law the budget must be approved by the German
parliament.

JERUSALEM,January 20 (Xinhua) -- Norway survived a fierce
second half to beat host Israel 1-0 in a soccer friendly at Ramat
Gan Stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian team took the 1-0 lead 11 minutes into the match
when Bent Skammelsrud blasted a penalty shot past Israeli
goalkeeper Nir Davidovitch.

<P>
The Norwegian team had the chance to make it 2-0 but their

Nimni chipped a penalty shot onto the goal post at the 60th
minute while striker Alon Mizrahi narrowly missed three times.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants G8 to Forgive Debt of Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany plans to seek major debt
reduction for poor countries at the June summit of the Group of
Eight (G8) nations in Cologne, German Development Aid Minister
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which will host the June 18 to 20 summit of G8 nations
in Cologne, planned to give the issue high priority at the
meeting, said Wieczorek-Zeul. The Group of Eight members are:
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative's goal is to cut or eliminate crippling debt of
highly indebted developing nations to give them a chance for
growth," said Wieczorek-Zeul.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Bonn wanted to speed debt reduction and that
the current timetable of step-by-step cuts over six years should
be reduced to three years. This would also mean countries enjoying
faster debt relief would have to carry out agreed reforms within
three years.
</P>
<P>
Germany will also call on the Paris Club donor nations to raise
its level of debt elimination to 100 percent instead of the
current 80 percent of state guaranteed trade credits in extreme
cases of hardship, according to reports of the German Press
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Germany planned to pay 29.77 million dollars to the World Bank
in 1999 to help kick off the initiative to forgive more developing
world debt and would be willing to increase this sum, the German
minister said without stating how much more Bonn would pay.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average dropped slightly Wednesday after investors sold their
holdings to lock in profits in the last hour of trading day.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed at 9,335.91, down 19.31. During the early
session, the Down index was down 54 at 9,300.90 before recovering
to Greenspan's remarks on the stocks. The index climbed steadly to
9,425.51 at noon but plunged in the last hour trading.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in his prepared
testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee in Washington
that the buoyant stock market could be headed for a tumble but
policymakers have to be "particularly" wary of actions that
unnecessarily sow uncertainties on the market.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks gave investors a relief for the concerns
that he might cool the market advance.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts believed that during the last trading session,
the Dow traded down "significantly" on profit-taking because the
market was susceptible to a little bit of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite continued to close
higher, boosted by the Microsoft's strong performance in the
second quarter. The index closed at 2,415.57, up 7.4 from the
record closing high of 2,408.17.

Other blue chip stocks made a little gain. The Standard &AMP;

<HEADLINE> German 1999 Draft Budget More than 290 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government Wednesday was preparing to approve a draft German
federal budget for 1999, which was due to increase to 290.51
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures were 272 billion dollars in 1998. The increase is
6.8 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministry officials said 1999 expenditures would include
"transitory items" totalling 13.87 billion dollars. Included here
were 4.88 billion dollars in cash transfers to help plug a gaping
hole in the postal pension fund and transfers to the struggling
state pension fund to cover payouts.
</P>
<P>
The largest single item on the 1999 budget is the 103.17
billion dollars earmarked for the cornerstone of Germany's social
welfare state, the ministry for employment and social affairs,
which gets about 5.95 billion dollars more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The transport and building budget comes second with 28.69
billion dollars followed by the defense budget of 28.15 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
New debt for 1999 will total 33.46 billion dollars - about the
amount which had been projected by former conservative finance
minister, Theo Waigel.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 blueprint is based on the draft budget drawn up by the
former conservative government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl who was
unseated in last year's general election.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was due to approve the draft budget which also must
be okayed by parliament's lower chamber where Schroeder's
government enjoys a comfortable majority.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Seek Compensation from Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will seek compensation
from Liberia and other backers of the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) in Sierra Leone for the resources committed to preserving
the legitimate government of that country, a Nigerian minister
said.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in capital Abuja Wednesday with visiting U.N.
Special Envoy for Sierra Leone Francis Okello, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Ignatius Olisemeka told newsmen that "there are ways of
doing that... We shall do that."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the peace-keeping force was deserving
international protection as it was discharging its mandate as
peace-keepers to the world.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister noted that the only way to curb the
recurring mischief by these supporters was to hold them
"accountable for their reckless action against the peace-keeping
force and the people of Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
"Only then can we have peace in the sub-region. They should be
made to pay for damages to sister African countries," Olisemeka
said, adding that without this option, these countries would
continue their destabilization of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that his country could withdraw its troops
after the restoration of peace to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said that the briefing from Ambassador Okello based in
Guinea would enable Nigeria to appreciate the situation in that
country where the West African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG
was battling to push out the rebels from capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
After the rebels in Sierra Leone launched attacks on Freetown
two weeks ago, the Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops have mounted
offensive to retake the capital.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed 15 people in
Bondo, southwestern Kenya, Oburu Odinga, a member of parliament
from the area said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Oburu demanded the Ministry of Health dispatch more personnel
and medical supplies to stem the spread of the disease, according
to a press report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"The government appears to be doing little to contain the
situation as there is lack of drugs and an acute shortage of safe
drinking water all over the district," Oburu complained.
</P>
<P>
He said Bondo Sub-District Hospital lacked a constant supply of
water and no emergency measures were in place to prevent the
further spread of the disease. The Nyanza provincial medical
officer, Richard Otieno Muga, confirmed there was a cholera
outbreak in Bondo, Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Migori districts in
the province.
</P>
<P>
However, health surveillance teams had been mobilized across
the province to curb cholera, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The public must realize there is no drug that offers
prevention against cholera other than strict personal hygiene," he
said.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Favor Political Solution to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany said on
Wednesday that they give priority to a political solution to the
conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, although they don't
exclude a possible use of force by NATO.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and his German
counterpart Joschka Fischer voiced the double message at a press
conference in the wake of a meeting on the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
``We are determined to stay engaged and mobilized and to do
everything, first politically and diplomatically, but also through
other means if necessary, for bringing peace to this region of
Europe,'' said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the situation in Kosovo is extremely grave
and time is running out for diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether NATO will revive its order given in October
on staging air strike against Serb forces in Kosovo and if France
and Germany will join such air strikes, Vedrine said that the
question does not come up exactly to the situation of today.
</P>
<P>
While launching an appeal to the Albanian separatist forces,
the KLA, to renounce violence, the German foreign minister said
that although Germany wishes to seek a political solution, it is
not acceptable that massacres and humanitarian catastrophes
repeatedly happen in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
``We ardently wish a pacific solution, but it is not acceptable
to continue to see in this region of the Balkans massacres and
humanitarian catastrophes of repetition,'' he said, adding that
all options remain open.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also reaffirmed their support to the
head of the Verification Mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), William Walker, who was ordered
by the Yugoslav government to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
``We estimate that William Walker should remain the chief of
the mission of verification and continue doing his task,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that truth must be established about the
massacre of 45 Albanians in the village of Racak last week, and
the people responsible for the killing be brought to justice.

LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets moved
higher Wednesday as investors stepped back into the markets

Greenspan said current equity prices implied high profit
expectations, while a slowdown was needed to sustain growth.
