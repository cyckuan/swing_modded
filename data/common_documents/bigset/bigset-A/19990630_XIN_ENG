<HEADLINE> Report on Weapons Hand-Over in N.Ireland Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 29 (Xinhua) - The international body set up to
oversee the handing over of paramilitary weapons in Northern
Ireland has agreed to delay its report - raising hopes that a
breakthrough may still be possible.
</P>
<P>
The release of General John de Chastelain's views on the
readiness of terrorist groups to disarm had been expected to be a
key factor in the on-going talks.
</P>
<P>
General de Chastelain, whose report will now be released on
Wednesday, a day behind schedule, reached his decision after a
lunchtime meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish premier
Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the talks on Tuesday afternoon suggested Sinn Fein
could be ready to make some movement on decommissioning. The
party's president, Gerry Adams, said: "We do not contemplate
failure."
</P>
<P>
"I think we can get there. It's a matter of bringing the right
political will," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UK and Irish prime ministers have both stressed that a deal
can be reached in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Blair and Ahern had separate talks with the Sinn Fein
leader and Martin McGuinness as the last-ditch efforts continued
to broker a deal before Blair's Wednesday deadline.

PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- France welcomed on Tuesday the
decision by Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to pardon
thousands of Islamists and release them from prison.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said

``We sincerely hope that the latest initiatives of President
Bouteflika could contribute to an end of the sufferings and
violence in Algeria,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes Mediation Efforts on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister for Kashmir
Affairs Abdel Meguid Malek on Tuesday expressed welcome to
international mediation efforts aimed at helping solve the
Pakistani-Indian conflict on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters while stopping over at Cairo
International Airport en route to Morocco from Jordan, Malek said
Egypt can play a key role in this respect as Cairo maintains good
ties with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pakistani Minister of Religious Affairs Raja Zafer
Ul Haq extended a request from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to help mediate in the ongoing
conflict over Kashmir between the two South Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ul Haq said Mubarak "has promised to work on" the issue.
</P>
<P>
India accused Pakistan of backing Muslim guerrillas who
infiltrated into the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir and has
been shelling the hilltops on which it said the infiltrators are
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan denied it has militarily backed the infiltrators,
saying it has only given moral support to those "freedom fighters."
</P>
<P>
Troops of the two countries have been exchanging fire along the
border in Kashmir over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan called for negotiations with India, but New Dheli
rejected international intervention and said no talks were
possible before the intruders were expelled from its territory.
</P>
<P>
Malek is on an Arab tour to rally support for his country's
stand on the Kashmir issue. He has visited Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon
and Jordan, and will travel to Morocco and Tunisia after leaving
Cairo.

BERLIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A 64-year-old German who sold
atomic secrets to Iraq was sentenced to five years in prison
Tuesday by a court in the southern city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
The court said, businessman Karl-Heinz Schaab was found guilty
of treason and foreign trade law violation for helping Iraq to
design an atomic device, Media here reported.
</P>

It said, Schaab supplied the country in 1989 and 1990 with the

enabled Iraq to produce weapons-grade uranium.
</P>
<P>
Schaab gave himself up to authorities at Frankfurt airport on

<P>
OTTAWA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Using the U.S. dollar as a "common
currency is not on the agenda" of this week's cabinet retreat,
Canadian Prime Minister said Tuesday as he entered the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such discussion in the government at all," he told
reporters amid local media speculations about the possibility of a
currency union with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister instead put priority of the meeting on a
free-trade zone for all the Americas, rather than the North
America Free Trade Agreement group of the United States, Canada
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's a three-way deal, we want to expand to a larger
deal with the rest of the Americas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local media believe, however, trade issues between Canada and
the United States carry weight on the table during the gathering
of ministers.
</P>
<P>
One of the hot topics is reported to be the modernizing of the
customs system between the two countries to make things more

<HEADLINE> Disagreement Remains in DRC Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Disagreement remained over three
main points in a draft document for ending the 11-month conflict
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), participants attending
Lusaka peace talks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DRC Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi said, "our main
 reservation is the question of a new national army. We don't
understand what is meant by the integrated army."
</P>
<P>
The ongoing ministerial meeting, attended by defense and
foreign ministers from 14 Southern African Development Community,
as well as Rwanda, Uganda and Libya, discussed a document drafted
by a technical committee which calls on rebel groups to be
integrated into a national Congolese army with their arms intact.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said the rebels demand to negotiate a
new political structure in the country, which is rejected by the
government, and the rebels insist all foreign forces be withdrawn
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Some officials close to the meeting said that they were
optimistic that a deal could be struck, however they said that a
quick breakthrough is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
"We have made considerable progress, but success lies in
addressing these three issues," said Bizima Karaha, security chief
and spokesman for the main rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Zambian government which was hosting the talks
said they were hopeful a cease-fire agreement would be reached.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the vast former Zaire, the third largest
African country, has drawn armies from at least six African
countries and threatens to engulf the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Ambassador to Zambia Christofa Jamo told journalists
that the meeting which started Monday would reconvene Tuesday
evening to let delegations involved in the conflict to iron out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
But he could not tell when the talks would end. If the
ministers approved the draft document, the heads of state would
meet in Lusaka to endorse the signature of the agreement.

</P>

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, briefing

<HEADLINE> Most Egyptian Ministries Secured Against Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- About 97 percent of Egypt's
government ministries and agencies have been secured against the
Y2K bug, an official announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining computers will be fully Y2K compliant by
September, said Ahab Elwy, head of the Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is optimistic," said Elwy, who also heads a
technical committee formed to handle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The committee is part of Egypt's 1998 government program to
ward off the chaos that is expected to occur around the world
because of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of
a year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
This confusion can affect the computer systems for electricity,
water, bank, prison locks, payrolls, elevators and gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
Elwy said all of the government's 166 mainframes and 108,518
computers have been adjusted to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
His committee receives weekly reports from the ministries and
agencies with a stress on the "contingency plans" designed as
back-up in case technical failures occur on or after January 1,
2000, Elwy said.
</P>
<P>
The private sector also reports to the technical committee and
major companies have been vigorously working to solve the problem,
Elwy said.

ADDIS ABABA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia claimed that it has
put out of action 1, 976 Eritrean soldiers during fightings in the
past two days near the Mereb River, according to a press release
issued by the Ethiopian government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian side claimed that Eritrea started the attack near
the Mereb River and that "the Ethiopian defense forces
successfully repelled the offensives" launched from Sunday to
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting continued Tuesday with low intensity, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no response from the Eritrean side available
here.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Ethiopian airforce bombed Eritrea's Assab
airport, a strategic military target, severely damaging the
airport runway.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea had blamed each other for initiating more
fighting in the wake of renewed calls from the Organization of
Africa Unity (OAU) and the U.N. Security Council for immediate and
unconditional cease-fire between the two Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two Horn of Africa neighbors broke out in
early May of 1998 over a disputed stretch of border.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have agreed to a peace framework put forward by
the OAU, but neither seems to have turned their words into action.

KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Bwindi National Forest
Park has received 20 radio units donated by Motorola to help
enhance the security of visitors.
</P>
<P>
Moses Ali, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Tourism, Trade and Industry who received the donations Tuesday,

The national park is famous for its rare mountain gorillas. It
boasts of more than 300 gorillas, more than half of the world's

<P>
The park hit headlines in early March when eight foreign
tourists were murdered in the park.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan troops were sent to guard the park soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The park reportedly accounts for nearly 70 percent of revenue
of Uganda' s Wildlife Authority and foreign visitors usually have

Security Council, Ismaila Baborcarr-Blaise Jane of Gambia, said,
"Members of the Council welcomed the resumption of the
identification process; they commended the parties for their
cooperation and expressed the hope that such cooperation will
continue."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council also commended the important role
played by the UNHCR (the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees) on preparations for the resettlement and return of
refugees," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council welcomed the appointment of Mr. William
Eagleton as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in
Western Sahara and wish him success in his mission," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council met in a
closed-door session to discuss a new report on the situation of
Western Sahara, presented by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
and hear the U.N. Secretariat's briefing on the latest development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15-nation Security Council, Annan said
that both parties in the region have been cooperating with the
identification of votes in preparation for a referendum on the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
In May, Morocco and the POLISARIO accepted a U.N.-brokered
package of measures to allow preparations for the referendum to go
ahead. The identification process resumed on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the importance of the parties staying the course
leading up to July 15 -- the date when the first part of the
provisional voters' list will be published and the appeals process
will begin.
</P>
<P>
Also in his report, Annan said that more than 2,300 people have
been interviewed since June 15, bringing the total number
identified since the process began in August 1994 to nearly
150,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.n. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is
preparing to repatriate refugees to the Territory in accordance
with the Settlement Plan, hammered out in August 1988.
Pre-registration has begun to determine their willingness to
return and their final destination in the Territory.
</P>
<P>
Under the Settlement Plan, the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) was established to monitor
a ceasefire and identify and register qualified voters for the
referendum on whether the former Spanish colony will gain full
independence or become a part of Morocco.

<HEADLINE> Religious Party to Support Barak's Government From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's religious party United
Torah Judaism (UTJ) has decided not to join Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak's emerging coalition government but to support it from
outside.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its decision here on Tuesday, the party said,
however, it might join the coalition government at a later time.
</P>
<P>
UTJ said that during its talks with a negotiation team of
Barak's One Israel alliance on Monday and Tuesday, the two sides
reached a compromise to set up a committee fully empowered to make
decisions on the issue of drafting religious students into the
army.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been the ultra-orthodox UTJ's major concern.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the religious students over the age of 24 can
be drafted for military training, that special uniforms will be
designed for them and that the defense minister has the sole power
to decide who will be recruited into the army.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the UTJ's decision is not a final
one, and that the UTJ is waiting for Shas to announce its decision
whether to join the coalition, which is expected to be made in a
meeting of the Council of Torah Sages of Shas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main problem standing in the way of Shas' entry into the
coalition is its insistence on full control of the Religious
Affairs Ministry, whereas Barak has promised the National
Religious Party (NRP) that it might share the ministry with Shas
in a rotation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked the two religious parties to solve the problem
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the left-wing Meretz, which has signed a coalition
agreement with One Israel, said it will make a final decision on
whether to joint the coalition government within several days in
the face of possible inclusion of Shas into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meretz has objected to Shas' participation in the coalition,
accusing Shas, which has controlled the Interior Ministry for
about 15 years, of misusing public money for its own interests.
</P>
<P>
The next few days will be crucial for Barak in his coalition
forming effort as he has to submit the cabinet list to the
acting Knesset (parliament) one week before July 9, the deadline
for his government formulation stipulated by the election law.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who won the May 17 prime ministerial election, has to
rally support from other smaller parties to form a broad-based
coalition government because his One Israel alliance got only 26
seats in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Israel to Abide by Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Tuesday called on Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak to
comply with all agreements Israel signed with the Palestinians
and to stop settlement activities in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Amman after his talks with Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh, Arafat said Israel must
adhere to the Wye River agreement and Oslo accord it reached with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Jewish state to kick off the third-phase
troop withdrawal from the occupied territories, lift Israeli
economic blockade on the Palestinian self-rule areas, and to
release Palestinian prisoners kept in Israeli custody.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has left Amman after a two-day work visit to Jordan,
during which he held talks with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Jordan for its consistent support for the
Palestinians, and described his talks with King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and Prime Minister Rawabdeh as "fruitful and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah and Rawabdeh reiterated Jordan`s
support for all legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has used many occasions to call on Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Barak to resume peace talks with Arab neighbors
after his May 17 election victory, which brought down the
hard-line Likud government in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
During Arafat`s visit, Jordan and the Palestinains also
agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in efforts to
revive the Middel East peace process, which remained
deadlocked since 1996 when the Likud came to power in Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Declines Comment on Ocalan Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
declined immediate comment on the death sentence imposed on
Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan by a Turkish court.
</P>
<P>
"We have long believed that Ocalan is an international
terrorist who should be brought to justice," white House spokesman
Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"But there is an automatic appeal here, so the judicial process
is still ongoing (and) so I'm not going to comment on the process
until it's completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was sentenced to death by a Turkish court on Tuesday for
treason over his Kurdstan Workers Party's campaign in Turkey in
which more than 29,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last year in Kenya by Turkey's agents with the
help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States warned its citizens of possible
violence once the verdict was handed down.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement last Wednesday that
U.S. government personnel and facilities around the world were
taking "appropriate" security precautions in case of a violent
reaction to the verdict from Ocalan's supporters.

<HEADLINE> World Economy in Gradual Recovery: U.N. Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The world economy is in a
gradual recovery process but economic growth in 1999 remains low,
the U.N. Economic and Social Council quoted a latest U.N. survey
as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After 2 years of financial turbulence and a marked slowdown in
global economic growth, the world economy is gradually recovering
with economic prospects improved and global financial markets
showing signs of stabilization, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Financial contagion from the Brazilian currency crisis at the
beginning of 1999 was contained and there has been some
restoration of capital flows to a number of emerging markets,
added the report.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be among the documents before the delegates of
the 1999 substantive session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council in Geneva from next Monday to July 30.
</P>
<P>
Despite these short-term improvements, economic growth in 1999
remains inadequate and markedly lower than at mid-decade,
particularly for the majority of developing and transition
economies, the survey goes on.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the rest of 1999 and beyond suggests only a
minor overall improvement and in a number of cases, the economic
situation will continue to deteriorate, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
In the majority of countries, growth for the foreseeable future
will fall far short of what is necessary to effect a substantial
improvement in living standards and a reduction in the number of
people living in poverty. it added.
</P>
<P>
The growth of world output at less tan 2% in 1998 was about
half of that in 1997. Growth in all groups of countries slowed
down but the setback to the developing countries was greater.
</P>
<P>
Their average growth of only 1.7% in 1998 was below that of the
developed countries for the first time since the 1980s and
contrasted markedly with the average growth of 5% or more that
they had achieved earlier in the decade.

<HEADLINE> Iran Offers to Help Lebanon's Infrastructure Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday offered to help
Lebanon rebuild its roads and bridges which were destroyed in
Israel's bloodiest air strikes on Lebanon since 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is ready to provide any assistance to help rebuild
Lebanese infrastructure from the davastation of the Israeli air
attack," said Mohammed Irani, charge d'affairs ad interim of the
Iranian embassy in Beirut, in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Irani made the announcement after meeting with Lebanese Minister
of Transportation and Public Works Najib Mikati along with a
delegation of Iranian ministry of transportation and roads.
</P>
<P>
Irani said the delegation has made a trip to the striken
bridges linking Beirut and its south and is working on a plan to
help have it repaired.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Israel launched the biggest air raids on
Lebanon since its 1996 "Grapes of Wrapth" operations, which killed
eight people and wounded 64.
</P>
<P>
The country's two power stations, three bridges and a
telephone relay station were also destroyed in the attacks which
followed a cross-border Katyusha barrage by guerrillas of
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that its air attacks served as a retaliation for
Hezbollah's offensive which killed two Israelis, whereas the
Iranian-backed group argued it fired rockets into northern Israel
to avenge the wounding of six Lebanese civilians of Israeli
shelling.
</P>
<P>
Syria has offered an emergency electricity supply while
Billionaire Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal, whose mother is a
Lebanese, has agreed to foot the bill of rebuilding the
destroyed power stations estimated at 30 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Appeals To IMF To Release Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Tuesday appealed to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to speedily approve the release
of the standby balance of payments support for Zimbabwe, saying
Harare urgently needs donor support to revitalize its economy.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic task force of the Zimbabwean National
Economic Consultative Forum said it is also crucial that other
multilateral and bilateral donors open their doors for Zimbabwe so
that the troubled economy could be turned back to a sustainable
growth path.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore urge the IMF to speedily approve the disbursement
in order to allow other institutions to come to the rescue of
Zimbabwe," said Isaac Takawira, chairman of the macro-economic
task force.
</P>
<P>
The forum said earlier in a statement it was pleased that the
government had now approved the signing of the letter of intent to
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"This is encouraging and we commend the government for taking
this bold step," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the action plan which was being prepared by the IMF
would provide the framework to implement the Zimbabwe Program for
Economic and Social Transformation and turn the economy back to a
sustainable growth path.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Zimbabwe will receive more than 800
million U.S. dollars from other donor agencies once the IMF
resumes its support.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Sign Relevant Agreements With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday voiced its
willingness to sign relevant agreements with neighboring Turkey
concerning the issues raised in a letter sent by the Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou to his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem
last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Yiannis Nikolaou said that the New York talks between the two
ministers on Wednesday would take place within the framework of
issues raised in Papandreou's letter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greece would have no reason not to sign the
relevant agreements if Turkey had no objection to agreements being
reached on these issues.
</P>
<P>
In his letter replying to an earlier one from Cem, Papandreou
reportedly accepted the proposal for talks on terrorism, on a
multilateral or bilateral basis, but he also proposed talks aimed
at reaching agreement on a series of other issues such as
environment, economic cooperation and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
Nikolaou stressed once again that apart from the issues set out
in Papandreou's letter, Greece was not willing to discuss any
other issue, and in particular it would refuse to discuss matters
stemming from unilateral Turkish demands and Turkish
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, no progress has been made in their bilateral
relations although the two rivals have tried hard to improve such
ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises Again in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence moved up
for the eighth consecutive month in June, signaling even stronger
economic growth in the coming months, the Conference Board said in
a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Consumer Confidence Index stands at 138.4
in June up from 137.7 in May, the highest level in more than 30
year. The all-time high for the Consumer Confidence Index was
142.3 in October 1968.
</P>
<P>
"Great expectations are continuing to fuel consumer
confidence," said Lynn Franco, Associate Director of The
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "While recent gains
in confidence are modest, consumers now account for almost 70
percent of U.S. economic growth, and current confidence levels
point to even stronger economic growth next year than previously
projected."
</P>
<P>
In another report Monday, The Conference Board said driven by
robust consumer spending, the U.S. economy will grow even more
strongly this year and into 2000 than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
The Board now projects the economic growth to run in the 4
percent to 4.5 percent range this year and more than 3 percent in
2000. This is an increase from the 3.5 percent growth rate that
the Board projected for the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Palestinians Agree to Push Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Palestinians agreed
Tuesday to build up mechanisms of bilateral cooperation and to
push forward the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a joint statement issued after
talks between Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh and
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Jordan expressed its readiness to stand
by the Palestinians to break the deadlock in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two leaders discussed the prospects for
the final status negotiations, especially with regard to issues of
water, security, borders and refugees, Jordan`s official news
agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh described his talks with Arafat as fruitful, and said
both sides shared identical views on various issues as well as the
working plans for the next stage, Petra said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Surplus in Balance of Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded a
surplus of 6.2 billion rand or one billion U.S. dollars in the
balance of payments on current account for the first quarter of
this year, the South African Reserve Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, seasonally adjusted and annualized, was a
significant turnaround on the past four quarters which were all in
the red, according to the central bank of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The balance on current account in the third and fourth quarters
of 1998 showed deficits of 19.8 billion rand (3.3 billion dollars)
and 18.5 billion rand (3.08 billion dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payment figures in the first quarter of 1999
were boosted by stronger merchandise exports, particularly of
mineral products which were assisted by a weaker rand, and a
considerable reduction in imports, mainly of manufactured goods
and farming products.
</P>
<P>
Gold exports were however well down and the outlook is far from
rosy for future export revenue from the yellow metal following
announcements of the proposed gold sales by the Bank of England
and the International Monetary Fund which has pushed bullion
prices down to 20-year lows.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly bulletin of the South African central bank
reported merchandise exports for the first quarter of 1999 at
149.1 billion rand (24. 85 billion dollars) compared to just 132.1
billion rand (22 billion dollars) for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports in the first three months were also 5.5
billion rand (917 million dollars) ahead of the third quarter of
1998, when the best level was recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
"The compression of aggregate demand in the economy contributed
to the reversal of the deficit on the current account into a
surplus," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Expressed in terms of a seasonally adjusted and annualized
rate, the current account turned from a deficit of 19.8 billion
rand in the third quarter of 1998, or 2.7 percent of gross

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Focus on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite unprecedented
economic and social progress in the last half century, the global
challenge of poverty remains, according to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks are contained in his report to the Economic and
Social Council which meets next month on poverty eradication and
other matters in its annual session in Geneva, the council said in
New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There are close to 1 billion adults unable to read or write
most of whom are women, Anna's report goes on.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of a billion people have no access to health
services and malnutrition affects over 800 million people.
</P>
<P>
Many millions lack access to safe water, and many millions more
have a life expectancy of less than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The greatest number of people below the poverty line live in
Asia, but the depth of poverty is greater in sub-Saharan Africa
than any other region. Among the poor, women and children are
suffering the most.
</P>
<P>
The number of fully working children between the ages of five
and 14 is at least 120 million or about 250 million if those for
whom work is a secondary activity are included.
</P>
<P>
Annan calls for immediate and full debt relief to the least
developed low-income countries and longer-term capital flows to
support their development objectives.
</P>
<P>
The council's substantive session from July 5-30 will tackle
questions like the role of employment in poverty eradication, the
gender dimension, capacity-building, the development of Africa and
disaster-relief assistance.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet approved here
Tuesday an early retirement program proposed by the Office of
Civil Service Commission in a bid to improve efficiency by
reducing manpower in the public sector, a Government House press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The early retirement package, to be applied on voluntary basis,
is expected to be taken up initially by 30,000 civil servants at a
saving to the state of almost 15 billion baht (416.7 million U.S.
dollars) over two years.
</P>
<P>
This package is part of the government's plan to cut 120,000
jobs in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The target group of the package is those who are aged 50 or
over and those who have been serving in the public sector for 25
years or more.
</P>
<P>
Special compensation will be given to the early retired
officials including a gratuity equal to seven months' wages and an
additional sum to be paid monthly along with the pension.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Begins Organized Return of Kosovar Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began the organized repatriation
of hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees by taking over 300
from camps in Macedonia to their homes in Kosovo's provincial
capital of Pristina on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 325 returnees from Stenkovec refugee camps 1 and 2 north of
the Macedonian capital of Skopje made their return trip aboard 10
buses organized by the UNHCR and the International Organization
for Migration, said a UNHCR press release available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Returning refugees is always the most satisfying part of our
work," said Dennis McNamara, UNHCR's Special Envoy for the former
Yugoslavia and Albania. "But it is also a major challenge when you
have a large refugee population like this one that is so anxious
to return."
</P>
<P>
Of some 800,000 refugees in regional asylum countries at the
beginning of June, the UNHCR said, more than half have already
gone back on their own, making one of the fastest spontaneous
returns seen by the refugee agency in decades.
</P>
<P>
The early returns occurred despite warnings from the UNHCR, U.N.
peacekeeping force (KFOR) in Kosovo and others that refugees might
face an uncertain security situation, heavy damage in many areas
and the lack of an international support system back in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that dozens have been wounded or killed by mines
and many have returned to find their towns and villages destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The refugee agency estimated that there are about 67,000
refugees still in Macedonia, 32,400 in camps and 34,700 living
with host families.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is also expected to begin organized returns of refugees
from Albania, where about 209,000 refugees remain. Some 46,000
refugees are now in the Republic of Montenegro and another 21,000
in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Calls For S-S Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Namibia Foreign
Minister Theo Ben Gurirab Tuesday called for improved Afro-Asian
solidarity and more efforts from bodies like the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) and the G-77 for better South-South cooperation in
the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come for Asia and Africa to share our common roots
for a stronger and democratic South," Gurirab told a function
organized here Tuesday by the Association of Indian Africanist.
</P>
<P>
"Improved South-South cooperation in economy, politics, culture
and technical fields is a must," added Gurirab, who arrived here
on Sunday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"We need the NAM and G-77, along with China, more than ever to
make a combined effort to regionally and internationally
strengthen South-South cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
With their big markets, trade opportunities, strong export
capacities and achievements in science and technology, Gurirab
said, India and other Asian countries must do more and more
business with Africa to improve South-South Solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Gurirab met Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee and External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh,
during which he expressed his understanding of India's stand on
the current conflict with Pakistan in Kashmir, an official of the
External Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab also called on Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan Tuesday, and during their 30-minute meeting, they
discussed NAM's role in prevailing international scenario and
steps to strengthen it specially in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is currently a non-permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council and Gurirab has been endorsed by the African
group of countries as the candidate for the next president of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations must become a democratic institution
unfettered by any hegemonistic tendencies of the cold war days, he
said.
</P>
<P>
India was among the first to recognize the ruling South West
African People's Organization (SWAPO) as the sole representative
of the Namibian people and allowed it to open an office in New
Delhi with full diplomatic privileges and status.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee paid an official visit to Namibia last August, during
which a protocol was signed on foreign office consultations
between the two countries.

Speaking at a news briefing, Greek government spokesman Yiannis

<HEADLINE> UAE Reiterates Support for Ethnic Albanians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Tuesday reiterated its support for ethnic Albanians in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where peacekeeping efforts are going
on as refugees are returning home.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will continue its support for Kosovars, until
"comprehensive and just peace" is achieved there, said Deputy
Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in a meeting
with his Albanian counterpart Aller Mitta, currently on a visit
to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Aller Mitta said through his visit he sought to express the
gratitude of the Albanian government and people to the UAE for
its support during the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians, most of them
Muslims, fled Kosovo to Albania and other neighboring countries
during 79 days of air strikes against Yugoslavia by U.S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were launched on March 24 on the excuse
that the Yugoslav government abuse human rights by cracking down
on ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
The UAE backed NATO's air strikes and sent huge amounts of
relief materials to the refugees, in addition to building an
airport in Kukes, Albania, for transporting relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also sent troops to join NATO in the peacekeeping
in Kosovo following the end of the air strikes earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led peacekeeping is being carried out under a
U.N. resolution following a Russia-mediated agreement.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Becomes Major Market for Thai Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has become a major
destination for Thai exports as two-way trade volume in the first
quarter of this year rose to 3.43 billion baht (93 million U.S.
dollars), the Thai Commerce Ministry announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry said that border trade
between the two neighboring countries accounted for 2.67 billion
baht (72 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, an increase
of 4.5 percent from the same period of last year, representing
80.2 percent of the overall bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Cambodia has high potential to substitute
the traditional markets that Thailand had relied upon because
consumers of the two countries had similar tastes and needs.
</P>
<P>
Major Thai products exported to Cambodia include food,
construction materials, electrical appliances and autos and parts
while major imports from there include processed wood, livestock,
fish and scrap steel.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Investors to Join Venture Capital Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will give
incentives to private investors for establishing or joining
venture capital funds to support small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Panpree patranukorn, advisor to Thai Industrial Minister, was
quoted by Thai News Agency as saying Tuesday that the incentives
could include tax exemptions on fund management and bonus for
private investors setting up the funds.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry planned to promote diverse venture capital
funds, aimed at increasing business opportunities and liquidity of
local SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The privately established venture capital funds, participated
by both Thai and foreign investors, would be similar to the Thai
Venture Capital Fund to be set up by the Thai government with the
initial capital of 1-3 billion baht (27.8-83.3 million U.S.
dollars), the advisor said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has planned to set up the Thai Venture
capital Fund to support its industrial restructuring program in 13
sectors and to serve as a pilot for other similar initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The privately-initiated venture capital funds would not only
benefit Thai SMEs, but also help boost and expand investment
projects in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Budget Disbursement Below Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The budget spending during the
first eight months of the fiscal year 1999 is well below target,
the Thai cabinet meeting announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Government House press release on the weekly cabinet meeting
said withdrawn budget by the end of May was at 426.1 billion baht
(11.8 billion U.S. dollars), or 51.6 percent of the total budget,
which is lower than the targeted 441.5 billion baht (12.3 billion
dollars), or 53.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry, one of the main obstacles
for the lower-than-targeted disbursement of budget for the 34
government agencies is the liquidity crunch faced by government
projects contractors.
</P>
<P>
Delayed construction projects by early rains and delayed land
expropriation also lowered the pace of investment spending using
the budget.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate government spending, the Finance Ministry has
asked government agencies to place budget disbursement requests
with the ministry before September 20.
</P>
<P>
The Budget Bureau has been asked to make a quarterly report to
the Cabinet on the progress of disbursement.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has also vowed to reduce the red tape by
limiting the budget approval procedure within one day.
</P>
<P>
By running a public sector deficit of up to six percent in the
1999 fiscal year, the government wanted to achieve a one percent
growth in gross domestic product (GDP). But delayed disbursement
has caused concern that this target will not be met.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate Tuesday cleared
five of the seven ministerial nominees submitted on Monday by
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Among those cleared were retired Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma
and Yomi Edu, two of the seven whose names were returned last week
by the 109-member upper house.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed 42 of President Obasanjo's 49 ministerial
nominees on June 23 and the seven were returned to the president.
</P>
<P>
The clearance of former Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Danjuma
without debate came during the resumed sitting of the Senate to
consider the new nominees presented by President Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma, speculated to head the defense ministry of Nigeria's
first civilian government for 15 years, returned to the West
African country at the weekend after treatment of "depression"
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Senate said that the clearance of the retired general, who
just bowed to the members after the announcement of his clearance,
was in recognition of "his meritorious service to the country."
</P>
<P>
Among the newly cleared nominees were the three substitute
nominees of the minority All People's Party (APP) whose candidates
were among the seven rejected earlier by the Senate, and two other
substitute names presented by the ruling People's Democratic Party
(PDP).
</P>
<P>
The clearance of a total 47 ministerial nominees paved the way
for a new civilian government of the Fourth Republic, which is
expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.

UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday called on the Indonesian police to investigate an
incident in which a regional office of the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) was attacked.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General deplores in the strongest terms today's
attack on the Maliana regional office of UNAMET," statement issued
by Annan's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAMET, some 100 persons, reportedly
pro-integration militia members, threw rocks and stones at the
office while UNAMET staff and local people took refuge there.
</P>
<P>
Several people were seriously injured, one UNAMET staff member
was hurt and the office was extensively damaged, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan holds the Indonesian Government accountable "for allowing
such an attack to occur, and deems any assault on UNAMET personnel
or property completely unacceptable", it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's representatives in the field "have protested
the attack to the Indonesian authorities in Jakarta and Dili",
East Timor capital, the statement went on.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET has been established recently to organize and conduct a
vote to determine the future of East Timor, considered by the
United Nations as a non-self-governing territory since 1976 when
Indonesia annexed it.
</P>
<P>
The territory had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 when an
internal rift led to Indonesia's occupation.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. mediation, Indonesia and Portugal reached an
agreement on May 5 to hold a so-called popular consultation in the
territory to see if the majority of its 800,000 inhabitants wants
special autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
The voting day had been scheduled for August 8, but the U.N.
put it off till two weeks away because of safety and logistics
considerations.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Hunting to Be Allowed in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- After an interval of nine years,
Mozambique will allow the hunting of elephants as a sporting
event, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, the Minister of Agriculture
and Fisheries, revealed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers approved recently a decree allowing
the restoration of elephant hunting in the southern African
country as a sporting event at its 17th meeting, the Mozambique
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique joined the Convention on International Trade of
Endangered Species (CITES) in 1990 and stopped elephant hunting
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the decree won't be effective until
the minute rules are made out which will take about a month.
</P>
<P>
Elephant hunting is aimed to control the number of elephants in
the country and reduce illegal hunting.
</P>
<P>
The elephants hunted will not be traded but instead be turned
into decorations, otherwise it is against the CITES.
</P>
<P>
Only areas with enough number of elephants could be qualified

<HEADLINE> IDB Launches First Yen Global Bond Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) on Tuesday launched its first Japanese yen global bond
issue of 100 billion yen (approximately 826 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ten-year bonds carry a semiannual coupon of 1.9 percent and
an issue price of 99.449 percent. This was the first benchmark
bond in the global yen market for almost a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Tokyo-Mitsubishi International
are the lead managers of the issue, which matures on July 8, 2009.
</P>
<P>
The issue attracted a broad-based favorable response from
investors worldwide, the Washington-based bank said. About 60
percent of the bonds were sold in Japan and other parts of Asia,
30 percent in Europe and the Middle East, and around 10 percent in
North America.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the issue will be used to help finance the
social and economic development of the IDB's Latin American and
Caribbean member countries, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
With this financing, the IDB has raised a total of 5.8 billion
dollars during this fiscal year through 19 separate transactions.
Among these it has executed its first global bond issues in three
currencies: Japanese yen, Canadian dollars and New Zealand
dollars. The bank has raised 3.4 billion dollars through three
U.S. dollar global bonds.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's funding program for the year calls for up to 9
billion dollars to be borrowed in a combination of currencies.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Sees New Dawn with New Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said on Tuesday that he saw a "new dawn" for the Middle
East peace with the imminent change of government in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The road ahead is long and the obstacles many, but we have
seen the birth of a new dawn," said Mubarak, speaking at a
honorary degree ceremony at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is visiting Washington this week for consultations on
the next steps in peace talks after Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak takes office.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak began meeting with U.S. leaders on Monday. He is due to
have talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said Clinton
wanted to consult with Mubarak on "how we can together help to
push the peace process forward on all fronts with the objective
of achieving a comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
Indyk said the United States expected Egypt to broaden and
deepen its relationship with Israel under a new government under
the leadership of Barak.
</P>
<P>
"This is the intention of the government of Egypt, and it will
be very helpful, as both the Israeli and Arab sides in
negotiations confront very difficult decisions," Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has made very positive remarks about Barak, calling
him "a good man, a very cautious man, promising" in a interview
with CNN on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told CNN that he expected Barak to visit Egypt soon and
was optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> New Group to Work With World Bank on Combating Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A special high-level
anti-corruption advisory group is working with the World Bank to
attack and prevent corruption in East Asia, the bank announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is still gaining members, brings together
former government officials, academics, business people and
officials from civil society, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The advisory group was formed to review the bank's regional
anti-corruption strategy and to assist the bank in assessing and
addressing corruption issues in its client countries in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting held in Washington in mid-June, the group
set its course on a dual track: first, advising the World Bank's
regional management on specific initiatives to address this
problem, and second, sharing information on what is happening in
various countries, including assessing the effectiveness of the
bank's regional anti-corruption strategy and its actions.
</P>
<P>
"This group, with its experience and breadth of views, is
extremely important for us to move forward in our anti-corruption
work," said Jean-Michel, Vice President for the World Bank's East
Asia and Pacific Region.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says NATO Moving Quickly into Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Tuesday that NATO is moving quickly to get its full
50,000-strong peacekeeping force into Kosovo to flush out Serb
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a photo opportunity in his office with Romanian
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc, Cohen said that "There might be
these groups or attempts to disrupt the peace process there."
</P>
<P>
He added that It is important to accelerate the arrival of the
NATO-led peace-keeping force, or the Kosovo Implementation Force,
adding the aim is to have more than 25,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has indicated that some Serb paramilitaries have
stayed behind after the withdrawal of regular Serb army and police
forces.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable for the Serbs to remain behind and try to
establish any kind of a presence. So I think KFOR will continue
to look for the Serb presence and insist there be full compliance,
as there should," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Babiuc discussed Kosovo and other topics, including
Romania's desire to become a NATO member.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he presented Babiuc with the results of a U.S.
study, done jointly by Cohen's office and the U.S. European
Command, that recommended actions by Romania to strengthen its
case for NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> AL-EU Summit Concludes in Rio de Janeiro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American,
Caribbean and European Union heads of state or of government
demanded Tuesday the establishment of a just free trade system and
the strengthening of the financial systems to prevent future
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
Both stances are contained in the Declaration of Rio and in the
Joint Declaration signed by the leaders attending the first summit
of Latin America (LA), the Caribbean and the EU that started
Monday and concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that the next summit will be held in Spain
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six leaders and representatives of 47 countries attended
the first LA-EU summit held in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of the
Brazilian state of the same name.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his Chilean
counterpart Eduardo Frei proposed the adoption of mechanisms of
protection against the speculative financial flows.
</P>
<P>
The world needs "new institutions that will regulate adequately
the enormous financial flows that characterize the global
economy," said Frei, demanding the EU not to exclude Latin America
from this process.
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro hailed the implementation of the
unique European currency, the euro, and condemned the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) policy.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in the joint declaration that the
strengthening of the financial systems of the countries of the two
continents will contribute to establishing a world economic and
financial system more dynamic and stable that will guarantee the
prevention of future crises.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to take an active part in the design of a
new international financial architecture, in view of the
seriousness and recurrence of financial crises and the severity of
their impact at a national and international level.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the summit said that the stability will permit
both regions to benefit from the integration of the markets of
capitals and reduce the risks implied by their volatility.
</P>
<P>
The leaders proposed to hold during the next World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting a new round of trade
negotiations of integral nature without excluding any sector,
directed to reduce tariff and non tariff barriers to the commerce
of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and of government decided to unite their
efforts to guarantee the full and timely implementation and
effective application of the commitments assumed during the
Uruguay Round.

WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) on Tuesday announced the closing of 112 million U.S.
dollars in financing for AES Parana for the construction and
operation of a 826 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle generation
plant in San Nicolas, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The AES Parana power generation project, which has a total cost
of 448 million dollars, includes a 17 kilometer pipeline and a 7
kilometer transmission line that will provide low-cost, reliable
and environmentally clean energy to the national electricity
market, the Washington-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
The financing facility, with a tenor of 12.8 years, consists of
a 60-million-dollar A Loan funded by the IDB from the bank's
ordinary capital and a 52-million-dollar B Loan syndicated to six
commercial financial institutions: ING Barings, Westdeutsche
Landesbank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, KBC Bank NV, Hypo
Vereinsbank and Generale Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project will be co-financed by an export credit facility of
102 million dollars to be provided by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan, commercial financial institutions, and Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
This is the first infrastructure sector project of the IDB's

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Urged with U.N. Mission in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday called on all parties to cooperate fully with the
United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) for a smooth voting
to determine the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The council, after meeting on the subject and considering a
recent report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, arrived at a
presidential statement which urges Annan to take "all necessary
steps to ensure full deployment" of UNAMET by July 10.
</P>
<P>
East Timor had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 when an
internal rift led to Indonesia's occupation. In the following
year, Indonesia annexed it, making it a province.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, considering East Timor a non-self-governing
territory, reached an agreement with Indonesia and Portugal on May
5 to hold a so-called popular consultation in East Timor to see if
the majority of its 800,000 inhabitants wants autonomy or
independence.
</P>
<P>
The voting date had been set for August 8, but Annan postponed
it to two weeks away for security and logistics considerations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "warmly welcomes" the channels of
communication set up between UNAMET and the Indonesian
authorities, the opening of talks between representatives of all
sides in East Timor and progress towards making the Commission on
Peace and Stability operative, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But it is seriously concerned about the lack of conditions to
begin the operational phases of the consultation process and the
acts of violence by the militias and other armed groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council urges the Indonesian Government and the
pro-integration and pro-independence groups to continue to enhance
cooperation with UNAMET, to allow the popular consultation to go
ahead in a timely manner," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Official: Drugs Threaten Russian National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The spread of drugs inside Russia
has reached a point that the country's national security is
threatened, a high-ranking official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, director of the Federal Security Service, the
main successor to the KGB, told a meeting in the Kremlin that
state-level measures should be taken to fight this social vice.
</P>
<P>
He said the surge in the number of minors and young people
abusing drugs also put the nation's future in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who also serves as chairman of the top Russian advisory
body, the Security Council, attributed the drug spread to
declining standards of living, degeneration of some members of the
society, and the lax fight on drugs.
</P>
<P>
The conference, dedicated to narcotics control, came up with
some basic principles for the fight against drugs and called for
coordinated actions by various departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug users in Russia rose 3.6 times since 1994.
In 1998 alone, the authorities registered 190,000 cases of drug
smuggling. Up to 116,000 people were convicted and 110,000
received disciplinary sanction.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- London shares fell heavily in
volatile trading Tuesday as the world waited for U.S. interest
rate decision.
</P>
<P>
On the day dominated by speculation about the scope of a U.S.
rate hike. The FTSE 100 sank to a sharply lower close of 6307.1,
down 98.6 points and near a session low of 6301.1.
</P>
<P>
The fall came despite a strong performance on Wall Street in
the afternoon and a record close the previous night by Tokyo's
Nikkei Index.
</P>
<P>
Rate-sensitive banking stocks, often the most vulnerable at
times of Fed-related uncertainty, saw some substantial erosion on
the session.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Scotland fell 3.6 percent, off its earlier lows, while
Lloyds eased 0.1 percent and HSBC suffered a nearly 3 percent loss
in a setback tied to its Asian performance.
</P>
<P>
Bucking the trend, shares of British insurer Prudential jumped
4.1 percent, to 935 pence, making it one of the top gainers on the
FTSE 100, after a report in the Financial Times highlighted
Prudential's efforts at corporate overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax share index closed flat as investors sat on their
hands ahead of the Fed's meeting which could raise the cost of
borrowing. The Dax ended the day's trading up 2.58 points at
5359.53 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 index of leading components resisted the
soft start on Wall Street to close 0.9 percent higher at 4503.83,

<HEADLINE> All Volumes of "Mao Zedong Works" Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The 6th, 7th and 8th volumes of "
Mao Zedong Works" have been published by the People's Publishing
House, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
All eight volumes of "Mao Zedong Works", another comprehensive
and multi-volume works of the late Chairman Mao after the "
Selected Works of Mao Zedong", have now been published.
</P>
<P>
The publication was approved by the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee and compiled by the Party Literature
Research Center of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The publication includes 803 literary works, incorporating 2.3
million Chinese characters, which could not be found in the "
Selected Works of Mao Zedong". The works were selected from
writings, lectures and recorded speeches of Mao Zedong in the 1921-
1976 period.
</P>
<P>
The first and second volumes of "Mao Zedong Works" were
published in December 1993, and the 3rd, 4th and 5th volumes were
published in September 1996. These five volumes compose most of
Mao's works written in the democratic revolution period before the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The 6th, 7th and 8th volumes of "Mao Zedong Works" incorporate
some 300 literary pieces, which were written after 1949; many of
them were published for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The 6th volume includes 137 works, incorporating some 330,000
Chinese characters, which were written in the period from October
1949 to December 1955.
</P>
<P>
The 7th volume comprises of 72 works, of some 290,000 Chinese
characters, composed in the 1956-1958 period.
</P>
<P>
And the 8th volume includes 90 works, of a further 290,000
Chinese characters, written by Mao Zedong in the 1959-1975 period.
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Revolution (1966-1975), launched by Chairman Mao,
was a mistake of overall importance. Therefore, "Mao Zedong Works"
only includes some key treatises written by Mao on reforming
overseas publicity, differentiating the three worlds, making
breakthroughs in diplomacy, and adjusting policies affecting
literature and art.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Quits F.A. Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United Wednesday decided
to pull out of next season's F.A. Cup to represent England at
January's inaugural world club championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by United chairman Martin Edwards at
a news conference at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United agreed in principle to accept an invitation
to take part in the inaugural world club championship to be staged
in Brazil," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
Triple champions United have a congested fixture list next
season and the Football Association offered them an exemption from
defending the F.A. Cup so they could travel to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said if United had not agreed to play in Brazil,
England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup would have been in
jeopardy, because otherwise the European Cup losing finalists
Bayern Munich of Germany, England's fiercest bid rivals, would
represent Europe in the club championship.

<HEADLINE> India Says No Intention to Cross LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said on Wednesday that India now had no intention
to cross the line of control (LOC) to clear the Kargil area in
Kashmir of "Pakistani intruders."
</P>
<P>
"As of now, we have no intention of crossing the LoC," Vajpayee
told a press conference in Lucknow, about 490 km east of New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Asked why India was hesitating to cross the LoC to choke the
supply lines of the so-called "infiltrators" as suggested by
Indian defense experts, he said "such decisions are taken after
giving due consideration to the opinions of the experts as well as
other issues."
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Vajpayee said it
was difficult to fix a time frame for accomplishing the on-going
military operations along the LoC, the de facto border between the
two antagonistic neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani said Wednesday he
was confident that the "Intruders" from Pakistan would be
completely evicted by the winter when the fighting must be stopped
because of the harsh weather condition in the area.
</P>
<P>
Advani reportedly said in Kargil, the Himalayan flashpoint
where the current crisis began, that the restrained approach taken
by the Indian government about not crossing the LoC had given the
country decided advantages.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any radical change in the situation. We will be
able to foil this aggression completely and hold general elections
in time," he was quoted by PTI as saying. India's general
elections are scheduled for the coming September.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said the entire area would be soon cleared of
intruders with the steady progress in Kargil by Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
On his talks with former Pakistani foreign secretary Niaz Naik
last weekend in New Delhi, Vajpayee reiterated that there could be
no talks with Pakistan until the latter withdraws it troops from
Kargil.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on a report carried by the media both in
India and Pakistan that India had sent an emissary to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior Pakistani official as saying on
Tuesday that a joint secretary in the External Affairs Ministry in
charge of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan affairs and R. K.
Mishra, editor of the Observer of Business and Politics, had
visited the Pakistani border city of Lahore as an Indian emissary
11 days ago and met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
In return, Pakistan sent Naik to New Delhi last Saturday for a
day-long unannounced visit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At a daily news briefing Wednesday, an External Affairs
Ministry spokesman evaded a direct response to the question,
saying only that it was part of "normal course of duties" that
they travel to countries they deal with.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in the diplomatic front showed that,
due to economic and political conditions on both sides, and
especially international pressure to end the current conflict
through talks and other peaceful means, the fighting in Kashmir
seems unlikely to be further escalated into an all-out war between
India and Pakistan, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said India was awaiting a response from Pakistan
on its demand that Islamabad withdraw its troops immediately from
Kargil.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the directors general of military operations
of India and Pakistan were in touch but had not discussed any
proposal for de-escalation of tension in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC), Naik said the two directors could meet shortly to discuss
withdrawal of "intruders" from the Indian side of the LoC.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Ready to Talk to India at Any Forum: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is ready to talk with
India at any forum for peaceful solution of all outstanding
disputes, Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to discussion at any forum. India's intransigence
stems from its domestic instability," Mushahid told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The current tension at Kargil on the Line of Control (LoC) is
linked with the larger issue of Kashmir, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to take cognizance of
India's military buildup and the human rights abuse in the
Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We remain optimistic that there will be a peaceful solution of
the Kashmir problem and the other side will see reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed Indian allegations of Pakistan sending
"infiltrators" across LoC. "Pakistan's hands are clean in this
regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the Indian obduracy which had brought the two nuclear
armed neighbors to such heightening tension which could turn into
conflict, said Mushahid.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's basic premise has been discussion and dialogue on
any issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question that the United States was calling
for the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from the peaks along LoC,
he said: "It is obviously the misperception or a misunderstanding
of the situation."

<HEADLINE> Vice-President Hu Jintao Meets Hong Kong SAR Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Wednesday that it is in the fundamental interests of the
six million Hong Kong people to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with principal officials of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) at the Government House here late
Wednesday afternoon, the vice-president stressed that social
stability is the key to Hong Kong's prosperity and development and
that economic prosperity can ensure long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
should always be the focal point in implementing the "one country,
two systems" policy and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Hu conveyed the best regards and wishes from President Jiang
Zemin and the central government to the SAR officials present,
including Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, senior government
officials, members of the Executive Council and leaders of the
legislative and judicial bodies.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president spoke highly of the work of the SAR
government, saying that the SAR government has administered Hong
Kong effectively and that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong
residents have been fully protected.
</P>
<P>
People can see that the central government is firm in
implementing the policy of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong maintains its status as a free port and
an international financial, trade and aviation center, that Hong
Kong's business environment remains one of the best in the world
and that its social and economic systems and the way of living
remain unchanged while the laws remain basically intact.
</P>
<P>
All this testifies to the vitality and correctness of the "one
country, two systems" policy, the wisdom and capability of the SAR
government led by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa to cope with the complex
situation, and the ability of the Hong Kong people to manage the
city, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that the practice of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy is unprecedented and it is inevitable for some new
situations and new problems to crop up. Both the central
government and the SAR government should sum up experience from
time to time for new progress in the course of practice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the recent interpretation of some provisions of the
Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) in accordance with the Constitution, Hu said the
interpretation does not affect the Hong Kong SAR's independent
judicial power and power of final adjudication, but safeguards
Hong Kong's rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is a consistent stand of the NPC and the
central government to safeguard Hong Kong's rule of law and that
such a stand will not change in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hu also praised Hong Kong's civil servants and legislative and
judicial staff for their contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability since its return to China by faithfully carrying out
their duties and ensuring the normal operations of various
institutions and the normal life of the Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the civil servants and legislative
and judicial staff will continue to support the work of the chief
executive and turn Hong Kong into a much better place in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hu attended a dinner hosted by the SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting and the dinner were Liao Hui,
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council; Chen Fujin, deputy director of the General Office under
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; and Jiang
Enzhu, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Hu came to Hong Kong from Shenzhen Tuesday to attend the
unveiling ceremony of the Reunification Monument on the second
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.

<HEADLINE> Seats Added for U.S.-Germany Quarterfinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Facing an unexpected demand for
tickets to see the U.S. team, Women's World Cup organizers
yesterday scrambled to make available an additional 13,000 to 14,
000 seats at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium for Thursday night's quarter-
final doubleheader that includes the Americans.
</P>
<P>
With portions of th eupper deck opened at the 80,116-seat
stadium, capacity for the United States-Germany and Brazil-Nigeria
games will be near 55,000. The added seats -- most of which are
along the sidelines, according to venue director Heather Quinn --
cost 30 U.S. dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive development in that the demand has
outstripped the supply," said Marla Messing, the tournament
president. "Our objective is to put as many people in these
stadiums as possible."
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the tournament, organizers had set a
quarterfinal downsized capacity of 41,110 that consisted of the
lower bowl, club seats and suites. But 5,000 tickets were sold on
Monday and only a few hundred high-priced tickes remained
yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Plays Big Role in Promoting Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The China Export and Import Bank (
Eximbank) has been playing a significant role in promoting China's
foreign trade and national economic development since it was
founded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the
Eximbank today, the chairman and president of the bank, Yang Zilin,
said that it has made good use of policy-oriented financial means
to support the export of machinery and electronics products,
complete sets of equipment and other capital goods.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of May, the Eximbank had ratified
export sellers' credit totaling 76.29 billion yuan and 140 million
U.S. dollars, with 65.46 billion yuan and 130 million U.S. dollars
actually disbursed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the range of export business has developed from
sole project loans to medium- and short-term quota loans, overseas
project contracting loans, overseas business development loans and
overseas investment loans.
</P>
<P>
Other policy-oriented export financing businesses have also had
rapid development, he said. So far the bank has ratified 100
million U.S. dollars in export buyers' credit, provided 1.44
billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade guarantee, and accepted 1.64
billion U.S. dollars in export credit insurance.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Receive 3.7 Billion Dollars in Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Wednesday that they
have agreed that Mozambique has met the requirements for receiving
close to 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in debt relief from its external
creditors under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The total debt relief package is worth 1.7 billion dollars in
today's values. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative is expressed
in net present value terms -- today's values -- which discounts
future debt service payments to the current year's values, using
current discount (interest) rates and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest debt relief operation organized by the
international community under the HIPC Initiative so far, and
raises the total relief granted under the HIPC Initiative to 5.5
billion dollars, or 2.7 billion dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the fourth country to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative, along with Uganda, Bolivia and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative debt relief will reduce Mozambique's
external public debt by almost two-thirds from about 2.7 billion
dollars to 1 billion dollars in today's values, on top of debt
relief provided under traditional mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's external debt-service obligations will fall to an
annual average of 73 million dollars in 1999-2005, compared with
an average of 169 million dollars that would have been due in the
absence of HIPC Initiative relief, and the 104 million dollars
actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, debt service due would fall to 8 percent of exports
and 10 percent of government revenues, compared with 19 percent of
exports and 23 percent of revenues actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique remains one of the world's poorest countries, with
about 70 percent of its population living in poverty. Debt relief
is expected to help deepen the social benefits of good economic
management and will enable the government to sustain increases in
spending for social development, the World Bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative entails coordinated action by the
international financial community, including multilateral
institutions, to reduce to sustainable levels the external debt
burden of heavily indebted poor countries that pursue IMF and
World Bank-supported adjustment and reform program, but for whom
traditional debt relief mechanisms are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)
will provide debt service relief to Mozambique equivalent to 975
million dollars, or 381 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
This debt reduction will be delivered mainly through the
purchase and cancellation by the HIPC Trust Fund of IDA credits,
resulting in debt service savings of 327 million dollars in
today's values. In addition, an IDA grant has been made to support
improved economic management which will provide debt service
savings of 54 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
The IMF assistance under the HIPC Initiative will take the form
of a grant deposited into an escrow account to be used to cover
part of the debt service falling due to the IMF. This assistance,
to be delivered over the life of outstanding obligations to the
IMF, will amount to about 125 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique also is expected to benefit form the changes
proposed by the recent G-7 Cologne Summit to strengthen the HIPC
Initiative. Once agreement is reached on an enhanced HIPC
Initiative, additional HIPC Initiative assistance will be
considered for Mozambique, the World Bank said.

<HEADLINE> Shas' Sages Endorse Joining Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Torah Sages of
Israeli Shas Party has agreed in principle to join the incoming
coalition government to be headed by Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak, Shas announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The council, headed by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, has approved the coalition agreement at its Wednesday
afternoon meeting, but also asked Shas negotiators to settle the
issue of which party will take Religious Affairs Ministry before
signing it with One Israel under Barak, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Shas negotiators have informed Barak of the council's
decision and requested Barak to give Shas more time to solve the
postship issue with the National Religious Party (NRP), which also
want to have this portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Sources from One Israel said that the two parties could reach
an agreement on the issue soon, with Shas taking the minister
portfolio while NRP getting its deputy.
</P>
<P>
Shas considers the Religious Affairs Ministry to be the fourth
ministry it is eligible to receive according to its Knesset
(parliament) seats and it should garner most posts in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 seats in the 120-member knesset during the May 17
elections, becoming the third largest party in the legislature
just behind One Israel and Likud.
</P>
<P>
Among the potential coalition partners, only the Center Party
headed by former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has not made
final decision whether to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has asked for another meeting later Wednesday with
Barak to thresh out whether the party could get two ministerial
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
One Israel has already signed coalition agreements with
Meretz, Yisrael Ba'aliya and the NRP. The United Torah Judaism
also struck its agreement with One Israel, deciding to support
the coalition government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of Shas and the Center Party, Barak
could have a broad-based coalition with at least 75 Knesset
seats.

<P>
As a leader of the committee, Holden has closely followed the
development of Sino-U.S. relations and he, naturally, also has his
own point of view on them.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have engaged in cooperation. I think that
the next step is to upgrade such cooperation as much as we
possibly can, because China's development accords with the
fundamental interests of the U.S.," he said, adding that the
United States should show its sincerity in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic growth, he continued, the two countries
have a shared interest, explaining that China hopes to develop
itself, and China's development represents enormous business
opportunities for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the U.S. and China, both as permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, shoulder important
responsibilities for world peace, stability and prosperity," he
said. He added that the two countries can further cooperate in
China's accession to the World Trade Organization, and in helping
solve the Korean peninsula and other South Asia issues.
</P>
<P>
With regard to problems in Sino-U.S. relationships, Holden said
that the political systems, histories and cultural backgrounds of
the two countries are widely divergent, and it is natural to have
differences on some issues. "That requires mutual understanding,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Holden wrote an article a month ago, pointing out that more and
more American political celebrities understand the importance of a
steady and stable Sino-U.S. relationship. He added that if the
United States could not reach common understanding -- that China's
success will serve U.S. interests -- mutual trust between the two
countries will be further damaged.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China and the United Stated, as two great
countries, will pursue cooperation in all areas to create a
peaceful and stable future.
</P>
<P>
"This is my biggest wish," Holden added.

</P>
<P>
He said that the Eximbank will be even more active in
effectively carrying out government concessional loan projects,
and will do its best in using foreign government loans to promote
China's economic restructuring and a coordinated social and
economic development.

<HEADLINE> China Centralizes Government Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The procurement of equipment and
supplies for China's government ministries and institutions is to
be centralized under the control of the Bureau of Government
Offices Administration (BGOA) and the new procedure is already
being tested for the purchase of cars, computers and refurbishment
projects.
</P>
<P>
In a circular released today, the BGOA under the State Council,
China's highest governing body, urged government ministries and
institutions to actively push ahead the program, which is still in
a trial stage.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau now requires those departments under the State
Council to file their procurement plans and needs for the coming
year in May and September, which will all be pooled.
</P>
<P>
A system of public tendering will be the major method of
placing government procurement orders. Other methods, however,
will include purchasing through negotiation or from single sources,
but all controlled by the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the Bureau has listed those items which have
to be officially approved such as autos, boilers, elevators,
computers and peripheral equipment, copying and fax machines, air
conditioners, office furniture, refurbishing projects valued above
500,000 yuan, receptions for large-scale meetings and auto
insurance and repairs.
</P>
<P>
Government departments can only buy the goods and services
listed with BGOA approval. For those items not listed, the BGOA
still insists that they must be procured using government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The BGOA has set up a joint working and action group with the
State Development Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Supervision to
supervise the procurement activities of all ministries and
government institution to try and rein in the misappropriation of
funds and corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau stresses that all government procurement should be
made in an open, fair and justifiable manner. It should guarantee
quality of goods and services and place importance on efficiency.
</P>
<P>
It reveals that it will extend its scope in supervising and
controlling government procurement step by step, gradually
expanding to cover more goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Criticizes Party Members Losing Socialist Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top state and Party leader
Jiang Zemin has criticized some Party members who lost the correct
political direction due to weakened political faith and lack of a
correct world outlook.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, made the remarks at a forum held here on June
28 to mark the 78th anniversary of the CPC's founding.
</P>
<P>
"A Party member, especially an official, should firmly adhere
to socialism and communism as his fundamental political conviction,
as well as Marxist dialectical materialism and historical
materialism as his outlook of world," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"If he is diffident in regard to these factors, he will surely
drift off the correct political direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
While pointing out the misbehavior of some Party members, Jiang
acknowledged that "some comrades' confidence about the final
victory over capitalism by socialism and the future of the
construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics has been
weakened".
</P>
<P>
"Some people, lacking spiritual ballast, have led a life of
debauchery, or tried to find spiritual sustenance in feudalistic
superstitions and other kinds of negative behavior. Some pursuing
personal interests have drifted with the money-worshiping tide and
even grabbed state property by taking advantage of their official
positions."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that education in political faith among Party
members and officials should be unceasingly enhanced. "Otherwise,
our ideological front will be occupied by non-proletarian
ideologies. We must remember and pay full attention to this lesson
that history has taught us."

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Bids Farewell to Steam-Engine Locomotives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China ended its long
history of using steam-engine locomotives on its railway network
as the grand old steam loco numbered "3169" was withdrawn from
service today.
</P>
<P>
The "3169" has served for 19 years on the Chengdu-Chongqing
line which was first built in the mountainous area in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Steam-engine locomotives had been serving on most railways in
Southwest China until diesel-engine locomotives were introduced in
1965.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all trains in this region are electricity-powered these
days, as a result of rapid social and economic development," said
Chen Qihua, director of the Chongqing Railway Administration.
</P>
<P>
"Trains in Southwest China are now traveling faster and faster,
" added Chen.

<HEADLINE> No Slam-Dunk Favorite in Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One of the most intriguing NBA
drafts in recent years will be showed tonight at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
With no clear-cut No. 1 pick like a Tim Duncan, several teams
will be looking to improve their position in the draft.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta traded veteran point guard Mookie Blaylock and the No.
21 pick to Golden State for the No. 10 pick, Bimbo Coles and Duane
Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
There are several players who added to the mystery of this
draft, including:
</P>
<P>
Lamar Odom, an early-entry candidate who unsuccessfully tried
to withdraw from the draft and return to college even though he
could be the first player selected. Jonathan Bender, jumping from
high school to the pros. Center Aleksandar Radojevic, a junior
college player who lost his NCAA eligibility because he was paid
for playing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good players in this draft," said Toronto
Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald, whose team has the N0.5 and
N0.12 selections.
</P>
<P>
"We'll get tow pretty good players. I don't think there are any
dominant players. I do think there are some players who will play
for a long time and help teams win games."
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls, notoriously secretive about their intentions
in the draft, have the first pick. They have the league wondering
who they're going to take or if they will pull the trigger on any
of several trade offers.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to be prepared. We don't really know what Chicago
will do," said Bob Bass, vice president of basketball operations
for Charlotte, which has the No. 3 pick overall.
</P>
<P>
Chicago is one of six teams with multiple first-round picks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Send Peace-keepers to Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would send its
troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as
peace-keepers once a cease- fire was in place, President Thabo
Mbeki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to send some South Africans to help contribute in
the peace making process," Mbeki told parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would do its best to ensure that any
troops were deployed legally and constitutionally.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from countries involved in the Congo (K) conflict are
meeting in Zambian capital Lusaka to try to put an end to the
11-month war.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the involved countries and delegates from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have been locked in
talks in the past few days, which again aroused hopes for a
cease-fire in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki praised South Africans and other African representatives
currently involved in the DRC peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Progress has been made and I'm sure there'll be a resolution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the South African Defense Ministry, the
time and size of such deployment have not been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry official said after Mbeki's announcement
that it could still take considerable time to finalize details for
the deployment of South African troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Colonel John Rolt said that the ministry was determining the
logistics for possible involvement in a DRC peace-keeping mission,
including timetables for the mission and the extent of the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Patrick Lekota said Wednesday that South
African peace-keepers would be part of "a joint monitoring
commission", which would have a "non-combative capacity."
</P>
<P>
He said the commission would be established once the cease-fire
was in place and the size of it would be determined by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Criticized for Boycotting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's outgoing Defense
Minister Moshe Arens was criticized Wednesday for his decision to
suspend Israel's participation in an international group that
monitors fighting in south Lebanon, Israeli radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Shimon Peres, now the interim Knesset
(Parliament) speaker, dismissed the decision as "extreme,"
especially because it was made only days before Arens leaves the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation Tuesday boycotted a meeting of the
monitoring committee consisting of the United States, France,
Syria, Lebanon and Israel, which was formed in April 1996 after an
Israeli military offensive against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been scheduled to hear complaints by Lebanon
over the Israeli bombardment of Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
While delivering the boycott order, Arens said the Israeli
government will not attend further meetings of the monitoring
group as long as he is in charge of the Defense Ministry, saying
the "rules of the game" in Lebanon had changed.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the Lebanese Hezbollah militia has
been breaking the understanding reached after the 1996 cease-fire
which bars the two sides from attacks against or from civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition to
oust Israeli troops from a border zone it carved out in south
Lebanon 14 years ago with a claimed aim of protecting Israel's
northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel unleashed a broad retaliatory air strike against
Lebanon last Thursday night after Katyusha rockets fired by
Hezbollah guerrillas killed two civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Eight Lebanese civilians were killed and more than 60 others
wounded in the Israeli air strikes, which also caused severe
damage to infrastructure in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that senior military officials
were also angry at Arens' decision, saying it was "scandalous"
because the monitoring group is the only place where Israel can
sit together with Lebanon and its main power-broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arens admitted that his decision might not last beyond next
week, when Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is supposed to have
presented a new government.
</P>
<P>
A moderate ex-army chief, Barak has pledged to withdraw
Israeli troops from south Lebanon within a year through
negotiations with Syria.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Recast Jiang Urges Party to Emphasize Its Political Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
must emphasize its Marxist political stance linked to socialism
with Chinese characteristics in order to maintain benefits for the
people, China's President Jiang Zemin has urged the party recently.
</P>
<P>
As general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Jiang made
his plea when addressing a forum on June 28 marking the 78th
anniversary of the founding of Party.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its existence the CPC has led the Chinese people as
they made great strides forward and achievements in the country's
successful revolution against feudalism, re-construction, and also
importantly in the later reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
"The key reason for the Party's success is its perseverance in
building itself ideologically, politically and organizationally
and in its work style under the guidance of Marxism," Jiang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without a political program, an aim or a party
line, then a party can no longer be regarded as a political
organization.
</P>
<P>
"As a dedicated Marxist party, the CPC with more than 60
million members must hold on to an appropriate political stance,
abide by the Party's disciplinary procedure and requirements and
strengthen political sensitivity and awareness, thus guaranteeing
the unity of the Party ideologically, politically and
organizationally," added Jiang.

Jiang, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made his

</P>
<P>
He said that when the situation is good, people should notice
the existing problems and try to solve them promptly. When facing
trouble and setbacks, people should see the bright future and have
full confidence in winning victory. When facing challenges, people
should calm down and deal with the challenges after careful

<HEADLINE> Canada to Import U.S. Bomb-grade Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Canadian companies have
acquired U.S. permission to import bomb-grade uranium from the
country for making medical isotopes, Canadian media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-year contract approved Tuesday by the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), Canadian manufacturers Atomic Energy
of Canada Ltd.(AECL) and MDS Nordion will import 130 kilograms of
highly enriched uranium.
</P>
<P>
The highly enriched uranium, which can be easily converted to
nuclear weapons, is to be used at new MAPLE reactors and in a new
processing facility under construction at the AECL Chalk River,
Ontario, to produce molybdenum-99, an isotope used in the medical
industry.
</P>
<P>
While insisting on yearly reports on the companies' steps to
convert highly enriched uranium to low-enriched, NRC praised
Canada's nuclear non-proliferation policy as "exemplary."
</P>
<P>
The exports would constitute no threat to "the common defense
and security of the United States," NRC was quoted as concluding
in making its decision.
</P>
<P>
The permission came after MDS Nordion executives told NRC on
June 16 that the company might be unable to continue making
medical isotopes after next year because of the uncertainty over
the imports.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa-based MDS Nordion is one of the world's leading
suppliers of several key isotopes, which are used in radiation
therapy, imaging and medical diagnosis to detect and measure heart
attacks, treat prostate and thyroid cancer, and to identify blood
clots.

This is the first time that the nine year old Erdeni Losang

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Inspects Bank, Container Terminals in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
inspected the Bank of China (BOC) Tower and the Kwai Chung
Container Terminals here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the company of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Jiang Enzhu, director
of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Hu came to the Bank of
China Tower, the headquarters of the BOC Group in Hong Kong,
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He mounted the 70-storey, 315-meter-high building, which is
located at Central of Hong Kong Island, to get a bird's-eye view
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The BOC Group is one of the largest mainland-funded enterprises
in Hong Kong. In 1998, the BOC's overseas assets amounted to 900
billion U.S. dollars, making it the second largest banking group
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hu then came to the Foreign Exchange Center on the eighth floor,
one of Hong Kong's major foreign exchange trading institutions.
</P>
<P>
He stopped from time to time to make inquiries to the staff
about the amount of currencies traded and the daily turnover in
the center.
</P>
<P>
Hu also made the round of the Business Hall on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China commenced its operation in Hong Kong in 1917
and became a note issuing bank in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Hu made a tour of Kwai Chung Container
Terminals in the company of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 routes connecting the terminals to major ports all
over the world. On the average, more than 100 ocean vessels come
in and go out of the terminals per day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, one of the world's busiest container ports, handled
14.7 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At a display room, HK Secretary for Economic Services Stephen
Ip briefed the visitors on the terminals.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Hong Kong's shipping industry has great advantages
in the long term. There are not only geographical advantages but
also advantages in the area of services such as insurance and
arbitration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong should make better use of these advantages and
enhance its competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao came to Hong Kong from Shenzhen Tuesday to attend the
unveiling ceremony of the Reunification Monument on the second
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Public confidence in Hong Kong's
economy was much stronger in June this year than it was a year ago,
according to a survey published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey on economic confidence indices across Hong Kong,
conducted by the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, showed that
economic indices in July 1998 were lower than those in July 1997,
but in June 1999 economic confidence was much stronger than in
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The most significant example was confidence towards the
improvement on the unemployment situation in Hong Kong. It dropped
in July 1998, but resumed considerably in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the fields of "economic prospects of Hong Kong", "stock
market", and "property market", the public confidence indices all
increased in June this year compared with July last year.
</P>
<P>
The institute began to conduct the surveys in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Isn't Privatizing Nation's Assets: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top leader has told the
Communist Party of China (CPC) members that the ongoing state-
owned enterprise reform featuring the establishment of share
holding companies doesn't mean that the country is carrying out
full blown privatization.
</P>
<P>
"Some comrades have misunderstood the situation, which has led
to certain deviations in the work in some localities," said Jiang
Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, at a forum
held on June 28 to mark the 78th anniversary of the CPC's founding.
</P>
<P>
"China has state-owned assets worth over eight trillion, which
belong to the people and form an important economic foundation for
the country's socialist system," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
If a large amount of state-owned assets finally end up in the
pockets of a small number of people, then our socialist system
will lose its economic foundation, Jiang warned
</P>
<P>
"As a result, a correct understanding of and adherence to a
basic economic system in which public ownership constitutes the
main part and diversified forms of ownership of the economy enjoy
common develop, and a correct understanding and handling of the
relationship between the public and non-public sectors of the
economy is both a significant economic and political issue which
concerns the fate of the Party and the nation," Jiang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost the state-owned sector, China, which is
in the primary stage of socialism, has started to experiment with
share holding and other forms of non-public ownership to
invigorate the whole economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Leaders Pay Tribute to Departing Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Political leaders in Australia
Wednesday paid tribute to Tim Fischer who quit as the deputy prime
minister, trade minister and National Party leader, saying, "We'll
miss you, Tim."
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech, Australian Prime Minister John Howard
described Fishcher as a political ally and warrior.
</P>
<P>
"No prime minister, no coalition leader, could have had a better
friend, a firmer ally or a more dependable colleague in difficult
times than I have had in you," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"I will miss you, but I will always remember what a tremendous
political ally and warrior you have been."
</P>
<P>
During a special meeting of National Party MPs earlier
Wednesday, Fischer announced that he would quit on July 20 this
year to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Fischer could quit because of
his son's mild autism, but he had given public assurances that he
would stay on in the parliament for the current three-year term,
which began late last year.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his understanding of Fischer's decision, Howard
said, "I know that the welfare of your family has been uppermost
in your mind in making the decision that you have made."
</P>
<P>
"You demonstrate that those personal things and those personal
associations and relationships are... infinitely more important
than any sort of glory, prestige, power or notoriety," he said.
</P>
<P>
A coalition between the National Party, which represents the
interest of Australian farmers, and the Liberal Party of Australia
led by Howard won last October's federal election to rule
Australia for a second three-year term.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Australian National Farmers' Federation President
Ian Donges said the nation's farmers would miss Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"Tim Fischer has been a champion of the Australian rural sector
since he was first elected in 1970 and the undoubted high point of
his career has been his last three years as Australia's trade
minister and deputy prime minister," Donges said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The farm sector will sorely miss Tim's consistent, passionate
and often colorful representation on our behalf," he said.
</P>
<P>
John Brown, Tourism Task Force chairman and a former labor
minister, said Fischer represented the industry with distinction
on his overseas trade missions.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that our industry was able to ride out the Asian
financial collapse with minimal damage is no small tribute to his
work."
</P>
<P>
Opposition trade spokesman Peter Cook said Fischer's
personality and energy had focused Australians on the importance
of promoting exports, winning access to new markets and creating
jobs in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"His enthusiasm for leading trade missions and developing new
markets for Australian exports is commendable."
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said Fischer was one of the great
characters of the parliament and of Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I had the honor to serve with him in opposition and in the
cabinet for over three years. He holds my great respect and
affection," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats leader Meg Lees said she was genuinely
saddened to learn of Fischer's resignation, despite their often
very different policy positions.
</P>
<P>
"Today, that is not important," Senator Lees said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is to recognize Tim's humanity, his
sincerity and his tireless work on behalf of his constituency --
Australia's farmers and those people living in regional and remote
Australia."
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the National Party decided to meet on
Thursday to elect a new leader.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Fischer's
deputy in the party, John Anderson, has confirmed that he will run
for the vacancy left by Fischer, which brings with it the title of
deputy prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Pinpoint Age of Feathered Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The age of the so called feathered
dinosaur, Sinosauropteryx, which is deemed the ancestor of modern
birds by many scientists, has been pinpointed at 125 million years
old by a team of international scientists.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion followed joint research by Swisher Carl from the
Berkeley Geochronology Center in the United States and Wang
Yuanqing along with other Chinese scientists from the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Their paper making this claim will be published in the British
science journal, Nature, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The research also indicates that the oldest flower and the
primitive mammal, Zhangheotherium, whose fossils were found in the
same area with that of feathered dinosaur, Beipiao in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, lived at the same time, the early
Cretaceous Period, instead of the late Jurassic Period of 144
million years ago as previously thought, said Xu Xing, one of the
authors of the paper.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a large number of important fossils, including
Confuciusornis, Sinosauropteryx, Jeholodens, and the oldest flower,
in the same region in Liaoning Province, has drawn wide attention
from international academic fields.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists are divided over the age of the fossils
from the late Jurassic Period to the early Cretaceous Period. Most
of the papers published in academic journals are based on
biological stratigraphic study.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists collected turf samples from the fossil-
bearing stratum and sent the samples to the famous Berkeley
Geochronology Center in the United States for 40Ar/39Ar dating.
</P>
<P>
"This dating method is very accurate," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dating shows that the famous fossils found in
Beipiao in Liaoning Province were younger than previously thought.
"We are forced to re-consider the complexity of biological
evolution."
</P>
<P>
"Clarifying the exact age of the fossils will provide new
insight into the study of the origin of birds, mammals and
flowering plants," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai 1st Quarter GDP Estimated to Rise 0.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Thailand in the first quarter of 1999 is expected to show a
growth of 0.9 percent year-on-year for the first time since the
country was hit by the economic crisis in mid-1997, an official
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sansern Wongcha-um, secretary-general of the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB), said the figure was based on
joint estimates by the NESDB and the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's GDP began to drop in the second quarter of 1997 even
before the economic crisis broke out in July that year.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend of the country's GDP continued till the
fourth quarter of 1998. The bottom of the quarterly GDP decline
was seen in the second and third quarters of 1998, when the former
"tiger" economy experienced 12.3 and 12.5 percent contraction
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sansern said the expected first-quarter GDP growth should be
attributed to higher production in both agriculture and
non-agriculture sectors.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the economic situation in Thailand was
supported by growth from the supply side of the manufacturing
sector, with manufacturing output up 5.7 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector's output in the first quarter rose 1.2
percent from the same period of last year while the services
sector also grew.
</P>
<P>
Sansern expected the GDP in the second quarter to show further
growth due to the government's economic stimulus measures.
Thailand has projected a 1-percent GDP growth for 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's GDP contracted 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Defends Appointment Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo defended for the first time in the public Tuesday his
policies on appointments and retirements and that of the review
panels.
</P>
<P>
The president, speaking at the inauguration of the Council of
State in Abuja, said that merit and geographical spread were the
cardinal principles that guided the choice of ministers to be
sworn in Wednesday, reported The Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president is under criticism recently that he has been
using the appointment and retirement of governmental officials to
marginalize the northerners, who had dominated the government for
quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
He urged state governors to "imbibe a collective sense of
purpose which will transcend narrow party loyalties and parochial
considerations."
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said the retirements in the armed forces were done
to protect democracy, re-orientate the armed forces and
subordinate them to civil authority.
</P>
<P>
"It has been observed that military officers who have held
political office find it difficult to fit into regimental duties
when they get back to the barracks the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added "their life-style has been found to breed discontent
among their colleagues who have not had the opportunity to hold
political office."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the advent of democratic governance after
prolonged military rule has given rise to euphoria mixed with
great expectations.
</P>
<P>
"There is an unequivocal consensus that in the past, we have
done very many things wrongly ... if we must avoid a repeat of
past errors, we should have patience to identify and correct these
errors."
</P>
<P>
The president who identified crisis of the economy as that of
poverty and mismanagement, said the situation has been compounded
by high rate of inflation, low capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector, food insufficiency, unemployment and under
employment.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that steps have been taken to ensure availability
of fertilizers to farmers in the next couple of weeks saying "if
may be late for some but it will still be timely."
</P>
<P>
He added that the federal government decided to embark on the
rehabilitation project to stabilize power supply nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on National security, the president said the situation
in the Niger Delta area remained fragile and volatile, adding
that a team of military and mobile police personnel had been sent
there to man strategic locations, while the government was
developing a master-plan to guide the systematic development of
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that a committee, made up of representatives of the
public and private sectors, had raised to help in formulating
policies on how best to move the economy forward.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government would pursue the policy of
deregulation and privatization of some state-owned enterprises
"when it is judged that their performance would be enhanced
through such approach".
</P>
<P>
For foreigners seeking to do legitimate business in Nigeria, he
promised to provide a stable and secure environment, adding that
the government was keen to discuss all aspects of the country's
foreign debt with a view to achieving a level of relief.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sends Team for Investigation in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has sent
a task force to East Timor to investigate a stoning incident which
hurt seven people and damaged the office of the U.N. Mission in
East Timor (UNAMET) in Maliana subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
The task force, which consists of officers of the Foreign
Affairs Ministry and related ministries, will join the Task Force
for the Direct Ballot in East Timor and UNAMET chief Ian Martin in
visiting Maliana on Wednesday, Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here before attending a limited cabinet
meeting on politics and security, Wiranto said he will also ask
the Commission for Reconciliation and Stability to help solve the
incident fairly so that the direct ballot could be held on time.
</P>
<P>
The commission is composed of East Timorese, security officers,
members of the National Commission on Human Rights and U.N.
personnel.
</P>
<P>
"If the case could not be solved through dialogue, it will be
settled by the police," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces, said
the incident occurred after pro-integration supporters took refuge
at the UNAMET office in Maliana to avoid a confrontation with a
pro-independence group.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jakarta Post, a 100-strong group of
pro-Jakarta militiamen attacked an unarmed U.N. outpost in Maliana
on Tuesday. Seven people were injured during the incident,
including a U.N. officer.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the first reported case of violence against
the U.N. mission since it began work in East Timor last month
ahead of August's scheduled ballot to determine the future of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The incident drew immediate reaction from U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan. A U.N. spokesman said in New York that Annan
"holds the Indonesian government accountable for allowing such an
attack to occur" and that any attack against U.N. personnel and
property was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal in May, Indonesia
agreed to hold the direct ballot in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Tea Sector Set for Privatization by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government will
privatize its state-owned Tea Board by the year 2000, Rwandan
Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigema announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwigema, the tea sector is of considerable
strategic importance in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, it has proved to be a consistently
growing asset for Rwanda's economy, creating 30,000 jobs, and
contributing to the stability of trade balance.
</P>
<P>
"Tea is second to Coffee as a foreign exchange contributor. It
makes up 71% of the total country exports and brought in 19
million U.S. dollars by the end of 1998," Rwigema underlined.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda has today taken the decision to
privatize production units of Tea Board for development reasons,
the Rwanda News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of this privatization is to mobilize and combine
private potential for share holding and management expertise by
injecting both foreign and local capital into the industry, so as
to allow the sector to maximize its output, thus contributing to
national development," he said.
</P>
<P>
As highlighted by the Rwandan Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning Donald Kaberuka, the tea sector in Rwanda was affected by
the 1994 genocide and civil war that led to a loss of 11,000 tons
between 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of Tea Board, Jean Bosco Iyadema,
there are nine factories, with infrastructures and plantations,
and these include among others Mulindi in northeast, Kitabi, Mata,
Shagasha, and Gisakura in southwest, Gisovu in the west, Pfunda
and Rubaya in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
It is said that by the end of 1998, these factories produced 15
million kilograms more than any other year before, on 12,056
hectares for the whole country. The average yield last year was
1.04 tones per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The government proposes to privatize 60 to 80 % of her shares
for cash unit.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of 20 to 40 % of the remaining shares, which
the Tea Board will hold for a maximum duration of three years,
will be reserved for Rwandan investors.

early in the day.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian currency was trading at 63.86
euro cents from 63.58 Tuesday and 79.83 Japanese yen from 79.59.

<HEADLINE> Macao Fishermen Respect Fishing Ban in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen in Macao have been
cooperative in the past month to comply with a fishing ban in the
South China Sea from June 1 to July 31, an official of the
Fishermen Association of Macao said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued by China's Ministry of
Agriculture in March this year, trawling and purse seine fishing
are banned in an area north to 12 degrees of north latitude,
including the Beibu Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Macao fishermen give the consent that the fishing ban is
conducive to protecting fishing resources and safeguarding their
long-term interests," Fung Hee, director of the Fishermen
Association of Macao, told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted that many fishermen were not
accustomed to resting in the two months when they used to be busy
before.
</P>
<P>
"Macao fishermen expect that fishing departments in the
mainland areas of China can effectively carry out the ban so that
they will have good harvests in the future," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the association, the population of
fishermen in Macao is estimated at about 4,000 who own some 450
fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
Fung said the fishing ban has affected the income of fishermen
to some extent, but the association has received no reports of
difficult living. If there are such reports, the association will
make contact with relevant government departments.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, the fishermen have used the period to
repair their boats and nets.

<HEADLINE> Plane With Leaking Fuel Pipe Lands Safely in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An Eva Airlines flight from Chinese
Taipei made an emergency landing Wednesday morning at the
Philippines' Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) after its
pilots discovered leaks in the aircraft's fuel line.
</P>
<P>
The airport authorities said no one among the 243 passengers
and crew members was hurt when Eva Air Flight BR 271 touched down
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The commercial plane was still 550 miles (880 kilometers) away
from the NAIA when the passengers complained of pungent odor
pervading the cabin of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
According to NAIA authority, the plane's pilot and a flight
officer traced the fuel leak to a broken fuel line leading to the
second engine of the three-engine McDonnel Douglas MD-11 jet.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to shut down the aircraft's tail engine in
order to keep the aircraft from burning.
</P>
<P>
They also radioed the Manila Control Tower for emergency
assistance once the aircraft landed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the aircraft touched down safely, the pilots
immediately shut off the two other engines while the fire trucks
trailed the aircraft until it made a complete stop at the end of
the runway.
</P>
<P>
This was the third accident in three days at the airport. On
Monday, a Fedex cargo plane overshot an NAIA runway, forcing a
24-hour closure of the international runway.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, an Air Philippines Boeing 737 jet broke loose
from a tug, causing one of its wings to hit several airport
apparatuses.

<HEADLINE> Rain-Struck Railways Back On Line In Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fierce rainstorms battered both the eastern and western parts
of Guizhou starting yesterday through to early this morning.
</P>
<P>
As much as 225 mm of rain has fallen on areas along the
Xiangqian (from Hunan to Guizhou), the Guikun (from Guizhou to
Kunming) and the Qiangui(from Guizhou to Guangxi) railroads in
Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The rainstorms have caused several landslides, with some parts
of the railways submerged by floodwaters. And this led to the
suspension of 15 pairs of passenger trains on the three routes.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Guiyang Railway Bureau, all
trains moving out from Guiyang Station will be able to resume
normal operations before midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, the weather forecast is for rain to continue over the
next few days. Rescue teams are on guard against more flooding.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rainstorms have hit many provinces and autonomous
regions in southern China, while a heatwave is plaguing the
northern part.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Minister of Trade and Economy Nasser Saidi
said that Israel's air strike on Lebanon's infrastructure would
have no serious effects on the country's economy or the summer
tourism season, the An Nahar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Monday to mark the launch of a
45-day shopping festival at east Lebanon's city of Baalbek, Saidi
said there was no en mass cancellation of hotel reservations by
summer vacationers from Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"All the bookings, whether at hotels or airline companies are
to stay," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks contrast with earlier reports from hotel
owners complaining about massive cancellation of bookings.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco's citrus exports by the end of May amounted
to 573,000 tons, a drop of 3 percent compared to the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the season, citrus exports volume was
estimated at 535,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic economic daily Alam Al Yom Wednesday quoted the
Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries
as saying that these exports included 223,000 tons "small size
fruits," and 350,000 tons of oranges.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Several Arab Gulf states are expected to see their
state budget deficits down by at least 25 percent due to the
rise in oil prices to 10-12 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab daily Al Hayat Wednesday quoted economic experts as
saying that the average petroleum price among the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) will exceed 14 dollars per barrel in 1999, leading
to an increase of 9 billion dollars over the anticipated petroleum
export revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GCC states which hold over 45 percent of world
oil reserves will expect a budget deficit of 22.5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will see a budget deficit of about 9 percent of
its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest since 1993 when it
hit 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Syrian People's Council (parliament) Monday
passed a law stipulating a 21 percent tax exemption on the
production of cotton and cotton yarn in an effort to promote the
competitiveness of the country's textile sector in world markets.
</P>
<P>
The Arab daily Al Hayat Wednesday quoted Syrian economic
sources as saying that the new law will help cut production costs
of Syrian cotton which amounts to about one million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 percent of Syria's 17 million population are engaged in
the field cotton production, and the area under cotton cultivation
is some 215,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Party to Emphasize Its Political Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
must emphasize its Marxist political stance linked to socialism
with Chinese characteristics in order to maintain benefits for the
people, China's President Jiang Zemin urged today.
</P>
<P>
As general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Jiang made
his plea when addressing a forum today marking the 78th
anniversary of the founding of Party.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its existence the CPC has led the Chinese people as
they made great strides forward and achievements in the country's
successful revolution against feudalism, re-construction, and also
importantly in the later reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
"The key reason for the Party's success is its perseverance in
building itself ideologically, politically and organizationally
and in its work style under the guidance of Marxism," Jiang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without a political program, an aim or a party
line, then a party can no longer be regarded as a political
organization.
</P>
<P>
"As a dedicated Marxist party, the CPC with more than 60
million members must hold on to an appropriate political stance,
abide by the Party's disciplinary procedure and requirements and
strengthen political sensitivity and awareness, thus guaranteeing
the unity of the Party ideologically, politically and
organizationally," added Jiang.

<HEADLINE> 49 Dead in Serious Floods in SW China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Serious floods in Sichuan Province,
southwest China, have killed 49 people in the last two months, the
vice-governor Jing Zhengshu announced today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the province's flood-control office show that
from late April to June 29, Sichuan experienced four major
rainfalls, with floods hitting 23 counties and affecting 830,000
people in terms of economic losses and damage to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
The floods have seriously hit 67,000 hectares of crops,
destroyed 830 houses and led to the deaths of 49 people. Total
direct losses from the floods are estimated at some 200 million
yuan (about 24 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The water levels in Sichuan's major rivers have all risen to
different degrees, with some sections of the rivers reaching
record high water levels.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that floods in these rivers may lead to the
rising of water levels in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
It is still raining in the western part of Sichuan and the
local provincial government is making serious preparations for
fighting possibly more serious floods.

GUANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Overseas businesspeople have
been banned by starting up solely-funded business related to
certain types of entertainment, including saunas and massage
parlors, by south China's Guangdong Province.

In the notice, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and
Guangdong Provincial Government also urged restraint in allowing

LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Manchester United will decide their future on next season's FA Cup
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, the Man United, treble
winners of the premier league, FA Cup and European Cup last season,
have scheduled a news conference for 1400GMT.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association has offered United an exemption to
allow the club to play in next January's inaugural world club
championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
F.A. executive director David Davies believes United must play
in the tournament if England are to succeed in their bid for the
2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
If Manchester United do travel to Brazil they would need to
reschedule two premier league fixtures, a possible League Cup
semifinal and an F.A. Cup fourth round tie.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to find enough alternative dates for those
matches is to reduce United's work-load," Davies said.

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday that he has no intention of implementing a revamp
of his cabinet one year after assuming the highest post of the

</P>
<P>
Instead, the president shared the credit of weathering the

all that alone, especially "at a time when many of our neighbors
in Asia have been set back by the currency crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said there is no reason for him to implement a cabinet
revamp, adding that the members of his "official family" have been
doing so well in their duties in their respective departments.
</P>
<P>
He particularly lauded the contributions of his economic
managers -- Trade Secretary Jose Pardo, National Economic and
Development Authority Director-General Felipe Medalla, Budget
Secretary Benjamin Diokno and Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu.
</P>
<P>
"They are the ones who really helped me and who sacrificed so
we can attain economic recovery and overcome the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he ruled out speculations about division and
rift among his cabinet members, adding that reports of
disagreements are just clear signs of transparency in his
government.
</P>
<P>
He said the differences of opinion only show that "there is
freedom to express their views in the cabinet."

<HEADLINE> Daily Slams British-Dutch Draft Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily on Wednesday
slammed a draft resolution by Britain and the Netherlands recently
submitted to the U.N. Security Council on the Iraqi issue, as "a
virulent attempt to undermine Iraq's legitimate right."
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra daily, organ of the ruling Baath party, said the
draft resolution is aimed at undermining Paragraph 22 of the
U.N. resolution 687 which requires the Security Council to lift
the sanctions after Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands recently proposed to the Security
Council that the U.N. sanctions on Iraq be suspended after Iraq
fully cooperates with an enlarged body of weapon inspectors, which
will replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and carry out
more intrusive inspections on Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the U.S. and British governments have never
been concerned with Iraq or the Iraqi people. "How could such
states try to present a draft resolution alleviating sufferings
of the Iraqi people?" inquired the daily.
</P>
<P>
It added that Iraq has the full right to reject such a
resolution and any similar one that deprives Iraq of its
legitimate demands and adds more conditions for lifting the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has the right to caution good-will individuals in
the Security Council not to fall in the Anglo-American trap and
get involved in approving or accepting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Readjusted Income Distribution Crucial for Expanding Demand (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A resurgence of China's weak
domestic market, a prerequisite for the nation's sustainable
economic growth, depends on readjusting income distribution in
order to raise the income level of Chinese citizens, according to
the Wednesday edition of Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's weekly economic review cited one economist's
view that the gap between demand and supply stems from the
declining income expectancy linked with the rising cost of living
which demands increased spending to be fueled by higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
The income growth rate for Chinese citizens has slowed in
recent years. Disposable income for Chinese citizens grew 6.6
percent on an annual basis in 1998 after considering price factors,
with the rate for the early 1990s standing at 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, income and consumption discrepancies between urban
and rural residents have become more distinct, with the purchasing
power of low income families which account for the bulk of
potential consumption declining in spite of government efforts to
stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show a continuing decline in
retail prices in recent months due to soft sales. Nonetheless, the
country's economy has continued to grow smoothly during the period.
The May RPI (retail price index) dropped 1.3 percent on the April
level, with the total consumer goods retail sales growth dipping
by 0.4 percentage points.

<TEXT>
<P>
Any continuance of the downward trend in consumption will
produce a negative impact on enterprises and sustainable national
economic growth, according the Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has responded by adopting a series of
measures to stimulate domestic demand, including intensified fixed-
asset investments, regulations favoring consumer credit and
several interest rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
However, the lagging income growth for the majority of Chinese
citizens has offset government efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, recent reform of the housing, healthcare, pension
and social security systems has placed a heavier burden on
citizens and prompted them to retain bank saving accounts in spite
of low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government must address the issue by initiating reform of
the distribution system, increasing salary levels for low income
workers and strengthening income tax levies, as well as developing
sound welfare and social security systems, according to the
article.
</P>
<P>
A substantial portion of salaries for workers and government
employees was previously applied to welfare benefits such as
housing and healthcare services. Today, however, they are
personally responsible for welfare benefits and thus income levels
should be raised accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The government should earmark a certain proportion of its
budget to ensure basic living standards for Chinese citizens,
particularly unemployed and retired people.
</P>
<P>
The article also called for improved income tax collections and
the introduction of new inheritance and gift taxes to help
facilitate the establishment of an efficient redistribution system.

<HEADLINE> Samsung to Seek Court Receivership for Automaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Samsung Group announced
Wednesday that it will apply for court receivership for Samsung
Motors instead of selling it to Daewoo Group.
</P>
<P>
The group boss Lee Kun-hee said on Wednesday that he will sell
his personal four million shares at Samsung Life Insurance valued
around 2.8 trillion won (some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) for
Samsung Motors to reduce debt burden on creditor banks,
subcontractors and subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Life Insurance controls 35 percent of South Korean life
insurance market, whose assets hit 36.4 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came six months after Samsung and Deawoo
failed to reach any agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Samsung agreed to give its start-up automaking
unit to Daewoo Motors in exchange for Daewoo's Electronics as a
part of "big deal" proposed by the South Korean Government against
over expansion and redundant investments.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to end this now. We thought this would be the best
for the economy," said Samsung Motors Vice Chairman Lee Dae-won.
</P>
<P>
Samsung said it will immediately supply 600 billion won from
Lee Kun-hee's contribution to help ailing subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
Following Samsung's announcement, the South Korean government
said it may allow Samsung Life to go public within this year
rather than the initial schedule of the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Motors' debt will down to some two trillion won after
Lee's donation as the automaker needs 3.1 trillion won to repay
the debt.
</P>
<P>
The other 1.2 trillion of the automaker's total debt of 4.3
trillion won are loans from the group's financial units.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Motors' corporate value is estimated around 1.5
trillion won.
</P>
<P>
Lee's contribution will thus pay off all of the automaker's
debts with credit banks. Creditors will actually have nothing to
lose if Samsung Life's share value rises, said the automaker's
vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
It will take the receivership court three months to study
Samsung's application before endorsing the receivership and
appointing a manager to determine the automaker's future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile industry
suffered a slowdown in growth in May, according to official
statistics, with the output rate for cars standing at 6.5 percent
on a year-on-year basis and that for trucks at a negative two
percent.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the country produced 50,900 cars and 73,900
trucks, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
The NBS expects that car manufacturing will keep a low growth
rate this year, partly because China has raised its standards for
eliminating car pollution and that there will be a sluggish
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also blamed the slowing down of industry and
investment in fixed assets for the drop in truck output.
</P>
<P>
However, against the trend, northeast China's Jilin province,
one of China's major automobile bases, enjoyed a 25-percent growth
rate for its car industry in May, taking the lead in the country,
said the bureau.

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Agriculture Secretary
Edgardo Angara stressed the need to prioritize post-harvest
facilities to reduce the considerable loss of grains.
</P>
<P>
Angara said that due to lack of efficient dryers, warehouses

<P>
At present, the average rice importation of the country is
600,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that the fishery sector loses around
400,000 tons yearly for lack of cold storage and other
post-harvest requirement.
</P>
<P>
"If we can save the 20 to 40 percent of production of fish, we
can certainly hope to be self-sufficient in fish," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he emphasized, "we shall encourage the use of more
efficient post-harvest facilities including cold storage,
mechanical dryers for rice and corn."

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Corn Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the breeding
and development of a new corn strain, known as black corn, to
enrich domestic resources.
</P>
<P>
So far, a batch of the black corn variety has been planted in
dozens of hectares of land in north and northeast China provinces,
according to an expert from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Foodstuffs using black sweet corn such as bread and noodles are
now on sale in a number of shops in some large cities such as
Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The essential elements, which include proteins, amino acid and
other trace elements, such as calcium and selenium, are 50 to 150
percent higher than those in common corn strains, according to
China's Food Testing Center.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts expressed great interest in the new strain
when the Huafeng Xinyuan Corporation first introduced it from Peru
five years ago. As a major corn producer and consumer, China
expects great potential for its corn industry.

<HEADLINE> China's Hi-Tech Stocks Drifting High in Bullish Sentiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New and high-technology stocks
are showing bullish momentum in China's upward swinging stock
market.
</P>
<P>
China's two stock exchanges set a record high in combined
transactions of 83.1 billion yuan on June 25, when the stock index
rose to 1,700 and 4,364 points in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
respectively. They broke the records on June 29, by closing at 1,
739 and 4,851 points.
</P>
<P>
Among the well performing stocks, a group of new and high
technology stocks have moved up by over 100 percent since the
middle of May, much higher than the composite increase of 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Development Technology Shareholding Co., for
example, had its stock traded up to 32.52 yuan per share on June
25, up 124 percent from a month ago. That day, the company's
Digital Signal Processing Laboratory, jointly set up with America'
s Texas Instrument, went into operation.
</P>
<P>
The export oriented company based in Shenzhen, China's first
special economic zone, is one of the world's three major computer
magnet-head suppliers. It has sustained a 50 percent annual profit
increase over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were only 29 state approved new and high
technology companies listed on the stock market. The number jumped
to 135 by the end of last year, accounting for 16 percent of the
total number of listings. They specialize in telecommunications,
bio-pharmaceuticals and bio-engineering industries and the
environmental sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the per-share earning ratio of these companies
averaged 0.2 yuan, 20 percent higher than the average level.
</P>
<P>
China is creating a more favorable climate for new and high
technology industries. The country's first fair for the sector
will be held in October in Shenzhen, which is expected to involve
15 billion yuan worth of capital transactions. Some 24 percent of
the capital flow will go to telecommunications and 12 percent to
the new materials industry, according to officials preparing for
the fair.

<HEADLINE> New Law to Guarantee Development of Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Implementation of Securities Law
on July 1 will guarantee the sustained, stable and healthy
development of China 's securities market, according to a senior
Chinese securities official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency,
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission
(SRC), said that implementation of the law represents a milestone
in the development of China's securities sector and will be a
highly significant factor for further improving the investment
environment on the market.
</P>
<P>
The 250 rules and regulations issued by the SRC and the
Securities Law, the first of its kind in China, will ensure more
effective regulation of the securities market, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that SRC has submitted a draft of the Temporary
Regulations of the Stock Issuance Verification Commission to the
State Council for approval and has drafted Stipulations on
Procedures for Approving Public Stock Offerings. Zhou voiced his
expectation that the latter regulations will be implemented in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The SRC is currently drafting four major documents, including
the Regulations on Supervising and Managing Listed Companies. The
four documents create excellent conditions to ensure the regulated
development of the securities market, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pledged that the SRC will further strengthen supervision
of the securities market and expand its supervision transparency.

"Either we progress together or we sink together," Fulci warned.
"Unless we act swiftly to reverse the spread of abject poverty,
our world tomorrow will be much worse and the prosperity and
security of many will be put at risk."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a UN report said that over 1.5 billion people still

absolute poor continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
There are close to one billion adult illiterates in the world,
most of whom are women, the report said. Three quarters of a
billion people have no access to health services. Malnutrition
affects over 800 million people. Many millions lack access to safe
water, and many millions more have a life expectancy of less than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
The greatest number of people below the poverty line live in
Asia, the report said, but the depth of poverty, which measures
how far incomes fall below the poverty line, is greater in sub-
Saharan Africa than any other region.

<HEADLINE> Transgenic Engineering Industry Center Set up in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's first transgenic center
has been established by the Zhejiang Chaofan Transgenic
Engineering Company as part of a national effort to promote the
development and production of transgenic animals and related
products.
</P>
<P>
The company, jointly established by the national transgenic
sheep research team and east China's Zhejiang Province at a cost
of 47.7 million yuan, will concentrate on raising genetically
altered animals and manufacturing various drugs using the milk of
these animals, on the basis of technology developed by the
research team.
</P>
<P>
The team, consisting of Zeng Yitao and Huang Shuzhen and other
scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Medical Sciences and
Genetics, injected the human blood clotting agent Factor IX into a
zygote of a goat which was then transplanted into the womb of a
female goat, resulting in the first transgenic goat in China last
year. It later produced milk containing Factor IX.
</P>
<P>
The scientists then used a similar method on a cow by
transplanting embryos grown in test tubes out of zygotes with
human albumin genes into eight cows, three of which became
pregnant, one of which gave birth to a transgenic calf in February
this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these achievements will greatly benefit human
albumin drug production using genetically altered animal milk and
this is specially important for the safety of products derived
from human plasma.

<HEADLINE> First Fiber Optical Cable Inaugurated in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest fiber
optical projects in the region was inaugurated Wednesday in
Cambodia, greatly upgrading the country's existing
telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony held in the northern province of
Kompong Chhnang, about 70 kilometers from the capital, was
attended by Prime Minister Hun Sen, Post and Telecommunications
Minister So Khun, local authorities representatives, the German
ambassador, high-ranking officials from Germany as well as
representatives from Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The cable was donated by Germany and it costs about 10 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech, Hun Sen thanked the German
government for its free assistance in modernizing the Cambodian
network.
</P>
<P>
He said, "All the projects built under the aid of the friendly
countries have played an important role in Cambodia's economic
development and its integration into the international community."
</P>
<P>
"As a country less developed in economy, we need to make even
more efforts to integrate ourselves into the world with higher
technology," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The 608-kilometer-long cable will provide the foundation for
the rapid expansion of telecommunications in the country and grant
substantial savings for telephone users.
</P>
<P>
The project, linking the Cambodian-Thai border at Poipet to the
Cambodian-Vietnamese border at Bavet through Phnom Penh, the
Cambodian capital, is the first step toward creating an
information superhighway connecting the six countries bordering
the Mekong River -- China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"At present, only about one people among 100 Cambodians has a
telephone while there is a higher percentage in the capital at
more than 7 percent. By 2003, we will be able to see two people
among 100 will have telephone," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that 200 million U.S. dollars will be needed in
investment in this project.

000 tons, 12,000 tons more than the previous year and a new all
time high.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Hainan Provincial Department
of Agriculture, the province planted a total of 2.58 million mu (
172,000 hectares) of early season rice, and half of the land was
seeded with high-quality rice breeds.
</P>
<P>
"We devoted a total of one million mu (66,000 ha) of land to
the growing of hybrid rice, whose output is higher than that of
ordinary rice by some 50 to 57 kilograms per mu," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the island's bumper harvest to a timely and
effective prevention of rice diseases and insect pests.
</P>
<P>
The reaping of rice across the island is expected to be
completed within the next couple of days.

<HEADLINE> Partnership Essential for Labor Training: Singapore Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister of Manpower
Lee Boon Yang Wednesday stressed that the tripartite partnership
between employees, employers and the government is essential for
the training and development of the work force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) Asian and Pacific Tripartite Consultative Meeting here, Lee
said the effectiveness of human resources development (HRD) and
training efforts hinges very much on partnership and shared
commitment of employees, employers and the government.
</P>
<P>
He said effective HRD programs would require employers to
invest in training and skill upgrading that go beyond meeting the
requirements of the present jobs and employers must prepare
workers for changes in technology and the way in which a company
does its business.
</P>
<P>
Citing skill upgrading as the worker's guarantee for
employability, Lee said employees' active participation in
learning and re-learning would sharpen their competency and
adaptability to new and higher-value-added jobs in a rapidly
changing business environment.
</P>
<P>
Lee also rests special responsibility on the government, saying
governments have a special responsibility to invest and equip the
work force with basic education that is essential for the
acquisition of new skills to keep pace with technological changes.
</P>
<P>
"Governments must promote the concept of life-learning and
constant refreshing of every worker's stock of skills and
knowledge," he added.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that as a result of tripartite efforts,
Singapore spent more than 258 million Singapore dollars (about 152
million U.S. dollars) on workers' skills development last year and
 more than 20,000 workers from 249 companies from many different
sectors are committed to training under the Skills Redevelopment
Program.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that his country will launch a strategic manpower
blueprint, known as "Manpower 21," next month with its strategic
thrust to be taken for the creation of a national system of
life-learning for workers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is held by the ILO in collaboration with
Singapore's Ministry of Manpower to serve as a forum to review
country situations and exchange experiences on HRD and training
especially in the context of increasing globalization.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 participants including representatives of the
government, employees and employers from 14 countries in the
Asian-Pacific region are attending the seminar which will last
until July 2.

<HEADLINE> Australian Deputy PM Quits for Family Reasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
and Trade Minister Tim Fischer announced Wednesday that he would
quit from July 20 this year in order to spend more time with his
family.
</P>
<P>
In a recorded message broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC), Fischer also said he would resign as leader of
the National Party of Australia, the minor partner of Australia's
ruling coalition under the leadership of Prime Minister John
Howard.
</P>
<P>
Howard leaves on Monday for a two-week trip to Japan and the
United States and Fischer will be acting prime minister until July
20.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Fischer could quit because of
his son's mild autism, but he had given public assurances that he
would stay on in the parliament for the current three-year term,
which began late last year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer announced his resignation earlier Wednesday during a
special meeting of National Party MPs he called to inform them of
his decision.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Wednesday on Fischer's resignation decision, Howard
said he will miss Fischer for his loyalty to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said his party will hold a meeting Thursday to elect
his successor as new party leader.
</P>
<P>
The ABC reported that Fischer's deputy John Anderson has
confirmed that he will run for the vacancy left by Fischer, which
brings with it the title of deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A coalition between the National Party, which represents the
interest of Australian farmers, and the Liberal Party of Australia
led by the prime minister won last October's federal election to
rule Australia for a second three-year term.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Production of Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce a quality
management system to put an end to the historical lack of
standards and norms which have affected the production of
traditional Chinese medicines for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to ensure the production of Chinese herbal medicine
in a scientific and modern way so that they will also be accepted
by people of other nations.
</P>
<P>
China is abundant in plant resources for medicine, with an
estimated 10,000 varieties. It also has a rich variety of minerals
that can be used as raw drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, although Chinese herbal medicine has a history of
thousands of years in China, it accounts for only three to five
percent of the world herbal medicine market which stands at 16
billion U.S. dollars a year. The remainder of the market is shared
by Japan, India, Thailand and The Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Science and Technology has already decided
to launch very soon a project to modernize the traditional Chinese
medicine sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, 124 countries worldwide have established various kinds
of institutions related to traditional Chinese medicine and more
than 9,000 people come to China to receive training each year.
</P>
<P>
France, for example, has 2,800 clinics offering traditional
Chinese medicine treatment and the country currently consumes 43,
000 tons of such medicines every year.
</P>
<P>
It has also been learned that many countries have begun
stepping up their research into Chinese herbal medicines over the
past few years and Japan has more than 20,000 kinds of Chinese
preparations.
</P>
<P>
Now the traditional Chinese medicines produced by two
pharmaceutical plants in Tianjin and Shanghai have passed the
authentication of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

<HEADLINE> China Expecting Stable Tea Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's tea output for this year
is expected to reach 665,000 tons, equal to that of last year or
even slightly higher, according to forecasts from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
An official from the plantation department of the ministry
noted that the weather this year is favorable for tea growing. As
a result of that, the quality of Spring tea is better than last
year. Meanwhile, Summer and Autumn tea is growing well.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the output of good quality and well-known tea
products, which reached 116,000 tons last year or 17 percent of
the total tea harvest, is expected to go higher this year and will
nudge the market price lower.
</P>
<P>
China known as the "Home of Tea" is one of the major tea
exporters in the world. Its tea production, however, fell into the
doldrums between 1993 to 1995 due to a downturn in the
international tea market and rising production costs at home. The
output at one point dropped to 400,000 tons from a high of 800,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The sector is now coming out of shadows by restructuring its
product mix. China's tea plantation acreage now has increased to
760,000 ha. and domestic sales last year reached 395,000 tons
earning 7.1 billion yuan (about 865 million US dollars).

SHENYANG, June 30 (Xinhua -- A female drug dealer was executed
in the city of Anshan, one of China's steel production bases in
the northeastern province of Liaoning, over the weekend, local
authorities announced today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xia, 36, was convicted of purchasing heroin from the
border area of southwest China's Yunnan Province in March of 1997,
and, with the assistance of her husband, selling the drug to
addicts in Anshan for a profit of 6,000 yuan (about 750 US dollars)
. The Anshan police also seized 590.2 grams of heroin from Zhou's
house while carrying out the arrest.

According to police investigations, Zhou, a jobless person from
the Tiedong District of Anshan, became addicted to drugs after
encouragement by her husband and the main purpose of her drug
dealing was to finance her own habit.

Zhou was sentenced to death by a local court for transporting

by the Supreme People's Court in Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Developing Nations' Role in WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China stressed the role of
developing countries in the forthcoming global trade negotiations
at the end of the trade ministers' meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC), which concluded here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, trade ministers or representatives of
the APEC's 21 economies gave their top priority to the new round
of global trade negotiations to be launched by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Minister of Trade and Economic Cooperation Long
Yongtu said China hopes that the contents and outcomes of the new
round of WTO negotiations will help set up a fairer and more open
trade system.
</P>
<P>
Although the world economy has benefited from trade and
investment liberalization in the past two decades, the benefits of
different countries are greatly unbalanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the gap between economies is widening
instead of narrowing and many developing economies have not
achieved the expected rapid growth. The least developed countries
are still increasing.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the new round of WTO negotiations should not only
be aimed at promoting the global trade growth and the world
economic development in general, but also it should fully consider
the demands and interests of the developing economies, so that
they can benefit more from the multilateral trade system," Long
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way, he continued, the new round of WTO
negotiations will win the broad support of and active
participation by developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Long noted that the economic growth of developing countries and
their support and participation are crucial to the success of the
new round of WTO negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new round of WTO negotiations will contribute
to the stability of the world economy and its steady growth.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Japan and
New Zealand were of the view that the agenda of the new round of
WTO negotiations should take the interests of all parties into
account.
</P>
<P>
They said they would be glad to see China and other countries
and regions who are applying for membership of the WTO join the
organization as soon as possible. They noted that without China's
participation, the new round of WTO negotiations will be
impossible to achieve its complete success.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives noted that developing countries would
suffer from long-term effects of the economic crisis and that they
should not participate in the new round of WTO negotiations while
carrying on their crisis burdens. They also called on other
countries to help developing countries completely get rid of the
economic crisis quickly.
</P>
<P>
The representatives urged the informal meeting of APEC leaders,
which will be held here in September, to make suggestions
concerning the agenda and direction of the new round of WTO
negotiations.

KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments
maintained a 21 percent increase over the past four years with
1998/1999 fiscal year topping 230 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Monitor daily said that total foreign direst
investment from January 1995 to January 1998 for Uganda is 422
million dollars, much higher than the reportedly 65 million
dollars for Kenya over the same period.
</P>
<P>
In the background to the Budget 1999/2000, the Ministry of
Finance said the investment as a percentage of gross domestic
product (GDP) is projected at 3.5 percent during 1998/1999
financial year ending by the end of June, up from 3.1 percent of
GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the ministry show that during financial year
1996/1997, foreign direct investment amounted to 160 million
dollars, nearly 40 million dollars more than that registered in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The positive trend in the foreign direct investment inflow is
attributed to strong government commitment to sound economic
policies, particularly fiscal discipline, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 2.5 Million Children Compelled to Work in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that some 2.5
million children are compelled to work to earn a living in
Indonesia and some 2,000 of them are known to be employed at
high-risk places, Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris said.
</P>
<P>
Children could work due to economic reasons, but their working
hours should be limited to three hours a day only so that they can
still go to school after work, Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted
Fahmi as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said at the launching ceremony of a
program on overcoming child labor problems in Indonesia here
Tuesday, that the government cannot tolerate children working at
places entailing high risks to their safety.
</P>
<P>
He said child labor is a problem which cannot be solved through
raids but must be solved comprehensively by providing employment
to families.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi admitted that following the deepening of the economic
crisis that has swept the whole country, the number of children
compelled to earn a living is showing an upward tendency.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, child labor in Indonesia was estimated to stand at
some 2.4 million, but in 1995 the number was down to 1.7 million,
he said, adding that in 1998, however, the number went up again to
2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion the minister also witnessed the signing of a
cooperation agreement on overcoming child labor problems between
the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
ILO has made available 1.2 million U.S. dollars in aid to
support activities carried out under the cooperation scheme.

MONTEVIDEO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Peru defeated Japan while
Paraguay and Bolivia drew goalless in Group A on the opening day

</P>
<P>
Roberto Holsen scored twice in an eight-minute span to boost
Peru to the 3-2 victory over the Asian guest Japan in the opener
in Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital.
</P>

Holsen scored in the 74th and 82nd minutes but it was Japan who
scored the opening in the sixth minute through a Wagner Lopes
header.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Soto scored in the 70th minute to equalize for Peru
before Holsen netted his first goal to put Peru ahead.
</P>

A free kick from Japan's Atsuhiro Miura evened the score in the
78th minute. But Holsen's deciding goal came as he headed in off a
centering pass from Flavio Maestri.

For the host Paraguay, scoring opportunities abounded when they
met Bolivia but what they lacked were the finishing touch.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese People Accept Second Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted in the
port city of Tianjin, north China, showed that second marriages
are no longer taboos for the elderly Chinese people and that
widows and widowers hope to remarry.
</P>
<P>
The survey of some 4,000 elderly Tianjin residents, including
600 widows and widowers, revealed that 46 percent of respondents
agreed that elderly people should remarry. In addition, some 68
percent of widows and widowers expressed the desire to remarry.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists noted that the responses indicate gradual
abandonment of the traditional concept that elderly people should
depend on their children for companionship and support, and that
most widows and widowers are lonely and need new partners.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 120 million elderly
citizens, including over 42 million widows and widowers. Tianjin
alone is home to over 350,000 widows and widowers.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the common wish to remarry as indicated in the
survey, only five percent of elderly Tianjin widows and widowers
have in fact remarried. Most elderly people fear the rumors which
quite accompany remarriages and some children selfishly dissuade
their parent from remarrying in order to protect their
inheritances.

HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in Hangzhou, capital
of east China's Zhejiang Province, has successfully transplanted
an unfrozen test-tube embryo into a woman's womb.
</P>
<P>
A recent examination shows that the embryo, which had been
frozen for 15 months, is growing well in the womb.
</P>
<P>
The woman, who has only given her surname Liu, had been unable
to conceive during her eight year marriage and sought help from
the Zhejiang Women's Hospital in 1997.
</P>
<P>
After finding an obstruction in both her fallopian tubes,
doctors took ova from her and bred several embryos in a test-tube.
They then transplanted one of the embryos into her womb, while
freezing the others in the hospital, with Liu's approval.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Liu had a miscarriage when she was five months
pregnant. In March this year, she went to the hospital again and
underwent the transplant of an unfrozen embryo.

<P>
MADOI (QINGHAI), JUNE 30 (Xinhua) -- The mainstream of the
Yellow River at its source in Qinghai Province, northwest China,
has remained dry for eight months.
</P>
<P>
Gengque, the magistrate of Madoi County in Qinghai Province,
noted that the mainstream had never before remained dry from one
year to another.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is 5,464 km long, running through nine
provinces and autonomous regions before emptying into the Yellow
Sea. Headwaters initially flow into Zhaling Lake and on to Eling
Lake before surging downstream to the middle and lower reaches of
the river.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed that the May water level in Eling was
one meter below the 4,268 meter level in 1993, with the water flow
rate falling from 7.8 cu.m. per second to 2.7 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
Madoi County, an area covering 25,000 sq.km., originally had 4,
077 lakes covering more than one sq.km. each. However, over 2,000
smaller lakes which used to dot grasslands and river valleys no
longer exist.
</P>
<P>
Gengque attributed the phenomenon to successive droughts, the
shrinkage of grasslands and the deteriorating environment.

<HEADLINE> Religious Education May Return to Lebanese Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Education Minister
Mohammed Youssef Beydoun has announced a preliminary decision to
make religious education compulsory, a move critics warned could
exacerbate sectarian division, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have finally decided to ... bring back religious education
to public schools after its years of absence," he said Tuesday
after a meeting with spokesmen of the country's 18 religious
parties.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of eight main denominations had unanimously
agreed to prepare separate school books on Islam and Christianity,
with a subsidiary chapter on the other religion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which has yet to get cabinet approval, would take
at least two years to come into effect, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Messara, member of the committee of academics which
worked on the school curriculum this year, criticized that
compulsory religious education "could be used as an excuse to
foster division and sectarian differences between students."
</P>
<P>
Religious teachings were taken off the state school curriculum
and made optional under former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a
bid to reduce sectarian tensions which were blamed for causing the
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
But clerics criticized the move, and have repeatedly called
for its reintroduction.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Environment Kezimbira Miyingo has said that developed countries
should be blamed for the global environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when opening a climate change
project inception workshop at the International Conference Center
here Tuesday, the New Vision paper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries' unsustainable pattern of consumption has
largely caused problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged for integrated and concerted efforts in
combating environmental problems because this is a global problem
and threatens to permanently change global weather and climate
with serious consequences on human activities.
</P>
<P>
He said western Uganda was already hit by severe drought.
Animal and crop production in the region had slumped due to lack
of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Cattle were dying for lack of water and pasture. The government
had already received reports of banana plants drying up in the
gardens, he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Parliament to Pass Referendum Bill First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Parliament resolved
Tuesday to pass the Referendum Bill before the Political
Organizations Bill after a four-hour stand-off.
</P>
<P>
The House, in an extraordinary sitting from morning till
evening, voted out the Legal Affairs Committee proposal that the
Parties Bill comes first, the New Vision newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Several MPs criticised Justice Minister Mayanja Nkangi, saying
that he introduced the bill too late, leaving members with on
choice but pass it to avoid a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Francis Ayume had a hard task accommodating various
points of information, order, clarification and procedure in a
long-winding debate, unusually attended by over 30 ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution demands that the Referendum bill be enacted
into law by mid-night on July 2. Campaigns for the referendum are
expected to follow up.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is expected to hold a referendum before July 3 of 2000
to decide the political system the country should adopt. The
multi-party MPs insist that general elections be held first and
that people are free to form other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's ruling National Resistance Movement denies that it is
a political party and allows no official activities of other
political organizations.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the ruling party (the movement) will
get at least 80 percent votes in the coming referendum.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Leaders of Central Government Institutions in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
this morning urged the central government institutions and
mainland-funded enterprises in Hong Kong to implement the "one
country, two systems" policy and abide by the Basic Law and the
laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He also called on these institutions and firms to respect and
support the work of the SAR government under Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks during a meeting with leading members of
the central government institutions and mainland-funded
enterprises in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy and the Basic Law have been fully implemented and Hong
Kong has maintained prosperity and stability since its return to
China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency, as an
authorized working organ of the central government, has maintained
close links with all the sectors in Hong Kong and has enhanced the
exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
He added that the branch has "effectively handled" some affairs
related to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hu went on to say that the Office of the Commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry has handled foreign affairs related to
Hong Kong and helped the SAR government in external affairs, thus
promoting Hong Kong's liaison and cooperation with countries and
regions outside China and international organizations in the
economic, cultural and other spheres.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the Garrison of the People's Liberation Army in
Hong Kong, Hu said that the garrison has won the trust and acclaim
from local residents by performing its duties according to law and
safeguarding the country's sovereignty, unification, territorial
integrity and Hong Kong's security.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that the work of these central government
institutions has enriched the theory and practice of "one country,
two systems" and contributed to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mainland-funded enterprises in Hong Kong, a
bridge and window of China in foreign economic relations, have
played an important role in promoting cooperation between Hong
Kong and the mainland areas and in providing funds and market
information for the economic developments in the mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
Hu recalled that soon after Hong Kong's return to China
President Jiang Zemin said that the great concept of "one country,
two systems" and the policies of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy advanced by Deng Xiaoping were
correct, that Hong Kong compatriots were capable of running Hong
Kong well, that the SAR government led by Tung Chee Hwa had the
wisdom and experience to cope with the complex situation and that
the great socialist motherland stood foursquare behind Hong Kong
in overcoming the difficulties and risks on its road of advance
and maintaining prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Such observations, Hu added, constitute not only the basis for
the evaluation of Hong Kong's present situation and future
development, but an important guarantee for maintaining Hong Kong'
s long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were SAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa; Jiang Enzhu, director of the Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch; Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in the SAR; and Xiong Ziren, commander of the
People's Liberation Army Garrison in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liao Hui, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, and Chen Fujin, deputy director of the General
Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
were also on hand.
</P>
<P>
Hu came to Hong Kong from Shenzhen Tuesday morning for the
unveiling of the Reunification Monument on the second anniversary
of Hong Kong's return to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A one million signatures campaign
and road race competition will mark Indonesia's efforts to garner
moral support from the public for its athletes competing at the
upcoming Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
Nestle Milo, a chocolate beverage producer, and Indonesia's
educational department will encourage the students of primary
schools in Jakarta to post their messages and signatures on a
banner.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is expected to provide a morale booster for the
Indonesian athletes in their respective attempts to gain sporting
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
The organizers will also target people in the campaign
providing banners at a number of public facilities such as
shopping centers and sport centers throughout the country. One
million signatures -- should it be realized -- will make it into
the record book.
</P>
<P>
The banners will be displayed along the route of the 5-km and
10-km run competitions in a program entitled "Milo Indonesian
Champions' Run", in which a total of more than 7 million rupiah (1,
000 U.S. dollars will be offered in prizes.
</P>
<P>
The run, co-organized by the country's track and field
federation, will be held on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to give moral support to our
athletes. We are only contributing a small amount of money for
them. But they will receive support from all Indonesian people,
represented by one million of their signatures," marketing brand
manager of Nestle Indonesia Rudolf D. Hoeffelma said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Insures SEA Games Athletes, Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) is providing two months of life insurance coverage
worth 5.83 billion rupiah (832,857 U.S. dollars) for 583 athletes
and officials from 20 sports taking part in the 20th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
KONI official in charge of athletes development Mochamad
Hindarto said that athletes and officials were each entitled to 10
million rupiah in coverage for accidents during training here or
in competition at the biennial event in Brunei Darussalam from
August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Provided by PT Pasaraya Life Insurance, the coverage began on
June 19 and lasts until August 19.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have insured our athletes for the
training period for the SEA Games. We want to anticipate any
unprecedented accidents during training and competition," Hindarto
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that KONI experienced difficulties in paying for the
medical costs of a rower injured at Jaliluhur dam during the 1997
Games here.
</P>
<P>
KONI planning and budget deputy Sudharno said the council
picked Pasaraya Life because it offered a more lucrative policy
premium.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta-based insurance company provided a monthly policy
premium of 7,000 rupiah for each participant.
</P>
<P>
"We only have to pay 8.162 million rupiah on the policy premium
for 583 participants. We have to pay in two stages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Swimming Association (PRSI) technical division
official Lukman Niode welcomed KONI's initiative, saying athletes
would be freed from concerns over medical costs if they were
injured.
</P>
<P>
"The insurance coverage should be more effective in multi-event
competitions like the SEA Games. PRSI cannot provide the insurance
because it would cost us a lot of money. Moreover, not all
swimmers are consistent in their achievements," he said.

<HEADLINE> We're the Underdog, German Women Insist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- When the men's national teams
of Germany and the United States met in last year's World Cup, the
Germans were heavy favorites. A defeat would have been considered
disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
With the women's teams from the same two countries set to meet
in a quarterfinal Thursday in suburban Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,
the public perception should be very different.
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand that the USA is the leading team,"
said Willi Henk, director of the German soccer federation's
technical program, which includes oversight of the women's
national team.
</P>
<P>
"They think the USA can't play soccer. They were more
interested in Germany against Brazil. "
</P>
<P>
The respective countries' head coaches paid one another
compliments Monday as they traveled to Washington to settle in for
a couple of days of training before the match.
</P>
<P>
"We have an edge in speed, but they are athletic," U.S. head
coach Tony DiCicco said. Midfielder Bettina Wiegmann is one of the
best players in the world, almost impossible to dispossess, a
class player in every sense of the word."
</P>
<P>
"They're a very proud team, a champion," DiCicco said of the
four-time European titlist. "They obviously weren't very happy
with their result against Brazil. In that country, it's politics,
soccer and religion, take your pick of what comes first."
</P>
<P>
German head coach Tina Theune-Meyer called the U.S. team the
cream of the tournament. "They are the best prepared in every way,
" she said. "You can see they are a team. They show it."
</P>
<P>
DiCicco said he has not decided whether to return to his
original starting 11 or give any of his super subs -- including
forward Shannon MacMillan, who had a goal and two assists against
DPR Korea-- another chance.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, it's about putting the hottest players on the
field, who's ready, who's confident," he said. "Those performances
yesterday, you have to take note."
</P>
<P>
The coach said he is aware of how difficult it is for players
like MacMillan and Tisha Venturini, the midfielder who scored
twice Sunday, to accept reserve roles after starting on the 1996
Olympic gold medal team. "I have as much respect for what they're
going through as I do for the starters, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany captain and midfield mainstay Martina Voss won't play
again in the World Cup after she aggravated a leg injury Sunday
against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Voss, 31, who earned her 120th cap in that game, did not play
in the first two games to try to let the injury heal, but came out
25 minutes into the Brazil game.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's 10 American college
students had a difficult time adjusting to a national team, as
evidenced by an 0-3 finish in their first Women's World Cup soccer
appearance.
</P>
<P>
They also had to contend with the NCAA's hundreds of rules.
While the Mexican federation gave its players a whopping $20 per
day allowance, the students could take on $10 because of NCAA
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"I saved it up little by little to buy something little," said
Mexican goalkeeper Linnea Quinones (San Digego State) after her
team lost 2-0 to Italy on Sunday. "It sucks, but it's a rule."
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing the tournament undistinguished, the Mexicans
team left Foxboro Stadium with a measure of pride because of
subtle improvements over the course of there Group B matches. They
lost to Brazil 7-1, and Germany 6-0 before giving Italy a
challenge on an oppressive 90-degree day.
</P>
<P>
Exhausted but smiling, Mexico marched away talking about a big
future. "After the first two games, I was upset and frustrated,"
said Lisa Nanez, a former Santa Clara University player. "But I
was happy with the results today. I hope this team will prosper."

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission Jacques Santer said on Tuesday that the European Union
(EU) may re-direct its agricultural policies because they are
worrying the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here at the end of the Latin
American-European Union summit that the trade barriers of the
European countries have impeded the exports from the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe has reached a level of competitiveness that
makes it possible to re-direct its agricultural policies. This
idea will be expressed at the "Millennium Watch" meetings, which
are to begin in Seattle, the United States, in November within the
frame of the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao's future will be more
brilliant after its return to China on December 20, Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government has cooperated closely with the
Chinese government to ensure a smooth handover of the Macao
administration, the prime minister told Xinhua during a press
conference at the Museum of Modern Art, the site for the Latin
America, the Caribbean and the European Union (LA-EU) Summit.
</P>
<P>
Macao has established close ties with Europe, especially with
the Iberian Peninsula countries, said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Those relations are an enormous advantage for the future
development of Macao, which will be able to act as a bridge
between China and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government is "very optimistic" over Macao's
future and is willing to strengthen its relations with China after
the return of the region, the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Big Quake Forecast for Mexican Pacific Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Seismological
Service (NSS) Tuesday warned of a possible powerful earthquake in
Mexico's Pacific coastal area.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters also gave a
similar warning about the existence of "seismic breaches" in
Guerrero and Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The organizations defined the seismic breach as a point of
shock between two plates deep in the earth, which accumulate
tension along the time until the friction surpasses the resistance
of the rocks and an earthquake occurs.
</P>
<P>
NSS director Javier Pacheco remembered that in the early years
of this century a great number of seisms were registered, that
broke the terrain in the region between Tapachula and Tonala, in
the southeast of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Pacheco said that the remoteness in time of those seisms makes
highly probable the eventuality of a powerful earthquake, that
could reach up to seven degrees on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
He added that a similar circumstance is recorded in Guerrero,
where no teluric contingence has occurred again since 1911.
</P>
<P>
The expert also said that there are other areas with high
seismic risk, including the Tehuantepec "fracture" and the coasts
of Colima and Michoacan, in the Mexican Pacific coast.

KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai expanded his cabinet Wednesday by inducting 17
new faces including one woman and five from the far-western region
of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The 32-member new cabinet includes 19 ministers, eight state
ministers and five assistant ministers.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen ministers of the old cabinet remain. Taranath Ranabhat
resigned as minister for law and justice and parliamentary affairs
before he took office as speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bhattarai holds concurrently the portfolios of
defense and royal palace affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ram Sharan Mahat was assigned foreign minister while Purna
Bahadur Khadka took over the powerful home ministry plus the
ministry of information and communications.
</P>
<P>
Kamala Pand is the only female in the cabinet. She is minister
of state for women and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Five lawmakers from the far-western region were included into
the cabinet this time. Lawmakers elected from the region had
expressed their unhappiness over Bhattarai's failure to include
any one of them in the 16-member cabinet formed on May 31.
</P>
<P>
The region returned the Nepali Congress candidates in all its
18 constituencies in the general elections held in May. The Nepali
Congress won 111 of the 205 seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that he would complete the cabinet formation in
three phases.
</P>
<P>
It is the first majority government in Nepal in four and half
years.
</P>
<P>
Six governments had ruled the kingdom in the past four and half
years after the mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Austria Concerned About Death Penalty of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Prime Minister Viktor
Klima said here Tuesday that his country is concerned about the
death penalty that Turkey has meted out to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Austria is in principle against the death penalty, Klima said.
He hoped that the transparency should be kept when other possible
lawful measures are taken, such as opening up an international
court and trying Ocalan again.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel pointed out that every country has appropriate rights
against terrorism, but to execute Ocalan will intensify the hatred
between the two sides and obstruct permanent political resolutions
to the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party, was sentenced to
death Tuesday morning by a security court in Turkey. The verdict
is yet to be confirmed by an appeal court, the Turkish Parliament
and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.

<HEADLINE> New Investments Hit First Half Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Board of Investment has
met its target of 100 billion pesos (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) in
fresh equity investment of the year, Business World reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Melito Salazar, managing chief of the government body, told
reporters Tuesday that they surpassed the target after the agency
approved three big-ticket projects just this month,
</P>
<P>
However, the approved fresh investments totaling 100.27 billion
pesos only represent a 34 percent drop from the year-ago 152.3
billion pesos (3.8 billion dollars) .
</P>
<P>
Total investments this month alone reached 68.49 billion pesos
(1.7 billion dollars), up 270 percent from the 1998 level of 18.4
billion pesos (460 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The achievement is reached largely due to a 44.46-billion-peso
(1.1-billion-dollar) refinery conversion project of Petron
Petropower Corp.
</P>
<P>
Petron's project will be implemented under a joint-venture
arrangement with U.S.-based Foster Wheeler Power Systems.
</P>
<P>
Other two major projects are the development of integrated
medical centers with an injection of 6 billions pesos (1.5 billion
dollars) and a new public utility articulated bus system with 3.8
billion pesos (950 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the second semester, the investment agency is targeting 300
billion pesos (7.5 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Asked to Grant Foreign Troop Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Coordination Center for
Logistic Support between Bulgaria and NATO has so far received
requests from Poland, Turkey, the Czech Republic and Hungary for
the passage of troops through the Bulgarian territory, Colonel
Vassil Vurbanov, head of the center, told a news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first Polish echelon which entered the country on Monday
has already left Bulgaria and another one is expected to enter on
Tuesday, Vurbanov said. A total of seven Polish echelons are
scheduled to pass through Bulgaria, he added.
</P>
<P>
Early July will see the transit of the next batch of troops:
the first of three Czech trainloads on July 1 (129 soldiers and 66
military vehicles) and the first of six Turkish trainloads and a
road column on July 3 (372 troops and 60 vehicles), Vurbanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Czech train will enter Bulgaria from Romania via Rousse (on
the Danube) and will leave the country via the Koulata checkpoint
on the Greek border. The Turks will come via the Kapitan Andreevo
checkpoint and will leave Bulgaria via Gueshevo (on the Macedonian
border), Vurbanov noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has not requested permission for passage of ground
echelons via Bulgaria, Vurbanov said, adding that no request to
use the Black Sea port of Bourgas for transit of troops has been
made either. "Nonetheless, we are prepared in case we receive a
request."
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Tencho Dobrev, deputy chief of general staff
of the Bulgarian Army, said that border formalities for the troops
will include only documentation clearance as they are entitled to
preferential customs treatment.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's agreement with NATO on the transit passage of allied
troops and equipment via the country under the Joint Guardian
operation was ratified by Parliament on June 25.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Warns of Mass Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI)
Chief Gen. Wiranto Tuesday warned of possible mass rallies ahead
of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) general session which
may create conflict between the people and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Such rallies will result in conflict on the streets between
the people, Polri (National Police) and the TNI," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
The 700-strong MPR is made up of 200 government appointees and
500 members of the House of Representatives (DPR). The June 7
election will choose 462 legislators. A further 38 seats are
reserved for the powerful military.
</P>
<P>
As no single party will attain an absolute majority in these
elections, the road to the presidency is expected to be bumpy this
year.
</P>
<P>
Megawati Soekarnoputri, whose Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) held a convincing lead in the provisional tally,
is the front-runner for the presidency. She is in competition with
President B.J. Habibie who has been nominated for the presidency
by the ruling Golkar Party, which trailed PDI-P in the tally.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also defense and security minister, said mass
rallies in support of presidential candidates are a "wrong step"
and will mislead the people.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time to maintain and develop the existing good
situation here. The elections were held safely. That is a positive
sign for us ahead of the MPR general session," national
newspapers Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto called on the public, experts and politicians in
particular, to comment on the political situation only with
"realistic and soothing" statements.
</P>
<P>
He said common people do not ask too much but only wish for
peace, adequate food and clothing, health security and schools for
their children.
</P>
<P>
"I think the voice of the grassroots must be heard. By
listening to their voice, politicians who will determine the
future of the nation through a democratic process may find the
best solution which is certainly not in rhetoric that will only
confuse the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with University of Indonesia lecturers on Tuesday,
Wiranto said that the TNI will remain neutral in the middle of the
battle between the camps of Megawati and Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The TNI would not side with either Habibie's or Megawati's
camp, but with the people, Wiranto stressed.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President

a pole against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the end of the summit,

<P>
He also said that it was possible that there would be a Latin
American currency in the future.
</P>
<P>
By focusing on the expansion of dialogue, Cardoso said, the

repercussions for the 21st century in the face of economic
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gov't to Set up 10 Holding Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to establish 10 holding companies to manage 144 state
companies (BUMNs) as part of its BUMN reform program.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of forming the holding companies, there will be
some liquidations involved along with the establishment of new
companies," State Enterprises Minister Tanri Abeng said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of a total of 159 BUMNs currently in existence, 15 are now
excluded from the program. Those excluded include giant oil
company Pertamina and certain companies under the management of
technical departments.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said the 10 holding companies would cover various sectors
namely financial service, agro-industry and consumer products
(energy, tourism, telecommunications and mass media), strategic
industries (logistics, mining, construction, building materials)
and forestry (pulp and paper and wood products).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the holding companies is at the heart of
the second wave of BUMN reform.
</P>
<P>
The first wave focused on the restructuring, profit and
privatization of the state companies.
</P>
<P>
"The second wave of the BUMN reform aims to empower the basis
and structure of BUMNs through the formation of holding
companies," Tanri was quoted by national newspapers Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said his office is yet to decide on which state companies
will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
"It is still under review. There is a possibility that some
BUMNs will be consolidated," he said, citing an example of the
reduction in the number of plantation companies from 14 to four
companies or from 10 insurance companies to three.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, it is also possible that the government will
set up scores of new BUMNs. For instance, PT Aneka Tambang will
yield five new state companies," he said, referring to the
diversified mining company.
</P>
<P>
Review of the formation of the 10 holding companies is expected
to be completed in September. This will enable establishment of
the companies to commence by the end of the year, he added.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Latin American and European
Union countries committed themselves Tuesday to promoting the
integral and mutually beneficial liberalization of trade.

In their Rio de Janeiro declaration issued at the end of the
first Latin America-EU summit that was held Monday and Tuesday,

regional integration plays an important role in the promotion of
economic growth, in trade liberalization, and economic and social
development.

Stressing the relations between the two regions in the economic
field, the declaration says that trade liberalization will help

volatility in the financial sector.

to strengthen the multilateral trading system and the economic
relations between the two regions, as well as their commitment to

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Crude Oil Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 547,000 barrels of
crude oil in the first two months of this year, down 34,000
barrels from the same period of last year, according to the latest
Economic Indicators published by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The indicators also show that the output of natural gas was 274
 million cubic meters during the two-month period, a drop of 20
million cubic meters as compared with the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar produced 3.423 million barrels of crude oil, a
reduction of 239,500 barrels from 1997, while the output of
natural gas was 1.749 billion cubic meters, a drop of 35 million
cubic meters compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
To develop the crude oil and natural gas industry, Myanmar has
since late 1988 been absorbing foreign investments for undertaking
both offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration and production
projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, foreign investment in the oil and gas
sector from Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand
and the United States reached 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 46
projects. The total foreign investment stood at 7.1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the oil and gas fields being developed, Yadana in Myanmar's
gulf of Mottama and the Yetagun field off the Tanintharyi coast
are the two outstanding ones.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil to Build Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The "Southern Cross" gas pipeline
to connect Brazil with Argentina will be built in the second half
of this year, Ieda Correia Gomes, Vice President of Brazilian Pan
American Energy, said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the gas pipeline, with a joint investment of some
400 million dollars with the British Gas company, will have a
transportation capacity of 20 million cubic meters of natural gas
daily from Argentina, via Uruguay, to Porto Alegre, in southern
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This project, whose Uruguayan section will be built this year,
will be concluded in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Five million cubic meters of natural gas transported every day
will be supplied to Uruguay, while the Brazilian quota will vary
between 10 million and 15 million cubic meters a day, which will
be used for the generation of electricity in the Rio Grande do Sul
thermoelectric plants, according to Ieda Correia Gomes.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that Pan American also is part of a group formed
by eight producers and six distributors of natural gas, including
Shell, Mobil and Astra.
</P>
<P>
The group also is studying the construction of another gas
pipeline to transport Argentine natural gas to the southwest
region of Brazil, Ieda Correia Gomes said.

<HEADLINE> Del Piero to Stay at Juventus Soccer Club Till 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy star Alessandro Del Piero on
Tuesday extended his contract with Turin side Juventus soccer club
until 2004.
</P>
<P>
The five-year contract, agreed after months of hard bargaining,
is believed to make the 25-year-old the highest-paid player in the
world.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency ANSA, Del Piero would get nine
billion lire (5 million U.S. dollars) for next year, the last of
his current contract, rising to 10.5 billion lire (5.9 million U.S.
dollars) in 2004.
</P>
<P>
With marketing rights thrown in, the package outstrips
Christian Vieri's payload inked into his recent record-breaking 49
million U.S. dollars move from Lazio to Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Italy northwestern city of
Turin, Del Piero made light of the suggestion that he was the
world's wealthiest soccer star.
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things money can't give you... my aspiration
was to start winning again quickly with Juventus, not become the
richest player in the world."
</P>
<P>
Del Piero is still recovering from a November ligament
operation but said he hopes to be back in light training in July.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to observers and fans not to be too hard on him in
his initial outings next season, when he will still be feeling his
way back to match fitness.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero was widely expected to be one of the stars of last
year's World Cup in France but his performances disappointed,
after a great year with Juve that saw them take the Italian
championship but fail in the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
His serious knee injury came after a late-summer of polemics in
which he crossed swords with former Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who
suggested he and other Juve players may have used performance-
enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero is currently suing Zeman over the claims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Juventus's owner, Italian car-giant FIAT's Former
boss Gianni Agnelli came up with one of his customary dry remarks:
"They are all happy about the renewal of Del Piero's contract, but
I think he is the happiest."

<HEADLINE> Anelka: I Want Out of Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka has given the clearest indication
that he wants to leave the club.
</P>
<P>
And the Frenchman will go to Lazio if his preferred move to
Real Madrid falls through. Anelka's agents have been negotiating
with Real Madrid while the Gunners have been trying to tie up a
deal with Lazio, and Anelka has now publicly stated that he sees
his future away from Highbury.
</P>
<P>
He said: "My priority is to join Real Madrid but if that does
not work out why not Lazio? I prefer that than to return to
Arsenal."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I would have no problem going to Italy. I always
planned to play there one day."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, who have placed a 21 million pounds price tag on the
French star, have complained to FIFA that transfer rules have been
broken by the player's representatives holding talks with Real
without their permission but Anelka rejects the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"All the clubs do that. Arsenal did the same thing with me to
get me to leave Paris St Germain," Anelka told France's L'Equipe
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who is on holiday on the Riviera
after a knee operation, said: "Two weeks ago, I was sure Anelka
was going to stay but today I'm a little more pessimistic because
he is showing a real determination to leave us.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will be sorted out before the start of training on
July 13," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Medicare Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
announcing his Medicare reform program here Tuesday, proposed a
new universal prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
"This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford at a price
America can afford," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The new drug benefit, if approved by Congress, would be
available as an option for those 65 and older and for the disabled
beginning in 2002. It would cost the government 118 billion
dollars over 10 years, administration officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's universal drug benefit will cover half the cost of
drugs, up to 2000 dollars a year, for a monthly premium of 24
dollars. During the first six years of the program, which begins
in 2002, the coverage will rise to 5000 dollars a year and the
monthly premium to 44 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his Medicare rescue plan will be paid for with
794 dollars over the next 15 years, all of it coming from
expected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the drug proposal in only a small
part of its plan to modernize the 34-year-old Medicare program,
enacted to provide health insurance for the elderly. The program
currently covers 39 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Medicare reform program reflects a major change in
the elderly population in the United States which is not only
larger and growing but living longer and healthier than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, about 20 million people were covered by the
entitlement program. Today that number has nearly doubled and is
growing swiftly as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire. By
2011 it will more that double again with more than 77 million
people eligible for benefits. In 2048, 81 million people are
expected to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's announcement sets up what is expected to be a bitter
fight with Congress dominated by the Republican Party. Many
Republicans say that much money is not needed to save Medicare,
especially for new benefits, and the extra surplus funds should
instead be used for a deeper tax cut.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, both Republican, issued a joint statement Tuesday praising
Clinton's efforts to provide better drug coverage for retirees
but questioned the need to give government subsidies for the
Medicare beneficiaries.

<P>
The meeting, chaired by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anna,

United Nations, will take part in the coming meeting as the senior
representative of Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, a
spokesman for the Chinese Missions, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>

tackle crime that has flourished with the exit of Serbian police
and military forces and the return of more than 300,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees. Only a small U.N. contingent has arrived from
the international mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>

But a one more portfolio is added to the existing list: a
deputy special representative for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
known as UNMIK. "The deputy is to coordinate the four pillars of
the U.N. mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are vying for the post and some
U.N. officials prefer Martti Ahtisaari, who however does not
finish his term as president of Finland for another six
months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will carry out its mandate without undermining
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, as stipulated by the June 10 Security Council
resolution, the senior official added.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Fertilizer Producer in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced on Tuesday that it has signed an
agreement to loan 65 million U.S. dollars to Fertilizantes
Fosfatados S.A. (Fosfertil), the leading fertilizer producer in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Fosfertil is Brazil's biggest fertilizer producer with one
third of the domestic Nitrogen and Phosphate market. The Brazilian
fertilizer market has grown at an average rate of 10 percent since
1992, while domestic production has not kept pace.
</P>
<P>
The investment will help Fosfertil to retain its market and
continue to operate as the industry's lowest cost producer, the
IFC said.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing for the 214-million-dollar project consists of
a loan of 20 million dollars for its own account and a syndicated
loan of 45 million dollars for the account of participants.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be used to expand production of core
products, retrofit an ammonium nitrate plant, and upgrade and
expand port facilities to increase operational flexibility and
reduce freight costs.
</P>
<P>
The mission of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is to
promote private sector investment in developing countries, which
will reduce poverty and improve people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence to Ocalan Distances Turkey From Europe, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The death sentence handed to Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan by a Turkish court Wednesday risks
widening the divide between Europe and Turkey, Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency ANSA, D'Alema, speaking on the
sidelines of the European Union-Latin American summit in Rio de
Janeiro of Brazil, said that both the sentence itself and Turkey's
handling of the trial were "very grave."
</P>
<P>
He said that "all this risks distancing Turkey from Europe".
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Italian Lower House's foreign affairs committee
in an approved motion urged the government to undertake "forceful"
moves with Turkey to obtain the commutation of the death sentence
handed down against Ocalan
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian courts are still considering whether Ocalan
can be granted political asylum, on the basis of a suit filed by
his lawyers before he left Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy refused to hand Ocalan to Turkey when he arrived in Rome
on November 12 last year because its constitution forbids
extraditing suspects to countries where the death penalty is still
used.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan left Italy on January 16 for an unknown destination
after authorities persuaded him to leave voluntarily. He left
before his request for political asylum was answered by Italian
aUhorities.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party turned
up again in Kenya four months ago when he was seized by Turkish
special agents and taken to the high-security prison where his
trial concluded Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Italians More Afraid of Thieves Than Mafia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Italians are more afraid of common
thieves than they are of organized crime, according to a report by
the Italian Social Investment Studies Center (Censis) presented
Wednesday at the national conference on Security and Legality
which is held in Sicilian city of Catania.
</P>
<P>
Although they are less spectacular than mafia-style crime, the
report found, purse snatching and house break-ins have contributed
more to increasing insecurity among Italians who are more and more
asking for law enforcement and administrative officials to do
something to make their communities safer.
</P>
<P>
Crimes like car theft or break-ins, the study added, have a
more direct impact on citizens and aggravates unease even among
those who have not been victims of these crimes.
</P>
<P>
Looking at organized crime, the Censis report found that the
mafia had gone through a radical change and now preferred a more
low-key, although no less dangerous, presence.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the era of the flashy bombs and gangland
slayings has given way to the low profile and almost invisible
presence which creates the illusion that tensions have subsided
and normality returned.
