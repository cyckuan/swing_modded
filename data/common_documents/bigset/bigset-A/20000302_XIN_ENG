<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 170,000 children under
one year of age die every year because of the shortage of potable
water in Afghanistan, according to a press report reaching here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that only 23 percent of the Afghan people
benefit form clean water. Almost 50 percent of the diseases posing
a threat to children's lives are caused by the lack of clean water.
</P>
<P>
"But lack of clean water is not the only problem being faced by
the people of Afghanistan," said the report. "Another problem
which has hit the people is drought."

<HEADLINE> Bayi Rockets Enter Finals at Chinese Basketball League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, Zhejiang Province, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Without their
starting center Wang Zhizhi, the defending champion Bayi Rockets
still proved too strong for Shandong Flaming Bulls as their took a
one-side 134-98 victory in Wednesday's third game of the best of
five semifinals round of the Chinese Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
The Bayi Rockets won the best of five semifinals series 3-0 and
captured the first final spot in the 14-team Chinese first
division.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other game, Shanghai Dongfang held off a strong
rally by the host Guangdong Hongyuan and scored a clutching 111-
102 victory which gave them a 2-1 lead and bring the best of five
series back to home in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuidong put the defending champion on his shoulders as the
1.98-meter power forward started in the center and poured in 33
points. Paced by Liu Yudong, the Bayi Rockets jumped to a flying
start with a 9-2 run and led Shangdong 36-19 at the end of the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets built 74-42 soiled lead at the interval and
dominated the rest of the game to eliminated the struggling
Shandong Bulls.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets starting center Wang Zhizhi, who scored 31 points
and 12 rebounds in the first game, was seriously injured in the
ankle and rushed to hospital in the second game last Sunday. The
returning is a day-to-day case for Wang, who was selected by the
Dallas Mavericks in 1999 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
The 2,25-meter center Yao Ming again turned out as the hero for
Shanghai as the 19-year-old's dunk put Shanghai ahead at 104-100
with one minute to go. His sky blocks kept the Guangdong team
scoreless for three minutes in the end of the game.
</P>
<P>

who will host Guangdong in the fourth game of the best of five
series on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Nigeria-Commonwealth
Investment Conference ended in the capital Abuja on Wednesday with
a five-point suggestion for attracting foreign investment into the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the conference jointly
organized by the Nigerian government and the 54-member
commonwealth, Nigeria was urged to maintain political stability,
pursue macro-economic stability and assure investors safety of
their lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria should also make further efforts to burnish its
international image and implement "more speedily" the on-going
economic reforms as a way of promoting international investors'
confidence, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including investors, bankers and government
officials from the commonwealth, identified investment potentials
in the African country's key sectors of agriculture, oil and gas,
water, power, telecommunication and transport.
</P>
<P>
With the restoration of democracy after a long military rule
last May, Nigeria has been making painstaking efforts to attract
foreign investment in a bid to revitalize its ailing economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Completes 4-Year Military Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AQABA, JORDAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government completed
a four-year military aid program to Jordan with the last batch of
weapons under the program delivered to the kingdom on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a brief ceremony held at the southern harbor city of Aqaba,
25 armoured vehicles with anti-tank rocket launchers, 24 anti-
aircraft Hawk missiles, radar systems and ammunitions were provided
to the Jordanian military under the 1.5-million-U.S.-dollar
drawdown aid package.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the U.S. provided a variety of military
equipment and training to the kingdom starting from 1996, said
officials at the American embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Jordan's Chief of the General Staff
Mohammad Yussef al-Malkawi, U.S. Ambassador to Jordan William
Joseph Burns and visiting Deputy Commander in Chief of the U.S.
Central Command Michael Dodson.
</P>
<P>
Burns said at the ceremony that the program showed the
importance Washington attached to its ties with Amman and its
appreciation of the kingdom's contributions to peace, security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The drawdown program was also part of a U.S. Foreign Military
Financing package to the kingdom, which amounted to 275 million
dollars from the fiscal years of 1996 to 1999, according to a press
release from the American embassy.
</P>
<P>
Washington took Jordan as an ally in the Arab world and was
steadily increasing its aid to the kingdom, which has been a major
peace broker in the region after it signed a peace treaty with
Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the U.S. government offered a total of some 300 million
dollars in various military, economic, food and other aid packages
to the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Western Jets Bomb Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Western war planes bombed civilian
targets in northern Iraq on Thursday, the third of its kind this
week, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nine formations raided the service and civil installations in
the northern provinces of Duhok, Arbil and Nineveh, the official
Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying. No report about
casualties or damage is available so far.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the warplanes returned to Turkish air bases
after they were targeted by Iraqi anti-aircraft units.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the 16th such exchange this year, and western
jets unleashed air strikes in northern Iraq on Monday and Tuesday
this week.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain imposed two on-fly zones on Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War with a self-claimed aim of protecting Iraqi
minority groups from attacks by Iraqi forces. Iraq never recognizes
or accepts the so-called northern and southern no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrol the no-fly zones on an almost
daily basis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Indicators Rise 0.3 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of Leading
Economic Indicators rose 0.3 percent in January, the same pace as
in the prior two months, The Conference Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a
report that the leading index now stands at 106.4 percent (1996=
100) in January. The 0.3 percent rise matched the increases of the
previous two months.
</P>
<P>
"The strong performance during the last months suggests that,
despite the rapid rate growth in Gross Domestic Product in the
fourth quarter of 1999, the economy maintained significant
momentum in the first month of 2000," said Conference Board
economist Ken Goldstein. The biggest risk to the ongoing expansion
is the prospect of more interest rate hikes, as the Federal
Reserve Board tries to engineer moderation in this quite strong
growth pattern."
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board also said that the Coincident Index rose 0.
4 percent in January, after three months of solid gains. Strong
gains in nonagricultural employment, personal income, and
industrial production contributed to the January gain. The Lagging
Index fell 0.2 percent, the second decline in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
"The stock market declined in January and vendor performance
increased," Goldstein said. "Perhaps most importantly,
manufacturing orders for consumer goods, but not for capital
defense goods, declined in January."
</P>
<P>
"If there is one trouble spot in the economic landscape, it is
that orders fell in both September and October, then recovered in
November and December, but declined again in January," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said seven of the 10 indicators that make
up the leading index rose in January. The most significant
increases are building permits, consumer expectations and money
supply.
</P>
<P>
The index is a barometer of economic activity in the next three
to six months.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Face Sanctions On Supercharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- High street banks in Britain have
been threatened with tough sanctions unless they back down from
controversial plans to charge customers up to 2.5 pounds for using
rival cashpoint machines.
</P>
<P>
At Question Time in the Commons Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said there were "legitimate concerns" about the possibility
that customers using the machines operated by banks other than
their own could face a 2.20 pound charge for withdrawing small
sums.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact on pensioners, students, lower income
customers and people in rural areas had to be taken into account
by the banks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's spokesman said that Blair believed any
charges should be within the 15p to 30p range, if not below.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office began an offensive against the decision by
members of Link -- banks and building societies that form a
network of 27,000 cashpoints -- to charge non-customers for
withdrawing money.
</P>
<P>
The new charges will originally come into effect from January
2001. However, following the prime minister and consumer attack,
it appeared that the banks might relent.

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership Rises In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in Britain who
own their home has increased for the first time in a decade,
official statistics released Thursday show.
</P>
<P>
In four years, at least 726,000 more homes have become
privately owned, bringing the proportion of home owners to 69
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Office of National Statistics said, "Life in Britain has
never been more comfortable. The rise in home ownership is
accompanied by an increase in consumer durables owned by each
household."
</P>
<P>
The proportion of households with access to two or more cars
has trebled from 9 percent in 1972 to 28 percent in 1998.
Households with a home computer rose from 27 percent to 34 percent
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ONS says home life has improved beyond recognition in 30
years. In 1972, 37 percent of homes in Britain had central heating
and 42 percent had a telephone.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the figures had risen to 90 percent and 96 percent
respectively, the ONS adds.

<HEADLINE> IOL: Migrant Workers Surpass 120 Million Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of migrant workers
around the world has passed 120 million, according to a study
published here Thursday by the Geneva-based International Labour
Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
The ILO study, Workers Without Frontiers, attributed the
growing number of migrant workers to globalization. It said that
flows of goods and capital between rich and poor countries will
not be large enough to offset the needs for employment in poorer
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, the social disruption caused by economic
restructuring is likely to shake more people loose from their
communities and encourage them to look around for work," the ILO
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report found the attraction of employment and better wages
were the major factors behind emigration. It said government
regulations restricting migration have also fostered a booming
industry in the trafficking of clandestine workers.
</P>
<P>
"This illegal flow of workers has created a large market for
forged documents," said the ILO study, adding that Bangkok "has
developed into a major production center" for forged documents,
mainly Korean and Japanese passports.

<HEADLINE> New Audi A2 Makes Debut at Geneva Motor Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- New Audi A2, the first large-scale
production car in the world made of aluminium, has been on its
first public display at the 70th International Motor Show which
began here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Audi A2 will be introduced into the market as of mid-June,
according to Franz-Josef Paefgen, Chairman of the Board of
Management of Audi AG.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected substantial momentum from the new Audi
A2 and the allroad quattro, a car combining the comfort of a
saloon with outstanding offroad driving qualities, which will be
delivered in May.
</P>
<P>
Audi has made a successful start into the new year. "In the
first two months of this year we have been able to once again
increase our deliveries to customers," said Paefgen.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that deliveries of Audi cars to customers by the
end of February would presumably amount to more than 90,000 units
worldwide, about 11 percent more than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Audi operates worldwide in developing and manufacturing high-
quality, high-tech automobiles. The company produces in Germany,
Hungary, Brazil, China, and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Contradictory Over Farm Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Thursday
gave contradicting statements concerning the invasion of farms by
liberation war veterans and landless villagers in the country
since last week, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government, which had been conspicuously quiet on the issue
all along, reacted with President Robert Mugabe and his deputy
Joseph Msika supporting the invasions while Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa ordered the invaders out of the 30-odd white-owned
farms by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sources told the state news agency that the diplomats from the
west countries had informed Dabengwa that their governments were
on the verge of asking the international community to impose
sanctions on Zimbabwe if it did not act fast to remove the war
veterans from farms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Mugabe told the Zimbabwe Broadcasting
Corporation that the invasions showed the war veterans were
committed to the cause they fought for and that the government
would not stop them if they did it without breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
However, Dabengwa said he had briefed Mugabe before making his
public statement.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa instructed the war veterans that they had until Friday
to withdraw from the farms because some of them are breaching the
law.
</P>
<P>
He said it was now unnecessary for them to remain on the farms
since the government had given a notice to amend the constitution
to include a clause which would give it power to compulsorily
acquire land for resettlement without compensation.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Challenges Facing Chief U.N. Arms Inspector  (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Hans Blix, executive
chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq, took up his duties
Wednesday and the new arms regime began to operate.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC was created by U.N. Resolution 1284 adopted in
December 1999 to replace the United Nations Special Commission (
UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction and to complete the task of tracking down and
destroying Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear arsenals. U.N.
arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since the U.S-led
military strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (
IAEA), who led the organization from 1981 to 1997 said at a press
conference that he was optimistic about his future work. But it is
widely seen here that Blix is already having some challenges at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
Working out the structure for the UNMOVIC is the first
challenge for Blix. Under U.N. Resolution 1284, Blix will have 45
days to draw up a new organizational plan, and a list of
commissioners as advisers and staff of weapon inspectors for the
agency, subject to the approval of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Picking up the lists of commissioners and weapons experts may
not be so difficult for him. The challenge is that the candidates
for commissioners and experts must be accepted by all the members
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 15-member Security Council have warned that the new
arms inspection regime should be totally different from the now
defunct UNSCOM and would like virtually the entire staff to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
These members also insisted that the agency should be widely
represented and arms experts should be drawn from developed
countries as well as from the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
But others expressed the concern that staff from the UNSCOM are
experienced in arms inspection and replacing them would
significantly delay UNMOVIC future operations in the field. They
said most of the UNSCOM staff should be absorbed into the new arms
regime.
</P>
<P>
How to implement U.N. Resolution 1284 was the second challenge
facing the chief U.N. arms inspector. The resolution granted the
UNMOVIC immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to all
areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport as
well as to persons under the authority of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The intrusive working mechanism was the common practice of the
UNSCOM which very often prompted serious confrontations between
the U.N. arms inspectors and Iraq. Iraq said it violated its
sovereignty and threatened its national security. Iraq no doubt
will not accept it in the future.
</P>
<P>
The resolution expressed the intention to suspend and lift
sanctions against Iraq once It cooperates with the arms inspectors
and makes progress in answering and clarifying the remaining
questions in the files of biological and chemical weapons. But the
resolution did not clearly define what remaining questions Iraq
must answer and what is the criterion to judge whether Iraq
cooperates or not.
</P>
<P>
Blix is required by the Security Council to report in every
three months on his work in the field once he operates. The
ambiguity of the resolution has created difficulty for him to
draft the report.
</P>
<P>
To make Iraq to accept U.N. Resolution 1284 and cooperate with
the United Nations arms inspectors is the third challenge for Blix.
So far Iraq has rejected to accept the resolution and barred the
United Nations arms inspectors for returning. It has reiterated
that lifting the sanctions is the precondition for the arms
inspectors to return to resume their work.
</P>
<P>
Blix, who enjoyed good cooperation from Iraq when leading the
IAEA from 1981-1997, said he would get cooperation from Iraq. But
Iraq replied that it was not in the position to make odds with
Blix himself and the problem lies in Resolution 1284.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Drop in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new single-family
homes plunged by 4.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 882,000 units in January, the lowest level since March 1999, as
higher mortgage rates cut into demand, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was bigger than the 1.1 percent decline many analysts
were forecasting. In December, new-home sales rose 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upswing in mortgage rates took their toll on new-home sales
in January. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was
8.21 percent in January, compared with 7.91 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Midwest took the biggest plunge, falling 8.7
percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 137,000
units. In the West, sales fell by 7 percent to a rate of 238,000
units and in the South they were down by 2.8 percent to a rate of
415,000. But in the Northeast, sales rose 5.7 percent to a rate of
93,000.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home, meaning half sold for more and
half for less, fell to 154,400 U.S. dollars in January, down 5.9
percent from December's price.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said online
retail sales totaled 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth
quarter, accounting for only 0.6 percent of the 821.2 billion
dollars in total retail sales during that period.
</P>
<P>
In a bow to the growing importance of this segment of the
economy, the government on Thursday made its first formal stand-
alone estimate of quarterly sales of goods and services over the
Internet and other online systems. The government's monthly
reports on retail sales nationwide include online sales but they
aren't listed separately.
</P>
<P>
Like the monthly retail sales report, the online sales
statistic is based on a wide range of businesses selling
everything from clothing and books to cars and furniture. But the
statistic does not include sales from online travel services,
financial services and ticket sales for things like music concerts.
Neither does the monthly retail report include these services.
</P>
<P>
Private analysts say that online sales remain a small portion
of total retail sales. In 1998, online retail sales accounted for
0.5 percent of all sales and were projected to account for 1.2
percent for all of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Maskhadov Owes Explanation Before Entering Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov
must answer legitimate questions from federal prosecutors before
Russian officials negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
"Maskhadov likes talking on the telephone. We know that he has
repeatedly told a European leader that he is prepared to release
foreign hostages, two Polish women and a Frenchman," Putin told a
press conference in Zvyozdny outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"This implies that Mr. Maskhadov was in control of the hostages
taken for ransom" even before the start of the anti-terrorist
operation in the North Caucasus, the Interfax news agency quoted
Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin was referring to the federal military campaign launched
last September following two waves of armed Chechen incursions
into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings, also
blamed on Chechen militants, that left some 300 people dead in
Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"This makes one think that he either is in cahoots with or in
direct control of gangsters. I believe that the Prosecutor General
's Office has legitimate questions to ask him," the acting
president said.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, before any political talks start, the criminal
aspect of the situation must be tackled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin reiterated the federal government's readiness to "
cooperate and negotiate with whoever is interested in a political
settlement in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Federal forces have claimed control of 99 percent of Chechnya,
but there were still pockets of rebels scattered in the southern
mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 300 to 500 Chechen fighters tried to break through
a federal siege four kilometers from the village of Ulus-Kert,
Putin's aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
"Helicopters and artillery are pounding the rebels. There is no
close combat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are sustaining losses, Yastrzhembsky said without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
According to Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, about 1,500-3,000
rebels are left in Chechnya, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels groups are scattered and "almost disconnected," the
minister said, adding that rebel leaders, including Maskhadov, are
still in the Chechen mountains.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops discovered a large number of arms depots in the
town of Shatoi, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"They were preparing for a lengthy defense. Had our offensive
been from the north, as it was in the previous campaign, it would
have been a never-ending slaughter. We came from the south and
took them by surprise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergeyev warned that the rebels would try to "seize
something important" and that "the army must not relax."

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.N. Works Very Closely With S.African Countries to Fight Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday said that the world body is "working very, very
closely" with southern African countries to fight against floods
in the region, the worst in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who described the current flooding situation in
Mozambique as "very tragic," made the statement in response to
press questions upon his arrival at the U.N. Headquarters in New
York Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a very tragic situation, what's happening in
Mozambique, and the region," he said, adding that he has been on
the phone with leaders of Mozambique and other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We have mobilized the U.N. system and have also begun
seriously raising money," he said. "We have got some response but
the response would have been better."
</P>
<P>
There is going to be a meeting in Pretoria, South Africa,
Friday, which attracts representatives from Mozambique, South
Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, "in an attempt to take a regional
approach to the crisis," he said. "We are working very, very
closely with them."
</P>
<P>
"I hope once the needs are further clarified the international
community will respond and that those with the capacity to give
will give, and give generously," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is urgent need for helicopters and small boats to rescue
people hanging on treetops or rooftops in the flood-affected areas,
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said at a news conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 people have been rescued in recent days.
Hundreds of thousands are homeless but safe on remote patches of
high ground, and tens of thousands are seeking help in refugee
camps that aid agencies are throwing together near the flood zone.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers estimated 800,000 people or more are at risk from
possible outbreak of malaria or cholera. About 100 cases of
malaria and diarrhea are reported each days in the centers where
flood refugees stay, said a Mozambican Red Cross official in the
nation's capital of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The floods have devastated the most fertile and densely
populated regions of the country, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows to Keep Mir Space Station Afloat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin
said Thursday that Russia would take measures to preserve the Mir
space station.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons supporting the preservation of Mir are convincing,
and we will work to put them into action," Putin told a conference
on the country's space exploration in the Star City outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Space exploration is not simply a matter of prestige and a
show of the country's might. It is a fundamental area of economics
and science. It is the thing that makes Russia a great country,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
A lack of funding had once threatened the continuing operation
of the station, which has been in orbit for 14 years, but an
infusion of outside capital will reportedly keep the station up
for at least five more years.
</P>
<P>
Some accused the West of pressuring Moscow to ditch Mir and
concentrate its limited resources on the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Thursday that Russia would keep its commitments to
participation in the ISS, but Mir should also be preserved.
</P>
<P>
"The usefulness of the station is obvious. The only unknown
factor is the financing," he said. Russia is to supply about 30
percent of the ISS' component, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we are interested in the project and believe that
cooperation would benefit both the international community and the
Russian space program," he said. "We will stand by all existing
agreements."

Some schools are without roofs while others are being used as

<HEADLINE> SADC Defense Ministers Hold Meeting in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) defense ministers meeting opened in the
Zimbabwean capital Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting would provide a platform for an exchange of
ideas and map out strategies on the best way forward in the
region's search for permanent peace, stability and tranquility in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting also sought to update and brief all SADC defense
chiefs on the SADC allies' involvement in Operation Sovereign
Legitimacy in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi said that the 14-member SADC should gear itself to solve
crisis situation with a single mind and unity of purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Your gathering here is therefore a clear manifestation of the
region's firm conviction in taking care of its own problems," he
said. "Nothing less is expected of us as a region because the
destiny of the region lies in our hands."
</P>
<P>
The region needs to harness all available resources and diverse
 experiences to seek solutions to the common challenges, Mahachi
said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Joint
Military Commission coupled with the appointment of former
Botswanan President Ketumile Masire as mediator in the DRC
national dialog and the envisaged deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force in the DRC would improve prospects for peace in
this vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
The collective approach should serve as a trigger towards
greater regional defence and security integration, Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
The Harare defense meeting would examine the prospects,
feasibility and implications for more meaningful regional
cooperation and integration in this and future missions.

<HEADLINE> Farm Invasions Have Negative Impact on Zimbabwe's Economy: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some Zimbabwean economists Thursday
said the invasion of commercial farms by ex-combatants will have
a negative impact on the economy and investment inflows.
</P>
<P>
The economists said that investors need to be assured of
security to their properties but the ex-combatants have
demonstrated that there is no guarantee of the security in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Economist of University of Zimbabwe Moses Tekere said the
invasions of over 40 farms so far would add to the general decline
of the economy as the country needs to attract investment to boost
government efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Investors want to be assured that a country they target
respects the rule of law. As things are, we have lost credibility
and we will find it hard to convince investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tekere said Zimbabwe has a small economy which needs foreign
capital, inputs and investment.
</P>
<P>
Economist of Institute of Development Studies Louis Masuko said
it is difficult for the business community to recognize the farm
invasions as a move to correct historical imbalances.
</P>
<P>
"The move will have a dent on business confidence in the
country. Investors are already skeptical about the security and
the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lecturer of the Department of Economics of University of
Zimbabwe Medicine Masiiwa said the government should intervene to
stop the veterans if the international community is to gain
confidence in it.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Joseph Msika said his government is waiting for
reports from provincial heads before it takes action.
</P>
<P>
The government has been widely criticized for failing to send
in the police to control the war veterans in contrast with last
year when the police were sent out as villagers invaded farms
around their communities.
</P>
<P>
War Veterans Chairman Chenjerai Hunzvi said the ex-combatants
were invading the farms on behalf of the landless who were eager
to be resettled.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The first consignment of
1,000 tons of South African white maize has been imported into the
southern Mozambique areas damaged by flooding, a World Food
Program (WFP) spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
WFP spokesman Francis Mwanza said that over one million
Mozambican people are in dire need of food and the situation in
the southern African country is still in emergency.
</P>

The U.N. agency will continue to buy enough maize from Zimbabwe
and South Africa, the closest sources of maize, to aid the
northern and southern parts of Mozambique, South African Press
Association quoted Mwanza as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that WFP should not be the only
 organization which is handling relief in Mozambique and a number
of relief donors should also be involved.
</P>
<P>
Another 4,000 to 5,000 tons of white maize will be sent to
Mozambique over the next one and a half months, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 war-displaced Angolans
are currently suffering hunger in the diamond-abundant province of
Lunda-norte in northeast Angola, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Antonio Manengo, representative of the Ministry of
 Assistance and Social Integration in Lunda-norte, the
humanitarian situation in the province is deteriorating as the
only non-governmental organization (NGO) operating in the region
has been shut down due to the lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Manengo said that the German NGO, World Lutheran Federation,
had ceased its operations in the province after long-term work in
the inner province bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Lunda-norte is famous for its abundant reserve of precious
stones which have been used by the Angolan rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi as financial support for their war against the government
troops in the past 25 years.

In the town of Xa-Muteba, 500 kilometers east of the capital
Luanda, the situation is critical while 54,000 displaced people
are suffering from various diseases due to the lack of food and
medicines, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Most of the displaced population in Xa-Muteba reportedly came
from the war-ravaged north-central province of Malange. At this
moment, they are living either in tents or in the open air.

With the upcoming March rains in the following weeks, the
humanitarian situation may get even worse, Manengo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South African and Brazilian
foreign ministers have completed preparatory talks on trade
cooperation that could lead to a free trade arrangement between
the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) and South America's
common market MERCOSUR.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said in
Cape Town Thursday that he and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz
Felipe Lampreia exchanged views on a coordinated stand within the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Erwin said their talks were the initial step in the process of
expanding and diversifying trade links between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with detailed exploratory talks around how we could
deepen the economic cooperation between South Africa and southern
Africa on the one side and Brazil and MERCOSUR on the other side,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think both of us feel it is possible to see this move
towards a free trade agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said it is in the interests of both countries to
enhance trade links and together to extend the maximum influence
over the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our own interest to have very deep dialog and, as far
as possible, coordination between ourselves and the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia, who is in South Africa on a three-day visit, has met
with President Thabo Mbeki and Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between South Africa and Brazil currently
stands at about 2 billion rand (about 330 million U.S. dollars) a
year, compared to around 200 million rand (33 million dollars)
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The SACU includes South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia and
Botswana, while MERCOSUR is made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay,
and Paraguay.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi on Thursday assured the country's parliament, the Assembly
of the Republic, that the government wants emergency relief for
the victims of the current flooding "to be distributed in a
transparent way and as quickly as possible" .
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the end of a two-day debate on the floods,
during which opposition deputies had repeatedly demanded that an
ad-hoc parliamentary commission be set up to monitor the
distribution of aid.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi pointed out that any aid which the government receives
in the form of money is written into the state budget in a special
line of its own. The parliament had passed laws on the budget "and
deputies know how the budget is controlled ", he said.
</P>
<P>
A major guarantee of transparency was the fact that donors are
directly involved in rescue operations. "Our national and foreign
cooperation partners have seats on the Technical Emergency
Council", said Mocumbi. "All who give help to the rescue
operations are represented there".

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's total debt stock has
reached 31 billion U.S. dollars at the end of February this year,
according to a report by the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 20 billion U.S. dollars of the debt was being owed to the
Paris Club of creditors and 6.5 billion U.S. dollars of it to
multilateral institutions, while the balance was made up of
private debts, said Philip Asiodu, chief economic adviser to
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media earlier this week in the capital Abuja,
Asiodu said the Nigerian government had managed to pay about 1.5
billion U.S. dollars to foreign creditors last month, calling on
the United States and Britain to help offset the rest of the
debts.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had spent about 10 billion U.S. dollars on
peace-keeping efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Nigeria's looted funds stashed abroad by former
leaders, Asiodu said that only 110 million U.S. dollars had been
recovered while about 700 million U.S. dollars were frozen in
various foreign banks.

others injured Thursday in a serious traffic accident in Semnan
province, east of the Iranian capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The collision took place on the Damghan-Semnan road when a bus,
a private car and a Nissan pick-up truck hit each other, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts said that the collision was caused by the bus'

of the private car as well as a crew member and a passenger of the
bus were killed. The body of another victim has yet to be

and reports said that 9,745 people were killed in traffic accidents
during the first seven months of the current Iranian calendar year
to end on March 20.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince in Beirut to Show Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on
Thursday held talks here with visiting Saudi Crown Prince and First
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The talks dwelt on the latest developments of the Middle East
peace process and Arab solidarity in the face of Israeli threats
and aggressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made by the international community to move
forward the Middle East peace process which has virtually
deadlocked on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli air strikes against infrastructure targets in Lebanon in
early February have triggered harsh condemnations from Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel also threatened to launch further air raids in
retaliation for Hezbollah guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops in
its self-styled security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The mounting tensions in south Lebanon have fueled concerns over
the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks, which were suspended
indefinitely in January after two rounds in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has insisted on the
integration of talks with Israel on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
Abdullah, also commander of Saudi National Guards, briefed Lahoud
on the outcome of his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
in Cairo and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, accompanied by a high-level official delegation, is
due to wrap up his visit to Lebanon Friday morning, which is the
last stop of his three-leg Arab tour.

<HEADLINE> Barak Denies Direct Phone Link With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
on Thursday denied media reports that he had direct telephone
conversations with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The denial was made in a statement issued by Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
The Yediot Aharonot daily said in a front-page story Thursday
that Barak was trying to break the deadlock in the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks by calling Assad directly and by conveying proposals
indirectly through U.S. channel.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's office said the report was "totally incorrect
and groundless."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk
said Thursday that in his opinion, Assad is determined to achieve
peace in the region as well as Barak.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Israeli-American Chamber of Commerce in Tel Aviv,
Indyk said that despite the current difficulties in the Middle East
peace process, there are great opportunities to reach peace
agreements in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who recently returned to Israel to serve his
second term, also pledged that U.S. is aiming at not only bringing
Israel and Syria back to the negotiating table, but also creating
confidence between them for the talks to succeed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again earlier this year only after two
rounds of talks due to differences over Israeli troops withdrawal
form the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Barak raised hopes for reviving the peace talks as
he hinted at a cabinet session that his four predecessors all had
made promise to withdraw fully from the Golan to the June 4, 1967,
lines under some conditions.
</P>
<P>
It was then widely rumored that talks between the two sides are
soon to be renewed and that secret high-level contacts have been
going on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
According to those reports, a breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian
peace track, with the help of U.S. mediation, would be made within
two weeks, or in April.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's office and U.S. officials adopted a policy to
deny all the reports. U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
on Tuesday dismissed as untrue these rumors, reports and
suggestions.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Couple Donate 12 Million Canadian Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian couple last week offered
shares worth 12 million Canadian dollars (about 8.3 million U.S.
dollars) in donation to a small charity in Ontario, said Canadian
newspaper reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The donation, one of the largest offered in the country, is a
gift that effectively doubles the size of the Kitchener and
Waterloo Community Foundation, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The couple, Michael Barnstijin, 41, and Louise MacCallum, 39,
retired two years ago as millionaires. They wanted to give
something back to the community both had lived in for most of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have an amount in mind... we just wanted to help,"
Mr. Barnstijn told his interviewers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They used to work in the high-technology firm Research in
Montion. The shares were acquired during Mr. Barnstijn's years as
a vice-president of the firm and Ms. MacCallum worked there as a
programmer.
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest donation previous to this was for 1 million
Canadian dollars (about 690,400 U.S. dollars)," said Mr. Barnstijn.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows Tougher Reprisals After Quitting Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will intensify its
reprisals against Lebanese targets if Hezbollah attacks Israeli
civilians once Israel pulls out its troops from south Lebanon, said
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh in Tel Aviv Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Along the new-old line we will have to retaliate more harshly
if our civilian population is attacked," Sneh told members of the
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The new-old border line will be the international border between
Israel and Lebanon along which Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
pledged to redeploy the Israeli troops after withdrawing from the
security zone in south Lebanon by July this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up this security zone in 1985 with a self-proclaimed
purpose of protecting its northern security. Hezbollah, or the
Party of God, has been fighting against the Israeli occupation
since then.
</P>
<P>
In the Past, Israel often poured out vengeful air strikes
against Hezbollah targets, sometimes Lebanese civilian targets, in
retaliation for Hezbollah attacks on Israeli troops inside the
security or on its northern towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, seven Israeli soldiers have
been killed in the security zone as Hezbollah stepped up its
military operation following a breakdown of Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We assume that Hezbollah would like to continue the fighting,
and in this case, we have to make it clear that since we have no
territorial margin of safety, we will have to act in different
ways, harsher than before," Sneh pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to bring the Israeli boys home within a year
during his election campaign last May, preferably under a peace
treaty with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled since January
after two rounds, due to Barak's refusal to write down a commitment
to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights which Israel captured
during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Sneh also urged Syria to resume the peace talks and do something
to rein in Hezbollah to pave the way for Israel's pullout from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If the Syrians were sincere about peace with us, they would not
allow Hezbollah to act the way they act, and the fact they give
license to Hezbollah casts a shadow of doubt on their sincerity in
the negotiations," Sneh said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges International Cooperation in Combatting Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on
Wednesday stressed the need to boost international cooperation in
fighting against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A security belt should be established around Afghanistan, the
world's largest opium producer, Brigadier General Mohsen Ansari,
deputy commander of the Security Forces, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is ready to cooperate with Europe and the
United Nations in that connection.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of its general policy and ideological and national
principles, the Islamic Republic of Iran will not allow the use of
its territory as a means for destroying a generation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the confiscation of 3,100 kilograms of morphine in
Iran's central Yazd province on Tuesday, Ansari said that more than
24 tons of morphine have been seized across the country since the
start of the current Iranian calendar year on March 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that morphine has no market in Iran but is smuggled out
to European countries via the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
He added that forces under his command have seized 240 tons of
various drugs in the current Iranian calender year.
</P>
<P>
Five Iranians and a Turkish man were arrested in connection with
the seizure of the morphine in Yazd Province. The morphine was
valued at nearly 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from Afghanistan
and neighboring Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the
Iranian Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.

ALGIERS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika has fired the governor of the capital Algiers in an
apparent move to tighten his rein in the country, the official APS
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision to dismiss Cherif Rahmani, the only governor who
also served as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, was taken
at a cabinet meeting chaired by Bouteflika on Wednesday night, said
APS.
</P>
<P>
It was still unknown who would replace Rahmani, but officials
said Bouteflika would pick up the new governor in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
"The move reflects my strong will to end all bodies which do not
comply with the constitution, restore the state's authority...and
cure the deterioration affecting its unity," said the president
while illustrating his decision.
</P>
<P>
APS quoted Bouteflika as saying that he has stripped Algiers of
the special status of being attached to the presidency and
therefore the capital would report to the interior ministry like
other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika said he would not tolerate "dangerous" situations "
that would allow any authority to escape central control."
</P>
<P>
In August, Bouteflika fired nearly half of the North African
country's provincial governors and promised on many occasions more
efforts to curb corruption.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Denies Envoy's Meeting with Israeli Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Tehran on Thursday denied a recent
report by an Israeli daily that Iranian ambassador to Finland had
met his Israeli counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was the Israeli
policy to resort to any possible means to forge close relations and
contact with Iranian officials to gain legitimacy, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's policy towards Israel has not changed and Iranian
officials refuse meeting and talking with Israeli officials at any
rank, it added.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed ties with Israel and refused to recognize the
Jewish entity after the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the former
shah's regime that had close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Terming Israel as a "usurper" of Islamic and Arab lands, Iran
has called for military struggle to "liberalize" the occupied
lands, particularly Jerusalem, the holy city for Muslims, Jews and
Christians.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Said Behind Shootout in Israeli Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official said
Thursday that the Palestinian militant group Hamas was behind the
shootout in a northern Arab Israeli town early on the day, during
which two Palestinian guerrillas were killed by Israeli security
forces.
</P>
<P>
"What happened this morning is that a group from Hamas captured
a building in Taibe, they were equipped with demolition charges and
explosives," Deputy Defence Minister Ephraim Sneh told foreign
reporters in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that two Palestinians were killed in an
exchange of gun-fire and an explosion after Israeli security forces
besieged the apartment they rented late Wednesday night and ordered
them to come out.
</P>
<P>
The two Palestinians shot at the security forces while they left
the building, one with a handgun and the other with a suitcase of
explosives, the radio said. The suitcase blew up in the gunfight
and killed the two, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the shootout, Israeli security forces still
surrounded the apartment, believing two others remained inside, the
radio said. The fifth was arrested after he left the building.
</P>
<P>
Sneh said the five Palestinians had been preparing a major bomb
attack in an Israeli city. "They intended to lay explosives in the
center of one of the Israeli towns and to inflict very heavy
casualties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the planned
attack had "catastrophic potential."
</P>
<P>
The largest Palestinian militant group opposed to the Israeli-
Palestinian peacemaking, Hamas has carried out a series of bombing
attacks in Israel in the last several years, killing scores of
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
This shootout took place one week after Israel's General
Security Service announced that it had disclosed a Hamas cell while
it was planning to stage major attacks in Israeli cities. The cell
was also said to be responsible for several bombing attacks in
northern Israeli towns of Netanya and Haidera in the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami has warned recently that there had been a resurgence of
Palestinian terrorist activities as a result of the impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. He called on the two sides to move
forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over a permanent peace
ground to a halt early February over the dispute on an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross failed to narrow the gaps in his latest shuttle
diplomacy in the region last week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 3 Tons of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,100 kilograms of morphine
have
been seized on the road connecting Iran's central Yazd and Kerman
provinces, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The morphine, hidden inside a trailer, was seized on Tuesday
along with three drug traffickers, said Brigadier Mohammad Ta'efi,
commander of the security forces of Yazd Province.
</P>
<P>
Ta'efi told IRNA that nearly 15,000 kilograms of various kinds
of drugs have been confiscated and 80 drug distribution gangs
arrested by the provincial security personnel since the start of
the current Iranian calendar year on March 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the
Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 253 tons of various drugs have been seized
across the country in the first 11 months of the current Iranian
calendar year to end on March 20.

<HEADLINE> 10 Filipino Soldiers Killed in Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ten Philippine Army troopers,
including a lieutenant, were killed Thursday while three others
wounded in an ambush by New People's Army (NPA) rebels in Bohol
province in the central Philippines, a military report said.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes said in the report
that the soldiers were on board a truck on their way to reinforce
a detachment when they were waylaid by about 40 guerrillas in a
village.
</P>
<P>
The ambush area is a winding road located deep in the forest,
according to one of the three soldiers who survived the ambush.
</P>
<P>
One of those killed was Lt. Socrates Que, who was leading
reinforcement troops.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he has ordered Maj. Gen. Santo Gabison, commander of
the Visayas Command, to conduct a hot pursuit operation on the
fleeing rebels until they are caught.
</P>
<P>
He said the NPA guerrillas launched the ambush in retaliation
for their heavy combat losses in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The only significant NPA attack was in last summer when they
raided a police headquarters in Batuan province, carting away more
than 50 high-powered firearms.
</P>
<P>
But since then, the rebels had sustained heavy losses as a
result of a stepped-up government army offensive in Bohol, Reyes
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 2 (Xinhua) - Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation

Business Forum will be an excellent opportunity for SME
entrepreneurs from throughout APEC to exchange ideas and progress
further the recommendations made in the past Joint SME Ministerial-

meeting," he said, adding that the forum will focus on
strengthening markets for entrepreneurs.

Serbini noted that four areas will be emphasized at the forum --
human resources development, information and communication
technology, financing SMEs and the strategic alliance between SMEs
and large firms.
</P>
<P>
Serbini said the new millennium will see a century of growing
importance for knowledge-based economies to explore potentials for
business in the area of information and technology.

<P>
"So Brunei is keen to promote and explore this into future APEC
activities, thus creating new opportunities for its members," he
said.
</P>
<P>
APEC's jobs will include advancing the work in the area of
economic and technical cooperation, especially in building the
foundation of a new economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Capacity building would play a central role in developing
economies so that they are better able to reap the potential
benefits of the vast opportunities far ahead, " he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Files Corruption References against  Ex-Premiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) of Pakistan has filed corruption references against
former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto in the
accountability court, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has filed a reference of three billion rupees (56.6
million U.S. dollars) default against Sharif, who is now in jail
on charges of the plane hijacking conspiracy, according to the
News Network International (NNI).
</P>
<P>
Against Benazir Bhutto, who is on exile, the NAB has filed a
reference for building a polo ground in the Prime Minister's House,
setting up a stable there and damaging the environment.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif's father Mian Sharif, brother Shahbaz Sharif, who
was chief minister of Punjab province, and others have also been
named in the default reference.
</P>
<P>
This is the second NAB reference against the deposed prime
minister. The NAB earlier filed a reference against him for
fraudulently purchasing a helicopter worth 2.05 million U.S.
dollars, which Sharif has denied.
</P>
<P>
In another reference, Benazir's husband Asif Ali Zardari,
currently in jail, was also named.
</P>
<P>
Benazir and Sharif ruled Pakistan for the past decade. Benazir
moved to England after her fiasco in the 1997 general elections.
Sharif, however, was deposed in October last year in a bloodless
coup.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Workers to Get 10 Pct Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential Palace
reassured government workers Thursday that they will soon receive
the 10 percent across-the-board salary increase President Joseph
Estrada promised to grant them starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the Presidential Palace
is now coordinating with the Department of Budget and Management
to ensure the effectivity of the salary hike as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"That is our plan. Before March ends, we will start giving them
the payment due to them," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 national budget, which was signed by Estrada on
February 16, provides funds for the salary increase of state
workers at the national government level. The pay hike is
retroactive to January 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zamora reminded local government units (LGUs) to give the same
benefit to government personnel at their level, especially now
that they would get their internal revenue allotment (IRA) shares
in full.
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting with members of the Union of Local
Authorities in the Philippines, Estrada promised LGUs that their
IRA shares will be computed based on the full amount of 121
billion pesos (3 billion U.S. dollars) starting April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zamora reminded LGUs of their promise to the
national government that they would help out in tax collection
duties.
</P>
<P>
He said this is crucial in generating the revenues needed to
cover the full amount of the IRA and other items marked as
unprogrammed in the 2000 national budget.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Djibouti Peace Plan for Somalia: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy supports the peace process
 initiated by Djibouti in Somalia, Italian Ambassador to Somalia,
Francesco Sciortino, said in Mogadishu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our interest to see how well things are moving ahead,"
said Sciortino who had visited Mogadishu with European Union (EU)
Commissioner for Somalia, Duarte de Carvalho in the past three
days.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by Djiboutian President Ismail Omar
Ghelleh, a reconciliation conference is scheduled to be held in
Djibouti on April 20 this year in a bid to establish a national
government for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The international community can give suggestions to "help the
Somalis to understand, to move properly and possible to arrive at
a solution," said Sciortino.
</P>
<P>
"We think that this is the process that has to lead to the
solution of the Somali problem, because we don't see other ways,"
the Italian envoy said. "We are taking part, we are supporting, we
are working for it."
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no central government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Many Somalis are never optimistic about the position of Italy,
once a suzerain of Somalia, in any political process especially
since the U.S.-led multi-national forces have arrived in the
country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, Sciortino has declared his government's position and
willingness to see Somalia back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
Sciortino said they are following the developments in Somalia
where a prospect for a solution to the extremely long crises of
Somalia seems to be underway.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the contradictions from the various Somali
politicians, he said things could not be decided from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis have been reacting differently, some opposing to
the Djibouti peace plan while others are supportive by even
contributing funds.
</P>
<P>
Though Djibouti did not ask for funds for the conference, the
international community will be supporting its outcome and the
reconstruction of Somalia as a government, EU Commissioner de
Carvalho said.

WARSAW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from five Central
and Eastern European countries have reiterated that 9 billion DM (
4.5 billion U.S. dollars) out of the 10-billion DM German
compensation fund should be paid directly to those exploited by
the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the Czech Republic, Belarus, Russia,
Ukraine and Poland held a meeting Wednesday in Warsaw to work out
a joint stand on the next round of negotiations in Washington on
March 7, which is said to be a "final negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Jerzy Widzyk, head of the Polish representatives, said at a

billion DM should be given to the living victims while the
remaining 1 billion DM could be used in other ways.

<P>
As to the future fund, Widzyk said that it should be between
100 million DM to 1 billion DM.
</P>
<P>
The 10-billion DM German compensation fund for the slave
laborers was set up after negotiations between the U.S. and
Germany on December 17, 1999. Since then, negotiations continued
in Washington, Berlin and Warsaw, but all the related countries
have not reached a consensus on the distribution of the fund.

<HEADLINE> EU Imports From Turkey Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) imports from
Turkey has increased more than one-sixth though exports to this
country decreased by 1 percent, Eurostat reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report was released one day after EU Economy Commissioner
Pedro Solbes Mira met Turkish Economy Minister Recep Onal to
review the tune-up of Turkey's preparation to join the 15-nation
western bloc.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European community,
said that Turkey exported in 1998 13.6 billion euro (13.1 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of goods to the European Union, representing
an increase of 15 percent while it imported 22.1 billion euro (21.
4 billion dollars) worth of goods from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has become the EU's eighth largest trading partner and
accounted for about 2.5 percent of total EU trade volume. Germany
is the largest trading partner of Turkey, followed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been trying for three decades to join the European
Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in
December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the European Union decided
last December in Helsinki to include Turkey in its list of
accession that already includes Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Bulgaria and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The EU has started official accession negotiations with the 12
countries but did not do the same with Turkey. Some EU member
states have been criticizing the human rights record of the
country that strides two continents.  Turkey is a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday regretted the
decision by the British government to free former Chilean
President Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"The (French) government regrets the decision of the British
home secretary to allow General Pinochet to return to Chile," said
the French government in a communique issued at noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French government shares the disappointment of the families

<P>
Pinochet left London Thursday afternoon for home on a chartered
Boeing, after spending 15 months under house arrest in London.
</P>
<P>
He was detained in October 1998 by Britain at the request of
Spain, which accused him of assassinating Spanish citizens.
</P>
<P>
France is one the countries which have asked for the
extradition of Pinochet for his alleged role in the murder of four

<HEADLINE> Russian Speaker Laments Western Silence Over Death of Tass Reporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of Russia's upper house
of parliament on Thursday lamented what he described as the
deliberate silence in Western media on the killing of a Tass
reporter by Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
"This silence shows that there are double standards in the
assessment of facts," Federation Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev
said, referring to the murder of Tass photographer Vladimir
Yatsina.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev made the remarks in the Hague, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yatsina, who was abducted by Chechen gunmen last July, was
killed by the militants recently when he was being moved from the
Chechen town of Shatoi to a gorge nearby. His body has not been
found yet.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Stroyev said, the Western media gave a wide
coverage to video footage shown last week on a German TV station
that alleged atrocities committed by Russian troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The footage was proved to be doctored and the German reporter,
Hans Hoefling, was fired Tuesday by Munich TV station N24 after
admitting that he was not present when the video was filmed but
had obtained the footage from a Russian journalist.
</P>
<P>
The Western media's approach of double standards "is
unacceptable for a normal democratic society and normal relations
with those countries," Stroyev said.

MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Russian peacekeeper died Thursday
in Kosovo of a gunshot wound to the chest, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Private Igor Korkhunov was shot by unidentified attackers
Tuesday in the town of Srbica, 34 kilometers to the northwest of
Pristina, Interfax said, quoting General Nikolai Staskov, deputy
commander of the Russian Airborne Forces.
</P>
<P>
The paratrooper was guarding a vehicle of the Russian
peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,600 Russian troops stationed in the Yugoslav
province as part of a 40,000 multinational peacekeeping force, or
KFOR.
</P>
<P>
No additional security measures for the Russian contingent are
planned in the wake of the Tuesday attack, but an investigation
has been launched into the assault, Staskov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The six-year-old boy who shot and killed a first-grade
classmate in an elementary school here on Tuesday was living in a
rundown crack house just blocks from the school -- without even a
bed to sleep on -- and leading a "life in chaos", authorities said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration's refusal to accept a German
deputy finance minister as the next head of the International
Monetary Fund has bruised relations with one of Washington's
closest allies and raised fresh charges in Europe of American
arrogance in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House voted 422 to 0 Wednesday to allow most Social
Security recipients for the first time to earn as much money as
they want without sacrificing any of their retirement benefits,
repealing a Depression-era policy intended to discourage older
people from holding jobs so younger workers would have a chance.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suffered a political blow
on Wednesday as three of the six parties in the Israeli government
joined the opposition to approve a bill to require a majority of
eligible voters -- not just those who go to the polls -- to
approve a referendum on peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The oil ministers of Mexico and Norway said they were
prepared to act independently of OPEC, if necessary, to help
relieve the global oil shortage.
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq soared 87.39 points to 4784.08 on record volume
of 2.2 billion shares, spurring talk that the index soon could
reach the 5000 level.

<HEADLINE> Over One Million Heads of Livestock Lost in Snows in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Up to March 1, about a million
heads of livestock were lost in heavy snows in 144 counties
throughout of the country, the Mongolian Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock Breeding and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
From last winter to this spring, heavy snows and freezing
weather in most parts of Mongolia have killed almost all the
cattle in some counties. Many pregnant animals had miscarriages
due to coldness and hunger, thus causing mass reduction of young
stock.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian leaders have called for nation-wide contribution
to help the disaster-hit areas and instructed relevant departments
to dispatch forage grass to alleviate the impact of the disaster.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and Russia met
Thursday in a foreign ministerial meeting to discuss the situation
in Chechnya as well as in Kosovo and the Middle East, according to
reports reaching here from Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
The EU side, represented by Portuguese and French foreign
ministers Jaime Gama and Hubert Vedrine, EU External Relations
Commissioner Christopher Patten and Common EU Foreign Policy High
Representative Javier Solana, tried to secure a firmer commitment
by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to allow international
monitors access to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers focused on human rights issues in the meeting
which will be followed by a trilateral meeting with the
participation of United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday also in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first three-way meeting of foreign ministers
from the European Union, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been accusing Russia of inappropriate
use of force in Chechnya and pressing for the presence of
international monitors in the region.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Gil-Robles, human rights commissioner of the Council of
Europe, went to Russia last week and the Spanish diplomat said
that Russian Acting President Vladimir Putin was ready to allow
some foreign monitors in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> French TV Shows Document on McCain in Captivity in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- French television channel France 2
showed on Thursday a document on U.S. Senator and Republican
presidential candidate John McCain during his captivity in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white document was shot in a hospital in Hanoi by
the late French journalist Francois Chalais several months after
McCain's bomber was shot down by a missile above a lake in Hanoi
on October 26,1967, during a bombing mission in northern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The picture, shown by France 2 in its mid-day news program,
showed the pilot lying in his hospital bed and presenting himself
as "Lieutenant Commander John Sydney McCain."
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the document, which lasted less than one minute,
McCain's words were not audible in English and were translated
into French: "I was hit by an anti-air firing. I tried to make
functioning the ejector seat. That injured my two arms and my leg.
"
</P>
<P>
"I would like only to say to my wife that I am all right and I
love her and want to see her soon," McCain said in the document.
</P>
<P>
McCain was captured after jumping with a parachute from his
plane before it crashed near the electricity center of Yen Phu.
</P>
<P>
He was freed in March 1973, two years before the Vietnam War
ended.

LONDON -- Former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet will not be
extradited on torture charges and is free to leave Britain,
British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of
Senator Pinochet to Spain. I have also decided not to issue
authorities to proceed in respect of the extradition requests from
Switzerland, Belgium and France," Straw said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he believes the general is medically unfit to stand
any trial.
</P>
<P>
That decision cleared the way for Pinochet to return home
immediately. Without any last-minute legal challenges, the retired
general could be on a plane home within hours. (UK-Pinochet)

LONDON -- A Boeing jet plane, with former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet on board, took off Thursday from a British
airbase in eastern England after the British government ruled that
he should not be extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture
charges.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean plane, which had been on standby at another air
base for several weeks to take Pinochet home, left Waddington
airbase at 1315 GMT, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The plane flew to Waddington airbase just hours ago and took
off in torrential rain minutes after Pinochet's motorcade arrived
at the airbase. (Britain-Pinochet)

JERUSALEM -- Israel will not accept any precondition for
resuming peace talks with Syria, Foreign Minister David Levy said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Syria's demand for written commitment to
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borderlines as a precondition and
Israel will not accept that, Levy told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to withdraw to borderlines on the eve of the Arab-
Israeli war in 1967 is a difficult issue and even several cabinet
ministers of the Israeli government oppose the idea, levy added.

According to him, Tang met with Russian Acting President and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and held talks with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Putin, Tang presented a letter to the
acting president from President Jiang Zemin, in which Jiang gave
high evaluation on the sound development of the strategic
partnership of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed that Russia would strictly adhere to the
principles set forth in all the joint documents issued by both
countries, and pointed out that regular meetings between leaders
of both countries are critical to the further development and
deepening of such a strategic partnership of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed that a summit meeting will be held this
year, and preparations for the regular meeting between the two
prime ministers would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Ivanov exchanged views on bilateral relations and
important international issues during their talks, and reached
broad consensus, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
They both expressed satisfaction about the fact that China-
Russia relations do not target at a third country, and have
gradually become an important factor in promoting the world's
multi-polarization and the establishment of a just and rational
international order.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that any actions aimed at destroying the
territorial integrity of a country cannot be accepted. Russia
reiterated its "One China" stance, and China reaffirmed its
support to the Russian government's fighting against terrorism in
Chechnya.

-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told former U.S. President
George Bush here today that the key to the steady development of
Sino-U.S. relations in the 21st century is to proceed from a
strategic perspective which involves acting in the best interests
of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in his meeting with Bush, who is here to
attend The Smile Train, a charity program sponsored by U.S.
software corporation Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to step up interaction with leaders from both
Republican and Democratic parties and people from all walks of
life in the U.S. and work together with them to further develop
Sino-U.S. ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
After briefing Jiang on the U.S. presidential campaign, Bush
told Jiang he firmly supported China's entry into the WTO and
advocated that China be granted permanent normal trade relations
status, adding that such moves were in the interests of both sides.
He said that he will personally work to push forward U.S.-China
relations.

 Dialogue Better than Confrontation in Human Rights: Vice-Premier
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said today in a meeting
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson that confrontation is not the proper way of solving
differences on human rights, and dialogue is better than
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Robinson is in Beijing for the Eighth Workshop on Regional
Cooperation for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in
the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Robinson spoke of the progress China has made in promoting and
protecting human rights in recent years, and welcomed China's
signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights in 1997, and the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that her office would like to cooperate with the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that in promoting and protecting human rights, action
is more important than talk.
</P>
<P>
China's human rights conditions are at their best in history, a
fact that the entire Chinese people have been satisfied with and
the international community has recognized, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government takes a positive attitude toward
cooperation with Robinson's office, Qian said. He expressed the
hope that cooperation between the two sides based on equality and
mutual respect will continue to grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will launch publicity
activities in north China's port city of Tianjin this month to
highlight HK's development after its return to China, according to
an official of HK Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"Tianjin-Hong Kong Week" will be the first such activity ever
held in the interior area, said Bowen Leung, head of the SAR
Government's Beijing Office.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda for the event, scheduled for March 18-26, is an
exhibition featuring post-return Hong Kong's cuisine and fashion,
business talks, and galas attended by HK celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Leung stressed that it was the duty of his office to expand
ties between the SAR and interior regions, and demonstrate how the
"one country, two systems" policy is being implemented  through
such events. The same activities will also be held in cities in
the west.
</P>
<P>
One of China's four municipalities under direct administration
of the central government, Tianjin has established a close tie
with Hong Kong. HK investment ranked first among overseas-funded
businesses in Tianjin last year, and the two cities are partners
in the field of foreign trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's banks will offer more
financial support to the development of Zhongguancun Science and
Technology Park in Beijing, known as China's Silicon Valley, said
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting attended by scientists, bankers and
entrepreneurs, the governor of China's central bank said China's
banks will work to help Zhongguancun become one of the most
advanced science parks in the world by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that China's banks had offered a total of 75.8 billion
yuan (about 9 billion US dollars) in loans to 53 science parks in
China by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The range of loans will be enlarged in the future to support
technological upgrading and the development of non-governmental
high-tech enterprises, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Long-term loans will be provided to the science parks to
encourage technological innovation. Foreign companies are welcomed
to develop high technology in the science parks, and overseas
financial institutions will be introduced to the parks in a
planned way, according to the governor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a coordinating group in charge of financial
services for China's high-tech development zones will be set up,
Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai, Beijing Take Lead in Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin
cities and Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces were at the top of the
list for the comprehensive capacity of sustainable development
among 31 provinces, cities and autonomous regions in China,
according to a just-issued report.
</P>
<P>
"The Report on China's Strategy for Sustainable Development"
for the year 2000 which was compiled recently by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) shows that Gansu Province, Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, Qinghai and Guizhou provinces and the Tibet
Autonomous Region were at the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive capacity for sustainable development in
different areas was estimated on the basis of the living
conditions, economic and social development, environmental
protection, social welfare system, intellectual resources and
other factors in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The CAS issued the first annual report in 1999. Compared with
the results of the same estimation last year, the average capacity
of sustainable development for the first five cities has not
changed much, while the gap between those cities has been narrowed
down. The capacity of sustainable development of Guangdong
Province is on a steady rise.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that most of the areas with bigger capacity of
sustainable development are in eastern China while most of areas
at bottom of the list are in the western art of the country. This
indicates that there is still a large gap between the sustainable
development capacity of the east and the west, but the margin is
narrowing.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Soldier Visits Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese soldier Azuma
Shiro today visited northeast China's Shenyang city, the third leg
in his China tour to seek support for his fight against forces
denying Japanese war crimes in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, 88, was a soldier in the Japanese brigade that
occupied Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In
the following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians and he recorded the atrocities in a secret
diary.
</P>
<P>
He published his diary in April, 1996, and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made public or any action taken
against him.
</P>
<P>
Shiro took his case to a higher court but his appeal was denied
in December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang is the birthplace of the September 18th Incident, when
the city was occupied in 1931 by Japanese invaders as they moved
to occupy the entire northeast. Their occupation lasted until
China won the war against Japanese invasion in 1945.
</P>
<P>
In front of the Shenyang September 18th Museum, Shiro was met
by hundreds of local residents who braved the morning cold to see
him.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the museum, Shiro said he was sorry for the
horrific acts committed by Japanese troops in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Shenyang residents have signed their names on
a white cotton sheet as a way to express their support.
</P>
<P>
Shiro has visited Nanjing and Beijing, and will go to Shanghai,
all the major cities of the wartime period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stock Market Bullish this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's two stock markets have
been bullish over the past two months, with their combined
turnover nearing 1,110 billion yuan ( about 134 billion U.S.
dollars) or one third of last year's total figure.
</P>
<P>
In the 31 trading days of the first two months, the A-share
transactions at the Shanghai Stock Exchange amounted to 587.5
billion yuan, while the transactions at the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange skyrocketed to 518.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The average per trading day transaction volume at the two stock
exchanges stood at 35.6 billion yuan for the first two months,
which was about 1.7 times that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly rising share prices have resulted in the all-time
high increases of both the total market capitalization and market
value of circulating shares.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of February, the total market
capitalization at the two exchanges reached a record of 3,400
billion yuan, 30 percent higher than that of the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the market value of circulating shares rose to
1,080 billion yuan, also a record for the two stock exchanges.

SHANGHAI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States will

<P>
The new network is expected to be open this summer and will

</P>
<P>
E-commerce, an entirely new method of doing business via the
Internet, is experiencing rapid growth worldwide. Many Chinese
websites have been actively engaged in e-commerce during the past
few years, seeking customers who are learning to shop online.
</P>
<P>
China's e-commerce, however, is facing problems such as a less-
developed Internet infrastructure and a lack of regulations and
laws.

China Development Bank will grant 400 billion yuan (4.8 billion US

Accession into the WTO will, in one way or another, affect the

Meanwhile, the draft Law on Legislation, the sole law presented
to the impending meeting for examination and approval, has aroused
wide attention from among deputies. Experts deem that the law will

as it is expected to facilitate the legal system to be required
for building a socialist market economy and democracy.
</P>

Earlier, President Jiang Zemin said that the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee has set forth ideas on strategic

<HEADLINE> Trans-Century Blueprint to Be Mapped out in Coming Legislature Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 3,000 deputies to
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, have
converged upon the Chinese capital today to confer on matters of
vital importance concerning political, economic and social
development in 2000, at the 3rd plenary session of the Ninth NPC
which is due to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Though a routine annual meeting, it is held in the year that
happens to be the last year when the central government formerly
promised to rejuvenate the ailing state-owned enterprises (SOE),
basically wipe out poverty, and fulfill the goals of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is the year, in which China has sped up the pace
for entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) and initiated the
strategy to develop its western areas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that reform of SOEs will be a major topic at
the coming conference as in early 1998, then newly-elected Premier
Zhu Rongji had pledged to bring most of the large and medium-sized
SOEs out of difficulty in three years' time and adopt the modern
enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics available show that SOEs around China earned 96.7
billion yuan (11.65 billion US dollars) in net profit last year,
up 77.7 percent over the previous year and an all-time high over
the past five years. And SOEs in northeast China, the country's
old industrial base, in particular, have improved long-term money-
losing performance.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to implement the pro-active financial
policy in a bid to expand domestic demand and boost economic
growth. However, the central decision-making departments and NPC
deputies would rather prefer quality economic performance to
quantitative growth.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Urges Arbitration on Peace Treaty Obligations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Abu Ala, speaker of Palestinian
Legislative Council, on Thursday called for an international
arbitration on implementing the agreements signed between
Palestinians and Israel if the current stalemate continues.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Palestine radio, Abu Ala, also
known as Ahmed Qureia, ruled out possibility that Palestinians and
Israelis could reach soon settle the long-overdue third-phase
Israeli redeployment and the problems in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the crises still exist, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala accused Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of evading the
implementation of signed agreements, saying the Palestinians find
it difficult to carry out the agreements alone if the Israeli
government did not honor its obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down on February 3
following an unsuccessful summit between Barak and Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat, who failed to iron
out their differences over the delayed Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat rejected the maps on the withdrawal because they did not
include Arab villages near Jerusalem and Israel failed to honor a
compromise deal to consult the Palestinian side before deciding the
maps.  
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate, the two sides missed the self-
imposed February 13 deadline for reaching a framework agreement on
final status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Precondition in Resuming Talks With Syria: Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not accept any
precondition for resuming peace talks with Syria, Foreign Minister
David Levy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Syria's demand for written commitment to
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borderlines as a precondition and
Israel will not accept that, Levy told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to withdraw to borderlines on the eve of the Arab-
Israeli war in 1967 is a difficult issue and even several cabinet
ministers of the Israeli government oppose the idea, levy added.
</P>
<P>
Although Levy rejected Syria's demand, he did specify what
enables Israel to restart its peace talks with Syria which have
been stalled since January after two rounds of talks in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Syria has repeatedly demanded of Israel for a written pledge for
full handback of the occupied Golan Heights to Syria before
relaunching the peace talks. Israel occupied the Golan in the 1967
Mideast War and annexed it in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Sunday that Barak told his ministers in a
cabinet meeting that four of his predecessors had made commitments
to the U.S. for a total pullback from the Heights in return for
security measures. This was the first time that Barak has admitted
the existence of the promise.
</P>
<P>
Syria regarded the admission as a positive signal given by Barak
for resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Barak experienced a serious political setback on Wednesday.
Israeli Knesset (parliament) endorsed in its first reading a
opposition bill on a future peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Likud bill requires a requires a special majority, or 63
percent of the cast votes, in a national referendum for ceding the
Golan, which has been called by some "mission impossible."
</P>
<P>
But Barak said after the voting that he would not reduce his
determination to continue to strengthen the country through peace
agreements and will continue to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said on Tuesday that Israel
and Syria have apparently cleared the obstacles blocking the
resumption of peace talks and are likely to return to the
negotiating table within a month.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shahat also said on the same day that "
there is a sufficient basis for the resumption of talks."

<HEADLINE> hke030261-- Greenpeace Battles Against U.S. Wastes in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The international environmental
group Greenpeace Thursday made a visit to Subic in the northern
Philippines to press ahead with their battle against toxic wastes
left behind by the United States in Subic and Clark, the two
former U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine News Agency, 28 Greenpeace volunteers
arrived at Subic bay on board their ship, the Rainbow Warrior.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, led by the ship captain, Peter Willcox and
Greenpeace advisor, Jack Weinberg, were met by some 500 students
from local high schools and a few members of various religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to Subic to remind the American government of
their moral, if not their legal obligations to the people of the
Philippines," Willcox said.
</P>
<P>
"As an American, I am ashamed by the government's refusal to
accept its moral obligation and clean up the toxic pollution that
the U.S. military left behind in the Philippines," Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
Streamers expressing people's sentiments against toxic waste
read:" This is no way to treat a friend, USA; clean up your mess,"
and "there is something fishy in Subic."
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Task Force for Bases Clean-up, the
records of the UST Hospital in Manila showed that it has treated
385 leukemia patients who are residents near Subic.
</P>
<P>
"Many see this as an elevated leukemia cluster that was caused
by the toxic pollutants left behind at Subic," Greenpeace toxics
campaigner, Francis Dela Cruz, said.
</P>
<P>
Clark was extensively used by the 13th U.S. Air Force and Subic
was used by the U.S. Seventh Fleet for nearly a century until 1991
when the Philippine Senate rejected the extension of the treaty on
the bases.
</P>
<P>
Two foreign-funded studies completed in 1998 had found more
than 40 sites in Clark and Subic to be in various states of
contamination.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress had confirmed serious contamination in the
former bases right after the pullout of the Americans. However,
the U.S. government has refused to own up to any legal or moral
responsibility for the toxic and hazardous wastes.

<HEADLINE> Oil Imports to Cost India Dearly in 2000-01 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- India's oil import bill is
likely to shoot up to 700 billion rupees (16.28 billion U.S.
dollars) in the upcoming 2000-01 fiscal year, up by 23 percent
compared with the estimated oil imports cost of 570 billion rupees
(13.26 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999-2000, India's Petroleum
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surge in costs is mainly due to the high prices of crude
oil and petroleum products in the international market, said the
ministry, which based its estimates on an average international
crude price of 27 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The volume of imports of crude and petroleum is likely to
increase by about 7.5 percent to reach 72 million tons in the
coming fiscal year, while the country's petroleum product
consumption in the 2000-01 period is expected to rise to 104
million tons from 98 million tons in the current 1999-2000 fiscal
year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, India spent over 570 billion rupees
(13.26 billion U.S. dollars) importing 67 million tons of crude
and petroleum products, the ministry estimated.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Goes for On-Line Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
plans to put villages nation-wide covered by the Gerakan Desa
Wawasan (visionary village program) on-line by providing
information technology (IT) facilities, a government minister said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IT facilities would be installed in one-stop centers to be
erected this year, Rural Development Minister Azmi Khalid told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said each center would have 12 computers to be manned by IT-
trained staff of the Community Development Department.
</P>
<P>
"After this all villagers can communicate on-line with
government departments and agencies without the hassle of writing
letters to get advice and assistance," he said, adding that
villagers should also benefit from the information explosion to
acquire the latest marketing techniques and technologies in
boosting the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The one-stop centers will form the infrastructure to kick-start
commercialized and cost-effective food production to reduce the
country's hefty food bill which amounts to 12 billion ringgit (3.
157 billion U.S. dollars) now.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would expand the visionary village program
and the one-stop-center concept nation-wide under the 8th Malaysia
Plan (2001-2005).
</P>
<P>
The visionary village program which started in 1996 covered 2,
168 villages up to last year and the number would be increased to
3,000 by the end of this year, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: APEC Remains Committed to Trade,  Investment Liberalization  By Wang Xiangjiang, Zhu Changdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 2 (Xinhua) - Brunei Ambassador Serbini Ali,
executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Secretariat, said APEC remains committed to promoting trade and
investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview with Xinhua in his office at the
Singapore-based secretariat, Serbini also reiterated that "APEC
will continue to support and contribute to the multilateral
trading system."
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, the APEC trade ministers' meeting in June and
the informal leadership meeting in November in Brunei will provide
opportunities for APEC to reiterate its political support to the
WTO (World Trade Organization)," he said.
</P>
<P>
APEC plans to enhance its outreach activities to its community,
one of which is to re-develop its website so as to provide easier
access to information for business and for wider community, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To enhance APEC's key role of facilitating regional trade and
investment, Serbini said, the APEC ministerial meeting made a
decision last year to develop non-binding principles to assist
policy-makers in formulating pro-business trade and investment
measures.
</P>
<P>
The ministers had consensus on developing relevant programs or
action plans to ensure the implementation of these principles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the main challenge facing APEC, he said the
challenge for the 21-member international organization is to make
people understand what trade and investment liberalization is for.
</P>
<P>
"As you look at what happened in Seattle, there was a big
question mark of people being marginalized because of
globalization, so APEC is trying to do its own bit to share with
the people the view that globalization is not necessarily bad,
trade and investment liberalization is not necessarily bad," he
said.
</P>
<P>
One assuring example is that economies that are open do better
than economies that are not open, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the economic crisis in 1997 and 1998, APEC member
economies did not go back and close to themselves, instead they
kept their commitment and pushed forward their liberalization
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
"And then I think we are on a good track," he said, adding: "
Recovery seems to be very strong in the region."
</P>
<P>
"If you look at what happened in Seattle, people are concerned
with questions of what this trade liberalization is meant for them,
" he said. "There is now a gap between people who benefit and
people who do not benefit."
</P>
<P>
APEC now realizes that it has to make sure that the people
realize the benefit by sharing with them good stories of
successful APEC members, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we need to bridge the gap by building our
own human resources and pursuing capacity building. This is the
role of economic and technical cooperation in APEC. And this is
very important." he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue E-commerce Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is pushing for
the enactment of two laws concerning the electronic commerce (e-
commerce) by mid-year, Deputy Commerce Minister Gonpot Asawinvijit
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gonpot was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that the
two bills, involving e-commerce activities and digital signatures,
are now being scrutinized in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the two bills will pass final hurdles in the
parliament and take effect by mid 2000," Gonpot said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Thai entrepreneurs to study the e-commerce,
saying the on-line trade will help them maintain their market
shares and competitiveness in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will also organize seminars to help
publicize knowledge and tactics on the on-line trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The global e-commerce is believed to grow 100 times in the next
few years.

<HEADLINE> Bush Fires Still Raging in Southern Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Bush fires, which erupted
separately in Borena and Bale regions in southern Ethiopia about
three weeks ago, are still raging rampantly, according to
officials of the Ethiopian Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Five people have reportedly been injured and 34,000 hectares of
forest destroyed in the fires. Besides, many houses and live
stocks were burned to ashes.
</P>
<P>
The Borena and Bale regions have had no rains for two years.
If the two fires met, it "would be disastrous", the Agriculture
Ministry has warned.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reason of dry weather, arson can be another
reason for the blazes.
</P>
<P>
Police said that nearly 150 people have been arrested on
charges of causing the fires.
</P>
<P>
To contain the fires, more than 8,000 people have been
reportedly deployed in the fire-stricken areas. Moreover,
hundreds of university students in Addis Ababa are also expected
to join the fire-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Ethiopian Agriculture Ministry appealed for
international help to stop the fires, which fire experts said
might take Ethiopia considerable time before being put under
control.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft-based operations are needed but Ethiopia currently has
neither the technical nor financial sources required.

<HEADLINE> S. African Reserve Bank to Stay Out of Exchange Market: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank will not play an active role in the foreign exchange market
or try to protect the local currency to attain government's
inflation targets, bank governor Tito Mboweni said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Parliament's finance portfolio committee in Cape
Town, Mboweni said the advantage of inflation targeting is that
the central bank no longer has to protect a particular level of
the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel announced in his budget speech
last week that inflation would be targeted at between three and
six percent, to be attained by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni said inflation targeting would improve the coordination
between monetary policy and other economic policies, and would be
most effective when all government policies were well coordinated.
</P>
<P>
"I can give you my word that we are not activists in the
foreign exchange market; we are not entering the market to defend
a particular level of the rand/dollar exchange rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is too expensive," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had spent more than 10 billion U.S. dollars to
protect the rand during the crisis of 1998, bloating the net open
position to 22.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank had reduced the position to about 11.2 billion dollars
and would continue to reduce it until it was closed.
</P>
<P>
However, Mboweni added that should the movements in the
currency market become excessive, the central bank could be forced
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
He assured parliament finance portfolio committee that the key
repurchase rate -- the daily discount rate at which the central
bank sells money to private banks -- was functioning well and
would continue as a floating mechanism.
</P>
<P>
But the fact that the rate seemed lodged at 11.75 percent was a
sign of stability and certainty in the market.

LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A reconciliation committee has been
inaugurated in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state after the recent
riots between Christians and Moslems over the proposed
introduction of Sharia into the state caused more than 400 deaths,
said a source reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which made up of Christians, Moslems, and
community leaders, was set up in compliance with the directive of
President Olusegun Obasanjo to ensure peace and harmony among the
people of the sensitive state, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of the committee, the State
Commissioner for Justice, Sani Aminu, explained that the committee
was necessary in view of the recent religious crisis in the state
capital Kaduna, adding that it was charged with the responsibility
of finding ways and means of preventing recurrence of the

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide $375M Aid to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bank's Resident Representative Laurence Clarke said in an
interview with the press here on Thursday that the planned
additional support was based on the assumption that the
privatization of the Zambian Copper mines would be consolidated
shortly this year and that the economy would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
He added that at the moment the bank has a portfolio of 14
on-going projects in Zambia at various stages of the
implementation in the agriculture, road, education, energy,
health, mining and finance.
</P>
<P>
Clarke added over the past two to three years, disbursements on
these existing projects will total 400 million dollars over and
above the proposed 375 million dollars programmed new assistance
to the people of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the long term objectives of the bank's program of
new and on-going assistance would be to continue to assist in the
generation of increased incomes and better living standards for
Zambians and to support efforts to reduce poverty as a central
element of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The new country assistant strategy indicate that the bank's
programmed support over the next three years would be evenly
divided between investment type projects and programs and the
balance of payment support credits.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that among the programs to be financed will be
operations to reform and strengthen capacity in the Zambia public
service in a long period.
</P>
<P>
It will also assist government in defining a new long-term
national vision strengthening its fiscal management and
preparation of a poverty reduction program.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the World Bank together with other multilateral and
 bilateral creditors will continue to support Zambian government
in the preparatory work for vitally important debt relief under
enhanced arrangements for heavily indebted poor countries from
which Zambia is expected to initially benefit this year.

<P>
MAPUTO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- About 100 cases of malaria and
diarrhoea are reported everyday in centers accommodating the
victims of floods in the Mozambican capital Maputo, according to
the Mozambican Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Despite the malaria and diarrhoea cases, the situation was
under control, said Alfredo Chioze, secretary of the Red Cross for
Maputo city.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique News Agency Thursday quoted Chioze as saying
that his organization has first aid brigades in all 10 of the
accommodation centers in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
But some people will only seek health care when the disease
they are suffering from is at a very advanced stage, which makes
it difficult to provide the help they need, the Red Cross official
said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the destructive flooding caused by the tropical Cyclone
Eline, Mozambicans are facing increased vulnerability to various
diseases and shortages of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi has warned the people
of the secondary effects of the biggest floods in 30 years in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people have reportedly died in the flooding, and
dozens of others are missing.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that the number of people directly affected by the
floods has risen to 900,000, of whom over 300,000 have been made
homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Minister of Foreign
Affairs Manna Lindh expressed disappointment at Britain's decision
to free former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, many of us are disappointed. We have always wanted
Pinochet to be responsible for his own actions," Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish foreign minister pointed out that Pinochet's
release is not his victory, because it doesn't mean Pinochet is
innocent or remitted, and that he should be responsible for his
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Lindh also said Pinochet is returning to Chile, which is
totally different from what it used to be, with Ricardo Lagos
holds the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Lagos was once hunted and imprisoned by Pinochet.

<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) - A Boeing jet plane, with former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet on board, took off Thursday from a
British airbase in eastern England after the British government
ruled that he should not be extradited to Spain to stand trial on
torture charges.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean plane, which had been on standby at another air
base for several weeks to take Pinochet home, left Waddington
airbase at 1315 GMT, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The plane flew to Waddington airbase just hours ago and took
off in torrential rain minutes after Pinochet's motorcade arrived
at the airbase.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's departure comes only hours after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw ruled on medical grounds that he should not
be extradited.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of six cars flanked by four motorcycle outriders had
traveled from the secluded estate in south London, where the
general had been held under house arrest since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Spain, which initiated 16 months of legal
wrangling by asking Britain to detain the 84-year-old general and
extradite him to Spain to face charges of human rights abuses,
said it would respect Britain's decision.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of Unrecorded Imperial Palace Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered the ruins of a 2,200-year-old imperial palace never
recorded in any historical books in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 800,000-square-meter ruins locate in Zhaojiawa Township,
Chengxian County. It was built in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
A number of earthen structures scattered around the main
building. Two palaces built of rammed earth were buried
underground on the southern side of the ruins.
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of tiles and other building materials collected
from the ruins looked delicate with beautiful designs, said a
witness.
</P>
<P>
On why such a large imperial palace was built in the region, a
Chinese archeologist deduced that the place was a headquarters or
a military center during the warring states period (475-221 B.C.)
and later became a palace for the emperor's short stay while he
was away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists also discovered the ruins of a temple
frequently visited by Liu Xun, the seventh emperor of the Western
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24).
</P>
<P>
The temple, on the southeastern suburb of Xi'an, was used for
holding sacrificial rites by all emperors in the Han Dynasty.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Provincial leaders in the
southwest China province of Sichuan took up shovels in a tree-
planting activity today in a bid to promote forestation in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, the newly-appointed provincial committee
secretary of the Communist Party of China, Governor Zhang Zhongwei
and hundreds of officials took part in the tree planting despite
light rain.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the most important provinces in the country's eco-
reconstruction, Sichuan is striving to become the green shield in
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River," said Zhou, who was the
country's minister of land and resources before taking his current
post.
</P>
<P>
The eco-reconstruction will not only benefit Sichuan, but also
the whole Yangtze River valley, said Cao Zhengqi, director of the
province's bureau of forestry.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, provincial leaders have been participating every
year in tree planting activities, which have resulted in 206,600
ha of new trees a year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province also took the initiative two
years ago to stop logging in natural forests.
</P>
<P>
These and other measures will play a critical role in
preventing floods in the river valley, Cao noted.

<HEADLINE> Fires Kill 2,700 Chinese in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Fires killed more than 2,700
people while causing direct economic loss of about 1.4 billion
yuan (about 169 million U.S. dollars) in China last year, becoming
the top threat to fast-growing cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighting specialists today warned that fires could be more
catastrophic than traffic accidents, even though the death toll
from fires is lower.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people underestimate the serious consequences of a
fire, such as the destruction of infrastructure, loss of property,
and negative impacts on the whole economic structure," Fan
Weicheng, a professor from the Chinese University of Science and
Technology, said at a symposium on city safety in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that fires were on the rise in recent years.
About 180,000 fires were reported in the country last year, an
increase of 40 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Fan blamed the lack of fire-fighting equipment and poor
management of fire fighting system in buildings as the leading
cause of frequent fires, such as a blaze which burned down a large
furniture mall in Beijing in 1998. In that case, firefighters were
unable to get equipment and water at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Another specialist worried that urban modernization has also
bring more and more hidden dangers.
</P>
<P>
"We have increasing pressures on preventing fires as the city
develops power and gas supply projects, telecommunications and
public traffic," said senior engineer Wu Qihong from the Chinese
Association for Fire Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
The nation has invested 30 million yuan to build a national
laboratory to study fire prevention, Wu said.

arise under new conditions.
</P>
<P>
"People's courts should rely on reform to improve efficiency
and promote justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu stressed, in their daily work, people's courts
should stick to several basic principles, namely adhering to
justice, improving the efficiency of lawsuits while reducing
expenses, and relying on the Party's leadership while accepting
the supervision from people's congresses.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, a leading
newspaper in China, is to carry an editorial Friday hailing the
opening of the third session of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The session, being held at the turn of the century, has a
special mission and is of great significance, the editorial says.
The history of an increasingly developed and powerful New China is
one that has witnessed the country's adherence to a multiparty
cooperation and political consultative system and to solidarity of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is an invention by the Communist Party of China (CPC)
that combines the united front theory of Marxist-Leninist parties
with actual conditions in China, the People's Daily says. It is
also a result of CPC's long unity and striving together with the
non-Communist parties, non-party groups and patriots from all
walks of life and ethnic groups, it says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, the CPPCC has played an
irreplaceable role in the political, economic and social life of
the country and has accumulated abundant and valuable experience,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial quotes President Jiang Zemin as saying that unity
and democracy constitute the basic experience of the CPPCC. To
foster unity and democracy under the leadership of the CPC is the
embodiment of the nature of the CPPCC, Jiang says.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have been basically
completed for the Third Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), and all the 35 delegations of deputies to this top
legislature have arrived in Beijing today for the annual gathering
due to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) sent its first
delegation to the NPC session. Deputies from Qinghai and Liaoning
provinces, upon arrival in Beijing, were already busy studying
related documents and making preparations for the session.
</P>
<P>
This year's sessions of the Ninth NPC and the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) are significant given the numerous tasks facing
the nation, said Bao Yizhi, a deputy from west China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
"China needs to continue policies for expanding domestic demand,
further economic restructuring, and speed up technological
innovations. It also has to find effective ways to push ahead
enterprise reform, re-employment of laid-off workers, housing
reform and increase of farmers' income," he said, adding that he
hopes the pace of revitalizing China's vast western areas will be
accelerated.
</P>

<P>
The editorial reviewed major events that took place last year.
These include the celebration of New China's fiftieth founding
anniversary, the return of Macao to its motherland and new
progresses made in reform, opening up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it says, China safeguarded state sovereignty
and dignity, the unity of the motherland, and social and political
stability to create a sound social and political environment for
the country to focus on economic work, with great victories
achieved over three political struggles, namely, protest against
barbaric attacks on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia by the U.S.-
led NATO, stern rebuke against the "two-state" fallacy by Lee Teng-
hui who wants to split the motherland, and crackdown on the "Falun
Gong" cult group. The CPPCC made important contributions to these
struggles by firmly adhering to unity and democracy, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
This year is the last year for China to implement its "Ninth
Five-Year Plan" (1996-2000), attain the goals of state enterprise
reform, and eliminate poverty in rural areas, the editorial says.
China will also work out its "Tenth Five-Year Plan" (2001-2005)
and strive for sustainable development, it says.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC need to hold even higher the great banner of unity
and democracy and play an even bigger role if China is to realize
its great renaissance, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily goes on to defines the unity of the CPPCC:
as a unity with a great common goal, as a unity for China's
reunification, and as a unity of all Chinese at home and abroad
for a great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The editorial defines the democracy of the CPPCC as a democracy
whose main content is to hold consultations and discussions, make
comments, raise proposals and exercise democratic supervision, and
as a people's democracy with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is the patriotic and united front organization of the
Chinese people, with the broadest representation organizationally
and the greatest inclusiveness politically, it says. It is an
important institution for realizing the political system of
multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the
leadership of the CPC. It is an important form of socialist
democratic polity that is in conformity with realities in China
and the fundamental interests of the people, the editorial says.

that the establishment of such a state on September 13, as Arafat
originally set, will affect the 2000 U.S. presidential election in
a negative way.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. election was due to end on November 3, and Vice
President Al Gore, Clinton's handpicked successor and a current
forerunner, will face the most critical time of his campaign in
September.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians unilaterally proclaim a state then and thus
lead to a confrontation with Israel, the Clinton-Gore
administration will surely be embarrassed by the failure of its
Middle East policies and such incident will damage Gore's chance to
win, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, if Arafat announces Palestinian statehood after the
election, the chances will be better for the Americans to
acknowledge the new state.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the November 15 date is that it was on that
day in 1988 that the Palestinians declared its independence in
Algiers, when Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) colleagues were fighting in exile there.
</P>
<P>
The policy change, as the sources said, was clued in Arafat's
recent remarks, which stopped mentioning September as the datelimit
and highlighted his intention to establish an independent state by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council of the PLO decided last month to declare an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital this year. It was
reported that the date was set no later than September 13, which is
also the date scheduled for the signature of an Israeli-Palestinian
permanent status treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians postponed their declaration of statehood last
year to wait for the results of the permanent-status negotiations
with Israel, which deal with thorny issues such as the status of
Jerusalem, borders, the future of the Jewish settlements on
occupied land and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed by the two sides
last September, they should reach a framework agreement on final-
status issues by February 13 and a final accord on permanent peace
by September 13.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli-Palestinian final status talks have fallen
into a crisis after breakdown of a summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat at Erez checkpoint at Gaza-Israeli
border, which had made the two sides miss the February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had lost its patience toward what it called
delaying tactics by Barak on the Israeli-Palestinian peace track
and it may be determined to announce statehood unilaterally.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Displeased Over Delayed Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- John Wolf, U.S. President Bill
Clinton's special adviser on Caspian basin energy diplomacy, has
complained of little progress in the implementation of Baku-Ceyhan
oil pipeline project, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following his two-week talks with Turkish and Azeri authorities,
Wolf revealed his displeasure to the press about the delay of the
pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the editor of the English newspaper, Wolf said
the project "is a bit behind schedule," and the delay "affects
chances to move the project along the lines agreed last year."
</P>
<P>
The 1,740-kilometer Baku-Ceyhan deal was signed by Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Georgia in Istanbul, Turkey last November on the
sidelines of the Summit of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Clinton attended the signing ceremony of the agreement, under
which the Azeri oil will be transported by a pipeline running, by
way of Georgian capital of Tbilisi, to Turkey's Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Georgia is seeking to earn a higher tariff
on the oil transported through its territory while refusing to
assume any responsibility for the security of its section of the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Given the uncertainty of the project, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel dispatched his advisor Hikmet Cetin to Georgia last weekend
in an attempt to persuade his Georgian counterpart Eduard
Shevardnadze to accelerate technical talks.
</P>
<P>
"It is not I who will reach the agreement. What is being
negotiated is a draft 'contract' or 'project agreement' between
Georgia and potential investors. It is for them, not the United
States, to reach this agreement," said Wolf in his letter.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Calls For Cross-border Control of Poliovirus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A two-day SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) meeting ended Thursday with
calls for coordination and cooperation among its member countries
to combat the cross-border proliferation of polio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of health secretaries of SAARC and
neighboring countries on management of polio eradication along
border areas, SAARC Secretary-General Nihal Rodrigo said the
complete eradication of polio calls for inter-country and inter-
regional collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Strategies adopted at the meeting will address not only the
technical and the clinical aspects of polio eradication, but also
sensitive concerns of social and cultural nature as well as
political ramifications, Rodrigo said.
</P>
<P>
As many of the SAARC countries are identified as the few of the
"major global poliovirus reservoirs," cooperation within SAARC as
well as between SAARC and its neighbors in controlling the cross-
border proliferation of the virus is elemental to polio
eradication, said some experts at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As of January 2000, the number of polio-infected countries had
fallen to 30 while Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and
Pakistan had been identified as "major poliovirus reservoirs,"
according to a paper presented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 health officials and experts from the seven SAARC
countries -- Nepal, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and Bhutan, as well as Afghanistan, Iran and Myanmar
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was jointly organized by SAARC, the World Health
Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund.

<HEADLINE> Fake Large-denomination Notes Found in Circulation in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Fake notes have already been found
in circulation barely three months after Nigeria's introduction of
its 100 naira notes (about one U.S. dollar), the Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary citizens are far too easy to fall preys of the frauds
for the imitations had virtually all the features of the original
ones.
</P>
<P>
The error of attributing the Zuma Rock to the federal capital
territory, Abuja, instead of Niger State in the new notes, also
appears on the fake ones.
</P>
<P>
However, the photograph of late national hero Obafemi Awolowo,
looks darker on the fake notes than on the genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
The 100-naira notes were introduced late last year to help the
country's economy walk out of the difficulties caused by absence
of larger- denomination notes. People in the west African nation
have to carry bags of notes to pay their telephone bills even
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government last year announced that it would also
introduce 200, 300, and 500 naira notes in the future, which would
almost certainly excite the counterfeiters in and out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The largest domination before the introduction of the 100-naira
notes is 50 naira.

LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has launched a HIV/AIDS project in Nigeria in an effort
to help the most populous African country to check the spread of
the deadly disease, according to information reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which took off as from this year, would support
the development of a strategy for HIV/AIDS control in children and
youths and mother-to-child transmission services, UNICEF zonal
health program officer, Jonas Itombra-Okoro, said in Port Harcourt
in eastern Rivers State.
</P>
<P>
The project would also focus on support partnership for
awareness building and advocacy for HIV/AIDS control, and the
provision of care for children suffering from AIDS, especially the
orphans, the UNICEF official said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the use of routine immunization rather than the
periodic national program on immunization, to prevent "our
children and women of child-bearing age from dying from
preventable diseases."
</P>
<P>
Rivers Commissioner for Health Omi Membere-Otaji commended
UNICEF for being in the forefront in supporting and implementing

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Niger State Withdraws Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Niger state Wednesday
withdrew all the bills on Sharia recently passed by the state's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigeria's newspaper Thursday quoted
Niger state governor Abdulkadir Kure as saying in the state's
capital Minna that the decision was made in accordance with an
agreement reached at Tuesday's meeting of the national council of
states in Abuja and it was "in the interest of all".
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting attended by the governors of the country's
36 states had decided that the northern states which had made
changes to their state laws to adopt Sharia should revert back to
the situation before last October.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Zamfara state last October declared that it would
adopt Sharia, causing great controversy between the country's
Moslem north and Christian south.
</P>
<P>
Riots recently broke out in the northern Kaduna state, southern
Abia and Imo states taking hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
"If suspending Sharia is the sacrifice some of us have to make
to sustain the nation's unity, I abide by it," said the governor,
who announced last month that his state would follow Zamfara's
suit to adopt Sharia early May.
</P>
<P>
He had earlier in a statewide television broadcast announced
that he was withdrawing the Sharia "in order to nip in the bud the
emergent threat to peace in our country."
</P>
<P>
The governor said measures had been put in place to stem an
exodus of non-indigenes from Minna. among other things, security
agents have been directed to mount sentry posts at exit points
from the state capital, and turn back persons suspected to be
fleeing the town in fear of ethnic backlash.

<HEADLINE> De Beers Denies Illegal Diamond Trade with Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South African diamond giant De
Beers has denied any involvement in the illegal diamond trade with
the Angola's UNITA rebels, the official Jornal de Angola newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Beers reaffirmed its full support for the
international efforts to bring peace to the warring African
countries including Angola, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, De Beers, the world's largest diamond
company, said that it has complied with the U.N. resolution 1173.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution bans purchases of diamonds from Jonas
Savimbi, head of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) rebels, or the precious stones of the Angolan
origin without legal certificates issued by the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
The South African company announced that it had stopped buying
Angolan diamonds from the underground sectors and had withdrawn
its buyers from the Congo and Guinea, just as it did some 15 years
ago in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
De Beers assured that it will make effort to prevent African
rebel movements from getting access to the diamond markets.
</P>
<P>
The company has instructed its offices in Belgium's Antwerp and
Israel's Tel Aviv, both of them important diamond processing and
marketing places, to refrain from buying diamonds from African
suppliers or areas under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
Angola was in 1974 the fourth-largest diamond-producing country
in the world. But the rampant civil conflicts and the illegal
exploitation have made the production rapidly decline year after
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to Tanzanian media report Thursday that the six
Burundians were suspected to be part of an underground group of
the extremist Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The accused, who appeared before Kasulu District Court on
Monday, are alleged to have taken part in what was seen as a
political assassination of five members of the same family at
Muyovosi refugee camp in Kasulu District on February 18, the
Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
But investigators of the cold-blooded murders were quoted as
saying Wednesday that the search for more suspects of the
military-style grenade attack on the family of five Burundian
refugees still continues.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma Regional Police Commander Placid Chaka told the paper
that the six suspects, who were arrested in camps located in
Kigoma Region, were part of a group of 14 Burundian refugees
arrested by the police shortly after the murders were committed.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are accused of murdering the family of Dr Jean
Batungwanayo, the 55-year-old younger brother of Leonard Nyangoma,
leader of the CNDD political group in Burundi resisting the
military rule of President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Dr Batungwanayo was warned by unknown people
against his political agitations for his brother's CNDD group
within the camp.
</P>
<P>
The CNDD group and the break away FDD military wing have become
fierce enemies despite being on the same side of the forces
opposed to Major Buyoya's government.

Like other camps, Muyowosi shelters Hutu refugees belonging to
both groups.

The Chinese government has made effective efforts to fulfill
people's economic, social and cultural rights and promote and
protect their political rights in the past year, Qian said, adding
that remarkable progress has been made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
China's human rights conditions are at their best in history, a
fact that the entire Chinese people have been satisfied with and

</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, China decided to step up the

implementation of this strategy is significant for improving
people's living standard there, and their capacity to enjoy all
kinds of human rights. Therefore, China hopes for support from the
international community in this regard, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Chinese government has high praise for the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

adding that China's relevant law-making organizations,
governmental organizations and academic institutions have studied
them and are making preparations for their ratification.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported the efforts made by the United
Nations and the international community to promote and protect
human rights, participated in U.N. human rights organization
activities, and made contributions to international human rights
cooperation, according to Qian.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Better than Confrontation in Human Rights: Vice-Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said today that it is natural that various countries have
different views on the human rights issue owing to different
national conditions, and confrontation is not the proper way of
solving differences -- dialogue is better than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting today with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is in
Beijing for the Eighth Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific
Region.
</P>
<P>
Robinson thanked the Chinese government for hosting the
gathering, and said she believes the workshop will help promote
exchange and cooperation on the human rights issue among the Asia-
Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
She also spoke of the progress China has made in promoting and
protecting human rights in recent years, and welcomed China's
signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights in 1997, and the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that her office would like to cooperate with the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that in promoting and protecting human rights, action
is more important than talk.
</P>
<P>
For China, a populous country, "we pay more attention to action,
" Qian said.

<HEADLINE> State Councilor Confers with Russian Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Russian relations have
maintained sound and stable development in recent years and
bilateral strategic cooperation has seen remarkable progress,
State Councilor Wu Yi said while meeting with Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebanov here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Since the summit between the two heads of state of the two
countries and the 4th regular meeting between the Chinese premier
and the Russian prime minister in 1999, the two sides have made
substantial progress in implementing accords, and bilateral trade
has recovered growth, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current international situation, it is of great
significance for the two sides to add more concrete content to
their strategic partnership of cooperation, and strengthen
cooperation in all fields, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the belief that bilateral cooperation will be
upgraded to a new level if the two sides explore more ways for
further cooperation and keep up with the newest market trends on
the basis of mutual trust and benefit.
</P>
<P>
The Russian deputy prime minister said that Russia attaches
great importance to cooperation with China, and is satisfied with
the achievements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep up the sound momentum of development in
bilateral cooperation, he said, the two sides should take measures
to ensure comprehensive development in areas of trade, technology,
energy resources, nuclear energy and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Wu briefed the Russian guests on China's strategy to develop
its vast western areas on a gigantic scale, saying that Russia is
welcome to participate in the development as a close neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Russia is interested in the development plans, and will spare
no efforts in joining the cooperation, replied Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also had detailed discussions on cooperation
projects in certain areas, and agreed that the 5th regular meeting
between the Chinese premier and the Russian prime minister will be
held in Beijing in mid-year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the two are to hold meetings for the Regular
Meeting Committee and its sub-committees. The addition of two
extra sub-committees on banking and space cooperation were also
agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
The Russian deputy prime minister arrived here today for an
official visit at the invitation of the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets George Bush (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told
former U.S. President George Bush here today that the key to the
steady development of Sino-U.S. relations in the 21st century is
to proceed from a strategic perspective which involves acting in
the best interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his meeting with Bush, who is here to
attend The Smile Train, a charity program sponsored by U.S.
software corporation Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefly reviewed the evolution of Sino-U.S. relations.
Even though they suffered a relatively big setback last year, both
sides agreed to continue their efforts to build up the China-U.S.
strategic partnership during the meeting of Asian-Pacific Economic
Cooperation held last September, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the China-U.S. signing of a bilateral agreement for
China's entry in the World Trade Organization (WTO) last November
also improved Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
"It was not an easy mission to develop our bilateral relations
to the current phase," he said, attributing the growth of the
current relationship to the efforts made by both sides, including
those made by previous U.S. administrations during the past 20-odd
years.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to step up interaction with leaders from both
Republican and Democratic parties and people from all walks of
life in the U.S. if it will further develop Sino-U.S. ties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
After briefing Jiang on the U.S. presidential campaign, Bush
told Jiang he firmly supported China's entry into the WTO and
advocated that China be granted permanent normal trade relations
status, adding that such moves were in the interests of both sides.
He said that he will personally work to push forward U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife Barbara are here as guests of the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Advisory Body Supports Government Stance on Reunification Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body declared
its firm support for the government stance Thursday on
facilitating the complete reunification of the motherland and
maintaining national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
is firmly against any attempt to separate Taiwan from the
motherland, said Tian Zengpei, a spokesman for the Third Session
of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee. The annual CPPCC session
will open Friday.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong and Macao to the embrace of the
motherland marks significant progress toward the reunification of
the motherland, which makes the Taiwan issue and the complete
reunification of the motherland a more prominent issue facing the
Chinese people including the Taiwan compatriots and overseas
Chinese, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tian said the CPPCC endorses the principles spelt out in the
recently-issued white paper entitled "The One-China Principle and
The Taiwan Issue", supports the government stance on the Taiwan
issue and all the measures the government takes in that regard.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC will spare no effort in promoting the "one country,
two systems" principle and the eight-point propositions put
forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the reunification of
the motherland, and furthering cross-Straits exchanges under the
One-China principle so as to achieve a complete and early
reunification and rejuvenation of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliamentary Commission Debates Constitutional Change Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Commission of the
Turkish parliament started Wednesday deliberations on a
constitutional amendment bill for direct presidential elections,
which is unlikely to be approved, Turkish Daily News reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted by 185 legislators led by the opposition
True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller and Virtue Party (FP)
leader Recai Kutan, wants the president to be elected through
public votes to a five-year term, instead of being elected by the
parliament to a single seven-year term under current procedures.
</P>
<P>
If accepted by the commission, the proposal would be submitted
to the Grand National Assembly (parliament) pending endorsement.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling coalition-dominated commission is expected
to reject the opposition proposal, as early as in its Thursday
session.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after rejecting the opposition proposal, the
commission would start debate of another amendment proposal, put
forward by the tripartite ruling coalition -- the Democratic Left
Party (DSP) of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, the Nationalist
Movement Party (MHP) and the Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
The tripartite proposal calls for allowing a maximum of two
consecutive five-year terms for the president who will still be
elected by the parliament members.
</P>
<P>
DYP leader Ciller has said that her party would back the ruling
coalition's proposal if the opposition proposal co-sponsored by DYP
was rejected by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FP also expressed readiness to support the
tripartite proposal if it includes, as is the case, an article to
ease control over political parties.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ecevit has already said that he wants an
amendment to the constitution to make stricter restrictions on
closing down political parties.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite proposal also includes another amendment that
would allow the Parliament Speaker's Office to raise the salaries
and pensions of parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ecevit introduced the two appendant provisions
into the ruling parties' proposal to curry favor with the
opposition parties so as to secure a two-third majority, or 367
votes, in the 550-seat parliament required for a constitutional
amendment without resorting to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that if the tripartite proposal can be accepted
by the Constitution Commission in its Thursday session, the debate
in the parliament over the proposal would start as early as next
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government remains
committed to holding open, free and fair elections which will
include all political parties, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Othman Ismail has said.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the court of the opposition, " said Mustafa
in his remarks to the local newspaper "El Raai Elaam" printed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudanese government has fulfilled all the opposition
demands, hoping this will pave the way toward a comprehensive
dialogue between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition has been trying to delay such a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government won't be patient forever and it is
waiting for the outcome of the opposition meetings in Asmara to be
held within this month.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa also warned the opposition to stop its current policy
toward what has been agreed upon concerning the Egyptian-Libyan
peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Cairo and Tripoli proposed an initiative to hold a
national reconciliation conference that will bring together the
Khartoum government, northern opposition in exile and southern
rebels in an effort to put an end to the civil war that erupted in
the country in 1983.
</P>
<P>
He added Sudan has invited the European Union, the United
Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity to
sponsor the election process, noting that "holding elections and
establishing a legislative council are important elements to
exercise democracy."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
informed the United Nations refugee agency that it was on the
verge of sealing off many of its camps because of congestion
problems, the Guardian newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though all camps were crowded as a result of overwhelming
refugee influx, Tanzania has no choice but to accept more of them
under the commitment to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, he said each camp has its own limit on the number of
refugees it can accommodate.
</P>
<P>
The alert was raised as large number of refugees, fleeing civil
war in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, continue
to enter western Tanzanian regions in droves, said the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the western Kigoma Region claimed that as of
last week, the region hosted 468,000 registered refugees, but it
is believed that there are some 200,000 unaccounted for refugees
scattered in various locations in the region.

NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- More police have been sent to the
Kenyan capital Nairobi to curb the rising crime rate in the city,
Minister of State Marsden Madoka told the East African Standard
newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Madoka said that raids and patrol by police had been underway,
adding that 186 suspects were caught on Wednesday night.

<P>
The crime including armed robbery and murder was rampant in
Nairobi with four police officers killed and two members of the
parliament shot and wounded last month.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that security in Nairobi has been deteriorating
due to a slowdown in economic growth, high unemployment and a
widening gap between the rich and the poor since 1997.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Travel Mart near Ancient Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China will hold the 8th National
Travel Mart in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, from July 12 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiqin, deputy-director of the National Tourism
Administration, said today that the event may rekindle interest in
traveling along the ancient Silk Road and help promote tourism in
China's interior.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, with an area accounting for one-sixth of the country'
s total land, has rich tourism resources, including places of
historical interest including the Silk Road and magnificent
landscapes ranging from glaciers to desert.
</P>
<P>
China now has the world's largest domestic travel market, and
its tourism income from the domestic front amounted to 283 billion
yuan (about 34 billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry has played an important part in
stimulating domestic demand and promoting national economic growth,
Zhang said, adding that this year's travel mart in Xinjiang is in
sync with the state's strategy to revive the western regions.
</P>
<P>
The National Travel Mart is the largest tourism event in China,
and has been held annually since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Primary Schools Start No-Homework Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese primary school students
are expecting a new semester without any homework, as the Ministry
of Education (MOE) has asked that all homework must be completed
at school, and students are to go home without any homework.
</P>
<P>
The MOE issued a regulation last month on reducing students'
homework, and asked educational departments at all levels to help
students spend their school days free of homework.
</P>
<P>
Some educators hold that this new MOE regulation will not only
release students from homework, but will also bring a breath of
fresh air for cultivating their creativity.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianning, department chief for basic education at the MOE,
said that the lack of an environment to nurture students'
creativity is the major gap between basic education in China and
that in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yunxiao, the deputy director of the China Youth and
Children's Research Center, pointed out that compared with the
teaching materials used by middle and primary schools in the
United States, those used in Chinese middle and primary schools
are much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The level of knowledge about physics for a grade one junior
middle school student in China is equal to that of a grade three
junior middle school student in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, experts doubt that the mere accumulation of text-based
knowledge can really improve China's basic education level.
</P>
<P>
Yang Deren, a chemistry professor at Shanghai Normal University,
pointed out that most teaching materials in China's middle and
primary schools are designed to cultivate scholars.
</P>
<P>
The MOE published "The 2000 Middle and Primary School Teaching
Material Catalog" last month, which reduced the amount of teaching
materials.
</P>
<P>
This no-homework effort will help primary and middle school
students to lighten their bags, which are notorious for their
being weighed down with all kinds of school paraphernalia, said
the official, adding that the publication of the catalog will help
push forward quality-oriented education.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianning believes that the catalog will help schools reduce
their teaching requirements, downsize examinations, and increase
teaching activities that strengthen students' creativity.

trafficking and producing last year, 2.4 percent higher than 1998,
among which 60 cases involved over 10,000 grams of heroin. Some 57,
000 criminal suspects, or 7.9 percent more than 1998, were
arrested. Altogether, 5.3 tons of heroin and 16 tons of "ice" were

</P>
<P>
Bai said that 214 cases of drug-related chemical smuggling were
hunted down, over 300 suspects arrested, and 272 tons of chemicals
for producing drugs were seized.

<P>
The vice minister also said that the country has built more
rehab facilities, and more than 220,000 drug users ended their
addiction last year.
</P>
<P>

2,081 counties have been found to have a drug problem, 48 more
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, all 31 provinces, autonomous regions,
and municipalities reported HIV carriers, among whom 72 percent
were infected by drug injections. There are more than 400,000 HIV
carriers in the country, according to recent estimates by experts.

ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Turkish soldiers and six
Kurdish rebels were killed Wednesday night in southeastern Turkey
in clashes between government security forces and the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the emergency rule authorities said
Thursday.
</P>

Five PKK guerrillas and three security forces soldiers were
killed in fighting that broke out on Gabbar Mountain in Sirnak
province. A six rebel was shot dead in an operation launched by
security forces against the PKK in Mardin province.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between security forces and the PKK, which took place
nearly on a daily basis in the past, have significantly scaled down

on his men to lay down their weapons and turn the guerrilla group
in a political organization.

Ocalan who was arrested in February last year was sentenced to
death on treason charge last June by Turkish security court. But he

KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has earmarked seven
pioneer locations nation-wide for expanding information technology

They would form the E-community pilot projects aimed at

He said that the country now has more than 1.5 million Internet

Malaysians, "Malaysia still has low use of the Internet and needs
to improve on the situation."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need to narrow the gap of IT
applications between the rural folk and town-dwellers.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no quick way towards that end, he said,
adding one approach to spread the use of modern technology nation-
wide would be to introduce IT in rural schools.

After a month of debate and with several revisions, the DPR
Thursday passed the draft of state budget for fiscal year 2000,
under which the government revenues is targeted to reach 152.8
trillion rupiah(21.828 billion U.S. dollars), while expenditures
is set to reach 197.03 trillion rupiah (28.147 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Based on the figures, the budget deficit will be 44.133
trillion rupiah (6.3 billion dollars) or 4.8 percent of GDP from
the previous figure of 45.373 trillion rupiah (6.48 billion
dollars)or 5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The new draft assumed the economic growth to reach 3.8 percent,
the inflation rate 4.8 percent, the rupiah exchange rate 7,000
rupiah per U.S. dollar and the oil price in international market
to be 20 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo said that the government will monitor such assumptions
closely.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do that (monitor the budget assumptions
closely). The government will always do that," the minister told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government, in due course, may revise
such assumptions based on the new developments and situations.
</P>
<P>
Previously, IMF Deputy Managing Director for Asia and Pacific
Department Anoop Singh said in an interview with Xinhua that the
government of Indonesia must achieve its budget assumptions.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see. And the Indonesian government (
together with the IMF) must try to achieve the budget assumptions
it has set,"Singh said, hoping that the budget will be able to
boost the economic recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talking to reporters shortly after the plenary
session,Sudibyo said "the most important thing is that the budget
reflected people's aspirations, but did not accommodate market
aspirations."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Not to Postpone Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's National Electoral
Commission Chairman Aziz Kasujja has said that the forthcoming
referendum on whether it adopts the multi-party system will not be
postponed as demanded by some political groups.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has not yet decided on the exact date for the
referendum, but the Article 271 of the 1995 Constitution
stipulates that it should be held between June 3 to July 2, or the
last month of the fourth year of the current Parliament, Kasujja
told Thursday's Monitor daily.
</P>
<P>
The Multi-party National Referendum Committee is one of the
groups that want to postpone the vote because several requirements
have not been met.
</P>
<P>
Kasujja said that if the date for the referendum is to be
postponed, the Constitution must be amended first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs
Mayanja Nkangi has disclosed that he would instruct Chief Justice
Wako Wambuzi to select a panel of three High Court judges to set
the referendum questions as stipulated in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the ruling National Resistance
Movement, led by President Yoweri Museveni, would win the
referendum and continue to rule the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices moved lower in Tokyo on
Thursday, dragged down by the yen's strength against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 16.56 points, or 0.08
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 20,065.11.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 6.76 points or 0.39 percent to 1,718.
48.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 801.70 million
shares from Wednesday's 837.28 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Materials was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index fell sharply soon after the opening of the
morning session as the dollar dropped to the 106 yen range,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rebound later lifted the key market gauge into the
plus territory, but volatility in the currency market and the
unwinding of corporate cross-shareholding ahead of March-end book
closings led the Nikkei lower again toward the end of the trading
session, they said.
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 107.42-45 yen, down from
109.11-13 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented high-tech issues were underpinned by
Wednesday's rise in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses were the biggest winners, surging 4.52 percent
as a group due to the high level of trading recently in the Tokyo
stock market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Losers included banks, paper manufacturers and rubber makers.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 712 to 566, with 119 issues remaining unchanged.

<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- British police confirmed on
Thursday morning that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet had
left the secluded estate near London where he has been under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
"Pinochet has now left the estate. The convoy has gone," police
spokesman Pete Long said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet left the house in one of the six cars in the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter hovered overhead as the motorcade, flanked
by four police motorcycle outriders, swept out of the back
entrance of the estate.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear yet where the motorcade are going.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw said earlier that Pinochet
should not be extradited to Spain to face trials of human rights
abuses and that he is free to leave Britain to Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Government said Thursday it would respect Britain's
decision to deny the extradition of Pinochet and planned to take
no further action in the case, reports from Madrid said.

in leading British newspapers Thursday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Germany is preparing to withdraw its choice to lead the
International Monetary Fund and rally round a new European

opposition to a senior German finance official makes his candidacy
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Twenty-seven of the passengers from the hijacked Afghan jet
are being allowed to stay in Britain for the time being despite
having their asylum claims turned down by Home Secretary Jack
Straw.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The first contribution to the growing international effort
to rescue Mozambicans from the worst floods of modern times
arrived in the country Wednesday, but the United Nations warned
that the aid was only a fraction of what was required, with
further floods expected before the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Asylum-seekers will face tougher restrictions on entry to
the United Kingdom under a controversial government plan to
rewrite the international law on refugees.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Premier Calls For Review of Police System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
Thursday called for a review of Japan's police system in the wake
of scandals involving the Niigata prefecture police force.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time has come for us to study the system that is
in place," Obuchi told a meeting of the House of Councilors Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
A study group, including private sector individuals, will
conduct a thorough review of the current police system and
operations, officials sources said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's current system was introduced to prevent the country
from establishing a state police force as it did before the World
War II, and to make it impossible for the cabinet to exercise
direct authority over police.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese police have been under heavy fire since the
revelation that two senior police officers continued to drink and
play mahjong together in late January after hearing that a missing
woman had been found after almost a decade of confinement in
Niigata Prefecture.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian Swimming president
Terry Gathercole on Thursday called for tougher doping control
procedures to be implemented by the sport's world governing body
FINA.
</P>
<P>
FINA criticized Ian Thorpe on Thursday for complaining about
drug testing procedures at last month's Berlin World Cup meet.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe and American world record-holder Lenny Krayzelburg had
claimed the urine sample containers used there were not tamper-
proof.
</P>
<P>
Gathercole told a news conference in Sydney that he would write
to FINA and urge it to upgrade its doping control procedures by
using tamper-proof glass bottles.
</P>
<P>
He added that he thought Thorpe had the right to complain the
procedures as nowadays young athletes have seen many media reports
of a sportsperson's urine sample or food being tampered with.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Taiwan Issue Supported in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A number of well-known people
from various communities in south China's Guangdong Province have
made statements expressing their firm support for the principle
and declaration stated by the central Chinese government in its
recently released white paper on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
They all said that the release of the white paper, titled "The
One China Principle and the Taiwan Issue," which came off the
press on February 21, is of great significance at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Lin Donghai, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of
the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that after the
return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, the Chinese
government once again put forward a white paper on Taiwan, which
demonstrates the government's solemn and just stand and firm
attitude in reunifying China, and expresses the common wish of all
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"As a native of Taiwan living on the Chinese mainland, I hope
compatriots in Taiwan recognize the true face of Lee Teng-hui in
his intention to split the motherland, and understand and support
the principle of 'peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems'", said Lin, who is also vice-chairman of the provincial
committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (
CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Xie Yongxiang, vice-chairman of Guangdong Provincial Committee
of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said he believes
that reunification of China can not be prolonged indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China has built diplomatic relations
with well over 160 countries, and the principle of one China has
been widely accepted and acknowledged by the international
community, so attempts by a handful of separatists in Taiwan to
separate Taiwan from China will never succeed," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Chen Anwen, deputy chief with the Taiwan Affairs Office of
Guangdong Province, said the release of the white paper on Taiwan
came at the right time and clearly showed the orientation for
developing relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of one China is the prerequisite and foundation
for developing relations across the Taiwan Straits. Those who
destroy the prerequisite and foundation should be blamed for
destroying the cross-Straits relations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Other organizations, including the Guangdong Provincial
subcommittee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese
Kuomintang, the provincial Taiwan Compatriots Federation,
Guangdong Provincial Trade Unions, and provincial women and youth
federations also held seminars on the white paper.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua)-- Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao today briefly introduced foreign minister Tang Jiangxuan's
official visit to Russia from February 28 to March 1 at a regular
press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Tang met with Russian Acting President and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and held talks with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on separate occassions.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Putin, Tang presented a letter to the
acting president from President Jiang Zemin, in which Jiang gave
high evaluation on the sound development of the strategic
partnership of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed that Russia would strictly adhere to the

of both countries are critical to the further development and
deepening of such a strategic partnership of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed that a summit meeting will be held this
year, and preparations for the regular meeting between the two
prime minsters would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Ivanov exchanged views on bilateral relations and
important international issues during their talks, and reached
broad consensus, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
They both expressed satisfaction about the fact that China-
Russia relations do not target at a third country, and have
gradually become an important factor in promoting the world's
multi-polarization and the establishment of a just and rational
international order.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that any actions aimed at destroying the
territorial integrity of a country cannot be accepted. Russia
reiterated its "One China" stance, and China reaffirmed its
support to the Russian government's fighting against territorism
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
During Tang's visit, an agreement on the exchange of visits by
citizens of the two countries and an accord on the exemption of
visas for tourist groups were signed, and a press communique was
issueed upon the conclusion of Tang's visit.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Knesset Wednesday signaled it may not support returning
the Golan Heights to Syria, when it approved by 60-53 the
preliminary reading of a Likud bill that would require a special
majority in a referendum for ceding territory.
</P>
<P>
Three coalition parties - Shas, the National Religious Party,
and Yisrael Ba'aliya - voted against the government. United Torah
Judaism joined them.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak scoffed at the vote, saying that no
parliamentary trick will block the will of the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Tension rose Wednesday between One Israel cabinet ministers
and Education Minister Yossi Sarid, from Meretz, in the wake of
Knesset vote on the Syrian referendum bill, which the government
lost.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ruling coalition ministers are convinced that Sarid
will have to compromise and "climb down from the tree he has
climbed" in order to make Barak's life easier.
</P>
<P>
They said Sarid's "obstinate refusal" to grant powers to Deputy
Education Minister Meshulam Nahari, from Shas, had induced Shas to
support the opposition in Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Five South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen and a resident of
the Israeli-occupied security zone, were killed Wednesday morning
in Hezbollah attacks in southern Lebanon. In other incidents during
the day, two civilians and three SLA militiamen were injured.
</P>
<P>
The deaths brought to 12 the number of SLA soldiers killed so
far this year, including its deputy commander Akel Hashem,
assassinated in a bomb blast near his home last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that it sees these attacks as a direct
violation of the Grapes of Wrath Understanding. Both Israel and the
SLA responded by firing at Hezbollah positions.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak is considering giving up Israeli presence at an early-
warning station on Mount Hermon, which was one of Israeli security
arrangement demands in the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
It is revealed that Barak concentrated his efforts to resume
negotiations with Syria via direct telephone conversations between
Jerusalem and Damascus and indirectly via the U.S. channel.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force had expressed its opposition, saying
the target date set by Barak for IDF withdrawal from the security
zone in south Lebanon and the need to withdraw with an agreement in
hand are causing the prime minister to soften his stands in the
talks with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tests Air-to-Sea Missile in War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian armed forces have test-fired
the Fajr (Dawn) air-to-sea missiles in the ongoing "Vahdat (Unity)
78" manoeuvre in the Gulf, spokesman of the war games Rear Admiral
Abdullah Manavi announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Manavi said the missiles were fired on a hypothetical enemy
during the third phase of the military exercises in the Gulf
waters, but he did not give the time and details of the test-
firing.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces on Wednesday successfully test-fired an
improved surface-to-air "Standard" missile built partly by Iranian
experts.
</P>
<P>
Manavi said that in the third phase of the manoeuvre,
scientific, industrial and military projects engineered by naval
experts in cooperation with other scientific and industrial centers
of the armed forces were tested, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the computerized firing guiding system installed on
frigates are to be tested during the manoeuvre while an improved
radar system for reconnaissance planes in the Persian Gulf and the
Gulf of Oman, which have been installed on marine destroyers, are
to be made operational, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said all systems, projects and equipment put into operation
in the war games were designed by researchers of the navy of the
Iranian army and domestic experts.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day military exercises were kicked off on Thursday
jointly by the Iranian Army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC) in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The exercises aim to examine application of modern means in the
Navy hardware including air-to-surface missiles, military sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 vessels, 120 gunboats, 30 choppers, 15 warplanes and
four brigades of naval troops are taking part in the games in an
area of 64,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Manavi said the final phase of the war games will be held on
Friday with participation of the gunmen of the navy forces of the
army and the IRGC as well as other forces involved in the
amphibious operation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes Draft of State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- After nearly a month of debate,
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) Thursday finally passed
the draft of the country's 2000 state budget with some revisions.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session chaired by Deputy House Speaker Tosari
Widjaya, 11 factions in the House agreed to pass the draft of
state budget with several revisions.
</P>
<P>
Based on many considerations, the draft state budget submitted
by the government on January 20 has experienced some changes in
targets of revenue, expenditure, deficit figure and net-financing.
</P>
<P>
Under the new draft, the government revenues are targeted to
reach 152.8 trillion rupiah (21.82 billion U.S. dollars),
increasing from the previous target of 137.69 trillion rupiah (19.
67 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The expenditures are expected to reach 197.03 trillion rupiah(
28.15 billion dollars), up from the previous figure of 183.06
trillion rupiah (26.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"So, budget deficit is expected to be 44.133 trillion rupiah (6.
3 billion dollars) or 4.8 percent of the GDP from the previous
figure 45.373 trillion rupiah (6.48 billion dollars) or 5 percent
of GDP," Chairman of the House budget committee, Sukowalujo
Mintohardjo said.
</P>
<P>
Among the macroeconomic indicators used as the base for the
budget revision for 2000 were an economic growth of 3.8 percent,
an inflation rate of 4.8 to 6 percent, oil price standing at 20 U.
S. dollars per barrel, and rupiah exchange rate of 7,000 rupiah
per U.S. dollars,Mintohardjo added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, target of tax revenues is also increased to 101.436
trillion rupiah (14.49 billion dollars), from 97.7 trillion rupiah
(13.96 billion dollars), while non-tax revenues is 51.45 trillion
rupiah (7.35 billion dollars) from 39.9 trillion rupiah (5.7
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We very appreciate the budget committee of the House for using
its budget right to deliberate the government-sponsored draft of
the state budget," Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo told
reporters after attending plenary session.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the House was able to use its budget right.
It(the House) has played nicely in using its budget right," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The budget is due to be validated by President Abdurrahman
Wahid before taking effect on April 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Names New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
Wednesday announced a new cabinet after dissolving his
nine-month-old cabinet in a surprise move last Sunday, information
from Blantyre said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the former ministers just switched portfolios. Justin
Malewezi stays as Vice-President and Minister of Privatization.
Lilian Patel has become Foreign Affairs Minister and Rodwell
Munyenyembe Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi also appointed eight deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
The only new face is Minister of Finance and Economic Planning
Matthews Chikaonda. Chikaonda has taken the place of Cassim
Chilumpha who took the portfolio of Education, Sports and Culture.
</P>
<P>
Chilumpha was involved in a case under the investigation of the
Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau. The former finance minister was
reeling from negative publicity after he awarded a crucial state
contract to a British company. Chilumpha has denied receiving any
kickbacks from the British company.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Muluzi dismissed his cabinet last week under the
pressure from donors and his ruling United Democratic Front party,
following rampant reports of corruption in high places.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Currency Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rise was attributed to the repayment of foreign currency
loans by domestic financial institutions to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the country's foreign currency reserves has grown
steadily from 48.51 billion dollars in 1998 to 74.05 billion
dollars last year. It reached 76.79 billion dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign currency holding dropped to some 4
billion U.S. dollars when the nation was gripped by a financial
crisis triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions. The country was forced to borrow 58 billion U.S.
dollars from the International Monetary Fund in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Pinochet Can Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
said here Thursday former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should
not be extradited to Spain to face trials of human rights abuses
and that he is free to leave Britain to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Straw also ruled that Britain would not proceed with the
extradition proceedings against Pinochet, a Home Office
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The general could now be on a plane home within hours.
</P>
<P>
Unless there are any further last-minute legal appeals, the
decision brings to an end a 16-month wrangle over the general's
future.
</P>
<P>
In January, Straw said he was "minded" to allow the general to
go free, after medical experts said he was unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
A report made by four independent clinicians said Pinochet, 84,
who had "extensive brain damage," was suffering from memory loss
and had difficulties in expressing himself and understanding
complicated phrases.
</P>
<P>
The decision to halt extradition proceedings is expected to
prompt frantic activity among campaigners on both sides of the
battle.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's supporters will try to whisk the general out of the
country as soon as possible. But campaigners who have fought to
have him extradited may mount another legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for some of the general's alleged victims in Spain
told BBC Radio that the Spanish government would be filing an
appeal to Straw's decision.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London in October 1998 at the request
of a Spanish judge who is seeking to put him on trial for human
rights abuses during his 17-year iron-fist rule in Chile, which
ended in 1990.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks' Deficit Totaled 4.4 Billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean commercial banks
registered a combined deficit of 4.99 trillion won (4.4 billion U.
S. dollars) last year due to bad loans to Daewoo Group, the
Financial Supervisory Service said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The banks originally posted a combined profit of 6.32 trillion
won but had to take out loss provisions of 7.99 trillion won for
heavy exposure to Daewoo Group crisis, and 3.1 trillion won in
accordance with tightened requirements on asset classification.
</P>
<P>
The combined deficit is expected to surpass 5.6 trillion won if
the deficit incurred by Korea First Bank is included. This part is
now transferred to the Korea Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, Seoul Bank had the largest deficit of 2.23
trillion won, followed by Hanvit with 1.98 trillion won, Korea
Exchange 802.8 billion won, Cho Hung 698 billion won, Peace 94.9
billion won, Kwangju 92.5 billion won and Jeonbuk 500 million won.
</P>
<P>
However, nine commercial banks have earned profits.
</P>
<P>
They are Housing and Commercial with a profit of 451.3 billion
won, followed by Hana with 144.8 billion won, Shinhan 113.1
billion won, Kookmin 107.9 billion won, Koram 50.3 billion won,
Daegu 30.8 billion won, Kyongnam 8.7 billion won, Cheju 6.2
billion won and Pusan 5 billion won.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the combined assets of the country's commercial
banks totaled 11.79 trillion won in 1999, up 0.3 percent from the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Pinochet Free to Go Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet will not be extradited on torture charges and is free to
leave Britain, British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of
Senator Pinochet to Spain. I have also decided not to issue
authorities to proceed in respect of the extradition requests from
Switzerland, Belgium and France," Straw said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he believes the general is medically unfit to stand
any trial.
</P>
<P>
That decision cleared the way for Pinochet to return home
immediately. Without any last-minute legal challenges, the retired
general could be on a plane home within hours.
</P>
<P>
Straw made his decision after re-examining a medical report
filed on Pinochet in January. He had said earlier that he was "
minded" to release Pinochet as the medial report suggested the
retired general was too ill to stand any trial.
</P>
<P>
The decision ended a 16-month legal battle by Pinochet to stop
his extradition from London to Spain, where he was to stand trial
on torture charges connected with his 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
Straw's decision to halt extradition proceedings is expected to
prompt frantic activity among campaigners on both sides of the
battle.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's supporters will try to whisk the general out of the
country as soon as possible. But campaigners who have fought to
have him extradited may still yet mount another legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for some of the general's alleged victims in Spain
told BBC Radio 4's Today program that the Spanish Government would
be appealing against the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the Spanish government said Thursday it would respect
Britain's decision to deny the extradition of Pinochet and planned
to take no further action in the case, reports from Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital in October, 1998,
while he was recovering from a minor back operation. At that time,
he was visiting Britain as a VIP guest for the Foreign Office. The
general had strongly supported Britain in its war against
Argentina over the sovereignty of the Malvinas (Falkland) Island.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's arrest was made at the request of a Spanish judge
who is seeking to put him on trial for human rights abuses during
his 17-year rule in Chile.

to evaluate and say whether the Chinese human rights situation has
deteriorated or improved.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government always attaches great importance to its
cooperation with the United Nations high commissioner for human
rights and hopes that the U.N. high commissioner will work with
the Chinese side to further the cooperation on the principles of
objectiveness, equality and mutual respect, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Urges New Anti-corruption Combat (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) recently vowed to establish an effective
preventive mechanism for curbing corruption so as to ferret out
high-ranking corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said the anti-corruption drive this year is
focused on requiring self-discipline among leading officials,
corruption-related criminal cases, and unhealthy tendencies in
some industries and government organs.
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to investigate into cases concerning
officials above the county level and severely crack down on
criminals operating in finance, securities, real estate, land
management, and government purchasing, as well as in judicial
bodies, Wei said in the latest issue of the theoretical magazine
Seeking Truth.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities should also zero in on big-time smugglers,
tax cheats, state-owned enterprise chiefs who violate the law or
recklessly handle state property, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on his fellow workers in the commission to
conscientiously supervise important economic sectors and uncover
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-corruption has an important bearing on the state's future,
especially in the present complicated international and internal
situation," Wei stressed.

<P>
Wei said that procuratorial organs have concluded 130,414
criminal cases and punished 132,447 officials including 4,092 at
the county level, 327 at the prefecture level, and 17 at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Among these officials are Xu Yunhong, former Party secretary of
the city of Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, Hu Changqing, former vice-
governor of Jiangxi Province, and Jin Deqin, former vice president
of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, who
now face punishment for violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the authorities are now attempting to curb
unhealthy tendencies in certain departments and sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the problem of rampant charges on vehicles is now
basically settled, improper burdens on farmers have been greatly
reduced, and excessive charges on enterprises have been abolished.
</P>
<P>
The state has closed 110 illegal pharmacies and 7,594
unauthorized drug producers and traders, and punished violators in
8,745 cases.
</P>
<P>
Military organizations have been ordered to end their
relationships with their branch businesses, and 19,458 of such
businesses have been closed, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei said that corruption is still not fully controlled
and remains widespread in some areas.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that ending corruption will be a long and
arduous work.

</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of Communist Youth League of China, which

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression in 1945, the CPC and the Kuomintang decided during
their negotiations in Chongqing to convene a political
consultative conference and organize a new government.
</P>
<P>
The conference was convened on January 10, 1946 and attended by
representatives of the Kuomintang, the CPC, the Democratic League,
the Youth Party and noted public figures. In November of the same
year, the Kuomintang unilaterally proclaimed the convention of a "
National Assembly" in violation of the resolution of the political
consultative conference and resulted in the dissolution of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The first session of a new political consultative conference
called CPPCC was held in Beijing in September of 1949, functioning
as the supreme state body.
</P>
<P>
The session adopted a "Common Program of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference" which bore the nature of a
temporary constitution, proclaimed the founding of the People's
Republic of China (PRC), elected the committee of the Central
People's Government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman,
and elected the First National Committee of the CPPCC. It also
designated the Chinese capital, national flag and national anthem,
and decided the way of numbering the years.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the National People's Congress, the supreme
institution of state power in China, was established and the CPPCC
then ceased to function on the NPC's behalf. But it has continued
to exist as China's patriotic united front organization with a
broad representation and played a vital role in the country's
political, economic, cultural and social affairs and international
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC has a National Committee and local committees, with a
five-year term for committee members. A plenary session is held
annually.
</P>
<P>
The Third Session of the Ninth National Committee of the CPPCC
is to open in Beijing tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is the Chinese people's patriotic
united front organization, a key institution of multi-party
cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), and a major form to promote
socialist democracy in China's political life.
</P>
<P>
At present, the CPPCC consists of representatives of the CPC
and non-Communist parties, people without party affiliations,
people's organizations, and representatives from ethnic minorities
and from all social strata. In addition, there are compatriots
from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) and from Taiwan, returned
overseas Chinese, and specially invited people.
</P>
<P>
The main functions of the CPPCC are political consultation,
democratic supervision and participation in and deliberation of
state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Political consultation means conferring on major policies of
central and local governments, major policy decisions concerning
the country's political, economic, cultural and social affairs
before the decisions are made, or main issues involved in the
process of carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
Democratic supervision means supervising, by means of offering
suggestions and criticism over the implementation of China's
Constitution, the relevant laws, regulations and major policies,
over the work of state organs and their functionaries.
</P>
<P>
The participation in and deliberation of state affairs means to
organize various parties, organizations, people from various
ethnic groups and social sectors to take part in the country's
political, economic, cultural and social life in varied forms.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is a great creation of the CPC that combines the
Marxist and Leninist united front theory with China's specific
national conditions, and the outcome resultant from the protracted,
united efforts made the CPC, non-Communist parties, people's
organizations, and patriotic personages of all nationalities in
China and all social strata, said Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the CPC Central Committee at a meeting on September 22, 1999 in
celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Achieving unity and democracy under the leadership of the CPC
epitomizes the true character of the CPPCC, explains the formation
and development of the CPPCC and provides a future direction and
mission for the organization.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinians Killed in Clash With Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- At least two armed Palestinians
were killed early Thursday morning when Israeli security forces
stormed an apartment building in Taibeh, an Arab town north of Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The security forces clamped a curfew on the town after the
assaults.
</P>
<P>
The forces besieged the building after they received information
that Palestinian "terrorists" with large quantities of weapons were
hiding inside and preparing explosion devices.
</P>
<P>
An exchange of gunfire erupted and a loud explosion was heard in
the apartment in the ensuing assaults jointly launched by police
and
agents of the Shin Beth internal security service.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians in the building were killed and two others
injured in the clash. One Palestinian was arrested when he was
trying to flee the scene. An Israeli policeman was also injured and
then delivered to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Before they launched the assaults, the police surrounded the
apartment building and ordered residents to evacuate the area.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known where the Israeli security forces
received the information about the Palestinians inside the
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said the Palestinians were residents of the West
Bank who had crossed into the Arab town.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian militant groups like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
carried out a series of bombing attacks in Israel in the last
several years with an aim of derailing the peacemaking between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have warned of a new wave of anti-Israel
terrorist acts stemming from the stalemate since early February in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

<HEADLINE> No Mediator Role for U.S. in Kashmir Issue: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- India on Thursday firmly ruled
out acceptance of any third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue
and asserted that no outside party, including the United States,
would be allowed to play the role of a "mediator or facilitator"
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told Rajya Sabha,
or the upper house, here on Thursday that any intervention,
facilitation or mediation "is not acceptable now or in the future.
"
</P>
<P>
Singh expressed the hope that Washington would recognize the "
new reality" of geo-strategic and political compulsions in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that India would not seek cooperation of
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or any other agency to
combat Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if the U.S. wants to share any information or
launch an attack on terrorism at an international level, India
would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that internationally there was a "greater
understanding" of India's position that Pakistan was sponsoring
terrorism, adding that even the U.S. had stated that there were
ties between Pakistani agencies and terrorists in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an Indo-U.S. joint working group on
terrorism and the U.S. offer to work with India to apprehend
hijackers of the IC-814 flight were clear indications that
Washington appreciated India's view on Pakistan's role in Kashmir,
he added.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has launched
 investigations into claims that two tons of ivory seized at Dubai
Airport last September originated from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The seizure in the United Arab Emirates was one of the largest

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said Wednesday investigations
were being conducted in conjunction with the Customs Department.

<P>
The KWS said that investigations show that since 1997 poaching
has increased five times in the Tsavo area, Kenya's biggest
habitat for elephants.
</P>
<P>
Key culprits in ivory trafficking are diplomats, personnel from
 international organizations and government officials, the paper

<HEADLINE> 80 Percent of Blindness Cases in Kenya Avoidable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 80 percent of a total of
210,000 blindness cases are avoidable in Kenya with a population
of 28 million, a senior health official has said.
</P>
<P>
About 43 percent of avoidable blindness cases are caused by
cataract, the East African Standard newspaper Thursday quoted
Deputy Director of Medical Services Peter Gaturuku as saying.
</P>
<P>
Trachoma causes 19 percent of the avoidable blindness cases and
glaucoma nine percent, said Gaturuku.
</P>
<P>
Gaturuku also blamed the high prevalence of blindness on lack
of ophthalmologists and poor distribution of them.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one ophthalmologist for every one million
Kenyans, most of them are based in Nairobi and provincial
headquarters," said Gaturuku.
</P>
<P>
The target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) is one to
every 250,000 by the year 2020, said Gaturuku, who is also
chairman of the Prevention of Blindness Committee.
</P>
<P>
The WHO predicted that the total of global blindness cases
would increase to 50 million people this century and over 90
percent of these cases will be in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Hopes to Attract Investment From Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has called on the Northern
Ireland Industrial Development Board to explore the trade and
investment potential in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas Biwott
 Wednesday told the visiting Northern Ireland delegation that
Kenya has an abundance of well-trained personnel, the state-run
Kenya Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>

has created a large market in the region which is composed of
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Northern Ireland Industrial Development
Board Bruce Robinson said that his organization would offer
technical assistance to small industries for their investment in
Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Declares Impasse In Talks With Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Co. Wednesday
notified its striking engineers and technical workers that it
considers labor talks at an impasse, and said the company is
tempted to impose an agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a letter faxed to the Society for Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), Boeing chief negotiator Geoff
Stamper said, "the company considers the parties at impasse" after
Boeing's latest offer was rejected.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA attorney Phyllis Rogers said the union, on strike now for
three weeks, would reply to Boeing shortly. He said SPEEA still
wanted to negotiate and would file a National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) complaint charging Boeing with refusal to bargain,
according to reports from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at an afternoon rally, SPEEA Executive Director
Charles Bofferding told about 1,300 union members that the impasse
declaration wouldn't stop the strike.
</P>
<P>
The SPEEA represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers in
Washington, California and Kansas. Workers walked out on February
9 after formal negotiations with federal mediators fell apart.
About 17,000 workers remain on strike.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said an impasse could mean that
Boeing would impose on its workers part or all of its latest
contract offer or the previous contract, which lapsed at year's
end.
</P>
<P>
During three days of talks with the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, Boeing offered on February 26 SPEEA
employees stock options in lieu of guaranteed bonus money and
required SPEEA-covered employees to start paying premiums on their
medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has been running full-page ads in local newspapers
defending its contract offers to SPEEA, which, union leaders say,
lack a bonus and adequate pay raises while curtailing benefits.
</P>
<P>
An average SPEEA engineer earns 63,000 dollars a year, while
technical workers make 45,000 dollars annually on average.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA claims the latest contract offer by Boeing is a step back
from previous offers, and the union plans to file with NLRB as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It could take weeks to rule on the impasse issue and whether
Boeing could impose any terms on SPEEA, said Ray Willms, assistant
to the director of the NLRB's Seattle office. Boeing would also
face limits on the terms it could impose.
</P>
<P>
"When a company implements its last offer, it's not
implementing a contract -- that would have to be agreed between
two parties," Willms said. "It can't impose terms like a no-strike
clause," but it can impose wages.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Announces New Legal Move Against Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A lawyer against former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet said Thursday that he was launching a new
legal attempt to prevent Pinochet from escaping extradition
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Joan Garces, the lawyer, said a Spanish judge was asking
Britain's state prosecutors to file an appeal against any decision
to allow Pinochet to go home on the grounds that he was unfit to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is currently awaiting news of his fate at the
exclusive estate in Wentworth near London where he is under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw was expected to make a "final
decision" at 0800 GMT on whether Pinochet should be extradited to
other country to face trial on human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Straw already said last month that he was "minded" to free the
84-year-old on health ground, rejecting demands by four European
states that he should face a torture trial.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Straw might decide to ask Pinochet to
undergo new medical tests to satisfy his pursuers, but he has
always suggested that he was happy with an original examination
which judged Pinochet unfit to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force's GPS Upgrading Deal Worth 1 Billion Dollars to Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- As the United States Air Force
Wednesday launched a new plan for the upgrading of its global
positioning satellite (GPS) system, Boeing Co., which had won the
original contract in 1996, saw its contract value more than double
to 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The revised plan calls for Boeing to build 12 satellites and
upgrade the GPS ground control network used by the military to
direct aircraft, ships, ground troops and precision-guided weapons,
according to Col. Douglas Loverro, director of the GPS program.
</P>
<P>
Under the original contract won in 1996, Boeing was to build
six GPS satellites and build and operate a ground control system
for the entire GPS network for about 420 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force held options for another 27 satellites. If all
those options were exercised, the total value of the deal would
have been 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the short term the new plan would substantially increase
Boeing's revenue from the GPS program, Loverro said.
</P>
<P>
Additional satellites will be opened to competitive bidding,
said Loverro. Industry analysts predict Lockheed Martin, Orbital
Sciences, Loral Space &AMP; Communications, TRW and Spectrum Astro as
likely bidders.
</P>
<P>
The GPS system, widely used in military operations, is designed
to emit encrypted signals to guide airplanes, ships and troops and
direct smart weapons with new-pinpoint accuracy.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved 35 years of
safe operations of the Chengdu - Lhasa air route on the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, known as the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 35 years, 28,000 flights using Il-18, Boeing 707s,
Boeing 757s and Airbus A340s have safely transported 3.5 million
passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo via Southwest China Airlines
under China's General Administration of Civil Aviation (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Flights from Chengdu to Lhasa, the capitals of Sichuan Province
and the Tibet Autonomous Region respectively, were once considered
among the most difficult in world aviation because of the harsh
and unpredictable weather on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Flights on the route have increased from the original once a
week to nearly 20 flights a week now.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice chairman of the Tibet Regional People's
Government, told Xinhua that this "air bridge," which was
inaugurated on March 1, 1963, has played an important role in the
economic development of Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German afforestation project
along the Yangtze River, serving as a shelter belt, has been
completed after four years of development.
</P>
<P>
The environmental project launched in 1996 involved a total
investment of 104 million yuan (about 12.5 million U.S. dollars),
including 12 million Deutsche marks (about six million U.S.
dollars) granted by the German government.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the project in east China's Anhui Province, a 31,
000 hectares of afforestation belt has been established to control
soil erosion and floods. This is expected to benefit some 620,000
farmers in 480 impoverished villages.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, German officials inspected the
progress of the project three times and were satisfied with what
they saw.
</P>
<P>
Another Sino-German collaborative forestry project, known as "
ecological protection belt", will be launched soon in the southern
part of the province with an investment of 80.04 million yuan,
including 12 million Deutsche marks to be granted by the German
government. This new project is expected to take five years to

YINCHUAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China, reported a steady growth
in foreign trade last year, with import and export volume reaching
237 million U.S. dollars, or 70 percent of Ningxia's total.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports stood at 225 million dollars in 1999, up 8.5
percent from the previous year.

economic cooperation department.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the imports and exports of the city's specialized
foreign trade companies totaled 155 million dollars, and those of
foreign-invested companies, 69.76 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yinchuan mainly exports goods to the United States, Japan,

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
signed a hosting bank agreement with the Xiangcai Securities Co.
Ltd. on stock hypothecation, and a letter of commitment was signed
simultaneously on the acceptance of the first pledge.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such agreement signed between a state-owned
commercial bank and a securities firm.
</P>
<P>
Stock hypothecation refers to securities firms obtaining short-
term loans by pledging the stocks they hold as collateral. These
collateral securities must be A shares or shares in securities
investment funds listed on China's domestic stock markets.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations of the People's Bank of China and the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, the borrowers must be head
offices of securities firms, and the outstanding term of the
capital borrowed through stock hypothecation is six months maximum.
</P>
<P>
CCB Vice President Zhang Enzhao said that stock hypothecation
is new to the bank's credit portfolio, and has emerged as a bridge
between the monetary market and the capital market, which will be
beneficial for the healthy development of both securities firms
and commercial banks.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua)-- Serious Chinese musicians should be
given more support from the government and the media, otherwise,
the country's music will continue to be like snack food: simply

creation of serious music, instead of letting the money trickle
indirectly to the producers of TV galas.

The musicians also criticized the media for their one-sided
fervor for pop music, and said they hope the media will devote

compositions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The First Session of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) was held in Beijing between September 21 and 30,
1949.
</P>
<P>
The session was attended by a total of 662 representatives from
all walks of life and Mao Zedong was elected chairman of the First
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, came into being, and hence the CPPCC
would no longer exercise the power on behalf of the NPC, but it
has continued to exist as an organization of patriotic united
front with the broadest representation.
</P>
<P>
Annual sessions of the CPPCC National Committee have been the
most solemn gathering for political consultation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first sessions of the second, third and fourth CPPCC
national committees were held respectively in 1954, 1959 and 1964,
at which Mao Zedong was elected honorary chairman of the national
committees and Zhou Enlai their chairman.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 1,988 members attended the First Session of the
Fifth CPPCC National Committee, which was held in Beijing from
February 24 to March 8 in 1978. It had been the first of its kind
after the end of the notorious "Great Cultural Revolution"of 1966-
76. Deng Xiaoping was elected chairman of the Fifth CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Sixth CPPCC National Committee was
convened from June 4 to 22 in 1983 in Beijing with 2,039
participants. And Deng Yingchao was elected its chairperson.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh CPPCC National Committee held its first session
between March 24 and April 10, 1988 in Beijing with 2,081
participants. Li Xiannian was elected its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee was
convened in Beijing between March 14 and 27, 1993 in Beijing with
2,093 participants. It elected Li Ruihuan its chairman.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Polish ambassador to Yemen was
kidnapped Wednesday night outside a medical clinic by armed
tribesmen, security officials confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time an ambassador has been kidnapped in
Yemen, where kidnapings of foreigners by tribesmen were common in
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners, mostly westerners, were often used as bargaining
chips by the tribes to squeeze the government or foreign oil
companies to meet their demands. The kidnapped were usually
released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that gunmen of the Khawlan tribe had taken the
ambassador to the al-Yamaniatain region, 50 kilometers east of
Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni police said the tribe kidnaped the envoy to pressure the
government to free a jailed tribesman, adding that government
troops have been sent to the region to seek the release of the
polish official. The polish embassy can not be reached so far for
comment.

<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam holds that the decision of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on the issue
of Vietnamese people staying in refugee camps in Hong Kong is
right and relevant, an official spokeswoman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Phan Thuy Thanh
made the remarks when answering a question about Vietnam's
response to HKSAR authorities' decision on the issue of Vietnamese
People in Hong Kong refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR authorities recently announced that Vietnamese people
who still remain in refugee camps in Hong Kong will be permitted
to reside in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thanh said that "residence permission accorded by the Hong Kong
authorities to the Vietnamese people who are living in refugee
camps in Hong Kong will help those people to stabilize their life
and integrate in the community."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokeswoman noted that "it is important that only
Vietnamese who came to Hong Kong before January 9, 1998 will be
considered for residence. All those who came to Hong Kong after

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Calls for Reconciliation After Religious Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has called on his fellow citizens to follow the line of
"reconciliation for development" in a bid to forestall ethnic and
religious violence in the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
In an emotional televised speech here Wednesday, he urged state
 governors, ministers and National Assembly members to return to
their states or constituencies to "help in the process of binding
the wounds".
</P>
<P>
In the speech broadcast nationwide, he expressed his surprise
at why such havoc could be done last week in Nigeria's northern
city of Kaduna in the name of defending of faith and religion.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that any religion in this day and age can
sanction the taking of innocent life," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Describing the clash between Christians and Moslems over the
introduction of Sharia worst in the country since the civil war in
the late 1960s, he vowed to bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo also assured the foreign investors that the current
crisis is but a hiccup in the country's pilgrim toward stability
and prosperity, which "is not unusual for a nation like Nigeria,
which has been oppressed by its rulers in recent years".
</P>
<P>
The president thanked the Senate for its support by announcing
Tuesday that the executive will be fully supported to deal firmly
and decisively with disturbances in any parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also showed relief that a consensus had been reached between
the country's Moslem north and Christian south during Tuesday's
emergency meeting of the Council of States.
</P>
<P>
The governors of the country's 36 states decided, at the
meeting, that the Moslem-dominated states which had adopted or are
ready to adopt the Islamic law of Sharia should revert to the
penal code in practice before last October, when the northern
State of Zamfara took the lead in applying Sharia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Web Sales Hit 2.8 Billion Dollars for January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers spent 2.8
billion dollars shopping online in January, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the said month, during which retail sales typically slacken,
consumers spent about half as much online as they did for the
entire holiday season, said a new monthly report compiled by the
National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade group, and Forrester
Research, a technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited about the data," said Scott Silverman, NRF
vice president for Internet retailing.
</P>
<P>
The numbers are also consistent with Forrester studies that
show online spending has exploded from 2.4 billion dollars for all
of 1997 to 8 billion dollars in 1998 and 20.2 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Once consumers get engaged in online shopping it tends to
stick," said Seema Williams, a senior retailing analyst for
Forrester Research. "They're shifting more of their spending to
online."
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the numbers reflect the growing presence
of e-commerce and the increasing comfort level of consumers as
they get used to the idea of shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
NRF and Forrester hope the new report, believed to be the first
that tracks only Internet sales, will help identify what consumers
are buying and how much they are spending online.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on the results of 5,000 responses to an
online panel surveyed by Greenfield Online during the first 10
business days of February, showed that consumers spent the most on
airline tickets, nearly 318 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Next, consumers spent the same amount for computer hardware and
books, more than 224 million dollars each. Third on the list was
computer software, for which shoppers forked over 187 million
dollars, closely followed by 182 million dollars spent on apparel.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Increases Exports In the Wake of Asian Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Exporters in Shanghai are doing
well in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, local exports rose to 18.79 billion US dollars, an
increase of 17.7 percent on a yearly basis and 11.6 percent higher
than the national growth rate.
</P>
<P>
And the exports in the year contributed to a more than 10
percent rise in the municipality's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises dealt with nearly 10.35 billion US
dollars of exports in 1999, an increase of 26.7 percent over 1998.
Seventy-seven percent of the total increase of 2.83 billion U.S.
dollars of exports in the year came from those overseas-funded
firms totaling more than 4,000. They are expected to export 11
billion US dollars worth of goods this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 privately-owned enterprises and two hi-tech
enterprises also began exporting last year, which has helped swell
the contingent of exporters.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai exported 3.89 billion US dollars of hi-tech and high
value-added products last year, an increase of 48.7 percent
compared to 1998's figure.

</P>
<P>
Shanghai has adopted a series of measures to help improve local
enterprises and make them more competitive on the international
market. Direct investment to southeast Asia and some developed
countries will be encouraged and marketing networks overseas will
be expanded to make it possible for exporting more local products
such as textiles, household appliances and electro-machinery.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- February was an extremely dry
month over much of the North Island of New Zealand, with no
rainfall at all in some areas of Hawke's Bay.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the National Institute of Weather and
Atmosphere (NIWA) of New Zealand said here Thursday that all of
the North Island received less than half the usual rainfall, with
many North Island regions recording less than a quarter of their
normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall was also below normal in the north and east of the
South Island.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall has produced severe soil moisture deficits
in quite a number of areas across the country, NIWA said.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices Surge in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest rise took the cost of octane 91 gas to 99.9 cents of
the New Zealand dollar (48.8 cents of the U.S. dollar) a liter in
urban centers, up 25 percent on 79.7 cents of the New Zealand
dollar (38.9 cents of the U.S. dollar) a liter last July when
prices first began to rise.
</P>
<P>
Octane 96 now costs 1.04 New Zealand dollars (50.8 cents of the
U.S. dollar) a liter.
</P>
<P>
The upward surge has been caused largely by foreign oil
producers cutting output in a successful attempt to boost revenue.
</P>
<P>
The weakening New Zealand dollar has also been marked as a
contributor to the rising rates.

<HEADLINE> Research Report Foresees Merger And Acquisition Wave in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A merger and acquisition wave is
expected to emerge in China in the next decade and give a big
impetus to economic development, according to a research report
published recently by the Financial and Securities Institution at
the People's University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The report, by Wang Mingfu, Li Fengyun and other experts,
foresees large-scale mergers and acquisitions in China in the ten
years with the development of information technology,
bioengineering and other new industries.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that mergers and acquisitions are presently
underway in many industries with powerful multinationals as major
players. If China joins the World Trade Organization, mergers and
acquisitions will become inevitable as many industries would be
exposed to tougher competition from multinationals.
</P>
<P>
They predict that future mergers and acquisitions will occur
between top enterprises in China involving enormous amounts of
capital.
</P>
<P>
Current barriers to mergers and acquisitions such as obscure
business ownership, cross-debtedness and laid-off workers, will be
resolved in the future, paving the way for Chinese businesses to
enter the international market for mergers and acquisitions and
allow foreign businesses to take bolder steps in mergers and
acquisitions in China.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that mergers and acquisitions are an
important tool for enterprises to expand their market shares or
start new businesses.
</P>
<P>
Through merger and acquisition, more than 190 publicly-listed
companies in China transformed their main business between 1997
and late 1999 from traditional industries to high-tech industries,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the anticipated merger and acquisition
wave will produce China's own giant conglomerates, improve its
industrial structure, optimize the allocation of resources, and
sharpen the competitive edge of the nation's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a comprehensive program aimed at promoting the country as
an eco-tourism destination with emphasis on nature and culture,
the official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation Dharmasiri Senanayake
Wednesday told the paper that under the program, his ministry with
related authorities will propose to introduce new eco-tourism
locations and mechanisms to preserve them, visitor impact,
environment friendly infrastructure facilities and training those
in the industry and launching marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
The program which also aimed to tap Sri Lanka's many
attractions of nature, wildlife, rich cultural and archaeological
heritage, has been planned to meet the target set by the World
Tourism Organization's "The International Eco-tourism Year"
planned for 2002,the Minister stated.
</P>
<P>
He said that eco-tourism is one of the fastest growing niche
segments in the world tourism industry and is surpassing the
hitherto popular sun and sand destinations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has much to offer on eco-tourism lines with its
unique blend of flora and fauna, natural scenic spots, rich
culture and ancient sites over 2500 years, the Minister added.

Deputy Permanent Secretary for Labor and Social Welfare Kirasak

likely to adopt the Japanese unemployment insurance system as a
prototype for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
" The Labor and Social Welfare Ministry through its Social
Security Office has studied unemployment insurance systems
implemented in several countries and has found that that of Japan
appears to be most suitable for Thailand, as the two countries are
both in Asia and have similar problem and conditions", he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan used to have large-scale unemployment during economic
slump, and thus, had had experience in dealing with the problem,
which could be good examples for Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the Japanese government will give financial
support to both employers and employees to avoid layoffs for the
former, or ease difficulties to the latter, which will also help
reduce social burden caused by unemployment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Defence Differences Remain Between Australia,  New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday admitted after his talks with visiting New Zealand
Prime Minister Helen Clark that major defence policy differences
with New Zealand would remain.
</P>
<P>
He said he had indicated to Clark that the Australian
government planned to lift its defence expenditure from the year
after next. However, "The size, shape and disposition of that
expenditure is something that we are yet to determine," he was
quoted by AAP.
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that Australia places a different and higher
priority on the defence association with the United States than
New Zealand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States lifted its military expenditure on a large
scale to pursue its global strategical end after the cold war.
</P>
<P>
Clark has a different stance.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to keep our end up but we have to work out
whether a small country can in the future try to be quite as
ambitious as we have been in the past," She said.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of her first visit to Australia as prime minister,
Clark clarified that "I am of the view myself that the security of
both of us is utterly dependent on the economic prosperity of
South-East Asia. In the end, our security is not guaranteed by our
weapons."
</P>
<P>
It was not what Australia hoped for.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, for a whole host of reasons we would like as
strong as possible defence commitment and provision from New
Zealand," Howard said after their meeting adding that "New Zealand
is a sovereign, independent country, it makes its own decisions
and we accept and respect that."
</P>
<P>
Australian defence analyst Professor Paul Dibb was not so
polite last week when accused New Zealand of being essentially
protected by Australia and becoming an increasing strategic
liability.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Trade Deficit With Russia Soars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's trade deficit with
Russia soared in 1999, contributing to 43 percent of its overall
deficit, the Economics Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's imports from Russia were two percent lower while its
exports to Russia dropped by 46.1 percent, according to statistics
from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade also dropped by 14.6 percent to 1.986 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999 from 2.326 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of bilateral trade last year lowered
Russia's status as a major trading partner of Hungary. Russia last
year became the eighth biggest exporter to Hungary while it was
the in the third place in 1997. In terms of imports from Hungary,
Russia's place slipped from the fifth to the 13th in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the downward trend in bilateral trade between
the two countries is not likely to be reverted in the short term
because of the poor economic situation in Russia.

OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila
Copps introduced an amended National Parks Act into the House of
Commons Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill moves ecological integrity to the top of the park
management agenda, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Canada has a responsibility to encourage
public understanding and enjoyment of our natural heritage so as
to leave it unimpaired for future generations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates strict control of commercial development in
park communities and severe penalties for wildlife poaching and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It was tabled after many of the country's 39 national parks
were reported under siege by ecological stress.
</P>
<P>
Excessive development in the Banff National Park, Alberta, has
put at risk the future survival of the park's bears and wolves.
</P>
<P>
The bill also formally announced the establishment of new
national parks in Northwest Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Newfoundland, British Columbia and Ontario.

<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan have agreed to
take measures against the recent U.S. safeguard on steel pipelines,
South Korean Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry officials said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have decided to exchange opinions in mid-
March in Japan and bring the case to the attention of the World

Japan has accepted South Korea's request to act as a third

<P>
In return, South Korea will act as a third party in Japan's WTO

<P>
The two nations also hope to join hands with the European Union
on the matter.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Exports to Developed Countries Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea exported more to
developed countries last year than it did to developing countries,
the first time in five years, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports to developed countries accounted for 50.7 percent of
the country's total and those to developing countries made up 49.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports to developing countries took up 49.2 percent in 1994,
50.1 percent in 1995, 55.8 percent in 1996 and hit a peak of 55.9
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports from developing countries grew steadily from
32.5 percent in 1994, to 34.4 percent in 1996, 38.3 percent in
1998 and 40.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Korea's trade surplus with developing
countries began to decline, dropping to 22.16 billion U.S. dollars
last year from 32.85 billion the previous year, as exports last
year rose by only 3.4 percent while imports increased by 36.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea had a trade deficit with Middle East countries
which increased to 8.25 billion dollars last year from 4.78
billion in 1998 owing to higher oil prices.

VIENNA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Airlines AUA announced
Wednesday that it would resume flights to Belgrade on March 26,
following the lifting of the European Union's air embargo against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
All Western countries' airlines, including the AUA, suspended
their service to the Yugoslav capital after the EU imposed an
embargo in March 1999, weeks before NATO launched a massive air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed on February 14 to lift the embargo
for six months. On Tuesday, an EU Council spokesman confirmed the
EU's formal decision to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU officials said they would keep up political and
financial pressure on Belgrade and more Yugoslav officials and
businessmen would be added to the travel ban list.
</P>
<P>
Swiss airlines and Germany's Lufthansa airlines have also
decided to resume flights to Belgrade in March while Yugoslavia's
national flag carrier JAT resumed its round-trip flights to the
Swiss city of Zurich on February 22.
</P>
<P>
The AUA will have a daily round-trip flight to Belgrade from
Vienna from Monday to Friday as of March 26.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua)-- Xie Yang, deputy director of the
Agricultural Department attached to the State Council Development
Research Center, has said China would strive to develop townships
to take in a 100 million surplus rural labor force, which will
grow from 120 million to 180 million in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a senior seminar on rural employment held recently in
the Chinese capital, Xie suggested China restrict the increased
number of new townships to no more than 450 a year. He also urged
extending the area of each township from the present 0.3 square
kilometers to one square kilometers on average.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to Xie, expanding the each square kilometer
township space will require approximately 100 million yuan (12
million US dollars).

Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (NCCIM), in cooperation with the
Association for Overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS), Japan, the
Kansai Economic Federation and the Pacific Resource Exchange

Mahathir hoped that with Japan's economy demonstrating concrete
signs of recovery, Japanese companies will assist the Southeast
Asian manufacturers by increasing imports into the Japanese market.

<P>
He said that with globalization and the information technology
revolution underway, emerging economies have to meet the great
need for capacity building in terms of human resources.

"The challenge of K-economy (knowledge-economy), which is
driven overwhelmingly by information and technical know-how that
confronts Malaysia and other ASEAN economies, must be met head-on
if we are to remain competitive," Mahathir said.
</P>

He said that "only with K-economy in place, can these countries
enhance their capability for value added productivity."
</P>

He expressed his belief that Kankeiren and PREX can indeed play
a positive role in helping transform the ASEAN economies into
knowledge-propelled economies.

Development in the 21st Century -- Contributing to the sustainable

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Parties Urge Opposition to Join Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the 12 parties, there are three parties from the ruling
People's Alliance (PA) coalition, two Muslim parties and three
parties of minority Tamils as well as four other small parties.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of these parties said there should be a bipartisan
consensus between the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
and the PA for the resolution of the war, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The UNP and the PA are Sri Lanka's two largest parties.
</P>
<P>
Political rivalries between the two parties have prolonged the
ethnic civil war between the majority Sinhalese-dominated
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who demand a separate
state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The PA government has been trying to gather support for its
constitutional reform proposals since January.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reform is needed to devolve powers to
regional councils in a bid to end Tamil Tiger rebels' separatist
war which had engulfed the nation since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts got a huge boost as Wickremesinghe
made a surprise U-turn in January and pledged support to the
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition leader backed down from his pledge last
Saturday. He said in a letter to President Kumaratunga that the
government must first hold talks with rebels and then work out a
reform plan to end the civil war.

The trans-Atlantic dispute was caused by the union's move to
rule against the use of aging planes fitted with mufflers to
reduce noise. The Europeans believe the mufflers cannot reduce
noise sufficiently and merely prolong the life of old aircraft
that should be taken out of service.
</P>
<P>
The EU drafted a law which bans all non-EU aircraft with noise-
reducing devices from European airports by 2002. In response, the
Americans were considering filing a complaint against the union
with the International Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The EU agreed later to suspend the law, which was expected to
be implemented in May, pending guarantees that the United States
would work together with Europe on more stringent noise standards
over the next 12 months, within the framework of the International
Civil Aviation Organization.

<HEADLINE> EU Military Mechanism Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors from 15 member states
of the European Union (EU) met here Wednesday for the first
meeting of the political committee of the European Security and
Defense Identity (ESDI).
</P>
<P>
The political committee and an ESDI military committee, which
were both set up by EU foreign ministers on February 14, will
serve as the interim institutions until a permanent NATO-like
defense mechanism is established.
</P>
<P>
The political committee, staffed by senior or ambassadorial
officials from EU member states, poses recommendations on the
future functions of the ESDI while the military committee,
composed of EU military experts and scheduled to meet for the
first time on March 7, will form the nucleus of the future
military command.
</P>
<P>
The two committees are led by Javier Solana, former secretary
general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, defense ministers from the EU member states
endorsed in Sintra, Portugal, a timetable for creating a rapid
reaction force of 50,000-60,000 troops with the capability of
being deployed within 60 days of notice.
</P>
<P>
According to EU officials, the force will serve not only as
defenders of the EU territory, but also as peacekeepers beyond the
EU borders.
</P>
<P>
A fund-raising conference for the ESDI force will be held late
this year. EU defense ministers acknowledged that the success of a
credible ESDI would hinge on adequate funding.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard has proposed that EU
governments dedicate at least 0.7 percent of their gross national
product to the ESDI.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) - Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill
Gates and his wife will donate 350 million dollars to improve U.S.
education, the foundation said in a news release on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will spend
350 million dollars over the next three years on education
programs, of which 250 million dollars will go to projects in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
"Bill and Melinda want to help improve all people's lives and
firmly believe all students can achieve," foundation spokesman
Trevor Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
The grants will primarily help teachers, students and
administrators use technology to improve learning, Neilson said,
adding that the money would be divided into four programs - one of
them national, the other three in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million dollars will be spent on forming a national
leadership program providing funding to every school district in
the country, Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
Money for programs with a Washington state focus includes
grants worth 150 million dollars aimed at helping a specific
school district perform better, 30 million dollars available for a
model school program, 70 million for a teacher leadership project.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Leaves for European Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
left here Thursday morning for a 10-day trip which will take him
to Italy, the Vatican, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kim's European tour is aimed at providing new momentum to
enhancing ties between South Korea and the European continent
before Seoul hosts the summit of Asian and European states in
October this year.
</P>
<P>
"The president wants to strengthen relations with Europe, which
is becoming an increasingly important partner for us in terms of
politics, security and economy," said Hwang Won-tak, Kim's chief
foreign policy advisor.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said that issues of economy and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) will top the agenda of the president's
meetings with the leaders of the European countries.
</P>
<P>
The European tour is expected to expedite the EU nations'
forging of diplomatic ties with the DPRK, which Kim believes is
vital to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, Hwang
said.
</P>
<P>
European nations are engaged in political dialogue with the
DPRK and Italy recently established full diplomatic relations with
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
At forthcoming meetings with leaders of the European states,
Kim is to re-emphasize his engagement policy toward Pyongyang and
seek European support in getting Pyongyang to resume dialogue with
Seoul and open up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the South Korean president will propose the
construction of an information super highway linking South Korea
and European countries, said the presidential advisor.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European Union, which has invested 6.26 billion U.
S. dollars in South Korea, is the largest investor in the country
compared with 3.75 billion dollars by the United States and 1.75
billion dollars by Japan.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between South Korea and the EU registered 29.
65 billion dollars last November, while the EU is South Korea's
second-largest export market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What's Wrong With Philippine Stocks? by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The worst of a regional financial
crisis is already over, but the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (
Phisix) have been hovering around 1,670 points in recent days, the
lowest since November 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Why does the Philippines appear to be losing out in the contest
to attract foreign investments?
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday that the
Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), a private self-regulatory body of
the stock brokers, must be revamped to revive investor's
confidence in the troubled capital market.
</P>
<P>
Changes in PSE management must accompany a forthcoming shakeup
in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) "because not only
local funders but also foreign funders seem to have lost
confidence (in the stock market)," the president claimed.
</P>
<P>
If the president's conclusion proves correct, the investors may
soon restore confidence in the Philippine stock market, since SEC
Chairman Perfecto Yasay is set to resign on March 25 and the
resignation will trigger a revamp.
</P>
<P>
However, local businessmen blamed the so-called cronyism of the
government leaders for the market tumble.
</P>
<P>
In January, Yasay alleged before a senate committee that
Estrada told him on the phone to exonerate businessman Dante Tan,
a friend of the president. Tan was among those being investigated
by the SEC for possible stock manipulation in the trading of the
Best World (BW) Resources Corp., whose stock went on a wild roller-
coaster ride last year.
</P>
<P>
Although President Estrada immediately dismissed the charge,
the allegation aroused strong reactions. Local investors blamed
charges of cronyism for the weak confidence in the Philippine
economy by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix has fallen 23.4 percent so far this year after
foreign investors dumped close to 5 billion peso (120 million U.S.
dollars) worth of shares last month.
</P>
<P>
PSE data indicated that foreign investors were net sellers in
18 of the 20 trading days in February. The biggest sell-down
occurred on February 21, a week after the release of the PSE
investigation report on BW, when foreign investors were net
sellers of 678 million pesos (17 million dollars) worth of shares.
</P>
<P>
Xen Gladstone, head of research for ING Baring in Manila,
predicted that the Phisix was likely to fall to the 1,500 points
level before investors re-assess values.
</P>
<P>
What is really wrong with the Philippine stocks?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that as economic reform bills stagnate in the
congress, charges of cronyism hound the Estrada administration,
and the central bank may raise interest rates, the Philippine
stock index become the worst performer in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Actually, foreign investors has been disappointed with the
Philippine economy since late last year, as its performance was
not as good as they have expected.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was least affected by the regional financial
crisis compared with its neighbors, but Phisix ended last year 8.8
percent up, the region's worst performer, and the nation's gross
domestic product was an unremarkable 3.2 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Forecast for this year's growth put the Philippines lowest in
Asia with a 3.5 percent rise by the Merrill Lynch Securities
Philippines, while Thailand is estimated to rise by 4.1 percent,
Indonesia 5 percent, Malaysia 5.6 percent and South Korea 6.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors attributed the slow pace of economic reforms
by the government to the weak recovery in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Critics once said that Estrada's inability to push economic
liberalization bills through the congress, mismanagement of the
budget deficit and a coterie of advisers who seem more powerful
than the cabinet have contributed to the malaise.
</P>
<P>
To restore investors confidence in the Philippines, President
Estrada recently reshuffled his cabinet, dismissed all his
advisers who did not have formal duties and functions, and formed
a high-profile executive committee to help set economic policies.
Further changes in the cabinet are also expected.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that despite the great efforts by the
president, investors' confidence in the Philippines is unlikely to
be restored soon if no substantial reform measures will be adopted
by the government.

<HEADLINE> Internet Sports Commerce Seen to Expand in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- American consumers are
expected to spend approximately 3 billion U.S. dollars in sporting
goods, apparel, footwear and even tickets online in 2003,
according to a new research unveiled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other Internet industries suffering large-scale
cannibalization of traditional revenues and audiences, sports
content actually presents an incremental business opportunity,
said U.S. Internet commerce research firm Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
"Sports content providers will reap incremental revenues as the
Internet continues to exist as a complementary channel and medium,
" Jupiter said.
</P>
<P>
With the Internet, sports leagues and organizations can
diversify revenues through paid content, licensing, syndication,
advertising and commerce, it added.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that online purchase of sports event tickets
will represent one-third of the predicted 3-billion-dollar U.S.
market in 2003. In addition, practical convergent programming will
flourish in sports media.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier study by U.S. research firm Forrester
Research, more than 22 percent of the households in North America
actively follow sports on the Web. By 2004, advertising on sport-
related Web sites is expected to reach 2.4 billion dollars, with
sports-related e-commerce climbing to 4.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges World to Do More for Victims of Africa's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Wednesday called on the international community to step
up emergency relief for flood-ravaged African countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the governments of the world are going to help, the time is
now, not tomorrow or the next day," UNICEF Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said in a statement released here. "The people of
southern Africa are in desperate straits and cannot hang on much
longer."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that thousands of people were still literally
hanging on to treetops, rooftops, and bushy outcroppings with
flood waters swirling around them.
</P>
<P>
There has been a notable shortage of helicopters to carry out
rescue and delivery operations in isolated areas, although
additional machinery has been arriving in recent days, according
to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
"The people and governments in this flood-affected region are
doing their utmost to survive and prevail, but they need our help,
" Bellamy said. "Rescuing the distressed, reaching out to the
displaced, giving hope to the despondent are all within our power.
It is our moral obligation."
</P>
<P>
Of the flood-ravaged countries of Mozambique, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Madagascar, the UNICEF chief toured
Mozambique and witnessed the devastation wrought by the region's
worst flooding in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF estimated that 800,000 to 1 million people have lost
their homes throughout the region and are now in need of urgent
humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations flash appeal is seeking approximately 14
million U.S. dollars for Mozambique alone. Appeals for other
countries are being finalized pending ongoing assessment missions.

However, Eurostat reported a drop of jobless rates in most EU
countries in 1999 as a whole, with the Netherlands, Ireland and
Sweden leading on the downward path with decreases in December
from 3.4 percent to 2.7 percent, from 7.1 percent to 5.8 percent
and from 7.7 percent to 6.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau estimated that around 12.3 million men
and women were unemployed in the 11-nation euro zone while the
unemployed numbered 15 million in the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat reported good news for young people in both the euro
zone and the EU.
</P>
<P>
It said the jobless rate among those under the age of 25 was 16.
9 percent in the EU and 18.2 percent in the euro zone in January

<HEADLINE> Private Sector in Chongqing Employ More Than State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- There are now more employees in
private-owned businesses than state-owned enterprises in Chongqing,
China's fourth and newest municipality in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 1.5 million people were employed in
the private sector by the end of October last year, 270,000 more
than those in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the private sector has been a top priority for
Chongqing since it became a municipality in 1997. Restructuring
inefficient state-owned enterprises and shedding a surfeit of
employees has also greatly contributed to a booming private sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 25,000 private businesses reported a total sales
income of 47.94 billion yuan (more than 5.7 billion U.S. dollars).
They also paid 1.08-billion-yuan (over 130 million U.S. dollars)
in taxes, accounting for 13 percent of the total tax revenue of
the municipality.

<HEADLINE> Ship Wreckage to Be Removed from Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The remaining seven of 18 ships,
deliberately sunk in the Yangtze River to create a defense line
during the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945), will be salvaged from
the River.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Yangtze Navigation Administration (YNA) said
that relevant departments have worked an overall plan to lift the
sunk ship as well as removing the mines around the ships.
</P>
<P>
Some one hundred wooden boats were also sunk along the Yangtze
River in Madang County, Hubei Province, to build a series of
underwater fortresses by Chinese Nationalist troops to prevent the
Japanese from making further inroads along the Yangtze. There were
39 mines placed along these fortresses.
</P>
<P>
However, these fortresses continue to be a unseen barrier for
other ships and vessels. The government salvage work started as
early as 1956. Since then, 11 ship have been salvaged. It will
take another two years to salvage the remaining seven.
</P>
<P>
YNA said the clean-up operations can only be carried out during
low water levels in winter and spring.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General-Appointed Doctors to Examine  Soeharto Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The medical team has reported to Attorney General (Marzuki
Darusman) that it has finished studying medical report (issued by
Soeharto's medical team) and that the examination will be
conducted this week," The Attorney General's Office spokesman
Soehandoyo was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
When asked to specify the date, Soehandoyo said: "The medical
team is still discussing the matter with the prosecutors."
</P>
<P>
Marzuki earlier said that direct examination on Soeharto was
aimed at ending speculation about the former ruler's health.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said last week that the state-appointed team of doctors
was scheduled to examine Soeharto at his home on Monday. However,
the doctors failed to appear at Soeharto's residence on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been named a suspect by the Attorney General's
Office in a probe into alleged corruption during his 32-year-rule.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyers have repeatedly argued that their client is
medically unfit to undergo questioning.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the 78-year-old Soeharto failed to answer a
summons at the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Abdurrahman Wahid said Wednesday that he
is willing to meet with Soeharto if the former President's family
gives him permission.
</P>
<P>
"I actually did make a request to meet with Soeharto sometime
ago but his family said that the meeting should be delayed because
he is still emotional and they are afraid the meeting could worsen
his condition," Wahid was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
When pressed to name the person who had interceded for Soeharto,
the president said that it was Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti
Hardijanti Rukmana.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business magazine Forbes last year estimated Soeharto's
family fortune at some 4 billion U.S. dollars. Time magazine, also
from U.S.,has put the figure at about 15 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Asks Vice-President to Play Significant Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Wednesday emphasized his determination to give Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputri a significant role in government.
</P>
<P>
"I need to emphasize here that in the Cabinet, I pointed out
that Vice President Megawati also functions as prime minister, I
say again she also acts (as prime minister)," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Megawati was constantly involved in the
decision making process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he also conveyed his wish for Megawati's
involvement directly to the Cabinet so there would be no
apprehension from the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Wahid conceded that due to his failing eyesight, Megawati
practically leads most of Cabinet meetings already.
</P>
<P>
"She asks and raise issues directly with the ministers during
the Cabinet meeting. You know why? Because as you yourself know, I
cannot see, therefore I do not know much about details," the
president was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since their election in October last year, Wahid has made it
clear that he would stray from tradition and empower the vice
president with more responsibility rather than just being a
figurehead.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that his remarks were also a reaction
to suggestions from several legislators of the need for him to
appoint a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that his comments would likely spark debate on the
Constitutional validity of a prime minister, Wahid quickly
remarked that people should not get into a legal wrangle over it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Suspect Escapes From Colombian Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. drug suspect
wanted for extradition by his country escaped Wednesday from a
prison in Colombia by hiding inside an old mattress, prison
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, James Springette, disappeared around 10 a.m. (1500
GMT) from Santafe de Bogota's La Picota prison.
</P>
<P>
He asked for a new mattress and it was delivered. When the old
one was taken out, he was apparently wrapped up inside.
</P>
<P>
He managed to pass through several checkpoints of this maximum
security prison without being detected.
</P>
<P>
Springette, 39, was arrested by Colombian security police in
Medellin in February 1999 and imprisoned in La Picota prison while
waiting for possible extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Springette had been condemned in the United States to life
imprisonment on charges of cocaine smuggling and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The La Picota penitentiary is the place where Miguel and
Gilberto Roderiguez-Orejuela are detained. The brothers were
leaders of the once all-powerful Cali cocaine cartel.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Foreign Minister to Visit Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Austria's new Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner will make her first visit to Switzerland
next week, the Swiss Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the mainstream conservative
Austrian People's Party, is scheduled to visit the Swiss capital
of Berne on March 8 where she will hold talks with her Swiss
counterpart Joseph Deiss.
</P>
<P>
News of Ferrero-Waldner's planned visit came just hours after
Switzerland's first reaction to the resignation of Joerg Haider on
Monday as leader of Austria's far right Freedom Party. Deiss
welcomed his resignation as a positive gesture towards Austria's
European partners.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 fellow European Union members froze bilateral ties
with Vienna over the entry of Haider's party in the government.
But Switzerland, which is not a EU member, has steered clear of
such moves, preferring to judge the new government on its actions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Swiss government spokesman confirmed that Austrian
Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel wanted to pay an official visit to
Switzerland and would be made welcome. The spokesman said no date
had been set for the visit but that it was hoped it would take
place soon.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd Threatens to Take Legal Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former Davis Cup
captain David Lloyd threatened on Tuesday to take legal action
against the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) for slander after he was
sacked for allegedly affecting team morale.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, Lloyd, who was replaced on Monday
by former Wimbledon semifinalist Roger Taylor after publicly
criticising two of his players, said: "That is a direct slander on
my character and future. They said my team had no spirit and no
morale."
</P>
<P>
"I will not stand by and let people make incorrect accusations.
</P>
<P>
"As far I am concerned we had fantastic team spirit and
fantastic team morale and that what's my future in life is all
about.
</P>
<P>
"If that's been put into jeopardy then I will take action.There
are no two ways about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Britain had been beaten 4-1 by the Czech Republic in
their world group tie this month, Lloyd said second string players
Arvind Parmar and Jamie Delgado were not fit enough to compete at
international level.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was the LTA's job to deliver players to him in
a fit condition.
</P>
<P>
LTA chief executive John Crowther said on Monday Lloyd had been
dismissed for his public criticism of the team and "the
unncecessary adverse affect these had on players and coaches
connected to the Davis Cup squad".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Crowther said former British number one Jeremy Bates
would coach the Davis Cup squad under Taylor's guidance.
</P>
<P>
"I can announce this morning that Jeremy Bates has been asked
by Roger to be the coach," Crowther said. "We are going to have
great team spirit and we are going to build on it from now."
</P>
<P>
Bates, 37, was consistently ranked as Britain's number one from
1988 to 1994 when he retired from international tennis.
</P>
<P>
He won the Wimbledon mixed doubles with Jo Durie in 1987 and
reached the final 16 in the men's singles in 1992.

<HEADLINE> China Encloses Northern Nature Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ma Weiyi, a herdsman from the Hui
ethnic group, left the hill where he has been living for nearly 70
years together with his family and their cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
The hill where the Mas have settled down for decades is part of
the Mount Helan Nature Reserves in north China between the Inner
Mongolian Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Reserves had been enclosed as of the end of 1999,
prohibiting hunting, herding, logging or human activities, for
environmental and ecological protection, according to an order of
the Alxa prefecture government.
</P>
<P>
No matter how Ma was reluctant to leave, he still applauded the
government's decision. "It is high time the Mountain and the
reserves got a rest," said Ma, adding that otherwise the previous
lush green mountains could possibly turn into infertile and arid
land in the future.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 70 households of herdsmen and over 50,000 heads
of livestock have moved away from the reserves and the local
government had set aside some three million yuan (about 361,500 U.
S. dollars) to help the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Mount Helan, with a forest coverage of 240 square kilometers,
serves as a natural shield preventing both western desert and cold
waves from moving eastward. The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region
has established the Mount Helan Nature Reserves in 1980, which was
listed as a national nature reserves with approval of the State
Council in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ship Auctioned To Pay Crew Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese maritime tribunal has
auctioned a ship registered in the country of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines after the company owners failed to pay its crew
salaries.
</P>
<P>
 In September 1996, 28 Chinese crew were sent to work for the
cargo ship M/V Big Angle, anchored in east China's Qingdao port.
The ship is owned by the Jinxing shipping company in northeast
China's Dalian port.
</P>
<P>
 On June 14 last year, the ship sailed to Port Said, Egypt,
but could not pay the necessary tolls for passing through the Suez
Canal as well as water and fuel. The stranded crew sent faxes to
Jinxing company pleading for financial help. On September 19, oil
supplies dried up and electricity was cut off.
</P>
<P>
The crew only ate two meals a day. The Qingdao Maritime
Tribunal helped them return to China, arriving at Qingdao port on
November 13.
</P>
<P>
The crew, who has been stranded for five months without any
remuneration from Jinxing, sued the company, requesting the court
to auction the ship to pay for outstanding wages.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the Jinxing company to pay 1.5 million U.S.
dollars in sureties but the company refused. The court finally
sold the ship to an ocean-shipping company in Fujian province,
east China, at a public auction for 2.2 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Exploded at Philippine Govt Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Suspected urban terrorists fired a
grenade launcher at the mainbuilding of the Department of Energy (
DOE)early Thursday morning but no one was injured , police said.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Aglipay, national capital region's police director,
said three of the suspects on board a red box-type car targeted
with a M203 fragmented grenade at the DOE building located in the
southern Manila suburb at about 3:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The explosion badly damaged the second floor while the outside
building structures of the first floor were hit by sharpness.
</P>
<P>
Aglipay said a leftist faction "belonging to the Alex Boncayao
Brigade called up a radio station, claiming it was responsible".
</P>
<P>
He noted that he has already deployed more policemen in other
possible target areas like petroleum companies which previously
received threats from sectors against the recent oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
"This is a cowardly act. They should talk to us peacefully to
resolve any problem, without resorting to this useless terroristic
act," said Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui.
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosion was the second blast to rock Metro
Manila since Wednesday night when two persons were wounded in
their legs after a grenade lobbed by an unknown man exploded under
a black car.
</P>
<P>
No suspects claimed responsibility in the first explosion.
</P>
<P>
The two blasts followed the series of bombings which took place
in the southern island of Mindanao and killed some 40 people.
</P>
<P>
The government suspected the leftist and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels, who forged a tactical alliance, to
be behind the Mindanao bombings.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, however, denied responsibility, claiming that the
military plotted all the bombings to justify launching of a coup d
'etat against the present government of President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Some senators and other government officials recently expressed
fear that the violent incidents in Mindanao might reach the
metropolis.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan reiterated
on Wednesday that Iraq will not accept the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1284, signaling that Iraq will not allow the U.N. arms

In a speech delivered at a pilgrims reception center near the

saying that it was just aimed at prolonging the decade-long
sanctions imposed on Iraq and keeping Iraq under the colonial
control by the U.S. and Britain, the Iraqi News Agency reported.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday
voted 420-0 to accept the Senate version of a bill aimed at
strengthening sanctions against Iran, which claims would punish
any other countries, especially Russia, which transfers weapons
technology to Teheran.
</P>
<P>
The bill would add pressure on President Bill Clinton to sign
it into law at a time when the administration was trying to
improve relations with Iran after its parliamentary elections,
which Washington sees a victory for reformists.
</P>
<P>
The White House threatened to veto the bill after the Senate
voted 98-0 the bill on February 24, saying the new measure against
Iran and other countries like Russia was unneeded and only

It also accused the Russian authorities of human rights violations

The U.S. State Department "used unreliable, specially selected
information about the federal action in Chechnya," the Russian

MOSCOW -- The Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
Wednesday that the political phase of Russia's anti-terrorist
campaign in the breakaway republic of Chechnya had started since
Russian troops Tuesday liberated the town of Shatoi, some 60 km
south of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Shatoi, located in the center of the Argun gorge at the
foothills of south Chechen mountains, was the last fortress held
by the rebel remnants after they escaped from Grozny into the
mountains in late February.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Security Council (the top security policy agency of
the country) decided to launch the political progress in Chechnya
at its latest session, said the Russian presidential aide, noting
that the previous military phase "could only be a precondition for
the political resolution to the Chechen issue, which is the most
important goal." (Russia-Chechnya)

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade in the South
American trade bloc Mercosur decreased to 97 billion U.S. dollars
in 1999 from 108 billion in 1998, Osvaldo Douat, vice president of

Brazil registered a trade deficit of 448 million dollars with

LIMA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign visitors to Peru almost
quintupled from 200,000 in 1992 to 940,000 in 1999, authorities
said Wednesday.

The World Tourism Organization in its account on the tourist

sixth place in 1998.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Considers Delay of Europe Matches for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Key European Champions League and
UEFA Cup matches in September are likely to be postponed to allow
players to take part in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The proposal surfaced during a 90-minute meeting between IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and
other top soccer officials.
</P>
<P>
In return, Samaranch indicated that to improve the quality of
soccer at the Olympics, he would discuss the possibility of moving
forward the 2004 Athens Olympics to July from August to avoid
clashes with club soccer fixtures.
</P>
<P>
IOC has concern about the release of players by clubs of the
qualified nations. In many regions in particular in Europe,
international club competitions will have already begun by the
time the Olympic tournament starts in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Blatter indicated that while FIFA wanted to try to meet the
concerns of the IOC for the Sydney Olympics, it was up to the
Olympic movement to make concessions to soccer in 2004.
</P>
<P>
He said if the Athens Games, projected August 13-29, 2004,
could be moved forward to late July before the start of the
European league season, this would "open new horizons" for soccer
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC and FIFA have long been at odds over the role of soccer
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch has wanted to make the Olympic soccer tournament one
of the major international events. He reportedly wants fewer
restrictions on who can participate in this year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, FIFA has essentially made the Olympic tournament an
under-23 event, although in 1996, three players without
restrictions, that is over-age players, were allowed.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has insisted on the restrictions, being wary about
creating a rival to the World Cup in terms of importance.
Eligibility rules for the Sydney Games are unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Huge Geothermal Field Discovered in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A large geothermal field was
recently discovered around the Chongqing city proper, in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have found over 40 hot water spots, half of which
are hot springs.
</P>
<P>
According to local residents, a dozen of hot springs emerged
during a miner earthquake in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The largest hot spring in Chongqing turns out 27,575 cubic
meters of water a day with the temperature averaging 74 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Li Yusheng, a senior engineer of Nanjiang Hydrological Team,
predicts that the geothermal energy reserve on some 10,000 square
kilometers of land in Chongqing can be exploited, several times
bigger than that in Beijing and Tianjin. The heat storage of the
geothermal field is larger than that of the coal reserve in
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Local hot springs now produces 100,000 cubic meters of water a
day, equivalent to the heat produced by 1 million tons of standard
coal annually, he added.

<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea will have to wait more than a fortnight before they know
if they will be punished by UEFA for the behaviour of their
supporters in Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
Reports from referee Rune Pedersen and UEFA delegate Sandor
Berzi will be considered by the disciplinary committee when they
next meet on Friday, March 17.
</P>
<P>
UEFA chiefs will also examine a report from Marseilles police
on their version of events in and around the Stade Velodrome.
</P>
<P>
"All these reports are going to be taken into consideration and
the disciplinary body will judge what to do," said a UEFA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
By the time a decision is made, Chelsea will have only one game
left in the Champions' League Group D, at home to Lazio but they
may need to win after losing in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
The trip to France turned into a gloomy night for the Londoners
as Gianluca Vialli's team were beaten by a first-half strike from
Robert Pires and trouble flared between English fans and police on
the terraces.
</P>
<P>
Some travelling fans thought the police had reacted heavy-
handedly. They said coins, cans and a flare had been thrown into
the Chelsea enclosure by Olympique Marseille fans but nothing had
been done to stop the barrage.
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses, however, were certain a hooligan element had
infiltrated genuine Chelsea supporters and triggered the violence.
</P>
<P>
The London club has suffered in the past from hooligan gangs
who associated themselves with the club to wreak havoc at home and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Man United Have No Plans for Beckham Contract Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United are not going to rush into offering David Beckham a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that United want to open negotiations to
test Beckham's long-term commitment to the club and are ready to
table a two-year extension worth 40,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
If Beckham is unwilling to sign, it has been suggested that the
club will cash in this summer on the England midfielder, who has
been linked with moves to Arsenal, Spain and Italy, in a transfer
worth at least 20 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
However sources inside Old Trafford said the club have not held
contract talks with the 24-year-old and have no plans to do so in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's current five-year agreement does not expire until
2003 and the club have no plans to review his contract until the
summer of 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's future at United is under scrutiny following his
recent bust-up with boss Sir Alex Ferguson, who is becoming
increasingly worried by his prodigy's showbusiness lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson dropped Beckham for the first time for the Premiership
match at Leeds 10 days ago, which has fuelled speculation that the
player's days at Old Trafford could be numbered.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has insisted all along that his relationship with
Beckham is an internal matter and when asked about the bust-up
yesterday he said: "I'm not discussing it.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to talk about a game against Bordeaux. I'm not going
to talk about my players to anyone," he said.

<HEADLINE> Owen on Course for Liverpool Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- England wonderboy Michael Owen has
put himself in line for a Premiership comeback against Manchester
United on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
And that is a major boost for Liverpool as well as England
manager Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
The 20 year-old Liverpool star completed a full 90 minutes of a
behind-closed-doors practice match at Anfield on Wednesday,
arranged so that boss Gerard Houllier could assess Owen's fitness
after his latest hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
Houllier was able to run the rule over Jamie Redknapp as well,
who also figured in the full scale practice match involving all of
Liverpool's first team squad.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp, who has recovered from knee surgery, played his first
game on Monday since last November.
</P>
<P>
The club skipper's comeback at the Riverside saw him score a
penalty in a reserve match against Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp could even find himself on the bench at Old Trafford,
but Owen's fitness and overall performance suggested that he is
ready for his first senior match since January 22.
</P>
<P>
Owen has suffered five hamstring problems since tearing a
hamstring at Leeds on April 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
He broke down in matches against Wimbledon on December 28 and
then at Watford on January 15 before being forced off again
against Middlesbrough seven days later. But now he has clearly
staked his claim for a comeback against the European champions as
Liverpool fight for a Champions League place.
</P>
<P>
Houllier said: "I was very pleased with what I saw of Michael.
The run out was a great success and although no final decision
will be made until later in the week as to whether he will play
against Manchester United, I was encouraged by his display."

<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal skipper Tony Adams wants to
replace Alan Shearer as England captain and believes he can help
young defenders Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell reach their full
potential.
</P>
<P>
Adams, 33, thinks he has what it takes to lead Kevin Keegan's
side to the 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If the England manager wants me to be the captain
then I'd do it, but if he doesn't want me to do the job that's
fine too."
</P>
<P>
Adams believes he has the leadership qualities to get the best
from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
He told Sky Sports: "If I get a chance to get physically well
then I've got a chance to do it. I'd love to be England captain
and I've really enjoyed it, I've been grateful to be England
captain the 10 times I've had the job.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to be a hindrance for the future. We've got
great young talent in Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell and time
moves on.
</P>
<P>
"I can contribute if I'm still needed."
</P>
<P>
Adams, a bulwark at the hub of Arsenal's glory years under
George Graham and Arsene Wenger, said the new wave of
international talent can only benefit from the wisdom he has
gained in an international career spanning 62 caps.
</P>
<P>
The reformed alcoholic was given a four-month jail term after a
drink-driving episode in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But his life hit rock bottom after Euro '96 when he went public
in his fight against alcoholism.

STOCKHOLM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tomas Behrend of Germany rallied
to upset fifth-seeded Marc Rosset 0-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4) on Wednesday
at the Copenhagen Open, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded German won the first-round match over Rosset, a
former Olympic champion from Switzerland who took the ATP Tour
stop in Marseille, France, last week and moved to fifth in the new
ATP champions' race standings, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Bjorkman and Gianluca Pozzi became the first players to
reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman overcame a second-set challenge by Ivo Heuberger
before beating the unseeded Swiss 6-1, 7-6 (5) in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Pozzi, an unseeded Italian, overcame Finnish wild-card entry
Ville Liukko 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Liukko upset No. 2 seed Thomas
Johansson of Sweden in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seed Mikael Tillstrom, another Swede who was runner-up

<P>
MADRID, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's Rivaldo lived up to his
reputation as World Player of the Year by striking twice to help
the Catalans beat Porto 4-2 in their Champions League Group A
match at the Nou Camp on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the win, Barcelona stood a point clear at the top on
seven points from three matches, one more than Porto on six.
Hertha Berlin, who drew 1-1 with Sparta Prague, have two points
and Sparta one.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona came off a shaky start as Louis van Gaal's side
conceded a Mario Jardel header after just four minutes.
</P>
<P>
But they came back strongly to establish a 3-1 lead by halftime
with goals from Rivaldo, who is also the European Player of the
Year, Frank de Boer and Patrick Kluivert.
</P>
<P>
Jardel brought Porto back into the game with a second header
after 79 minutes but Rivaldo was on target again in the dying
seconds to put the result beyond reach.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce Grain Growing Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua)-- China plans to reduce the grain
growing area slightly but will not scale down the targeted grain
output for this year through farming technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The government will make policy change to encourage farmers to
reduce the growing area of early rice in the south and that of
wheat in the north, while expanding the growing area for beans in
Northeast China, according to a report of China Economic herald
recently.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at leaving greater room for coastal regions
to develop high value-added agricultural processing industry and
supporting the arid western regions to develop forests and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
Provinces in central China are required to maintain the crop
growing area while striving for raising grain output per unit.

<HEADLINE> Easier Search for Multimedia Content on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A new search method soon will
enable people to browse in ten minutes the most interesting part
of a 10-hour-long television news broadcast, or find pictures and
videos containing the image of a specific person in seconds,
according to local scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Media Computing Group of Microsoft China Research
Laboratory has come up with a new multimedia search method aimed
at picking out useful data through examination of content itself
instead of by the use of key words.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Hongjiang, who heads the group, said that people will
be able to find what interests them most in the huge database on
the Internet and skip those of little or no value to them without
losing key information, with the help of this new technology.
</P>
<P>
"In a world with speeding computer technology and growing
dependence on the Internet, multimedia information from the web
will proliferate and weigh heavier in people's daily life, which
makes accurate and quick searches very important."
</P>
<P>
In ten years, an ordinary computer will be a hundred times more
powerful than one today, making it possible for the ordinary user
to handle all sorts of multimedia data, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The new search method will help viewers condense to the minimum
the time it takes to find what they are most interested in on the
web through an on-line computer or even television, he said,
adding that browsers based on this technology will automatically
catalogue and edit live television news in a real-time fashion.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his group have also created an Internet search engine
that accepts inquiries in real sentences in Chinese such as "Where
are the most interesting places in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
The common practice at present is to type in key words when
searching. In this example, one might use "Beijing" and "
interesting" as key words, which may result in thousands of
irrelevant possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expects the application of this new search engine in
Chinese websites within one year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United defeated Girondins Bordeaux of France 2-0 in a Champions
League second phase match Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United took a long time to find their rhythm at Old
Trafford but eventually went ahead after 42 minutes when Welshman
Ryan Giggs cleverly touched in a cross from fellow midfielder
David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
The holders then peppered the Bordeaux goal in a five minute
purple patch but failed to regain the initiative after the break.
</P>
<P>
The French visitors gained in confidence and missed a great
chance to equalise in the 58th minute when Lilian Laslandes ran
through on goal but laid the ball into the path of Sylvain Wiltord
who, apparently surprised to get it, shot wide with the goal at
his mercy.
</P>
<P>
United's England striker Andy Cole had an even better
opportunity soon after but fluffed his shot when left unmarked no
more than six meters from goal.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford nerves were finally calmed six minutes from
time when Giggs crossed for Teddy Sheringham to head into an empty
net. It was his first European goal since his dramatic injury-time
equaliser against Bayern Munich in last year's final.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriots Urged to Hold Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides on Thursday called on Greek and Turkish Cypriots to hold
direct talks so as to reach a settlement on the island.
</P>
<P>
The time has come for one side to know the positions the other
side put forward during their separate meetings with U.N. officials
within the framework of the proximity talks, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two
communities were held last December and earlier this year. The
third round of talks were scheduled for May 23 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the four principles guiding the negotiations,
namely "no preconditions, all issues on the table, political will
to yield results and taking into full consideration the Security
Council resolutions" must apply simultaneously as they are "
interrelated and indivisible."
</P>
<P>
He also held that a detente between Greece and Turkey will make
Ankara feel the "necessity to do something regarding Cyprus as
otherwise this improvement may deflate."
</P>
<P>
On the third round of talks, he said "there's got to be some
progress," adding that "from May onwards things must take an
ascending road, otherwise the credibility of the process will be
undermined."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkey's demand for the establishment of a
confederation of two states in Cyprus, Kasoulides stressed that "
confederation is worse than partition" of the island.

<HEADLINE> Consensus Reached on Arrangements of Oil Pipelining  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Georgia reached an understanding on Thursday on the
arrangements of oil transit through Georgia, reported the Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was described by the Transport Ministry as an
appendix to the inter-governmental agreement on the Baku-Ceyhan oil
pipeline, which was signed on October 18, 1999 in Istanbul by
Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
As talks between Azeri and Georgian groups came to a dead-end
over disagreements on land expropriation, environment, security and
transportation fee issues, the first round of tri-partite talks
started in Ankara in January and the second round was held in Baku
in February. The Istanbul meeting concluded the last round of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Ministry said in a statement that the parties will
soon proceed to take up the issue of transportation fee, the most
controversial issue overshadowing Baku-Ceyhan project. The
cooperation displayed in Istanbul may constitute an impetus to push
the sides to find a rapid solution to the most difficult issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Istanbul, Georgian Foreign
Minister Irakli Menagashvili attached great significance to the
Baku-Ceyhan agreement, saying that it is vital not only for the
signatory parties, but also for the entire Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
However, Menagashvili appeared in no way to be flexible about
the issue of transportation fee. He indicated that the problem of
transportation fee had not been on the agenda during the three
rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
Realizing an uncertainty as a result of the thorny issue,
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel dispatched his advisor Hikmet
Cetin to Georgia last weekend in an attempt to persuade his
Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze to accelerate technical
talks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Georgia is seeking to earn a higher tariff
on the oil transported through its land.
</P>
<P>
The 1,740-kilometer oil pipeline will run from Azeri capital of
Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan by way of Georgian
capital of Tbilisi.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Progressing in Water Desalination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of water desalination
stations in Saudi Arabia has reached 27 with a total capacity of
745 million gallons a day, which satisfy 70 percent of the
kingdom's needs of potable water.
</P>
<P>
The stations also generate 21.8 million megawatt per hour
electricity, accounting for 21 percent of the total power generated
in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi News Agency quoted sources of the
General Corporation of Water Desalination on Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
A network of 2,000-kilometer pipelines has been built to
transport desalinated water from the stations along the Persian and
Red Sea shores to various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water expect that the
water production capacity of the stations will reach 800 million
gallons after the completion of current expansions.
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the Research and Development Centre was launched in
eastern city of Al-Jubail for researching on reducing costs,
enhancing the capacity and updating the techniques of the water
desalinating stations. The centre has five laboratories and the
most advanced equipment.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia won the award of the International Desalination
Institution in 1999 for the best research on desalinating water
with thermo techniques.

<HEADLINE> Greece Raises 10-Point Package on Solving Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece, which has been recently
concerned by the worsening situation in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, Thursday put forward a 10-point package on the settlement
of the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the package at a luncheon given in his honor by the
Foreign Press Association, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said the first is the strict implementation of U.N.
Security Council resolution 1244 which provides the parameters by
which the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo is acting.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed the need for clear messages to be sent by
the international community focusing on no change in borders and
the encouragement of a multinational society in Kosovo, as well as
the need for the international community to clarify that there
will be a long interim period until a final settlement in the
province is reached.
</P>
<P>
The remaining points include the creation of an internal
function in Kosovo with the participation of Serbs and Kosovars,
the immediate promotion by the international community of
investments in the infrastructures sector, the opening of an
office for Balkan reconstruction, the promotion and implementation
of the Stability Pact.
</P>
<P>
The last two points in Greece's positions concern seeking ways
to enable Serbia's participation in efforts to reconstruct the
Balkans and pacify the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece has warned that any idea of independence in Kosovo will
surely lead to a conflict and any flare-up of fighting in Kosovo
will be disastrous to all.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece has a strong battalion of 1,200 men
participating in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, which
has recently seen rising violence between NATO peacekeepers,
ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also made it clear that it will not send more
troops to Kosovo and will not participate in NATO military
exercise,codenamed Dynamic Answer, that is to take place in the
region late this month.

Zaldivar said of Pinochet's possible retirement of politics
that "this is a personal decision. The lifetime senator mandate (
of Pinochet) is unrenounceable."
</P>
<P>
"Not even the lifetime senator can leave the post until the
constitutional reform is approved," added Zaldivar.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced Thursday Pinochet's
release for humanitary motives, denying with this the extradition
to Spain of the former military ruler.
</P>
<P>
Zaldivar said that because of 84-year-old Pinochet's health
condition and for the same reasons for which the extradition
procedure was suspended,the situation to fulfill the functions do
not exist.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Senate said about a possible privation of
Pinochet's privileges as a senator, that his case is like any
other citizen's, for his later trial in Chile.
</P>
<P>
"There are conditions in Chile, with a judicial power that acts
independently and without any limitation," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday reiterated his desire for a European head for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and stressed he was not pushing
for a U.S. candidate to head the multilateral lender.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he would be happy for a German to head the
lending agency, even though the United States has opposed the man
nominated by the European Union, German Deputy Finance Minister
Caio Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's 24-member executive board was due to hold an informal
straw poll later on Thursday to gauge support for candidates Koch-
Weser, interim IMF chief and naturalized American Stanley Fischer,
and the Japanese candidate Eisuke Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
"I want there to be a European (managing) director of the IMF,"
Clinton said at a briefing. "I will not support an American
candidate even though I have enormous respect for Mr. Fischer and
I'm gratified that the African nations expressed their support for
him."
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that he believes a European was right for the
job, adding that he would be happy for a German candidate to lead
the organization.
</P>

"I think the Europeans should lead the IMF, and it would suit
me if a German led the IMF. Nobody's playing any games here,"
Clinton said.

MADRID, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said
Thursday that relations between Spain and Chile are normal,
assuring the position of his government of respecting British Home
Secretary Jack Straw's decision to release former president
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>

Matutes said that judge Baltasar Garzon "has given instructions

<P>
In his opinion, there have been no successes nor failures in

fulfill what the law demanded of it, in the first place, and
afterwards the acquired political commitments, so "nobody must be
surprised by the Spanish attitude."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish foreign minister said that "this was a very
delicate question" that could trammel Spain's relations with other
countries," and said he was glad he could leave his successor this
matter already resolved and not a pending mortgage, "since I am in
the eve of my retirement from politics."

<HEADLINE> Papandreou: Greek-Turkish Ties Must be Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou Thursday stressed that the relations between Greece and
Turkey must be strengthened, especially after the signing of a
series of agreements for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Papandreou described the
agreements signed by him and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem
this year as meaningful, creating the foundations on which the
dialogue between the two neighboring countries could develop
further.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial dispute in
the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two long-
time rivals have since last June begun to improve their strained
relations, with the holding of a series of low-level dialogue and
the signing of a total of nine agreements for bilateral
cooperation in a variety of sectors.
</P>
<P>
On the disputes between the two countries, Papandreou stated
that the Greek-Turkish differences must be discussed within the
framework of international law if they did not have to do with
Greece's sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that Athens' foreign policy axes were the
consolidation of a climate of trust and the exploitation of the
new agreements, the expansion of the confidence-building measures,
the cooperation at a regional level and the cooperation for Ankara
's European prospect.
</P>
<P>
As for the problem of Cyprus, which has been divided since
1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third
of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens, the Greek minister said that the existing initiatives
undertaken by the European Union (EU) and the U.N. offered a new
tool in the effort to resolve the protracted division problem.

UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan reported Thursday that more than three million voters in
Haiti have registered by mid-February and called the progress of
the electoral process "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General also noted some problems in voter
registration for Haiti's elections, scheduled for later this month.

Although voter registration began on January 24, the report

electoral violence, and fraud and irregularities were reported in
several areas.

Annan also said that "While the security situation in Haiti
remains of concern, the police force has been able to work with
increased efficiency in recent months.'
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti is
gradually reducing its presence in preparation for the transition
to an International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti. The
transition will take effect on March 15.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Sends Special Emergency Team to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Mark Brown, the
administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
has sent a special emergency team to Mozambique in order to
enhance the U.N. capacity in assisting the African country to
fight against the worst floods in 30 years, a UNDP press release
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following an appeal of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for
intensified response to the flood-besieged country of Mozambique,
Brown has dispatched the special emergency team to the country
directly from Glen Cove, New York, where he is chairing a global
meeting of UNDP Resident Representative and U.N. Resident
Coordinators.
</P>
<P>
"The team will enhance the capacity of the UNDP office in
Maputo and coordinate closely with the Office of Coordination for
Humanitarian Affairs to provide additional technical and
organizational support to the government and people of Mozambique,
" the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The special team consists of experienced UNDP Resident
Representatives and personnel from neighboring Angola, Botswana,
Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Additional support from UNDP teams from
China and Venezuela, countries with flood experience, are also
being mobilized.
</P>
<P>
UNDP, through its contacts and networked presence in the
region, will help Mozambique and its neighbors in their leadership
of the coordinated international response.
</P>
<P>
"UNDP will provide assistance to a number of southern African
countries such as Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe that have also
been affected by the severe weather situation," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have two goals: first, to help Mozambique and its
neighbors organize an intensified response to the expanding crisis;
and second, to start working today on the response to the longer-
team development challenges which this crisis has thrown up,"
Brown said.

<P>
"We issued a call for expressions of interest and the results
were more encouraging than anyone could have anticipated," said
Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund Carol
Bellamy, member of the GAVI board. "Early and enthusiastic
interest on all sides demonstrates the teamwork and commitment
essential to achieving universal child immunization."
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the World Health Organization and Chair of
the GAVI board Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland said, "The message here is
that if the international community can find ways to make vaccines
more affordable to low income countries, the countries will meet
us halfway by investing the necessary resources in people and
systems that will get those vaccines to children."
</P>
<P>
"The growing international momentum in the field of
immunization is definitely being felt on the country level," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Every year, nearly three million children die from diseases
that could be prevented with currently available vaccines,
according to the GAVI. The alliance is seeking to close the
growing gap in the number of vaccines available to children in
industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In late March, the GAVI will issue an official call for
proposals to countries with incomes of less than 1000 U.S. dollars
per capita GNP.
</P>
<P>
Resources from the fund will primarily be used to purchase
vaccines for hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and
yellow fever, and safe injection materials.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers More Flood Aid to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is considering
another 2 million euro (1.94 million U.S. dollars) of flood aid to
Mozambique, said EU sources on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be coming from the union's European Community
Humanitarian Office that already offered last week 1 million euro(
0.97 million dollars) as emergency aid to the African country.
</P>
<P>
Still more emergency aid will be considered by the 15-nation
bloc whose Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Poul Nielson was right
now in Mozambique on a fact-finding trip.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, has been following the emergency situation in Mozambique,
said EU External Relations Commissioner Christopher Patten.
</P>
<P>
Continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African
region, aggravated by the cyclone Eline, have led to displacement
of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage
to housing and the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks of flooding have left 1 million people homeless and
the situation may get worse as weather forecasters warned that new
storms would threaten the flood-ravaged country, where an
estimated 10,000 people are still stranded on trees and house
roofs.
</P>
<P>
Nine of Mozambique's 15 rivers are still swelling from waters
coming in from neighboring countries such as South Africa,Zimbabwe,
Zambia and Malawi.

before a Chilean court.
</P>
<P>
He said that Belgium would sue Pinochet in a Chilean court on
behalf of those who were deported by Pinochet and later settled in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Britain detained Pinochet in October 1998 during his visit to
the country only to decide to release the man after British
doctors had decided the former Chilean general could not face
trial after suffering brain damage in strokes during the autumn of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was Chile's military chief when he ousted the elected
government of the south American country in 1973. He ran Chile
for 17 years as the head of a military junta. He reinstated
democracy after he won less than 50 percent of a plebiscite in
1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
rejected Thursday a United States' request to permit its planes to
over-fly Venezuelan airspace in the war against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that his government cooperates with the U.S.
authorities in their war against drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said in Uruguay, when he attended the new president of
that country, Jorge Batlle swearing in, that he understands it as
a limiting decision of an operation fundamentally directed against
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysts, Venezuela does not want to
complicate more the relations between those two countries, because
it wants to be a factor of harmony instead of aggressions, direct
or indirect.
</P>
<P>
The United States approved Wednesday the Venezuelan war against
drugs, and also that of other Latin American countries, like
Colombia and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Renews Appeals for Debt Write-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Debt Group Thursday
renewed its calls for the total and immediate cancellation of the
country's external debt.
</P>
<P>
It is immoral for creditors to ask Mozambique to continue
servicing its foreign debts while the country is appealing to the
international community to help it deal with the devastation
caused by the current flooding in the southern and central parts
of the country, the group said at a press conference in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, Mozambique pays about 1.4 million U.S. dollars
per week to the rich countries, the same countries which are
granting it humanitarian aid in the scope of the emergency and
reconstruction," it said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's debt service for 2000 is estimated at about 76
million U.S. dollars, a sum that the group considers would go a
long way toward mitigating the suffering of the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Debt Group is a coalition of non-government
organizations, churches and individuals working on debt issues.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Crack Down on Fake Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday directed the Kenya plant health inspectorate service to
take appropriate actions against any seed merchant or trader who
stock or sell fake seeds.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when officially opening a Kenya
national show sponsored by the North Rift Agricultural Society in
Eldoret in northwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The country's food security is of paramount importance, he
said, stressing that all the major players in the production and
marketing of seeds should ensure that farmers get the appropriate
seeds for each zone.
</P>
<P>
He told farmers attending the show that there will be adequate
farm inputs for this planting seasons, saying that 22,000 tons of
maize seeds and 100,000 tons of fertilizer will be available.
</P>
<P>
On the livestock sector, the president said the adoption of a
free market policy in the dairy industry would benefit all
players. He encouraged more private practitioners and investors to
extend veterinary clinical service, dipping and artificial
insemination services to all corners of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi urged local farmers to increase pyrethrum and
horticultural production, challenging them to exploit the
potential in the country by producing new crop varieties aimed at
food processing to speed up industrialization.

<HEADLINE> Albright Orders to Extradite Rwandan Pastor for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright signed an order on Thursday to extradite a
Rwandan pastor for trial on genocide charges at the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
David Scheffer, U.S. ambassador for war crimes, said the
Seventh Day Adventist pastor, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 75, would
fly shortly to the Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the
international tribunal is based.
</P>
<P>
Albright's decision for the extradition came five weeks after
Ntakirutimana lost an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in
which he argued that he cannot be extradited because no treaty
authorizes it. But U.S. Congress has approved Ntakirutimana's
extradition under a 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
U.N. prosecutors say Ntakirutimana encouraged a large group of
Tutsi men, women and children to seek refuge in a church and
hospital compound in 1994 and then took part in their massacre.
</P>
<P>
He has been in U.S. federal detention in the Texas town of
Laredo, where he had been living with one of his sons.

<HEADLINE> Growth of Number of Worldwide Software Engineers Expected to Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Growth of the number of
worldwide software engineers will temper beginning this year and
slow even further through 2003, according to a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a worldwide information technology (IT) skills
shortage, the number of professional developers worldwide
increased 11.5 percent last year. But growth will slow to 9.6
percent in 2000, and by 2003, it will be under 6 percent, said the
report from the U.S. research firm International Data Corporation
(IDC).
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the declining growth is due to the stability
of the population in the developed countries, the already high
penetration of IT professionals in these developed countries, the
complexity of adopting IT in underdeveloped countries, and
increasing productivity of professional developers.
</P>
<P>
IDC expects the number of developers, same as software
engineers or system programmers, will increase the fastest in the
Asia-Pacific region where, despite the complexities of moving to a
highly industrialized economy, there is tremendous demand for IT.
</P>
<P>
"The less developed status of this region enables it to enjoy a
more rapid uptake of IT, which, combined with its large
populations, will significantly increase its ranks of professional
developers," the report said.
</P>
<P>
IDC's report also revealed that Visual Basic, which is the most
widely used developer's language, will be overtaken by HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), the document format used on the World Wide
Web, in 2002. Component-based development, Java and Internet RAD (
rapid application development), however, will be the fastest-
growing languages.

On Tuesday morning, the 6-year-old boy brought the stolen
handgun to Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris Township of
Michigan State in the United States and shot a 6-year-old girl.
She died a half hour later.
</P>
<P>
The charge would require prosecutors to show gross negligence
on the part of Jamelle James for allegedly allowing the little boy
to get the .32-caliber semiautomatic gun used in Kayla Rolland's
death, Prosecutor Arthur Busch of Genesee County in Michigan State
said.
</P>
<P>
The complaint will also allege that James contributed to the
delinquency of a minor and as a result, the manslaughter was
committed, Busch added.

The boy, whose name was not released, was questioned and
released. He was staying with a relative and police said he would

<HEADLINE> Italy, Korea Urged End to Division of Korean Peninsular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A strong appeal for an end to the
division of the Korean peninsular emerged here Thursday as the
President of Republic of Korea Kim Dae-Jung started the first
state visit to Italy since 1884.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after the end of the Cold War, the rigid splitting
of Korea no longer has the least historical or strategical
justification," said Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italian President, who
hosted state dinner to Kim Dae-Jung in the Qurinale presidential
palace Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The only path open is for a progressive North Korean opening to
the rest of the world, with South Korea's friends such as Italy
lending a helping hand until Pyongyang is ready for "direct inter-
Korean dialogue".
</P>
<P>
A similar approach was voiced by Dini earlier, who told his
South Korean confrere Lee Joung-Binn that he hopes to see
progressive reconciliation between the two Koreas thanks to the "
sunshine policy" inaugurated by President Kim's administration.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to Ciampi, President Lee pointed out that the Cold
War between the two Koreas still goes on, but the "sunshine policy
" is designed to encourage north Korea to "chose the path of
reform,opening and change."
</P>
<P>
Italy opened up diplomatic relations with the Democratic People
's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in last January arguing that this
would also help ease its relations with the international
community and reduce its isolation as a stimulus to direct
dialogue with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi recalled that the opening up of relations was only
decided after extensive discussions with the south Korean
government and mentioned an important aim of the move as being to
develop dialogue on nuclear and missile non-proliferation, arms of
mass destruction,regional security and human rights.
</P>
<P>
In his six-day visit in Italy, Kim Dae-Jung will also visit the
Vatican before traveling to France and Germany.
