<HEADLINE> AL Hopes UN General Assembly to Get Tough on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A draft resolution under debate at
the U.N. General Assembly today could serve as a very tough
condemnation of the Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in
East Jerusalem, an Arab League (AL) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General for Arab Affairs Ambassador Ahmed
Ben Helli told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the Arab call to
halt the construction of Jewish settlements enjoys wide support
among the 185-member U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Israel's biggest ally and sponsor of the peace
process, last Friday vetoed the European-sponsored draft
resolution against Israeli plans to build 6,500 Jewish homes in
Har Homa, a tree-covered hill in Arab East Jerusalem. The
resolution was supported by 14 other U.N. Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and non-aligned groups at the U.N. then turned the
matter to the General Assembly, where a similar resolution is
certain to win overwhelming backing. Regarded as the gauge of
international opinion, however, the assembly's resolutions do not
carry the weight of the Security Council resolutions and are
non-abiding.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli officials have to realize that the Arabs have options
that could strongly defend their legitimate rights that are also
supported by the international community," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Arab position and determination will not to be bargained
with, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he warned that Israel's continued intransigence will
push the region into the vicious circle of violence and prompt
Arab countries to reexamine their positions towards Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Some Arab countries have already halted steps towards
normalization with Israel because of its settlement policy and
violation of peace agreements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. stance, the official said that
Washington realizes it has joint interests with the Arab world,
which "are buttressed with the realization of a just and
comprehensive Mideast peace."
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. guarantees of the return of all Arab lands
occupied by Israel since 1967 were part of the principles of the
1991 Madrid peace conference co-sponsored by the U.S. and Russia,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday, the AL said the U.S. veto runs
contrary to the U.S. letters of guarantees relayed to the
Palestinian side at Madrid. The letter says that no change would
be made on the demographic features of Jerusalem until "final
status" talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Israelis and Palestinians want to build the capital of
their states in Jerusalem, the holy place of Judaism, Christianity
and Islam. As the final talks drawing near, Jerusalem has become
the butt of Israeli-Palestinian tug of war.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Regulates Self-Defense Groups' Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government has
recently published a decree to regulate the activity of the
country's 200,000-strong self-defense groups, called Patriots,
which are organized by civilians to fight Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the decree, which
appeared in an official daily, as saying that the self-defense
groups are from now on officially called Groups of Legitimate
Defense (GLD).
</P>
<P>
The decree said that each team of the GLD, manned by "volunteer
citizens" and "duly authorized by the public powers," is headed by
a leader or by an agent of security forces who reside in the area
where the group carries out its self-defense duties.
</P>
<P>
It said that the creation of a GLD team should be authorized by
the local prefect, requested by the local residents and agreed
upon by the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The members of the GLD are entitled to take "action of
counter-attack, as individuals or in an organized way, against all
aggression, acts of terrorism or subversion, or in a general way,
against all acts of organized criminality or delinquency conducted
against people or properties."
</P>
<P>
The GLD members are also required to "prevent or repel acts of
terrorism and subversion against places of residence, places of
social life, as well as public and social infrastructure
equipment."
</P>
<P>
The decree said that the GLD members cannot "penetrate the
interior of a home or a closed space except in cases of
entrenchment or necessity to bring rescues at the appeal of
others."
</P>
<P>
The GLD members are not paid or compensated by the government
unless a member cannot "exercise normally his professional
activity because of charges in (carrying out) legitimate defense
(duties)," said the decree.
</P>
<P>
The first groups of self-defense teams appeared in 1994 in the
villages of Kabylie, and the number of such groups has increased
over the past three years in areas where Islamic militants are
active.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's 1997/98 Budget Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's 1997/98
budget was unveiled today by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in
Cape Town, spelling out some new economic and financial measures
for the new fiscal year which starts in April.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the new budget included significant relaxation
of foreign exchange controls, tax relief package of low and
middle income earners, individuals allowed to invest limited
funds abroad and hold foreign currency accounts in local banks,
and VAT (value added Tax) stays unchanged at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some customs duties for certain imported goods will
come down, but alcohol and cigarettes will become more expensive,
and fuel price remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In his first budget speech, currently televized live
nationwide, Manuel said, however, budgeted expenditure for the
year is 186.746 billion Rand (about 41.45 billion U.S. Dollars at
present rate) and about 36 billion US Dollars revenue, leaving a
deficit of 5.5 billion US Dollars, the targeted four percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1.24 billion US Dollars education budget still takes a
significant section of the government's total spending after debt
repayments, accounting for 6.5 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The defense force will have its budget of 2.38 billion US
Dollars, a 9.4 percent decrease compared with the previous year,
while the budget for the police rises to 2.9 billion US Dollars,
a 14.4 percent increase on last year.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure for the departments of safety and security,
correctional services and justice are also up to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Describing the new fiscal year as one of consolidation, Manuel
said the government would "steer the economy firmly along the
growth path envisaged in our macro-economic strategy", released in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the new budget "tells the story of a
government determined to effect deep transformation to live
within its means".

<HEADLINE> US Poultry Export Increases Quickly in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. export of poultry
products increased sharply in the past 10 years, resulting mainly
from a huge import of Russia in recent years, the U.S. Journal of
Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies shipped 4.4 billion pounds of chicken products
overseas last year, totaling 2.45 billion U.S. dollars. The export
accounted for 16.9 percent of total U.S. poultry production.
</P>
<P>
It was a sharp increase compared with the export about 10 years
ago. In 1985, U.S. producers exported only 417 million pounds of
chicken products -- about 3 percent of total production, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. export of poultry products to Russia increased quickly
since 1991, when former U.S. President George Bush granted the
country 35 million dollars in credits to buy U.S. chicken
products.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. export of chicken leg quarters to Russia
reached 908 million dollars, nearly one fourth of total U.S.
poultry export.
</P>
<P>
The outlook of U.S. poultry export remains very strong in
coming years with many U.S. companies trying to expand market
share in the Asian countries, the paper said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Volleys of automatic
gunfire broke out at Johannesburg's library gardens this
afternoon during a Zulu commemoration of the 1994 Shell House
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Police and Zulu marchers opened fire on one another at about
2:15 p.m. after a single shot fired from the crowd, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of marchers dived for cover when the shooting
started, they said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting lasted about five or six minutes before the
gathering broke up in disarray, said one of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
So far, reports about casualties are not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people were killed and over 170 injured in
clashes between Zulu nationalists, the police and African
National Congress supporters in Johannesburg and East Rand
townships on March 28, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mourners decided to stage the march and service in the library
gardens today because March 28 falls on Good Friday this year.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 Zulu people were expected to have participated in
the march today to commemorate the bloody day and to call for the
day to be a public holiday.

<HEADLINE> Historic HK Duathlon Race to Take Express Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A historic sporting event named
Timex Hong Kong International Duathlon Race is to be staged on
April 20, the Hong Kong Triathlon Association (HKTA) and Timex
jointly announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The event is to inaugurate the North Lantau Expressway, which
is one of the key projects of the New Airport Core Program and is
scheduled to be open to traffic in May.
</P>
<P>
The landmark running-cycling event takes the expressway which
runs along the northern coast of Lantau Island and to the New
Airport at Chek Lap Kok, which is now under construction. It is
expected to attract more than 600 local and international
athletes, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Three different courses have been designated to challenge
competitors of all ages: Course A is a six kilometers run, 40
kilometers cycle race and six more kilometers run; Course B is a 3
kilometers run, 20 kilometers cycle and 3 kilometers run; and
Course C consists of a 3 kilometers run, 20 kilometers cycle and
200 meters run.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ryan, president of the HKTA, said the Timex Duathlon
will arouse tremendous interest among people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, a city with only 8,000 dedicated cyclists and
30,000 active runners, the potential for 40,000 duathletes is
already in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a great opportunity for people to participate in
the opening of an expressway which will soon become one of the
city's busiest integral connectors," the HKTA chief continued.
</P>
<P>
"To run along a closed road is a rare experience for
triathletes or duathletes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The race has been sanctioned by the Asian Triathlon
Confederation and the Chinese Triathlon Association has promised
to send a six-member team including five athletes to the event.
</P>
<P>
Athletes are to enter in the individual men's and women's
categories, which include Open, Veteran and Junior groups.
</P>
<P>
And to ensure the safety of athletes, the race will be closed
to spectators. But each competitor could register two guests at
the organizers' discretion.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the course is flat and not difficult to
the participants. But as it faces the sea, some sectors might be
a bit windy," said Ruth Hunt, director of the race and a former
triathlete herself.
</P>
<P>
The organizers had overcome a lot of difficulties and won over
helping hands from many organizations and departments, she
said. "Some 100 policemen are to be designated in place along the
course to ensure safety and order," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Things have now been put on the right track and everyone
wishes the event to be a success," she added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been staging duathlon races ever since 1992. An
international-standard triathlon race includes 1.5 kilometers
swimming, 40 kilometers cycling and 10 kilometers run.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: An American Book Aimed to Defame China (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has published a
book aimed to viciously defame the People's Republic of China and
its major achievements over the past decades with sheer
fabrication and distortion of facts.
</P>
<P>
The book entitled "The Coming Conflict with America" was
published recently in the United States, in which the authors made
up a story about "China threat" and imagined military conflicts
between the United States and China in future.
</P>
<P>
The two authors of the book, Richard Bernstein and Ross
H. Munro, who were Beijing-based foreign correspondents
respectively working for Time magazine and Toronto Globe and Mail
for years, should be aware of the actual situation in China.
</P>
<P>
However, leading a secluded and comfortable life in the
diplomatic residential quarters in Beijing for years, the two were
keen to keep close contact with few so-called Chinese dissidents
rather than ordinary Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Although the two journalists spent several years living and
working on Chinese soil, they know little about the
5,000-year-long history of Chinese civilization and turned a blind
eye to the brilliant achievements by the Chinese people in their
fight against foreign invasions and for national independence,
freedom and liberation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they ignored the fact that the Chinese people, under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrew the rule
by imperialists, feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists.
</P>
<P>
And they again turned a blind eye to the universally
acknowledged great achievements made by the Chinese people in
their reform and opening up drive for socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
As foreigners working in China, they could neither understand
spoken Chinese nor read Chinese books. It is forgivable for them
to know little about modern China since they could not speak
Chinese and had to rely on interpreters to communicate with
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
However in this book, the two authors racked their wits to
defame China with all sorts of anti-China materials they collected
through every means. This cannot be explained as that they have
"little learning."
</P>
<P>
Driven by a racial superiority of the "white supremacy," the
two authors are extremely domineering and conceited.
</P>
<P>
Though they witnessed the ongoing socialist construction
carried on by the Chinese people, the gradual improvement of
living standards of the Chinese people and efforts to perfect
socialist democratic and legal system in China, they furiously
imprecated and defamed China's socialist system since it did not
collapse as they wished after it happened in the Soviet Union and
East Europe.
</P>
<P>
The authors were eager to strangle China's socialist system in
the cradle.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong and Macao to China, the peaceful
reunification of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan are no doubt good
for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
However, the authors, viewing things with prejudice and racial
discrimination, alleged that this will break the balance of power
in the Asia-Pacific region and may even pose a challenge to the
U.S. global hegemony because it would make China more powerful.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they concluded that these developments must be dealt
with. In their logic, only a split China is in the interests of
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: An American Book Aimed to Defame China (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entertaining imaginary fears, the authors claimed that
Sino-U.S. confrontation is inevitable, and that conflicts of
interests between the two countries would aggravate until a war
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the 21st century, the authors believed
that Sino-U.S. confrontation would be one between the top two
powers in the world because the U.S. Asia-Pacific policy in the
last hundred years has been focusing on preventing an (Asian)
power from emerging to challenge the status of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Refuting this wrong prediction to the point, Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said unless the United
States violates China's territorial integrity and sovereignty,
there would be no possibility of any occurrence of the so-called
conflicts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, the United States and China were allies in
World War II and there exists no fundamental conflict of interests
between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries used to boast effective strategic cooperation
to safeguard peace, stability, development and prosperity in the
world.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the U.S. and China, representing the world's
largest developed and developing countries respectively, share
extensive common interests.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of coming generations, the two countries have
every reason to enhance mutual trust, reduce troubles, promote
cooperation and avoid confrontation, but not a single reason to
resort to "a war."
</P>
<P>
Wishing to see a world plunged into chaos, the two authors
fabricated an "Arabian Nights"-like myth to mislead and confuse
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
They deserve the title of "loyal subjects" of the United States
of America because they always bear in mind and feel extremely
happy at their country's hegemonic acts throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
They inferred on the bases of the superpower Cold War logic
that someday China, with its rapid economic development, will
surely follow the steps of the U.S. and seek hegemony in Asia in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Cooking up a story, they claimed that driven by deep-rooted
nationalist sentiment, China is seeking to replace the United
States as the dominant power in Asia. This conclusion represents a
typically indecent way of thinking -- gauge a noble heart with
one's own mean measure.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that socialist China should
demonstrate to the world with its practices that China is opposed
to hegemonism and power politics, that it will never seek hegemony
and that China is a steadfast force to maintain world peace.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China belongs to the third world. China will still be
a member of the third world and will never be a superpower even if
it becomes strong one day with its development."
</P>
<P>
The teachings of Deng Xiaoping were, are and will be the
guidelines of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
China has always been pursuing a peaceful and independent
foreign policy. It holds that all countries, big or small, rich or
poor, strong or weak, are equal. China insists that developed
countries have the obligation to help with the development of
developing countries and that they do not have any right to bully
them.
</P>
<P>
The United States, styling itself as "world police", has a
habit of issuing orders to other countries and refuses to change
its course of action despite concerted condemnation and opposition
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Now, fearing that a stronger China may become an obstacle to
its seeking hegemonism in Asia, the United States is acting like a
villain who sues his victim before he himself is prosecuted. Its
ultimate goal is to stifle China.
</P>
<P>
The absurd arguments fabricated by the authors, in essence, are
a revised version of the "China threat" theory created earlier by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes, Cleverness may overreach
itself. The two authors of the book thought they could mislead the
world with a deceptive pamphlet and a few naive tricks.
</P>
<P>
But lies are lies.
</P>
<P>
One of their ancestors, Thomas Jefferson, has rightly said: You
can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people
all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the
time.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Sending Forces to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today denied reports that
Egypt has sent military forces to participate in an international
peace-keeping force in Zaire and insisted that Egypt limit its
actions to the humanitarian domain.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian contributions to all countries of the region,
including Zaire, are mainly humanitarian, the Egyptian MENA news
agency said, citing an Egyptian diplomatic source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation that visited the region in January
under Health Minister Ismail Sallam, had discussed means of
providing humanitarian assistance to African countries within the
context of international relief efforts initiated by Cairo along
with other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt backs reaching a political settlement in Zaire within an
African context without foreign intervention, the diplomatic
source noted.
</P>
<P>
Rebels fighting against the government of Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko have captured an expanse of eastern Zaire,
driving Rwandan Hutu refugees before them and threaten the key
garrison city of Kisangani on the Zaire River.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Friday called on the rebels to
declare a ceasefire and accept a five-point U.N. peace plan, which
Kinshasa accepted only under pressure from rebel advances. The
Zairean rebels refused the plan, standing by their demand for
direct talks with Seko.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Calls for Abattoir Hygiene Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has ordered a full report from the Ministry of Agriculture over
hygiene in Britain's abattoirs here today.
</P>
<P>
Major asked the ministry to have a chronology prepared of how
the issue was handled.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said he asked the ministry to
provide him with "one comprehensive document." Once the report is
prepared, it will be made public and statement will be made to the
House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Major also ordered a report Tuesday from the ministry on what
steps it had taken to deal with the problems and when they had
been implemented. The report will be published soon.
</P>
<P>
Major is already under fire from the main opposition Labor
Party, which last week accused him of covering up a report on
abattoir standards.
</P>
<P>
The party has vowed to create a Food Standard Agency
independent of the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure consumer
interests are not sacrificed to those of farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (lower
house) today adopted a resolution granting amnesty to combatants
who broke laws in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed by 262 votes in favor, eight against and
six abstentions, will come into effect without the approval of the
Federation Council (upper house) and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>

It is designed to ensure a peaceful settlement of the conflict
in the republic and will be implemented within six months over its
enactment.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will cover those who committed socially dangerous
offenses in Chechnya, Daghestan, North Ossetia and the Stavropol
in the period between December 9, 1994 and December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the amnesty will not cover servicemen and officers of
the Interior Ministry who stole firearms, ammunition, explosives
and sold them to illegal armed factions and persons who
participated in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Hoesch-Krupp Profits Plunge 60 Percent Due to Steel Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's heavy industry group
Hoesch-Krupp said today that its profits in 1996 declined by some
60 percent to 208 million marks (121 million U.S. dollars) due to
losses in its steel operations.
</P>
<P>
The group said all other divisions made money last year except
the steel unit, which lost 56 million marks (about 37 million
dollars). It expected the steel operations to improve and the
overall profits to rise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hoesch-Krupp said its turnover in 1996 totaled 24 billion marks
(15.8 billion dollars), 500 million marks (330 million dollars)
more than that of 1995, which saw a record profit of 505 million
marks (333.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the profits downturn, Hoesch-Krupp said it would
continue from last year the payment of 5-mark dividend per 50-mark
share.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Turn Out New Internet Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world leading
software publisher, announced that it will soon release its
Internet Explorer 4.0 which is believed to make it easier to
integrate the Internet and the personal computer's desktop.
</P>
<P>
Preview versions of the highly anticipated browser will go to
developers this month. It will be ready for the public this
summer, according to a report of the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Explorer 4.0 is significant because it puts most Windows 95
functions, including the "start" button -- which launches programs
-- right on the Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
The browser becomes the first screen a personal computer user
sees.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said it is also trying to create an open standard for
so-called push technology and has signed partnerships to integrate
the technology into the Explorer 4.0 browser. The push services
automatically deliver information from a corporate network or the
Internet to an individual's PC. By using the technology, Explorer
can make that information as easy to get as a document sitting
inside the PC's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Netscape Communications, the leader in
browsers, is heading in the same direction. Its next-generation
browsers also are designed to be the main screen on a PC.
</P>
<P>
That boosts the already intense competition between Netscape
and Microsoft in the battle over how people will use PCs to
access information.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Djibouti Railway Co. Incurs Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti Railway
Company is incurring a monthly loss of 20,000 Birr (nearly 3,000
US Dollars), a report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Buh Hussein, general manager of the company
as saying that the company's monthly expenditure on Addis
Ababa-Djibouti route amounts to 150,000 Birr while its income is
only 130,000 Birr.
</P>
<P>
Hussein told workers at Dire Dawa, second largest city in
Ethiopia, that the maintenance of the locomotives and
tracks, expenditure on spare parts and fuel were the major factors
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary expenditures including maintenance of residential
quarters have raised the running cost, said the general manager.
</P>
<P>
However, the workers of the company were quoted by the report
as complaining that lack of control on the part of administrative
bodies, corruption, unplanned activities and shortage of
spare parts are the basic reasons for the loss.
</P>
<P>
The 781-km railway was built at the beginning of this century.
The company incurred loss in its operations in recent years due
to ageing locomotives and tracks as well as shortage of
spare-parts. A study enabling the company to become profitable has
been presented to the company's board for approval by the
governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> Canada Relaxes Rules on High-Tech Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
decided to drastically shorten the processing time for high-tech
immigrants in a new bid to fill its vacant software jobs at home.
</P>
<P>
A new six-month pilot project, beginning from next month, will
reduce the time from several months to several weeks for those
with a firm job offer in one of six specific high-technology
categories, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The project is said to be the result of months of lobbying by
the high technology industry for immigration rule changes.
</P>
<P>
The industry has blamed the shortage of qualified Canadians to
fill key jobs for slowing the development of many new products.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Canada now has about 15,000 vacant jobs in
six high-tech categories, including communications, multimedia,
management information, consulting, product development and
"imbedded" software.
</P>
<P>
Raphael Girard, assistant deputy minister for immigration, said
the experiment will end a time-consuming process that now forces
companies to prove there are no Canadians qualified to fill key
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Qualified immigrants with firm job offers will be issued
temporary work permits to enter Canada during the project, Girard
said.
</P>
<P>
The project has been welcomed by the industry, which is
expected to bring in 2,000 to 3,000 skilled specialists on
temporary immigration visas.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it also got its share of criticism from others, who
claimed that the government is rewarding companies that have
failed to develop skilled staff and helping immigrants to take
Canadian jobs.

<HEADLINE> Germany Considers Delaying Euro Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The German government is considering
to delay the planned 1999 launching of the European single
currency Euro, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the Eruo may cause an economic catastrophe
in this country... Plans to delay the Eruo launching deadline are
circulating in Bonn," German news agency DPA quoted a report from
the news weekly Stern as saying.
</P>
<P>
Without citing sources, the latest edition of Stern to be
published Thursday, says that government officials are considering
to delay the start-up of the Eruo and the setting of currency
exchange rates for one or two years.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) countries are required to comply with
strict limits on budget deficits and public debts this year before
being allowed to launch the Eruo. Stern says that among the 15 EU
members, only Luxembourg and Finland appear set to meet the
criteria easily in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Germany has failed to meet the criteria in recent years, and is
expected to fail again this year with a record post-1930s
unemployment and a sluggish economic upswing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has reiterated
that there would be no watering down of the admission criteria.
</P>
<P>
A decision on delaying the Eruo launching will be made at the
EU summit scheduled for June or sometime later this autumn in
Amsterdam, says Stern.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Boeing Co. projected
that the worldwide demand for new airplanes will increase quickly
despite anticipated lower air traffic growth, the Journal of
Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
Boeing expected in its current market outlook report that the
demand of new passenger and cargo planes the world over will
exceed 16,100 in the next 20 years, worthing more than 1.1
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The outlook forecast an annual worldwide air travel growth of
4.9 percent from 1997 to 2016, down slightly from last year's
prediction of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 2016, the world fleet will total 23,600 passenger and cargo
planes, it said.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific markets will continue to be the hot spot for
traffic and equipment growth. The region will lead with 33 percent
of the world demand for new planes over the next 20 years, down
slightly from the 1996 forecast of 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co., the world's largest airplane maker, is seeking a
world market share of 67 percent. Boeing officials said that it
"will fight every battle and will not back off on any campaign"
in the competition with other airplane makers.

<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China is happy about the
significant progress in the Middle East peace process but is
concerned about incidents like Israel's latest decision to build
new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, a senior Chinese
diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Alternate Representative of the Chinese
delegation Li Baodong said China has always favored peaceful
negotiations by all parties concerned on the basis of relevant
resolutions of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He called on the parties concerned to act with prudence,
cherish the peace already achieved and strictly abide by the
concluded agreements.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Commission on Human Rights has provided great support
to the just cause of the Arabs and Palestinians in the occupied
Arab territories over the past years, Li recalled.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the commission help find a solution to serious
human rights violations caused by colonialism, racism, foreign
aggression, occupation and alien rule, and safeguard the
sovereignty and national independence of states.
</P>
<P>
China will continue making contributions to the comprehensive
restoration of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian
people and to the realization of a lasting peace in the Middle
East, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
started on Monday and will end on April 18.

HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the World Bank today
reached agreement on a 100 million U.S. Dollars development
assistant program aimed at supporting the country's objective of
poverty reduction and promoting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The pact was reached at the end of two-day intensive
consultations between the bank and the Zimbabwe government on
development cooperation projects to be implemented in 1997 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
The bank said during the discussions, the Zimbabwe government
had strongly reaffirmed its commitment to the economic reform
program and indicated that a variety of initiatives were being
implemented to further deregulate the economy and reform the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
In particular, it said in a statement issued at the end of the
talks, Harare indicated that actions were being taken to reduce
the public sector's deficit by redefining the role of the
government and rationalizing the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Besides, other steps include overhauling the planning,
budgeting and expenditure control system, strengthening tax
administration, and accelerating the privatization and
commercialization of public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank expressed strong support for the Zimbabwe
government's reform program and indicated that timely
implementation of these actions was necessary to further improve
the investment climate and to guarantee much-needed employment.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its assistance strategy to Zimbabwe would
include helping the government with the design of macro-economic
reforms to stimulate growth, reduce inflation and place greater
emphasis on rural development, natural resource management and
the environment.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Appointment of New Albanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece today welcomed the
appointment of a new Albanian prime minister, saying developments
on the political front gave rise to "guarded optimism" for a
resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that following the appointment of a prime minister the
attempts to form a national unity government will bear fruit,"
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha appointed Bashkim Fino, an
economist from the opposition Socialist party, new prime minister
Tuesday in a bid to halt an armed rebellion sweeping the south.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that there was a possibility of a representative of
the Greek government -- most probably Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis -- visiting Albania soon and that his contacts
would include meetings with representatives of the rebels since
"armed rebels played a role and could not be ignored in political
developments."
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis visited Tirana last Saturday to meet with Albanian
President Berisha and members of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Responding to charges that the Athens government was
"supporting" Berisha, Reppas said, "The government is bolstering
ties with Albania to the benefit of the Greek monority as well as
security and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Greece shares a common border of some 150 kilometers with
Albania and there are about 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in the
neighboring country, mainly in southern Albania.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordan's King Hussein wrote Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a personal and forceful letter saying that he could not
continue as the Israel's partner and friend. The King accused
Netanyahu of taking decisions amounting to continued deliberate
humiliation of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will soon
forgive some loans made to about 20 of the poorest nations,
beginning with Uganda, in an effort to reduce the debt burden
plaguing them. The agencies said they expected to slash as much as
300 million U.S. dollars from Uganda's international debts of 3.4
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- When the Clinton administration released a long-awaited
report to Congress last month on the costs of NATO enlargement, it
appeared to offer the best of all worlds: a low-budget extension
into East Europe that would gratify tight-fisted legislators, ease
defense burdens for prospective new members and defuse an ominous
showdown with Russia. But defense analysts in Europe and the
United States say the "enlargement on the cheap" strategy may be
too optimistic even in the absence of any visible threat to the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered a sweeping shake-up
of his government Tuesday, pledging to slash the bloated Russian
bureaucracy and warning that every senior official's job is on the
line except for those of his top two lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat invited U.S., European and
Arab envoys to a Gaza conference this weekend to discuss Middle
East peace in light of Israel's decision to build housing in East
Jerusalem. The United States, over Israeli objections, will
attend. Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein wrote Netanyahu saying he
has lost confidence in Israel's prime minister as a peace
partner.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Near Agreement on New Partnership: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) have achieved enough progress towards a
new partnership, said a local news report today.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that an agreement between Moscow and
the alliance could be ready for signing by President Boris Yeltsin
and the alliance's 16 heads of state at a special summit in May or
June.
</P>
<P>
"In a key concession, Russia now seems ready to drop its
insistence on a legally binding treaty that would have to be
ratified by all parliaments and has signaled a willingness to
accept NATO's preference for a political document endorsed by
government leaders," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted senior NATO officials as saying that the new
flexibility was evident in the latest discussions on a NATO-Russia
pact, which was held Sunday in Moscow by Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov may elaborate further on Moscow's new thinking when
he visits Washington later this week to plan the U.S.-Russia
summit scheduled for Helsinki on March 20," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia has not muted its opposition toward NATO's
eastward expansion, the report quoted Western officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO has said that it will decide to invite central and eastern
European countries to join the alliance at a summit meeting in
Madrid in July. Russia strongly opposes the move.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Rules Out Higher Coal Mining Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- German Economic Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said today he saw no possibility for the government to
raise subsidies for the unprofitable coal mining industry, though
the protesting coal miners' blockade of the government district
here entered its third day.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Berlin's B.Z. daily, Rexrodt described as
"generous" the 4 billion marks (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) of
annual subsidies to be offered by Bonn to the bituminous coal
mines in the west of Germany from year 2005.
</P>
<P>
This was the best the government could do given its financial
situation, Rexrodt added.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 miners today continued blocking Bonn's main
north-south artery and maintained a barricade around the
headquarters of Rexrodt's Free Democratic Party, the junior
partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,000 miners were expected to join a rally later
today in Bonn, to continue protest against the government's plans
to slash annual federal subsidies for coal mining from the 10
billion marks (about 5.8 billion dollars) currently to 5.5 billion
marks (about 3.2 billion dollars) as from year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Of the continuing subsidies, Bonn will pay up to 4 billion
marks (about 2.35 billion dollars), with the rest paid by North
Rhine-Westphalia state.
</P>
<P>
Miners' trade union IG Bergbau has warned of mass unemployment
in the coal mining regions of the Ruhr Valley and Saarland as a
result of the quick pace of subsidy cuts. In February, Germany's
unemployment reached a post-1930s record high of 4.67 million, or
12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Against the blockade of some 15,000 miners several hundred
yards off his chancellery, Kohl Tuesday postponed the due talks
with IG Bergbau leader Hans Berger on subsidy cuts to Thursday,
saying he would not let himself be put under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Berger Tuesday asked the miners to call off protests and await
the results of Thursday's talks, but the proposal was apparently
defied by protesters.
</P>
<P>
The trade union is demanding 6.5 billion marks (about 3.82
billion dollars) in annual subsidies from 2005 and say miners are
willing to reduce the coal mining workforce to 45,000.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, only about 30,000 jobs of a total of
85,000 in western German mines would remain by 2005.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the loss-making deep-pit coal mines in the west of
Germany received a record state handout of 11.2 billion marks
(about 6.59 billion dollars), with 10 billion (about 5.88 dollars)
from Bonn and the rest from North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
German bituminous coal costs 280 marks (about 165 dollars) per
ton, compared with 80 marks (about 47 dollars) per ton for the
same kind of coal purchased on international markets.

<HEADLINE> Anti-FN Protest Organizers Complain of Police Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of a protest against
the extreme-right National Front (FN) Tuesday night in Marseille
have complained about the "violent savageness" with which police
stopped their initiative.
</P>
<P>
Several anti-racist and human rights groups condemned in a
communique issued today "this unjustifiable and unqualified
attitude" of police and said that the demonstrators wanted to
protest in a "calm but determined way."
</P>
<P>
They said that police dispersed demonstrators with gear gas
without pre-warning when some 8,000 people protested outside a
meeting hall where FN President Jean-Marie Le Pen and the number
two of the FN Bruno Megret were making speeches.
</P>
<P>
The groups which joined the protest included the Movement
against Racism and for Friendship among Peoples, the League of
Human Rights, SOS Racism and Alarm Citizens.
</P>
<P>
But Marseille police commissioner Michel Sappin said, "All the
interventions of forces of order were carried out in a situation
of defense or repelling acts of violence, degradations or
voluntary arson committed by certain hooded demonstrators."
</P>
<P>
He said that four policemen and one photographer were wounded
in the clash between demonstrators and police, and 12 people were
detained by police.

<HEADLINE> Angola Reaches Pact With Portugal on Road Repair: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola has sealed cooperation
agreements with Portugal on rehabilitation of its main roads
damaged during the civil war, Minister of Public Works Castro
Van-Dunem said in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Portuguese magazine "Trade" during
his recent visit to the west European country published today,
Van-Dunem said four-fifths of Angola's 15,000 kilometers of roads
remain pot-holed and impassable due to the war.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, over 100 bridges need to be repaired, and
all these demand cooperation with Portugal, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the assistance of the World Bank, he said, four roads in
Luanda's suburbs would also be built, at a cost of some 25
million U.S. Dollars. And the European Union will assist in
building a 70-km road in the south, he added.

<HEADLINE> DESY Discovery Possible Clue for "New Physics" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Physicists at the German Elektron
Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg have found evidence that could
result in "new physics", with further data to be taken this year
for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
According to German news agency DPA reports today, DESY
scientists have in experiments registered data that cannot be
explained by today's theories.
</P>
<P>
They find a positron that can collide with a proton in such a
manner that it is deflected at a wide angle, thus gaining enormous
momentum. By February 19, scientists there had registered 11 such
events -- far more than expected on the basis of theoretical
predictions.
</P>
<P>
The experiments were conducted with HERA, the Hadron Electron
Accumulation Ring, Germany's largest and most expensive scientific
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
HERA is a ring-shaped particle accelerator with a circumference
of 6.3 kilometers which runs in an underground tunnel. It
accelerates both protons and positrons to almost the speed of
light, and the particles collide head-on in the tunnel beam.
</P>
<P>
DESY physicists believe that if the initial evidence were
confirmed, the so-called standard model of physics to date should
be radically shaken.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPA reports, more will be known in October
when the next data-taking period are completed.
</P>
<P>
Possible theoretical explanations of what is happening at DESY
include super symmetry -- extension of the standard model which is
purely hypothetical as yet, with the support from many experts.
</P>
<P>
Another possible cause of the high number of registered events may
be so-called leptoquark -- an exotic elementary particle. A hitherto
unknown natural force could also be causing the new interaction.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Make Banking Sector More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government is planning
sweeping changes to make the Greek banking sector more effective
and competitive on an international level, National Economy and
Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said today.
</P>
<P>
"The basic government philosophy in the banking sector is the
creation of relatively large banking units with diversified
activities as well as increased stakes in the share capital of
state-run banks," Papantoniou told bankers at a meeting of the
General Assembly of the Association of Greek Banks.
</P>
<P>
He said the first concrete indications of this philosophy would
be seen in the next few months with the immediate re-tendering of
Cretabank, the continuation of reforms of the Agricultural Bank of
Greece into a modern commercial bank and the sale of the Bank of
Central Greece.
</P>
<P>
Moves to merge the Ionian and commercial banks and the national
housing and mortgage banks would be well under way by the end of
the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bank of Greece Lucas Papademos said all current
restrictions on foreign exchange accounts in Greek banks would be
lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
Papademos told the meeting that commercial banks needed to
modernize to become more competitive and effective.
</P>
<P>
The main prerequisites for growth in the banking sector, he
said, were the reduction of operation costs, the expansion of
portfolios and the reduction of risks.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Urges U.S. to Keep Cooperative Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. secretary of state
Henry Kissinger said here today that the U.S. government should
keep a "cooperative and realistic relationship" with China and
avoid conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made the remarks in a speech at a forum of Philippine
businessmen, legislators and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should do our best to have a cooperative but
realistic relationship with China, willing to give them a real
stake in international system and welcoming their participation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the U.S. will face resistance from China if
the U.S. government trys to tell China what it should do.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. history is two hundred years, China history five
thousand. In Chinese history they have been putting dynasties,
every one of them have last long or longer than entire history of
the US," Kissenger said.
</P>
<P>
"So therefore the U.S. attempt to lecture China on its domestic
situation, there is certain resistance because the Chinese believe
they have managed for 4800 years without significant advice from
the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kissenger said China has experienced great changes in the past
decades, the growth of China is a basic fact and the international
system must get used to that reality.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who had served as foreign policy adviser to three
former U.S. presidents, also castigated the current U.S. policy to
browbeat trading partners on human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said it is "absurd" for the U.S. government to believe that
"two hundred and fifty million Americans can tell all the billions
of the people in the rest of the world what form of government
they must have and by what kind of domestic practices."

PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Zaire has reinforced troops in
Mbuji-Mayi in Oriental Kasai to defend the diamond-bearing central
region against the advancing rebel forces of Laurent-Desire
Kabila, according to a report of the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a source of the Zairean Defense Ministry as saying
that "fresh troops" have been dispatched to Mbuji-Mayi to

Mbuji-Mayi is 200 kilometers south of Kindu, which fell to the
rebels one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The source said, "The enemy is no longer trying to pierce our
lines in the northeast front because he dreads something."
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what the rebels said, the fightings are not going
on 10 kilometers from Kisangani. The shortest distance (with the
rebels) is 40 kilometers. We control the situation," AFP quoted
him as saying.
</P>

Zairean Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo said today that Kisangani
"will not fall."

<HEADLINE> EU Must Be Made for Its Own People: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) must
change its ways and focus more clearly on the aspirations of its
people if it wants their support, European Commission President
Jacques Santer said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the European Parliament EU assembly in Strasbourg,
France, during a ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the
Treaty of Rome, Santer said that in its haste to create a single
market, the EU had left other, vital concerns by the wayside,
"with dramatic implications at times."
</P>
<P>
"Our joint project... has to be to reflect the feelings and
aspirations of our citizens," he told the assembly.
</P>
<P>
People would not back the union if it did not also tackle
unemployment and give them proper social and health protection, he
added. He was speaking a day after thousands of European car
workers protested in Paris against plans by carmaker Renault to
close an assembly plant in Belgium, with the loss of 3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The EU had succeeded in abolishing national borders for
criminals but not for national police forces, Santer said, adding
that it had a common trade policy but hadn't been able to reap
political benefits from it.
</P>
<P>
The EC president said EU governments needed to tackle all these
problems during their ongoing reform of the EU treaty.

<HEADLINE> International Conference Aiming at Rescuing Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said today the upcoming international conference in Gaza
was designed to rescue the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
from the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 100 visiting Israeli businessmen, Arafat
said that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was still
committed to peace despite of the current crisis created by
Israel's violations of peace accords.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference of foreign diplomats, due to be held
Saturday in Gaza, would discuss the Israeli violations and their
impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Abu Rudeineh today called on the
international community to put pressure on Israel to "implement
accurately and honestly" the peace accords signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He denied Israel's accusation that the conference was a
violation of the Oslo agreement. "No, it's a part of the
agreement which says that whenever there is a problem, there
must be supervision. This supervision is by those who signed the
agreement," he said, referring to the United States, Russia and
Norway which sponsored the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has issued invitations to the U.S., Russia, Norway,
Japan, the European Union and Arab countries to attend the
conference. Rudeineh said all these invited had accepted the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's strong opposition, the U.S. government has
decided to accept the invitation by sending its Consul-General
in Jerusalem Edward Abington to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk rejected the claim that the
U.S.-Israeli relations were in crisis due to the U.S. agreement
to attend the meeting. He said the U.S. agreed to attend only
because it wanted to conduct the dialogue with the Palestinian
side in order to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel today continued condemning the holding of the
international conference as a violation of the peace
agreement. Foreign Minister David Levy warned that such a meeting
would only put the peace process into deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, currently visiting
Russia, said in Moscow that the Gaza conference was against
Israel and violating the peace agreement. He also accused the PNA
of violating the peace agreements by failing to change the
Palestinian Charter calling for Israel's destruction, refusing
to collect illegal weapons and having released anti-Israeli
Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged Arafat to stop threatening with violence
whenever there was a crisis and come back to the negotiating
table. He said the PNA would make a mistake if it broke off
contacts with Israel. Local media reports said that Arafat had
refused to receive telephone calls from Netanyahu in recent days
to protest Israel's recent actions.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis was caused by Israel's unilateral decision
on the scope of further troop pullbacks on the West Bank, its
plan to build the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem and its
order to close four PNA offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to convene Thursday a meeting of the Palestinian
Council in Bethlehem and another meeting of the Central
Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Friday in
order to formulate further response to Israel's tough stance.

<HEADLINE> S. African Regional Cereal Sufficient for This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Regional cereal availability at
28.12 million tons will be sufficient to cover consumption and
strategic reserve requirements for the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the 12-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) food security unit today referring
to revised food security assessments for the region's current
marketing year.
</P>
<P>
In a report released in Harare, the unit said that regional
consumption and strategic requirements demand only 26.79 million
tons, leaving a surplus of 1.33 million tons.
</P>
<P>
''Most SADC countries expect cereal harvests which are either
equal to or higher than last season, should favorable rainfall
conditions prevail until the end of the season,'' said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, the unit said, maize production is expected to
surpass last year's above average harvest of 2.6 million tons, or
at the very least, remain at the same level.
</P>
<P>
The unit said Malawi, Zambia, Swaziland and Namibia are the
other countries expecting increased maize production.
</P>
<P>
It added despite heavy rains, potential crop yields are
unlikely to be achieved in Angola and Mozambique. And production
in Botswana is likely to remain low.

<HEADLINE> Killings, Violence Occur in Johannesburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and many others wounded today in shootings linked to a
demonstration by thousands of Zulu people marking the 1994 Shell
House massacre, police and medical workers said.
</P>
<P>
The wild shooting, which broke out at Johannesburg's Library
Gardens at 2:15 p.m., was sparked by one or two shots, apparently
fired from the crowd, followed by a 30-second volley of automatic
fire, South African Press Association quoted unidentified
witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet clear who was responsible for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Shell House massacre refers to the shooting n
March 28, 1994 when eight Zulu protesters were shot dead,
allegedly by security guards of African National Congress (ANC)
outside the party's Johannesburg headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At least another 50 people were killed and over 170 injured in
clashes between Zulu nationalists, policemen and ANC supporters
in and around Johannesburg on that day.
</P>
<P>
Mourners decided to stage the march and service today because
March 28 falls on Good Friday this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, about 20,000 Zulu people, almost all of
them armed with sticks, held demonstrations in downtown streets
in Johannesburg under the watchful eye of almost 2,000 police and
troops in armored vehicles, supported by a police helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called on South African President Nelson
Mandela to appear in court to answer charges in connection with
the 1994 Shell House massacre

<HEADLINE> Arab Businessmen Oppose Regional Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab businessmen today agreed to
work toward a common Arab market but opposed the establishment of
a regional businessmen council that will involve Israel in the
region's economic integration process.
</P>
<P>
"It is premature to form such a council as the peace process
has not yet been completed on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese
tracks," Arab Businessmen Council (ABC) Chairman Hamdi al-Tabba
said at a press conference held at the end of the two-day meetings
of the Arab Businessmen Council.
</P>
<P>
The council cannot be established with Israel's participation
as long as Israel still "monopolizes the Palestinian market and
rejects opening it to Arab products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the council endeavors to facilitate the
transfer of Palestinian products to Arab markets and the movement
of Palestinian businessmen in the Arab world,
</P>
<P>
He denied any differences over the council's performance among
the Arab states and welcomed any Arab country to join the council.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up the meetings here today, Arab businessmen agreed
to work towards the establishment of the Arab Free Trade Zone in
January 1998 in conformity with the decision taken by the Arab
ministers of economy here last month.
</P>
<P>
They also reached an agreement on establishing a data network
for Arab businessmen to get acquainted with investment
opportunities in the Arab world and exchange information on
ventures, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The meetings covered means of enhancing economic, trade and
investment cooperation among the Arab countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ABC also held a lengthy meeting today with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid during which they discussed
the role of the private sector in economic and social development
in the Arab countries and cooperation between the Arab League and
Arab businessmen.
</P>
<P>
It also dealt with the need to take steps towards facilitating
the movement of Arab businessmen and Arab goods in the Arab
world.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- About 300 pulse seeds
believed to sustain soil fertility and serve as natural
fertilizers have been gathered in Ethiopia, a biological expert
from the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
Asfaw Haile-Mariam told local journalists that seeds selected
from these pulses through laboratory tests, in house experiments
and demonstration centers will be distributed to multipliers
during the next crop season in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Asfaw said peasants in different parts have long experiences
in using biological fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
He said countries such as China, India and Indonesia take a
prominent place in using these biological fertilizers produced
cheaply and helping to prevent air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The national soil research laboratory of Ethiopia has a plan
to conduct in-depth studies about biological fertilizers in
cooperation with the national fertilizer agency, he added.

<HEADLINE> Athens Suitable for 2004 Olympic Games: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Athens of 2004 will be an
idyll of parklands and will have no traffic problems or air
pollution, said a report on the repercussions of major public
works projects.
</P>
<P>
The report, released today, was prepared by Greek and foreign
scientists. It said that the public works projects currently under
way will significantly improve the quality of life in the Greek
capital, in time for the 2004 Olympic Games which Athens hopes to
host.
</P>
<P>
The report was commissioned by the Athens 2004 Olympics
Committee, which has also drafted an action plan, in cooperation
with the country's Environment, Town Planning and Public Works
Ministry, to upgrade the quality of life and to protect the
environment, given that environmental factors play a role in the
selection of cities to host the games.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee recently put Athens
alongside Rome as front-runners for the 2004 games but stressed
that Athens suffocating air pollution was the greatest obstacle to
the Greek capital's bid.
</P>
<P>
But the scientific report noted that since 1990 smog levels in
the city have shown a gradual reduction and that the completion of
the metro subway system, the international airport at Spata, the
construction of a number of major road axes and the introduction
of use of natural gas in industry would all contribute
significantly to further reduction of air and noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the supervisor of the Athens 2004 action plan,
Kostas Liaskas, said the program will relate to planning and
construction of sports facilities, land use, transport, energy,
environmental management and other factors.
</P>
<P>
"In the year 2004, the Olympic Games will be held in a clean,
healthy and attractive Athens, which will be in the future a pole
of attraction for tourists and services, but will also meet the
desires of residents and the needs of production," he said.

RABAT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Minister of Culture
and Information Hamed Youssef Hammadi today called on Arab
countries to help carry out the United Nations "Oil for Food" plan
with Iraq and obtain the lifting of the six-year-old U.N. sanction
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said at a press conference that the role of Arab
countries is the key for the lifting of the U.N. sanctions,
imposed upon Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Arab countries stand up in the coming months
and rise against the situation which prevails presently in Iraq,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since France, Russia and some African and Asian
countries have asked for the lifting of the embargo on Iraq, "we
cannot but hope that the Arab countries will be more dynamic in
the months to come."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister held talks with Moroccan Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali Tuesday, and delivered a letter
from President Saddam Hussein to King Hassan II.

<HEADLINE> New Strategy Launched to Stop Air Pollution in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government launched
the National Air Quality Strategy here today to achieve new air
quality objectives throughout the country by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to press ahead with steps to
achieve by 2005 major reductions in the principal air pollutants
which threaten health in the UK," Environment Secretary John
Gummer said.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy sets out standards and objectives for the control
and reduction of the eight main health-threatening air pollutants
in the UK -- nitrogen dioxide, particles, ozone, sulphur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, lead, benzene and 1,3 butadiene."
</P>
<P>
Air quality in Britain has improved considerably since the
1950s and 1960s. However, advances in scientific knowledge since
then have led to a better understanding of the health effects of
major air pollutants, and provided new technologies to tackle
these.
</P>
<P>
The air quality standards set out in the strategy represent
concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere at which there
would be no, or minimal effect on public health.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy is the first of its kind in Europe. It will offer
everyone, even those most sensitive to air pollution, a very high
level of protection," Gummer said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will be subject to periodic reviews, the first in
1999, to assess progress towards meeting the objectives and ensure
their continuing relevance and the cost effectiveness of the
proposed measures.
</P>
<P>
Required by the British Environment Act 1995, the British
government consulted the environment agencies and representatives
of local authorities, business and non-governmental organizations
in the preparation of the strategy.

<HEADLINE> China: Developed Countries Cling to Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Alternate Representative
Li Baodong said here today that representatives from developed
countries had turned a deaf ear to sincere appeals for cooperation
put forward by those from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Li said that the speech made this afternoon by
Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Hans
Van Mierlo "is such an example."
</P>
<P>
Li said that Van Mierlo unfoundedly accused China of violating
human rights in his speech on behalf of the European Union (EU).
However, Li stressed, Van Mierlo "probably has forgotten two
things."
</P>
<P>
"First, the human rights record in the history of the
Netherlands is by no means glorious. During their colonization
process and colonial rule over several centuries, the Dutch
colonialists violated human rights on a massive and systematic
scale, the consequences of which have not been eliminated
completely even till today," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Secondly, he has forgotten to look at his own
backyard in Western Europe. At the end of last year, a notorious
case of pedophilia was exposed in a member state of the European
Union, which shocked the people in that country as well as the
whole world. However, Van Mierlo did not even say a word about
this case."
</P>
<P>
Intolerably, Li said, "while addressing the commission, he took
himself for a teacher and the delegates of developing countries
for pupils with ears only for his harangue."
</P>
<P>
Li noted, "The first and foremost principle of the UN Charter
is sovereign equality. He is in no position to admonish us. I
would like to suggest that he had better concentrate on reviewing
the ignoble human rights record in the history of his own country
and on tackling the human rights problems within the EU."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference given after his speech at the session,
Van Mierblelo insisted that the EU is prepared to table a draft
resolution against China, but the final decision has not yet been
made.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights meets
here in Geneva from March 10 to April 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Of Britain's 4-11-year-old
children, 38 percent have given up eating beef and 20 percent is
shunning most meat because of worries over BSE, or mad cow
disease, according to a report today by the Vegetarian Society
(VS).
</P>
<P>
The report, which was based on a sample of nearly 1,000 parents
and a total of almost 1,500 children, was conducted as there are
widespread concerns in the country that BSE can be passed from
infected cattle to the human race.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Connor, communications manager of the VS, said that
almost a quarter of the children in the age group were avoiding
meat, which showed that they would be comfortable with a
vegetarian diet in the future.
</P>
<P>
On average, 7 percent of British adults are vegetarians at
present. However, the report said that the figure would increase
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said most parents believed that a
vegetarian child could be as healthy as a meat-eating child.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Could Cost Britain 2 Billion Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The enlargement of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could cost Britain more than
2 billion pounds (about 3.24 billion U.S. dollars) over the next
13 years.
</P>
<P>
The estimate of Britain's contribution to the NATO expansion is
based on the country's present share of the existing NATO budget,
according to a research report by the British-American Security
Information Council.
</P>
<P>
Military experts say that if Britain's share is as high as 3.24
billion dollars or 324 million dollars each year, it would be more
than the Pentagon's estimate of American costs, which would be
around 1.5 to 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a document published recently, the Pentagon estimated that
the total cost of NATO expansion would be between 27 and 35
billion dollars from 1997 to 2009 and a third of this would be
provided by the new NATO members themselves.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the full costs to the alliance would be
revealed to NATO's North Atlantic Council in May, but NATO
officials believe that some of the costs would be met by savings
elsewhere, including pruning the 65 NATO headquarters to about 20.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ban on Burundi Not to Ease: Ugandan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eriss Kategaya said
today that the current developments in Burundi were so explosive
that relaxation of the economic sanction on it was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya said at the Dar es Salaam International Airport that
economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by some Great Lakes
countries would not be relaxed until the military junta led by
Major Pierrre Buyoya meets the conditions set by the Arusha
Summit in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya was on his way back to Uganda after having delivered
a special message of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania and Uganda are extremely concerned over
the developments in Burundi which have rendered many Burundians
dead or displaced.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people have died since October 1993 when
Burundi ethnic civil war was sparked by the assassination of the
country's first democratically elected Hutu President Melchior
Ndadaye.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the regional states have repeatedly warned that
Burundi could go to the way of its northern neighbor Rwanda where
up to one million people died in 1994 in a genocide of Tutsis and
moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya added that Uganda and Tanzania were also following
the latest developments in Zaire with keen interest and that a
summit to discuss the issue would be held in Nairobi, Kenya in
the near future. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- "The inferences in the
press regarding (Jordanian) King Hussein's stability are an
outrageous slander," said a statement issued by Israeli Prime
Minister's Office here this evening.
</P>
<P>
"To impute such inferences to the Prime Minister or anyone
in his entourage is unacceptable. The Prime Minister has the
deepest respect for His Majesty," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime minister was talking about the need for
stability in relations between nations," the statement continued.
"He was in no way referring to personalities or individuals."
</P>
<P>
The three-paragraph statement did not give the background of
the clarification, nor identified any press organizations that
made the inferences.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Israel have rapidly sunk to a
low ebb this week. King Hussein sent a letter to Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on March 9 saying that the premier
is not acting as a peace partner and instead his policies,
especially building a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, will
make bloodshed virtually inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Hussein told Netanyahu that his policies are making peace a
"distant, elusive mirage."
</P>
<P>
In a three-page response to the monarch sent on March 10,
Netanyahu sought to defend Israel's policies and called for
Israeli-Jordanian relations and their own personal relationship not
to be held hostage to Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's envoy on Cyprus,
Sir David Hannay said here today he hoped that direct
negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the
island will start within the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sir David, who arrived here Tuesday for a new round of
contacts on the island, made the remark after a two-hour
meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, which he described as
"a very good talk".
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he is working very closely with
the United Nations in a bid to find a solution to the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"There is an intensive preparatory process underway," he said,
noting this is led by the U.N. and "we are hopefully
strengthening and assisting this process."
</P>
<P>
Sir David said his talks and contacts in Cyprus are not
separate in any way. "It is all part of a concerted effort
by the international community led by the United Nations to
find the way through the problems that have previously blocked
the solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. Chief will convene
face-to-face negotiations between two communities' leaders before
the end of the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sir David also discussed today the Cyprus problem with
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides in what he said "a very
useful, friendly and constructive way".
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, he crossed into the Turkish-controlled
northern part of the island to meet with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Sir David's visit follows a U.N.-sponsored proximity talks
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides, which started
Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General's Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel described Tuesday his first contacts with President
Clerides and Denktash as "a good start".
</P>
<P>
The on-going proximity talks are aimed to pave the way
for the face-to-face negotiations between President Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash seeking solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> EC Endorses S.Africa's Qualified Membership for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today gave the green light to the draft protocol to the revised
Lome Convention which sets out the terms and conditions of South
Africa's membership.
</P>
<P>
The commission described this as "an important milestone" in
the two-year negotiations on the future framework of cooperation
between the European Union and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Having approved the results of the technical negotiations
between the two parties concluded two weeks earlier, the
commission asked the EU Minister Council to approve its proposal
"as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Under the initial agreement, the trade benefits of Lome will
not apply to South Africa. Trade relations will be governed by a
separate bilateral agreement, which will contain provisions for
the gradual establishment of a Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
In economic terms, South Africa's main benefit from membership
of the convention is that it will be eligible to tender for
European Development Fund projects in all Africa, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) countries.
</P>
<P>
At a political level, South Africa's membership of the
convention and its full participation in all Lome institutions
should have important positive effects.
</P>
<P>
"It will undoubtedly increase the political weight of the ACP
group of countries, and influence the political dialogue between
the ACP and the EU on many issues, including the post Lome
debate," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, it was further agreed, following a
South African proposal, that projects and activities in South
Africa will not be funded from Lome resources -- with the
exception of refugee assistance, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The commission said South Africa confirmed its preference to
receive continued financial assistance through the European
Program for Reconstruction and Development, which is funded
directly from the EU Community budget.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the ACP/EC Joint Council of 24 April will
formally approve the protocol, which would then enter into force
later this year, together with the rest of the revised Lome IV
Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention is first signed in 1975 by the then
nine-member European Economic Community and 46 ACP countries with
the aim of boosting trade and economic relations between the EEC
and the ACP group.
</P>
<P>
The Lome IV Convention, which was renewed in 1989 and came into
force in March 1990, has a validity time of 10 years. It has at
present 85 members.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Boycott Gaza International Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel today angrily announced
that it will not participate in the Palestinian-sponsored
international conference to be held in Gaza Saturday, the
state-run Israel Radio reported .
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister David Levy made
the announcement in a strongly-worded statement during a Knesset
(parliament) plenum session this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Levy declared that Israel will not agree to go to such a
tribunal to face an accusation finger. He warned that such a
move could put the peace process into a deep abyss.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
Tuesday invited the U.S., Russia, the European Union, Norway and
Japan to attend an international conference in Gaza on March 15
to discuss the current crisis in the peace process stemming from
recent Israeli decisions on building settlement in East Jerusalem
and redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, now on an official
visit to Russia, has reportedly charged that the move
constitutes a violation of the Oslo Accords between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. has responded positively and announced to
send U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem Edward Abington to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel will not be intimidated by Palestinian
threats and will build the Jewish settlement in Har Homa in East
Jerusalem as planned.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Arafat had consulted with the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and other Palestinian "terrorist
organizations" on current crisis with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy warned that the PNA was stirring emotions and this could
deteriorate into violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that should Arafat give Hamas the green light, it
would strike a mortal blow to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Levy called on Arafat to return to the
peace table.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Pays Homage to Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General Assembly,
at its first plenary meeting held since January, paid tribute to
the memory of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Opening the memorial ceremony, General Assembly President
Ismail Razali of Malaysia said that the passing away of Deng
Xiaoping is "a loss not only to China, but to the international
community as well."
</P>
<P>
"With his vision of reform and pragmatism," he said, "Mr. Deng
will be remembered as an astute leader who helped steer the cause
of China towards international peace and security during a time of
global transition."
</P>
<P>
"He will be also be remembered for his unparalleled
contributions as the chief of architect of modernization,
liberalization and economic prosperity in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the General Assembly, he requested the permanent
representative of China to convey "our heartfelt condolences and
profound sympathy to the government and people of China and to the
bereaved family."
</P>
<P>
Under the invitation of Ismail, the member states then stood up
and observed a minute of silence in tribute to Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Representative of Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin American
and Europe then addressed the General Assembly, expressing their
"profound sorrow" on the passing of the Deng Xiaoping. The
representative of the United States, Bill Richardson, also spoke on
the behalf of the host country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun told the General Assembly that Deng Xiaoping was an
outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the
Chinese people of all ethnic groups, the chief architect of
China's reform, opening-up and modernization and founder of the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng led China in re-determining an international
strategy, adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace,
safeguarding world peace, promoting world development and opposing
hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
These efforts, he said, have opened up "a new situation of
China's relations with foreign countries in a new era" and made
"historical contributions" to developing and strengthening China's
friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the future, Ambassador Qin said the central
collective leadership with President Jiang Zemin at the core will
lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Deng
Xiaoping, building China into a prosperous, democratic and
civilized socialist country and developing friendly relations of
cooperation with all countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Strategy to Combat Acidification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
stepped up its efforts to combat acidification by adopting today a
proposal on a strategy to reduce the levels of acid deposition in
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The strategy will, by 2010, reduce significantly the extent of
the areas in the EU where the tolerance of sensitive ecosystems to
acidity is exceeded.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, main elements of the strategy
include establishment of national emission ceilings for each acid
rain pollutant, ratification of the UN protocol on further
reduction of sulphur emissions, and proposal for a directive
limiting the sulphur content of heavy fuel oils.
</P>
<P>
Other elements are revision of the EU's so-called Large
Combustion Plants Directive, promotion of cost-effective measures
to reduce emissions in countries in Central and Eastern Europe,
and designation of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea as so called
sulphur dioxide control areas.
</P>
<P>
The EC's current predictions indicate that the extent of
affected areas in 2010 would, in the absence of the strategy, be
8.7 million hectares. With the strategy this figure will be
reduced to 4.5 million hectares, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
According to EU figures, a total of 33.4 million tons of
sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and ammonia, three major
culprits for acidification, were emitted in the EU in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanga-based
Association for Rural Development Promotion (ARDP) is planning
to set up neem tree nurseries in Tanga, eastern Tanzania, in a bid
to raise the tree products which are full of therapeutic values.
</P>
<P>
ARDP Secretary Fredolin Mbunda told reporters here today that
medical materials drawn from the tree can cure 124 human and
several animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of the neem tree, popularly known as muarobaini,
would enable rural residents to have access to the tree products
and thus ease the shortage of drugs in rural areas in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 neem trees have been planted in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ARDP is planning to raise 2,000 individuals, groups,
schools and the municipal authorities to help further plant the
tree in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ARDP has put forward an application and sent a request to
the ministries of Health and Agriculture for permission to
establish a backyard pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
The secretary appealed to donors, environmentalists and
researchers to support the association in the promotion of the
tree, which has been used for years in India for making human and
animal medicines.
</P>
<P>
The association was formed in 1994 to help alleviate poverty
and deprivation among the rural population in the Tanga region.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Adviser to the U.S. Trade
Office Ian Kalisky wrapping up a tow-day visit to Saudi Arabia at
the head of a commercial delegation today called for opening the
Gulf doors for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference before leaving the Kingdom that the
U.S. called on the Gulf Cooperation Council states to encourage
the private sector and the privatization to pave the way for
increased foreign investments, Kuwait News Agency reports from
Saudi capital city of Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
He was also quoted as saying that Oman and Saudi Arabia could
join the World Trade Organization after they have reformed their
economic and trade structures.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official arrived in Saudi Arabia Tuesday in response
to an invitation by Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry
Council for talks on more investments and opening new marketing
outlets for Saudi products in the U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Kalisky said during his stay in Riyadh, he discussed with
Saudi commercial officials means to bolster economic cooperations
between the two countries. Their talks also reviewed the outcome
of activities of joint teams that met in Washington last June and
the seventh round of talks between the two sides held in Bahrain
last year.
</P>
<P>
Deliberations also tackled double taxation, investment and
trade exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalisky toured the Gulf earlier and conferred with Gulf
officials on means to promote economic, investment and trade
ties. In 1996, the Gulf-U.S. trade exchange was up to 25 billion
U.S. dollars or 14 percent over the year before.
</P>

Kalisky also claimed that the U.S. Mideast policy was
mainly to support peace and to ensure closer trade cooperation
with the Middle East countries including north Africa and
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Moi Pays High Tribute to Media's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today said that "the role of the media in the social and economic
development of any nation must not be underestimated."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of a new printing plant here
today, the president stressed that media is "an agent to
influence thought and social changes".
</P>
<P>
He warned that the influence that the media has on the
thinking and conduct of people "must never be used to weaken the
positive aspects of the culture of our people or to undermine the
moral fabric of society".
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that a partisan press is a great danger to
democracy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the Aga Khan, who is on a visit to Kenya,
described the social obligation of the press as "resisting the
siren song of sensationalism and sectarianism (which is used) as
ways to build short-term readership and short-term profits."
</P>
<P>
The new printing plant, which was built by the Nation Group of
Kenya set up by the Aga Khan in 1960, is one of the most advanced
facilities on the African continent today.
</P>
<P>
The Nation Group is the first newspaper company, outside of
the United States, to employ web-offset printing and computerized
type-setting, according to a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the explosion of technology in the media
industry, the Aga Khan challenged the view that "the developing
world in general and Africa in particular, may be left behind by
this revolution."
</P>
<P>
He argued that "it seems to me that societies which have
invested less in old technologies have the potential to propel
themselves into new technologies, provided they have the
commitment and resources to do so."
</P>
<P>
The Nation Group is the largest newspaper publishing company
in east and central Africa. It publishes five newspapers
including the recently launched regional weekly newspaper The
East African.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation has a circulation of 180,000 and the Sunday
Nation's sales are in excess of 220,000. All the three
newspapers are on the internet.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Receives First UN Compensation Payment for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today said it
received the first payment of money from the United Nations
Compensation Committee for individual claimants who fell victims
to Iraq's occupation in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Public Authority for the Assessment of Compensation
(PAAC) said in a statement that it received more than 11.3
million U.S. dollars Tuesday which would cover 3,482 claims of
category "A" (people who left Kuwait and Iraq ) and 1,061
claims of category "C" (individual losses less than 100,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Every claim would receive a maximum of 2,500 U.S. dollars
in accordance of UNCC decision, the statement said. Kuwait
welcomed the payment of the first installment which was made
possible due to the oil-for-food formula that allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of Iraq's proceeds from the oil exports
under the formula goes to the UN compensation program. This
week UNCC made bank transfers amounting to 144 million U.S.
dollars to 63 governments representing 57,636 claimants.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the largest beneficiary of the first installment
receiving 58.3 million U.S. dollars for 23,334 category "A"
claimants. Other large beneficiaries include Sri Lanka, India,
Bangladesh and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The compensation to Kuwaiti claimants would be paid in a
smooth manner with coordination with the ministry of finance,
the central bank, the ministry of justice and local banks,
PAAC's board chairman Khaled Ahmad Al-Modefh said.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNCC ratified 187,000 claims from Kuwait with
a total cost of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait received the largest portion of a first symbolic
payment made in 1994 for 13.4 million U.S. dollars to
relatives of people who died as a result of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait also received some money from the UNCC before, but
it was small amount paid from frozen (Iraqi) assets," the
PAAC official said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait welcomes this development and we hope that
the Kuwaitis and all other victims would be compensated.
</P>
<P>
Based on the assumption that the oil-for-food resolution is
extended in June 1997, it is expected that the second
installment payments could be made in August 1997.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Federico Pena was confirmed as
energy secretary of the United States today by the Senate on a
vote of 99-1.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton applauded the Senate for its "strong
vote of support" to the former mayor of Denver and transportation
secretary during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats and Republicans said Pena was a man of integrity
who had shown an ability to resolve contentious issues during his
four years as transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted last week,
19-0, to confirm Pena to the Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
But the White House's opposition to a Senate bill for a
temporary nuclear waste storage facility in Nevada had held up
Pena's nomination for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Nevada's two senators strongly oppose the bill and Clinton has
promised to veto it.
</P>
<P>
With Pena's Senate approval, there are two more Clinton's
Cabinet nominees, Alexis Herman as labor secretary and Anthony
Lake as director of Central Intelligence Agency, to be confirmed
by Congress.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Positive Step towards Rapprochement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A "thawing" in the strained
relations between Pakistan and India is expected as the two South
Asian countries are to resume their foreign secretary-level talks
later this month after a span of over three years.
</P>
<P>
The four-day foreign secretary-level talks, scheduled for March
28-31 in the Indian capital of New Dehli, are the eighth of its
kind between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which remain suspended since January 1994, are aimed
at paving the way for a meaningful dialogue between the Foreign
Ministers of the two countries early next month in New Delhi and
eventually a summit meeting between the top executive heads of the
two sub-continental states on the sidelines of the South Asian
Summit in the Maldives in May.
</P>
<P>
The major initiative taken by the two countries towards a
rapprochement is widely welcomed by the international community.
It is the first time in the last three years that Pakistan and
India have expressed their determination to break the current
impasse in the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
What is most encouraging is that neither Pakistan nor India
this time has laid down any pre-conditions for the talks, analysts
here noted. The imposition of preconditions has made such talks
fruitless in the past, they said.
</P>
<P>
Their approaches to the issue of preconditions are seen as
practical.
</P>
<P>
The last round of foreign secretary-level talks held in
Islamabad on January 1-3, 1994 failed to make any headway due to
the "basic divergences" between the two countries on the issue of
Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The unconditional resumption of high-level talks reflects the
growing pragmatism in the attitude and mind-set of the leaderships
of Pakistan and India, as peace and development have become the
major trends in today's world, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
An improvement in the long strained bilateral relations between
Pakistan and India is an economic necessity for both countries and
for the South Asian region as a whole, they said.
</P>
<P>
Economic matters, particularly cooperation in the fields of
commerce and trade for common development, have acquired a top
priority in international relations today.
</P>
<P>
And there is a compelling need for those developing countries
like Pakistan and India to spend less on armaments and more on
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of Pakistan and India, the two countries
have fought three wars, two of which were triggered off by the
Kashmir problem. Half a century on, the two countries are still
locked in confrontation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
This insecurity has been lingering on as successive governments
of the two countries have diverted valuable resources, which
should have been used to end poverty and social injustice, to an
arms race.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Pakistan and Indian has also had a
destabilizing effect on the whole South Asian region. The
instability in the region has not only frustrated economic powers
in their efforts to increase investments, but also obstructed the
development of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), of which both Pakistan and India are members, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Improved bilateral ties and the signing of a no war pact
between Pakistan and India could make the investment environment
friendly in the region and help attract large amounts of foreign
capital which is badly needed by the two countries in developing
their national economies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Pakistan, which is eager to get rid of
the ever worsening debt crisis, have remained at a relatively low
level due mainly to two reasons: regional insecurity and domestic
political instability.
</P>
<P>
As for the pro-business government of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, it is facing increasing pressure to open up trade
extensively with India.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Pakistan would benefit most from expansion
of trade with India as many raw materials from India are cheaper
in terms of price and freight rates, which can help reduce the
production cost and give Pakistani businessmen a competitiveness
edge in prices on international markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the items Pakistan is importing from other
countries are available in India at much cheaper rates, which
helps in saving its limited foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The general public in both countries wishes for better ties and
favors an armed conflict-free relationship, despite deep
suspicions on both sides.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts added that the resumption of bilateral talks
is by no means a guarantee for a speedy solution to the Kashmir
issue. Major issues between the two countries remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
What the international community is following with interest is
that whether Pakistan and India would lay the Kashmir issue aside
for a while and concentrate in stead on other issues including
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have cautioned people against expecting too much from
the forthcoming talks in view of the previous talks which all
ended up fruitless.
</P>
<P>
However, the resumption of talks this time is seen as a
practical and forward-looking step taken by the governments of
Pakistan and India in the direction of finding a just, lasting and
mutually satisfactory solution to all the pending issues between
them, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> China Expounds Stand on Right to Self-determination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Alternate representative of the
Chinese delegation Liu Xinsheng said here today that a correct
understanding and application of the principle of
self-determination is of particular importance despite the
profound changes in the international situation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Liu said: "The history of international relations
since World War II demonstrates that when a nation has yet to win
independence and liberation, when a sovereign state is subjected
to alien aggression and occupation, and as a result, the people's
right to self-determination is illegally deprived of, there is no
respect for human rights and freedom to speak of, still less the
country's economic prosperity and social development."
</P>
<P>
"The recognition of the right to self-determination means
respect for a state's sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity, so that people can totally liberate themselves from
foreign aggression and subjugation and choose their own political
and economic systems and development paths according to their
particular national circumstances. No country should impose its
own ideology, social system and development model on others," He
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted, "The domineering over the weak by the strong and the
bullying of the small by the big on various pretexts constitute
gross violations of the Charter of the United Nations and of the
principle of self-determination. And so does interference with
others' affairs by exerting political pressure, imposing economic
sanctions or even resorting to force. Such violations should
naturally be condemned by the international community."
</P>
<P>
However, "it is entirely a country's internal affair to employ
political, legal, economic and administrative measures to deal
with problems concerning ethnic groups through adjusting their
relations", he stressed. "Inappropriate application of the
principle of self-determination to the internal affairs of
multi-national countries apparently exceeds the definition and
scope of the right, as set forth in the above-mentioned
international human rights instruments."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the principle of self-determination should not be
regarded as the basis to address and resolve problems with respect
to ethnic groups in a country, still less should it be used as an
excuse by foreign forces to support or encourage the impairment of
a state's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence." he
added.
</P>
<P>
Liu concluded, "The restoration of the Palestinian people's
rights, including the right to self-determination, and an early,
just and reasonable solution to the question of Palestine are key
to the realization of peace and stability in the Middle East
region. We hope that the parties concerned, guided by the
principle of "land for peace", and based on the relevant
resolutions of the U.N., strive for a comprehensive, just and
lasting settlement to the Middle East question through political
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The current session meets here from March 10 to April 18.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Group, ILO Reach Agreement on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's largest business group
and the International Labor Organization (ILO) signed an agreement
here today to implement a program to raise people's awareness
against child labor among employers of the country's industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) promised to implement the program
with the objective to "sensitize" its members in various
industries on child labor and create public awareness on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to an ILO official, an increased output of carpet
industries in Asia's underdeveloped countries has raised the
demand for child labor, creating more problems relating to child
labor in the region.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates show that Nepal has some five million
children directly or indirectly involved in different forms of
child labor, most of them working in places like carpet factories,
mines, and construction works.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Shakes Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A moderate earthquake with an
estimated magnitude of 3.7 on the Richter scale shook the central
Philippines tonight, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, the second in two days, hit Mindoro island at
8:12 p.m. and aftershocks were expected, the institution said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The institute said it expected no damage caused by the quake
whose epicenter was located under the seabed 23 km northwest of
Puerto Galera islet.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the quake was possibly caused by tectonic
fault.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning, a strong earthquake measuring 7 on the
Richter scale hit Mindanao in the southern Philippines. But the
quake, whose epicenter was also located under the seabed, caused
no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Usually an earthquake with a magnitude of 4 will be damaging if
it hits a densely populated area.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Workers in Singapore Urged to Come Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Human Resources
Minister Lim Ah Lek today urged Malaysian workers in Singapore to
return and work at home.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when commenting on the controversial remarks
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew made about Malaysia's Johor
State.
</P>
<P>
In a recent court affidavit, Lee described Johor as a place
"notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings."
</P>
<P>
Lim said the Singapore government does not appreciate the good
relationship between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which itself is facing a labor shortage, need the
contributions of those who are working in Singapore and welcome
them to come back, the minister said after presenting scholarships
from the Sony group of companies in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia would like them to work here rather than elsewhere
because we are having problems, especially now when the Singapore
government does not seem to value our good relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that his government is not forcing them to
come back but they should do so on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We have pride, they should come back as they are not welcome
there (in Singapore) and that is not the first time he (Lee) said
that and that is not the way to build up a relationship between
the two countries," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has lost many trained workers to Singapore and yet the
Malaysian government never discouraged them from going there
despite a labor shortage, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the number of Malaysian workers in Singapore, Lim said he
did not have the figures as many of them work on their own and
are not required to register with the Manpower Department.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew has made an apology to Malaysia in a statement
which was released today by his press secretary.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Sells 40 Million New State-Owned Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA), the only governmental agency managing public
stakes in state-owned companies, today sold in auction 40 million
shares of the Kuwaiti Company for Building and Repairing Ships in
a further effort to proceed with the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Hesham Al-Otaibi, Director General of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
through which the shares were sold, said the primary price of
each share was 206 fils (0.68 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the private International Investment Group Company
bought 10 million shares at a price of 208 fils (0.69 dollars) per
share while the Kuwait National Bank, a commercial bank taking
part in the auction on behalf of a group of investors, bought the
other 30 million shares at a cost of 206 fils (0.68 dollars) per
share.
</P>
<P>
The amount of shares sold today constitutes 30 percent of the
company's total shares. The KIA and the Kuwaiti Oil Tankers
Company, the country's only state-owned oil transporting company,
together hold 108 million shares of the company, accounting for
81 percent of the company's total shares.
</P>
<P>
The auction was within the framework of the KIA's policy
to promote private investments.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait so far has raised about 600 million dinars (about 2
billion dollars) from its privatization plan launched in 1994
which is designed to widen the investor base, reduce state
economic controls and boost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shares were sold off through auctions and public
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
KIA director-general Ali Al-Bader said last December that the
authority, which had already sold its stake in about 15 Kuwaiti
firms, is in charge of a plan to sell state holdings in about 60
local firms and to prepare for a second phase to end state
involvement in some public services like water, electricity and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Participation in Kuwait's privatization plan is exclusive to
nationals of the Gulf Cooperation Council states including Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Another 65 million shares of the company would be offered to
public subscription after the March auction at a rate yet to be
decided, the KIA official said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Active brain cells have been
cultivated in a Chinese satellite some 300 km away from the earth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said here today
that the achievement indicates that China has met the advanced
world standard in biological experiments in space.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33 different species of bio-products, weighing 91
kg, were put into a satellite launched on October 20, 1996, for a
cultivation experiment.
</P>
<P>
After the satellite's return, Chinese scientists spent three
months studying the results, which have shown that China has for
the first time obtained in-space active brain cells, solid seaweed
with a high resistance to salt, and high-quality fungi.
</P>
<P>
Other successful experiments proved that high-grade plants can
sprout and grow, and that insects can breed in space.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists were also excited to find fixed cells of
different micro seaweeds had grown in space, which suggests a
bright future for the development of biological reactors in space.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew Makes Apology to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew today apologized to Malaysia for his controversial
remarks on Johor, a southern state of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed this evening, Lee's press
secretary said that the senior minister "had no intention to cause
offense" in the sworn affidavit he made on January 27 in a court
hearing on defamation cases against opposition Workers' Party
member Tang Liang Hong.
</P>
<P>
Lee said: "I was baffled. He (Tang) claimed his life was under
threat. But, of all places, he went to Johor. That place is
notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings. It does not
make sense for a person who claims to be fearful for his life to
go to a place like Johor."
</P>
<P>
This angered Malaysia and Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi demanded Wednesday that Lee apologize for
the "callous" statement.
</P>
<P>
Lee's press secretary explained: "The Senior Minister has not
been to Johor since he stepped down as Prime Minister in
1990....It was his perception based on reports he had read in the
press."
</P>
<P>
He said said Lee made the remarks not in open court and it was
"unfortunate" that it became public by the way the litigation
developed.
</P>
<P>
"The affidavit sought to rebut the reasons Tang had given for
leaving Singapore for Johor Baru immediately after the general
election," which was held on January 2.
</P>
<P>
However, the press secretary said, the public was confused over
the terms and effect of the Mareva injunction. As a result, the
parties applied and the judge ordered open court hearings so that
the public would have the facts.
</P>
<P>
Tang also asked for an open court hearing when he sought to
challenge the impartiality of the judge, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This meant that the affidavit would now be discussed in open
Court. As a result it has now been reported in the press. This was
not anticipated when Mr Lee first applied for the Mareva."
</P>
<P>
"He had no intention that his affidavit made in support of
court proceedings in Chambers should affect the good relations
between Malaysia and Singapore," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Release of POWs From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urged today Islamic
world to support the efforts to get freed Iraqi prisoners of war
allegedly detained in Iran for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq News Agency quoted an government information official as
saying that thousands of Iraqi POWs, who were captured during the
eight-year war between the two countries, are still detained in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The official said in the interview with the agency that Iraq
had freed 39,044 Iranian POWs in August 1990 and Iraq is no longer
detaining any Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Iran's Prisoners of War Committee, Abdullah Nejfi
recently accused Iraq of still holding a large number of Iranian
prisoners of war and refusing to release them.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) has affirmed several times, the latest of which was
in a statement issued in Geneva on December 29 last year, that
thousands of Iraqi POW's were still detained in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The POW's problem between Iraq and Iran is the most thorny
issue that has prevented the two countries from normalizing their
relations after ending the war in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Desert-Based Aerospace Town Turned into Oasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Every year, a large number of
outsiders, both Chinese and foreigners, visit the China Jiuquan
Satellite Launching Base in Gansu Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Located in a vast desert, the small town that surrounds the
base holds a certain appeal for travelers, with lush greenery and
flowers blooming everywhere. The only bleakness on the horizon is
a bald, brown mountain on the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of local residents, most of whom are
employed in the country's aerospace industry, the desert town has
been turned into an oasis.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the base is one of the oldest and
largest in the country to conduct experimental satellite and
missile launches, including "Dongfanghong No. 1," the country's
first satellite sent into orbit in April, 1969.
</P>
<P>
The base was first called "Dongfeng." Chinese President Jiang
Zemin inscribed "Dongfeng Aerospace Town" during a visit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some locals recall that when tens of thousands of soldiers came
to build the base, it was nothing but endless desert, barren save
for spotty tufts of grass blowing in the dry wind.
</P>
<P>
Kang Xiuying, a retired teacher from a local kindergarten who
has spent most of her life there, said that when they first
arrived, the salt and soda content in the soil was so high that
people had to wrap their feet and legs with cloth to prevent their
skin from becoming parched and cracked.
</P>
<P>
In summer, she recalled, the scorching cobblestones burned
people's feet, even through the soles of their shoes. The bone-dry
air caused chronic chapped lips and nosebleeds, and everyone had a
suntan.
</P>
<P>
The stark reality of life in the desert has prompted local
residents, soldiers and officers alike, to consider the issue of
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Young people now are told repeatedly not to damage
trees. Retired driver Zhang Zhan'ao, like many other residents in
the town, has planted flowers and fruit trees in his courtyard.
</P>
<P>
Large forested and grassy areas have been built up on the edge
of the town, while large tracts of farmlands have been cultivated
nearby. A reservoir capable of storing 18 million cubic meters
lies beside the paddy and wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
In the past, pilots flying overhead had trouble seeing the base
below, as the small town blended into the desert due to its lack
of green. Now, with a green coverage of 61 percent, the base is
easily detected from the sky.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hopes to Improve Ties With Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministry today reacted
quickly toward Canada's decision to suspend diplomatic activities
in Nigeria, saying it is looking forward to an earlier resumption
of the normal operations of the Canadian high commission.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government on Wednesday announced the temporary
suspension of operations at the Canadian High Commission in Lagos
due to "safety concerns".
</P>
<P>
However, the suspension does not mean that Nigeria will break
off bilateral diplomatic relations with Canada, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said this morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described it as "groundless" that the Canadians
claimed officials at the high commission or embassy have not been
given the security assurances by the Nigerian side.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of the Canadian foreign ministry on
Wednesday, the Canadian embassy in Lagos has been without a
security officer since last December and efforts by Canada to
send a replacement have been blocked by the failure of the
Nigerian government to issue a visa.
</P>
<P>
But this claim is "absolutely groundless," said the Nigerian
spokesman, adding that the Nigerian government hopes Canada will
resume the normal operations of its high commission as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria close down its high commission in Canada last
September in an adjustment of its diplomatic missions and
personnel abroad due to the short of fund.
</P>
<P>
The move, however, is seen by observers as sort of retaliation
to Canada's tough stand against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been fraught with
diplomatic hiccups following Canada's consistent calls for
sanctions against Nigeria over its human rights record which
forced the Commonwealth to suspend Nigeria in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, Canada has since maintained a
hostile attitude toward Nigeria, especially within the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), established for
monitoring human rights situation in its African member states.
</P>
<P>
Last June, when CMAG decided not to impose further sanctions
against Nigeria, Canada, a member of CMAG, said it was going
ahead for some more sanctions unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
With the temporary closure of the Canadian high commission in
Nigeria, observers here said there might be an even glimmer
future between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Add 2,100 Airliners in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's passenger turnover
through air transport is expected to increase by 11.5 percent
annually in the coming 20 years, bringing the need for an
additional 2,100 planes by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 large and medium-sized aircraft should be added by
then, according to an annual report by the China Aviation
Industrial Corporation under the Civil Aviation Administration of
China.
</P>
<P>
The report says that with the growth of China's economic
strength, civil aviation will also develop quickly. Although the
yearly increase in air transport is lower than 23.4 percent for
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), it will be much higher than
the world average in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, 150-seat airliners will still account for most of the
country's aviation fleet, followed by 200-seat and 300-seat
airplanes, the report predicts.
</P>
<P>
The Annual Report on Predictions for China's Airline Market was
first published in 1991, and is updated each year.

Chinese Cycling Association (CCA) announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting officials from the French Cycling Association had

sprint event to help China prepare for the 1998 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
France will invite Chinese moutain bikers to compete in the
Tour de France mountain bike event and support China in its bids
to stage a leg in the 1999 Mountain Bike World Cup series and
World Junior Cycling Championships in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the details of the cooperation have yet to be finalised,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The CCA said the cooperation will help tremendously in its
long-term development plan which aims at winning a cycling medal
at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 and clinching a gold medal at
the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The best result that China had at the Olympics was a seventh
place while France won five cycling golds at Atlanta last summer.

BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Esmat Abdul-Maguid,
secretary-general of the Arab League arrived here today for
celebrations marking the Day of Unity with South Lebanon, which
falls on March 14.
</P>
<P>
At the Beirut International Airport, Abdul-Maguid called for
a unity of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the occasion of the South Lebanon's Day
demonstrates the determination of the Lebanese and the Arab nation
to prove that they are "one nation."
</P>
<P>
A series of nation-wide activities are scheduled for today and
Friday to mark the first Israeli aggression of Lebanon on March
14, 1978.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab League's role in seeking a solution of the south
Lebanon's problem, Abdul-Maguid said that the organization is not
"hesitant or reluctant at all to do what it is demanded to do and
what it sees as a duty."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent Israeli decision to build additional
Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the Arab League chief
stressed the decision "threatens the peace process" in the region
and constitutes another challenge for the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israeli decision was not only
condemned by all the Arab states, but also condemned by most of
the countries in the United Nations and in the U.N. security
council.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that contacts are currently being held between
Arab leaders in light of the Israeli challenges and these
contacts "could lead to an Arab summit, small-sized or enlarged."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian military authorities
today rejected an allegation by Israeli military authorities
that Iran is trying to purchase ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not need to "utilize non-conventional weapons and
it procures its needs from domestic sources," a high-ranking
military official was quoted by the state-run news agency IRNA
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not give the name and identity

</P>
<P>
An anonymous Israeli military official in Moscow, Russia,
Monday reportedly threatened that Israel will act to prevent
arming Iran with ballistic missiles if persuasion fails to
do the job.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military authorities responded by saying that such
allegations are raised to shift the crisis elsewhere from the
territories the Jewish state has occupied and these attempts are
doomed to fail, according to the IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official described the conventional military
cooperation between Iran and other countries as a routine
practice at an international level.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has repeatedly expressed its interest in
promotion of its defensive cooperation in the Gulf and with
neighboring countries and has taken steps in this direction.

To cater to the latest developments, China will modify the 1984
law and those formulated earlier in the near future, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Stepping up legislation will provide an effective guarantee
for the system of regional autonomy of national minorities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the Nationalities Committee will
promulgate a law concerning protection of the rights and interests
of people of the national minorities scattered around, a law on
the language and characters of the ethnic groups and regulations
on autonomy in the five autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang expressed his confidence that a relatively
complete system of socialist legality and supervision for issues
relating to national minorities will be set up before the year
2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu condemned shooting that occurred today near the
Israeli-Jordanian boder in which seven Israeli students were
killed and a dozen others injured.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian soldier opened fired without provocation at a
group of Israeli school girls from Beit Shemesh of central
Israel, who were on a school outing in the scenic Naharayim
area on the Jordanian side of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that any kind of violence against the innocent
was unacceptable in whatever terms and should be rejected. He said
nothing could legitimatize violence, stressing that "there is no
greater danger (than violence) to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We can have disagreements, they are inevitable in any kind of
process and negotiation. But we cannot pursue peace unless we
pursue it peacefully," he said, referring to the current disputes
between Israel and Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged the Jordanian government to bring those guilty
to trial and to investigate how this incident took place.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported Jordanian King Hussein had telephoned
Israeli President Ezer Weizman to express his shock and sorrow
over the killing, and to offer his condolences to families
of the victims. The monarch promised that he would do
everything possible to calm the current tense situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti has
sent an expert team to investigate the incident. He also expressed
condolences to the Israeli government and the families of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place near the Israeli-Jordanian border,
which has been relatively calm since the two sides signed a peace
treaty in 1994. Naharayim is an scenic enclave in the Jordan
Valley which was returned to Jordan by Israel under the 1994 peace
treaty, but Israelis still have full access to the area for
sightseeings.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident also occurred during a time of rising tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hussein and Netanyahu recently exchanged angry letters over the
current Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock. Hussein strongly
criticized Israeli government for endangering the peace process
with its hardline policies.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Consumer Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China has established a basic
legal framework for protecting consumer rights and interests that
is in step with the substantial growth in consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau said today that
China's work on legal affairs for safeguarding consumer rights and
interests has improved steadily since China initiated the reform
and opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China has approved over 200 laws and
regulations related to economic affairs, more than 60 of which are
directly associated with consumer rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
These include the "Law on the Protection of Consumers' Rights
and Interests," the "Law against Unfair Competition" and laws on
product quality and food hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Providing further protection are the consumer groups which have
sprung up across the country. The China National Consumers'
Association, founded in 1984, has opened branches in provinces,
cities and counties. Last year, it received half a million
complaints and resolved 88.7 percent of them, recovering more than
300 million yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China still has much to do to protect the
rights and interests of consumers, partly because consumers don't
know how to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted jointly by the State Statistics Bureau, the
People's Bank of China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
and ministries of Labor, Public Health and Civil Affairs in
December 1996-January 1997 shows that nearly a quarter of the
Chinese urban consumers, or some 50 million, reported abuses of
their rights last year, involving a loss of about 6.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that only 22.3 percent these consumers voiced
their complaints; nearly 70 percent accepted their situation
without coming forward.
</P>
<P>
Some of those who did seek justice took their gripes back to
the shops where they purchased the goods or to other service
outlets. Some complained to consumers' associations or contacted
the manufacturers. Only 1.1 percent took legal action.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that purchase of fake or inferior quality
products is the major source of abuse to consumers' rights and
interests.

area when a Jordanian soldier opened fire at them.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place in Naharayim in the northern part of
the Israeli-Jordanian border, when dozens of Israeli students
from Beit Shemesh came by buses on school outing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World's Interest High in 4th Hortec Fair in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The East Africa's fourth
International Horticultural Trade Exhibition opened in downtown
Nairobi today, attracting a considerable number of overseas
horticultural buyers, dealers and auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
Interest in the three-day exhibition is so high that all
available stand space at the Kenyatta International Conference
Center had been snapped up by November.
</P>
<P>
Among more than 120 participants of the 1997 show are those
from South Africa, France, the Netherlands, Israel, Germany,
Britain and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Displays range from root stock, seeds, fertilizers,
agro-chemicals and greenhouses to power generations and water
pumping equipment, cold storage and transport.
</P>
<P>
Cut flowers, in various delicate colors and shapes, are in
abundance there, as overseas and local suppliers of root stock
display their end products.
</P>
<P>
A series of seminars on Kenya's horticultural industry will be
held during the trade fair, sponsored by the Fresh Produce
Exporters Association of Kenya (FPEAK).
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been rated internationally over recent years as a
major supplier of flowers and vegetables, notably cut flowers,
fresh green beans, snow peas and avocados.
</P>
<P>
Fresh produce exports are the fourth foreign exchange earner
after tourism, tea and coffee for this eastern African country,
said Darius Mbela, the minister of agriculture, livestock
development, at the beginning of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
He vowed the government will continue to support the industry
through research work, the provision of extension services as
well as the development of an enabling policy framework.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan horticultural exports reached 83,496 tons in 1996, up
16.4 percent from the previous year, according to data from
FPEAK.
</P>
<P>
The country is expecting to export more than 100,000 tons of
horticultural products annually by the turn of the century, local
reports said.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's jobless rate last
month climbed to 8.8 from 8.5 percent, as the proportion of
full-time work to total employment fell to its lowest level on
record.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in its bulletin
released today said 19,900 people became unemployed in February,
pushing the jobless rate to its highest level since last October.
</P>
<P>
Following continued strong growth in part-time positions in the
past year, the ratio of full-time work to total employment fell to
a record low of 74.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the unemployment rate, Prime Minister John Howard
said that "there are a number of things we've already done which,
over time, ought to lift economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"We have changed the industrial system. Business investment is
running at a historically high level and we have very low rates of
inflation. Now all of those things are benign and positive for
economic growth," he told reporters in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to his party supporters yesterday, he said that
economic growth would need to accelerate from the present level of
about 3.5 percent to between 4 and 4.5 percent before the jobless
rate could be substantially reduced.

<HEADLINE> Meeting On Promoting Peaceful Reunification Of China In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The fifth executive council of
the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification was
held today here in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that they will remember Deng Xiaoping's wish
and strive to reunify the motherland with the principle of
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and president of the China Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, which was founded in
September of 1988, reported that adherence to the "one China"
principle is fundamental to peaceful reunification and developing
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been significant achievements in the
campaign to stop separatism and "Taiwan independence", anti-China
forces worldwide are still blocking China's reunification, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are trying to turn the island into an
"independent political entity", while engaging in activities that
create "two Chinas", he said, pointing out that the so-called
"national development council" of the Taiwan authorities recently
further demonstrated its attempt to create a separation and to
hinder the reunification process.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China's reunification requires efforts of the
people of Taiwan, and that more exchanges should be made with them.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tinghan, deputy head of the United Front Work Department
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, voiced
the hope that the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful
Reunification will continue to implement the guidelines of
President Jiang Zemin's important speech on promoting
cross-straits relations, and increase mutual understanding of
people on both sides of the straits and economic exchanges, and
make new contributions to the reunification and rejuvenation of
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Human Rights Reports (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary says that the Chinese state, in fact, protects
the freedom of religion of the citizens and their normal religious
activities in accordance with the law. No one will be punished
just for religious beliefs or for normal religious activities. At
the same time, people cannot avoid penalties for criminal
activities simply because they believe in religion or flaunt the
banner of religion.
</P>
<P>
The third part of the commentary criticizes the "Reports" for
using a lot of space to accuse China of having no freedom of
speech, of the press, or of information in order to vilify China.
</P>
<P>
It is common knowledge that there can be no freedom of speech,
of the press, or of information in the world without some limits,
the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
China's lawful limits to freedom of speech, the press, and
information fully conform to the spirit of the international
convention on human rights and to international practice, it says.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the commentary notes, the "Reports" is not
concerned about the question of whether Chinese citizens really
enjoy the freedom of speech, of the press, or information. Any
politically unprejudiced person would not deny that freedoms,
including the speech, press and information freedoms that the
Chinese people enjoy today greatly surpass those of any periods of
Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Chinese people now have many more individual
freedoms than ever before, Anthony Saich, representative of the
Ford Foundation in charge of China affairs said in February, 1997,
The commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
Former US President George Bush said on February 24, 1997 that
Chinese citizens today have more human rights and individual
freedoms than at the time he left the country in 1975, according
to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
In its last part, the commentary states with numerous facts
that during the past year, great improvements were made in China's
human rights situation. In 1996, China's economy achieved
sustained, rapid and healthy growth, democratic and legislative
construction was obviously enhanced, and people's rights to exist
and develop and other human rights further improved.
</P>
<P>
To reach its anti-China, anti-Communism aims, the "Reports"
ignore the facts and describe China, which is constantly
developing, as a country with worsening human rights conditions,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It says that using human rights to carry out public opinion
struggle against China is a full manifestation of the stubborn
Cold War mentality of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports", started in the days of Cold War as part of its
"human rights diplomacy", was actually used to meet Cold War
political demands, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that after the ending of the Cold War, the
United States takes socialist China, which persists in its own
road of development, as its imaginary enemy, and frequently
attacks China by using the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The annual human rights "Reports" of the US State Department
have therefore become an important tool for opposing China,
vilifying China, and interfering in the internal affairs of China,
it says.

The report by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) announced that
the economic growth was registered at 4.5 percent during the
last Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
The banking authorities said earlier that Iran is expected to
earn an oil export revenue of 19 billion U.S. dollars in the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The revenue gained from oil and gas exports amounted to 14.5
billion dollars in the first three quarter of the current year,
the CBI report said.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil exports stood at 2.36 billion dollars in the
period, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The total value of imports reached 11.63 billion dollars in
the past nine months. The trade surplus was 5.23 billion dollars
in the period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that all due debts were paid on schedule and
2.5 billion dollars were added to the foreign exchange reserves
of the country as a result of the surplus trade.
</P>
<P>
Continued economic stability has led to reducing the
inflation rate to less than 24 percent during the current
year. The average rate of inflation was 49.4 percent in the last
Iranian year, said the report.

<HEADLINE> More Arms Uncovered in Kromah's Country Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force, known as ECOMOG, reported on Wednesday the discovery of
more weapons at another home of former Liberian warlord Alhaji
Kromah outside Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Kromah, leader of the defunct ULIMO-K warring faction, has
been put under house arrest since ECOMOG troops found a big
quantity of arms at his residence in Monrovia last Friday with
his fellow Mandingo fighters claiming it a plot against him by
protest actions.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted ECOMOG sources as saying
that troops again discovered scores of heavy calibre guns, rocket
propelled grenade guns and bombs from Kromah's residence in
Voinjama in Loffa County, some 260 km north of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A container full of rocket-propelled grenade bombs was also
taken from the ULIMO-K barracks in the town.
</P>
<P>
The search was conducted following information provided by
residents of Loffa County, according to a statement issued on
Wednesday after a meeting between ECOMOG Force Commander
Major-General Victor Malu and members of the International
Mediatio Committee of Ambassadors and United Nations officials.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian Justice Ministry said earlier this week that
Kromah will appear before a magistrate to answer charges of
illegally stashing arms against him, as ECOMOG has completed
investigation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a local newspaper owned by Kromah, The National,
reported that he was due to appear in court before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of a week-long grace period for former faction
fighters to surrender their arms after the January 31 deadline,
ECOMOG has recovered some 920 weapons and large quantities of
ammunition from various parts of Liberia, Malu said at
Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malu had announced before the deadline that after that date
ECOMOG will hunt the hidden arms in the country and any one
caught with weapons will be treated as common criminal.

<HEADLINE> HK Re-exports, Imports Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's re-exports and
imports edged up in January while domestic exports fell by a big
margin, according to latest government statistics on external
trade.
</P>
<P>
In the first month of this year, the value of re-exports grew
by 0.9 percent over a year earlier to 102.1 billion HK dollars (13
billion US dollars), while domestic exports decreased by 9.1
percent to 17.3 billion HK dollars (2.2 billion US dollars).
Meanwhile, imports picked up by 1.1 percent to 131.8 billion HK
dollars (17 billion US dollars), the Census and Statistics
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the department said that the external trade
figures for a single month at the beginning of each year tend to
be fluctuating as a result of different timing of the Lunar New
Year Holidays. It is more meaningful to make comparisons over a
longer period.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Human Rights Reports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of China's
State Council published a commentary today refuting the United
States' attempt to provoke a confrontation and interfere in
China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that on January 30, 1997, the US State
Department released its "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices
for 1996", in which it commented improperly on the human rights
situation in 194 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It says the "China part" of the "Reports" continues to spread
slanderous rumors against China in disregard of the Chinese
people's strong opposition in the past years, thus laying bare the
attempt of the "Reports" to create confrontation and interfere in
China's internal affairs by using the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The commentary with about 8,000 words, entitled "Another act of
creating confrontation by using the pretext of human rights,"
falls into four parts.
</P>
<P>
In the first part, the commentary points out that one of the
major characteristics of the US State Department's "Reports" is to
attempt to mislead the public by using materials that were proven
worthless long ago, and tried to turn lies into truth by repeating
them.
</P>
<P>
It says that most of the "new" materials and cases provided by
the "Reports" are fabricated and false.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Reports" alleged that Ngawang Choephel, a
foreign scholar visiting Tibet, was detained by Chinese
authorities for making a documentary about Tibetan performing
arts, and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the fact is that the 30-year-old
Ngawang Choephel entered China in June, 1995, having been sent by
the Dalai Lama clique to engage in intelligence activities under
the guise of collecting materials on the Tibetan performing arts,
using funding and equipment provided by a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tibet, he collected information in Lhasa,
Shannan, Nyingchi and Xigaze by using methods conforming to the
"information collection plan" he drafted before the visit, the
commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
Having gained sufficient evidence of Nagawang Choephel's
espionage activities, the commentary says, China's public security
departments arrested him in accordance with the law, and Nagawang
Choephel made a full confession of his espionage
activities.

<HEADLINE> Two Starve to Death in E. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Two men starved to death in
eastern Uganda, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Ananasio Onyago of Soni Parish, and Okoth Omuto of Mifuni
Parish, West Budama County, Eastern Tororo District, died in a
prolong famine, "the Monitor" reported.
</P>
<P>
And there were constant reports about collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Zebedayo Omoit, a local council chairman of Tororo District,
said a man collapsed at the official's home when he was asking
for help. The man was served a cup of tea later.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Pallisa District, headmaster of Kamonkoli Primary
School hardly escaped a lynch when he appealed the parents of his
pupils for money to feed the children with a porridge every
morning at 10:00.
</P>
<P>
The children were suffering from increasing case of collapsing
in recent two weeks. Earlier reports said the children in the
drought-hit area drinking water to reduce their hunger pain.
</P>
<P>
The worsening famine sparked exodus of rural population to
towns, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The residents in the drought-hit eastern area were selling
their assets at very low price for money. Patrick Okumi, a
resident of Eastern Kumi District, sold his bicycle at 35,000
Ugandan Shillings (some 35 U.S. Dollars) in Malera sub-county
market.
</P>
<P>
He said he can buy some 10 km of beans and some potatoes now
to support his family of eight some three weeks. He bought the
bicycle at 92,000 Ugandan Shillings (some 92 U.S. Dollars) last
November.
</P>
<P>
Present famine in Uganda was caused by long dry spells from
last December up to now. The eastern part suffers the most
critical food conditions. Earlier reports said 19 of 39 Ugandan
districts have been affected and some 2.1 million of residents
have been suffering from the famine.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said famine looms in western Uganda.

HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- One out of ten Hong Kong
teenagers thinks of suicide, with loneliness and depression as the
main causes, a recent study shows.

The thought occurs in 9.5 percent of primary school students
compared with 6.7 percent in secondary schools, according to a
survey conducted by the Center for Child Development at the Hong
Kong Baptist University.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that suicidal youngsters could easily turn
inner anger and frustration into violence or drug abuse. They
suggested that children be taught to open up and share thoughts
with their peers.

<HEADLINE> HK Papers Highlight Budget Straddling Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- All Hong Kong newspapers today
devoted full pages to Hong Kong's 1997-98 financial budget, which
was unfolded Wednesday by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in today's commentary that the
budget, entitled "Continuity in a Time of Change," is a unique
one that is to straddle the handover on July 1, 1997, when China
resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong. The budget
is unique for it was based on consensus reached between China and
Britain through negotiations of the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese paper said that the budget is "steady and prudent"
because it follows strictly the traditional principle of "living
within one's means" and complies with the provisions of the Basic
Law, the constitutional document of Hong Kong after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Express News said in a commentary that the new budget
basically makes everybody happy and is conducive to the smooth
transition. The huge public wealth will lay a solid foundation for
the economic development of Hong Kong after the handover, says
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary forecast on Wednesday that as Hong
Kong becomes a Special Administrative Region of China, it will
have total reserves of around 330 billion HK dollars (42.3
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao commented that the budget shoulders a historic
mission. On the one hand, it must respond to the far-reaching
significance of the resumption of the exercise of China's
sovereignty, and on the other hand, it must respond to the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese daily said that many Hong Kong people and social
groups have expressed their satisfactions with the new budget,
which, they believe, will help to increase Hong Kong people's
confidence, and help the smooth transition and future development
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's commentary said that the budget should be
scrutinized by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), the
interim legislature of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The budget covers the last three months under the British rule
and the first nine months of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR). The 1997-98 financial year runs from April 1,
1997, to March 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Strike by Uganda Railway Workers Goes on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A fresh strike by Ugandan
Railways Corporation workers to Tororo, eastern Uganda has
paralysed cargo and passenger traffic to and from Nairobi, Kenya,
reported the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 passengers heading for Uganda were yesterday stranded

and February plus arrears for December last year, January and
February this year.
</P>
<P>
The fresh strike followed an earlier one in January this year
by railway workers in Jinja, Kampala and Tororo main stations in
Uganda over similar claims.
</P>
<P>
The strikers were quoted by the paper as saying that the
corporation had pledged in January to pay their salary and
arrears at the end of every month but the contract was allegedly
breached prompting the fresh strike.

LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The French Embassy to Nigeria
today confirmed that 20 foreign nationals, including 16 French,
three British and one American, have been held hostage off the
Nigerian coast by local people.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners were working on an oil platform belonging to
the ETPM company of France, which is currently trying to contact
them in Warri town, Delta state, southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The villagers who are holding the foreign nationals have not
made any demand so far, according to a French Foreign Ministry
statement this morning.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not say when the incident happened.
</P>
<P>
The French Embassy said "the situation is quiet" in Warri and
negotiation is underway between ETPM and villagers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source close to the foreign business circle in
Lagos told Xinhua that oil workers in Worri are said to be on
strike for better pay. However, this cannot be confirmed at the

<P>
MACAO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to launch an
"Afforestation Week" from this coming weekend to improve local
citizens' awareness of the importance of planting and protecting
trees.
</P>
<P>
During the coming week, dozens of local community groups will
participate in various activities including lectures, exhibitions
and contests of potted plants. New books on the theme will be
published, and students will plant trees.
</P>
<P>
The event is held annually in the territory, whose land area
totals 21 square kilometers. Although it costs the government
515,000 patacas (about 65,000 US dollars) this year, officials say
 it is worthwhile since the green space in Macao is still small.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of afforested area in the Macao Peninsula, where 95
percent of the population live, grew from 230,000 square meters in
1988 to 450,000 square meters in 1996. Most of Macao's two islands
are covered by trees.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Some of the most important and
influential leaders in the world of sports will address an
international seminar in Hong Kong in June on sports marketing in
the next century, organizers announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve sports leaders from around the world will provide their
views on the future direction of sports at the two-day seminar
named "Marketing of Sports in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
"This is the most ambitious and prestigious conference the SDB
has ever organized," Andrew Ma, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Sports Development Board (SDB), told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen, in the last 10 years or so, marketing has played
an increasingly important role in the world of sports. The
Olympics, the World Cup, the Asian Games and the Commonwealth
Games and other big sporting spectacles, once organized on a
largely amateur basis, have been transformed into multi-million
dollar extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
"As more money and sponsorship have been poured into sports,
sports and business have been irrevocably intertwined," he added.
</P>
<P>
The speakers will offer their views on the future economic,
social and political impacts on sports, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Michael Payne, marketing director of the
International Olympic Committee, Wei Jizhong, secretary-general of
the Chinese Olympic Committee, and Christopher Renner, general
manager of ISL, Asia Pacific, who oversees marketing of Hong
Kong's professional football league and sponsorship programs for
Hong Kong's Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"What more opportune time than now, with the approach of a new
millennium, to examine this question. And what more appropriate a
 place than Hong Kong, on the verge of an historical and exciting
handover to China, to play host to this conference," the SDB chief
said.
</P>
<P>
The Conference scheduled for June 13-14 is organized by the SDB
in conjunction with the Hong Kong Tourist Association and the Hong
Kong Dragon Boat Association.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Human Rights Reports (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second part of the commentary notes that in order to cook
up charges for China's "violations of human rights", the "Reports"
refer to criminals and people who violate the law in China, or who
harm national security and public order as "political dissidents"
and "political prisoners".
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" say that Wang Dan is a "political prisoner" who
was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment in 1996 for "announcing his
attention to investigate China's human rights situation in 1994".
</P>
<P>
But, the commentary says, the fact is that Wang was sentenced
to four years imprisonment with one year deprivation of political
rights in 1991 for working to subvert the Chinese government, in
clear violation of the country's criminal code, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
After he was released on parole on February 17, 1993, he
contacted overseas anti-China organizations in secret and became
involved in a series of activities that were intended to overturn
the Chinese government and harm national security. He was arrested
in accordance with the law on October 3, 1996, according to the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that Wang Dan was sentenced to prison not
because he was a dissident who announced "his intention to
investigate China's human rights situation", but because he
violated the law by harming national security, it says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the commentary says, there are no "political
prisoners" in China, and people do not violate the law merely by
expressing their own ideology or opinions about public affairs. No
one is punished by law just because he or she holds a different
political view.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the "Reports" accuses China of persecuting
religious believers and encroaching on freedom of religion. To
support its accusations, the "Reports" cites people who used
religion to cover their criminal activities and who were therefore
dealt with in accordance with the law, calling them "defendants of
conscience".

area in the Jordanian side of the Jordan River, which had been
occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel returned this area to Jordan under the peace treaty
signed in 1994, but Israelis still have full access to the
favorite area for sightseeing and outing.
</P>
<P>
Today's shooting occurred during a time of rising tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu recently exchanged angry letters over the current
Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock. King Hussein has strongly
criticized Israeli government for endangering the peace process
with its hardline policies.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Refuted US Bill on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China voiced its strong
opposition to US interference in China's internal affairs here
today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the US House of Representatives recently
approved a bill regarding Hong Kong, asking China to honor the
Sino-British Joint declaration and accusing China of setting up
the Provisional Legislative Council of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the report at a routine press conference
here today, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai said
that there are some people in the US Congress who know nothing
about the reality in Hong Kong and have no idea about China's Hong
Kong Policy. However, he added, without having any necessary
in-depth study, they went so far as to approve some so-called bill
that gratuitously questions whether China will comply with the
Sino-British Joint Declaration after July 1, 1997, incites
suspicions about China's sincerity and determination for
implementing its relevant policies, and threatens that the US
would take measures to alter the relevant US practices in the case
that Hong Kong's high level of autonomy and the American political
and economic interests there are damaged after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly oppose and will absolutely not accept such a
wrongful move of grossly interfering in China's internal affairs,"
Cui stated.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Hong Kong is the business between the Chinese and
British governments before July 1, 1997, and will be China's
domestic affairs after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, he
said, adding that no foreign government or organization has the
right to meddle in Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
Now that Hong Kong's return to its motherland is already a
certainty, which is the general wish of the people, the United
States ought to try and play a positive role for the benefit of
Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity and
stability, Cui said. "This will not only meet China's interests,
but also serve the US fundamental interests," he noted.

</P>
<P>
-- The rift between the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG)
Ltd and ENEL of Italy over the European company's pull-out of a

<HEADLINE> China to become World's Second Largest PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sales of personal computers in
China will reach eight to ten million units in 2000, making the
country the world's second largest PC market after Japan, a local
electronics expert predicts.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Muchang, head of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's
Computer and Microelectronics Research Center, who made the remark
in an interview with Xinhua, says that China's computer industry
experienced "certain substantial changes" last year.
</P>
<P>
Business in the computer and related industries was 92 billion
yuan last year, up nearly 50 percent from 1995, and hardware sales
were worth 71.5 billion yuan, an increase of 52 percent. Software
products posted sales of 9.2 billion yuan, up 35.3 percent, while
other information services amounted to 11.3 billion yuan, a rise
of almost 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Now fifth worldwide, China's share of the global market
increased from 0.5 percent some years ago to two percent last
year," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mass production of computer components has allowed
PC sellers to cut costs by a bigger margin than ever. "Three
computer parts and components production centers have sprung up in
the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Valley, and the Bohai Sea
Rim, which includes Beijing and Tianjin," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Local computers can now keep up with international developments
and promote their own brand-name products. Major producers,
including Legend, Great Wall, Founder, and Donghai, now compete
with overseas corporations, including such famous brands as IBM,
Compaq, and Hewllet Packard. Last year Chinese producers even
launched price-cutting campaigns to grab a larger share from
overseas rivals.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, Chinese producers had a 26 percent market
share, and "the development trend this year will go further
upward," he said. Foreign PCs still have 44 percent of the
market. The rest were "clone products," he said.
</P>
<P>
New technical gadgets have also become popular in
China. ChinaNet, which is connected to Internet, saw the number of
users jump from 3,000 in 1995 to more than 100,000 last year, Zhou
said. Foreign technology and equipment providers are now taking a
closer look at the burgeoning market in China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Exports Boosted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- With much coffee streaming in
from neighboring countries, coffee exports boosted rapidly in
Uganda, reported the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Coffee experts were quoted as saying that Uganda could even
occupy the second spot on the world market with the continued
inflow from Zaire, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean Ugandans are not growing much coffee," a
source at uganda coffee development authority was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the influx, processors and exporters complained of a
declining quality in parts where foreign coffee is received or
processed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The influx has been attributed to the favorable local prices
and the ease of access to the Ugandan market.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan coffee also found its way to Uganda through Mbale
bordering Kenya, while Tanzanian coffee have been streaming to
Masaka, about 80 km north of Tanzanian border.

anti-drug policy.
</P>
<P>
-- France has asked the European Union to help establish an air
bridge with the Zairean city of Kisangani to provide humanitarian

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Four new French-designed
Panther helicopters joined the Israeli Navy Wednesday enhancing
its offensive arm in the Middle East, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The navy spent 63 million U.S. dollars to purchase the
French-designed Panther from the American Eurocopter Corp.. Built
by the French Aerospatiale company, the Panther replaces the
sea-based Dolphin, which has been in service since 1985. A fifth
Panther is to be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
The Panther is an updated version of the Dolphin. Known as its
integral tail rotor, the Panther is a new-generation of aircraft
that will enhance the weapons systems on navy missile boats by
expanding their visible horizon and guiding anti-ship Harpoon
missiles to their targets. They will also hunt submarines and
carry out search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The Panther's three-man crew is made up of a pilot, a
navigator, and a communications officer.
</P>
<P>
The Panther is based on the Dolphin's original mid-1970s
design, but its problematic U.S.-built engine has been replaced
with a more powerful French one. Its avionics have all been
upgraded a generation.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held at the Ramat David Air Base, Israel Air
Force Commander Maj. Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliyahu said that "this is a
day which strengthens the navy, the air force and the IDF (Israel
Defense Forces)."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Blasts VOA, DFR for Distortions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's leading newspaper Nhan
Dan today criticized the Voice of America (VOA) and the Democratic
Forum Radio (DFR) for their distortion of facts concerning the
press freedom in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"No one can deny the recent positive socio-economic changes in
Vietnam," the newspaper said, adding, "The communist party and the
government of Vietnam have exerted great efforts to help the
people effectively exercise their rights of self-mastery and
actually enjoy rights to freedom and democracy, including the
freedom of the press."
</P>
<P>
It said in a commentary, "The VOA and the DFR are deliberately
ignoring the increase both in number and quality of Vietnam's mass
media."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the Vietnamese people have already expressed
their wish to have friendly ties with all countries in the world,
it said. They have been trying to forget the sufferings of the
war with the U.S. in the past, it noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the VOA and the DFR are often hostile to Vietnam,
especially when they comment on issues of human rights in the
country.

LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Agriculture Minister survived the latest attack on
the Government's handling of food safety Wednesday, insisting in a
Commons statement that hygiene standards in abattoirs were going
up but conceding there was "scope for further improvement."
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major was under growing pressure
from senior colleagues Wednesday night to announce the general
election date this week, as the government remained mired in the
damaging controversy over abattoir hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- John Major's flagship nursery voucher scheme for
four-year-olds has been severely criticized by a Tory-dominated
committee of MPs.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- John Major's flagship nursery voucher scheme is unlikely to
raise standards, increase parental choice, or even provide extra
places for children.

<HEADLINE> China's Rebuttal of US Human Rights Reports (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the "Reports" are not concerned about the
question of whether Chinese citizens really enjoy the freedom of
speech, of the press, or information. Any politically unprejudiced
person would not deny that freedoms, including the speech, press
and information freedoms that the Chinese people enjoy today
greatly surpass those of any periods of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the majority of Chinese people now have many more
individual freedoms than ever before, Anthony Saich,
representative of the Ford Foundation in charge of China affairs
said in February, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Former US President George Bush said on February 24,1997 that
Chinese citizens today have more human rights and individual
freedoms than at the time he left the country. (Note: George Bush
served as chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China from 1974 to
1975.)
</P>
<P>
On the freedoms of speech, press and information, the "Reports"
themselves had to admit that Chinese society continues to open
further, and "it has freer access to outside sources of
information...satellite television broadcasts are widely
available...increasing numbers of citizens have access to the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
Why then do the "Reports" still accuse China of not having
freedoms of speech, press, and information? In the words of the
"Reports", the real reason is that China does not permit citizens
to deny "basic doctrine providing for a socialist state under the
Communist Party's leadership," and that the freedoms the Chinese
people enjoy are not enough to "endanger the leading role of the
Communist Party." This clearly tells us that what the "Reports"
call for is not real freedom of speech, or the press, or
information, but the "freedom" to oppose the socialist system and
the ruling Communist Party. So long as China is still a socialist
country where the Communist Party is at the helm of the state, no
matter how democratic it is or how many freedoms its people really
enjoy in speech, the press, and information, for those who wrote
the "Reports" it is always "a country without freedoms." That's
where the real problem lies.

ignore the facts and describe China, which is constantly
developing, as a country with worsening human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that during the past year, great improvements were
made in China's human rights situation. In 1996, China's economy
achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy growth, democratic and
legislative construction was obviously enhanced, and people's
rights to exist and develop and other human rights further
improved.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1996, the national economy grew 9.7
percent in real terms over the previous year, and the average per
capita income for urban residents reached 4,300 yuan (500 US
dollars), a 3.3 percent increase in real terms; the figure for
rural residents reached 1,900 yuan, a 9 percent increase in real
terms, the highest growth for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Total bank savings deposits for both urban and rural residents
reached 3.85 trillion yuan (480 billion US dollars) in 1996, 880
billion yuan more than for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China has the fastest rate of poverty relief in the world. In
1996 as many as seven million people in rural areas were helped
out of poverty, bringing rural China's total number of
impoverished down from 250 million in 1978 to 58 million at the
end of 1996, or less than a twentieth of the world's total
compared to a forth in the past.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, another 457 county-level administrative units in 26
provinces or autonomous regions realized their goal of eliminating
illiteracy and achieving nine-year compulsory education for
everyone. This benefited 190 million people, or 16.4 percent of
the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, great achievements have been made in democratic
construction at the grass-roots level. From 1995 to 1996, most of
the villages in China completed a new round of direct election to
form villagers committees, the rural grass-roots administrative
body. More than 98 percent of the urban mini-districts established
neighborhood committees or groups, 97 percent of which was through
direct election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China passed the Law on Protecting the Rights of the
Elderly, the Law on Lawyers of the People's Republic of China, the
Law on Administrative Punishment and many other legal documents
concerning human rights, and made significant amendments to the
Criminal Law in an effort to protect human rights by law.
</P>
<P>
The amended Criminal Law in particular increased the
participation of layers in criminal proceedings, provided greater
protection of rights of victims, and standardized methods used in
issuing summons, custodies and other compulsory measures. These
provide greater guarantees in dealing with criminals and in
protecting innocent persons in legislative procedures. The facts
show that human rights conditions in China continued to improve in
an all-round way in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the "Reports" ignore all of this, and chase after some
so-called "individual cases" and even fabricate "facts" to provide
evidence of "China's violation of human rights" and draw a grim
picture of China's human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the authors of the "Reports" don't really want
China to be strong, stable, and developing, nor do they want to
see any improvement and development in the human rights conditions
for all the Chinese people. What they really want to do is to use
human rights as a tool with which to vilify China in the
international community and sabotage China's stability and
development.

<HEADLINE> China's Rebuttal Of US Human Rights Reports (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not accidental that the "Reports" use human rights to
carry out public opinion struggle against China. This is a full
manifestation of the stubborn Cold War mentality of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all that the human rights reports of the US
State Department, started in the days of Cold War as part of its
"human rights diplomacy", was actually used to meet Cold War
political demands.
</P>
<P>
From its very beginning, it was a political tool the US
authorities used to put pressure on socialist and developing
countries. After the ending of the Cold War, the United States, to
enhance its efforts in pursuing hegemonism and power politics,
takes socialist China, which persists in its own road of
development, as its imaginary enemy, and frequently attacks China
by using the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The annual human rights "reports" of the US State Department
have therefore become an important tool for opposing China,
vilifying China, and interfering in the internal affairs of China.
</P>
<P>
However, just as motions advanced by the United States against
China at the UN Commission on Human Rights have failed six times,
the purpose of the US State Department's Human Rights Reports in
opposing China will not be achieved.

<P>
China is a country whose civilization goes back 5,000 years and
which is full of vitalily and hope. In no way will the 1.2 billion
Chinese who have stood up change their course of development
because of foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
The US State Department's reports openly interfere in the
internal affairs of other countries and runs counter to the spirit
of the UN Charter and the trend of the times. Item 3, Article 1 of
the UN Charter clearly states that the fundamental approach to
promoting human rights in the international community is to
"promote international cooperation." For a long period of time
however, human rights, under Cold War influences, have become a
tool of big powers to stir up political conflicts, to practise
hegemonism, and to interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries. After the Cold War, the people all over the world
demanded that the international human rights activities crawl out
from under the shadow of the Cold War and take the healthy track
of international cooperation and dialogue. The Vienna Declaration
and Program of Action adopted at the 1993 World Conference on
Human Rights reiterated that improvements in human rights must be
made in keeping with the aims and principles of the UN Charter,
particularly with the UN's primary goal of international
cooperation.

<P>
TIANJIN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Administration of Industry
and Commerce in Tianjin, a port city in north China, Wednesday
openly destroyed counterfeit products with a total market value of
2.4 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The destroyed goods included fake cigarettes, wine, foodstuff,
garments, video tapes and brand logo prints.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Dong, director of the administration, the
destroyed items were but a small fraction of the fake and
counterfeit goods confiscated by his department.
</P>
<P>
In the recent two years, the administration dealt with more
than 3,000 cases and closed 300-odd underground sales or
production sites. "The market value of the confiscated goods
totalled around 400 million yuan," Shi said.

<HEADLINE> Difficulties Remain in China's WTO Accession: Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite difficulties in China's
negotiations for access to the World Trade Organization, progress
has been made, an official of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation attended the third meeting of the WTO
Working Party on China held in Geneva from March 4 to 6, at the
invitation of the Party's chief. Before and during the meeting,
China consultated with WTO members including many developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In these discussions, an increasing number of nations expressed
the hope for a faster pace in the negotiation process for China's
entry, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the consensus of the WTO members that China's
entry into the organization will help strengthen the multilateral
trade system.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the official added, whether the final progress would be
made will be decided by the political will of all the parties.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to have talks with all the parties, the
official commented, "China needs the WTO, and the WTO needs
China."

<TEXT>
<P>
A resolution on increasing international cooperation in human
rights, adopted at the 51st Session of the UN General Assembly in
November 1996, again stressed that true and constructive dialogue
based on mutual respect and equality is needed to promote
international cooperation in human rights. All this represents the
tendency of the day in the present international community to
demand cooperation and dialogue and to oppose conflict and
pressure in human rights. The United States is neither a world
government, nor has it been vested with authority to act as one by
any widely-accepted international organization or
conference. Nonetheless, it is trying in every way possible to
pretend to be a "world judge of human rights", one that has issued
reports year in and year out to make unwarranted charges against
other countries. The move which goes against the historical trend
and man-made conflicts over human rights run utterly contrary to
the spirit of the UN Charter and the popular sentiment of the
international community, and will necessarily meet with the
opposition of more and more countries, including China.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Official Blames Baghdad for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in northern Iraq Blamed the
Iraqi government for an assassination in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted Fuad Masum, a member of
the PUK leadership, as saying that Baghdad wanted to make the
situation in northern Iraq more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Masum made the remarks following the killing of Muhiddin
Rahim, a high-ranking Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) official,
in the northern Iraqi town of Erbil, which led to a complete KDP
pull-out from the Ankara peace talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three rival parties, the KDP, PUK and
Turkmen Front, met here early Tuesday to discuss measures for
bringing peace and stability to the northern Iraqi region.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara peace process started after bitter clashes between
the KDP and PUK last September.
</P>
<P>
"In Erbil, Iraqi security officials have influence. Their
involvement (in the assassination) is really a big possibility,"
Masum said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP withdrew from the peace talks Tuesday to protest
against the assassination of Rahim, claiming that the PUK was
directly involved in this terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
However, the PUK denied its involvement.
</P>
<P>
Masum also disclosed that the KDP and Baghdad would soon
reach an agreement, which is in its final stage now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior diplomat monitoring the situation in the
region said that the KDP's withdrawal from the peace talks
indicated that the Kurdish group was distancing itself from the
U.S. initiative and getting closer to the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Turkey, mediators of the
tripartite peace talks of rival parties in northern Iraq,
intensified efforts to save the process, which was aimed at
reestablishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Robert Deutsch, U.S. State Department Director of Northern
Gulf Affairs, told reporters that they were investigating the
assassination. He said the Ankara peace process would continue
following his consultations with his Turkish counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular press briefing Wednesday, Turkish
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey
hoped the Ankara peace talks would continue as planned despite
this sad event.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Turkey chaired a series of
multilateral meetings in Ankara in a bid to work out a
peaceful solution to the problem in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China's Rebuttal of US Human Rights Reports (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Reports" say China "detained foreigners visiting Tibet,
searched them..." alleging that Ngawang Choephel, a foreign
scholar visiting Tibet, was detained by Chinese authorities for
making a documentary about Tibetan performing arts, and was
sentenced to 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the 30-year-old Ngawang Choephel, whose
ancestral home was Zada County, in the Ngari region of Tibet, was
a dance teacher with the song and dance ensemble of the exiled
"government" of the Dalai Lama before his arrest. Using funding
and equipment provided by a foreign country, he entered China in
June 1995, having been sent by the Dalai Lama's group to engage
in intelligence activities under the guise of collecting materials
on the Tibetan performing arts.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tibet, he collected information in Lhasa,
Shannan, Nyingchi and Xigaze by using methods conforming to the
"information collection plan" he drafted before the visit.
</P>
<P>
Having gained sufficient evidence of Nagawang Choephel's
espionage activities, China's public security departments arrested
him in accordance with the law, and Nagawang Choephel made a full
confession of his espionage activities. The Intermediate People's
Court of the Xigaze Region sentenced him to 18 years in prison on
the charge of espionage, and deprived him of political rights for
four years, also in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
After the first ruling, the defendant appealed to a higher
court, and the second instance is now under way. With regard to
such kind of people who endanger a country's security and engage
in espionage activities, any country that practices a legal system
should punish them according to law. It is a complete distortion
of the facts when the "Reports" use the term 'visiting scholar'
or 'foreign tourist' to describe a spy.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" also attack China for arresting or detaining
foreign businessmen at will, saying "Australian businessman James
Peng, whom Chinese public security officials kidnapped in Macau in
1994 and brought to China for trial, was sentenced to a lengthy
prison term in September 1995."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Peng Jiandong was from Jiexi County in
Guangdong Province, became a naturalized Australian citizen in
December 1991.
</P>
<P>
Acting as the general manager of the Shenzhen Yuanye Industrial
Corporation Ltd, Peng diverted 800,000 Hong Kong dollars (about
103,000 US dollars) of his corporation's investment remittances
intended for the Sino-Australian Liupin Corporation in Australia
to his own Kangya Corporation in Hong Kong in March 1989.
</P>
<P>
When he became chairman of the board of Yuanye in November
1989, he embezzled 290,000 yuan in funds from the corporation
under the guise of borrowing money from its subsidiary, the Yuanye
Materials Corportation, in February 1992.
</P>
<P>
Peng was arrested, according to law, for embezzlement and
misappropriation of funds in October 1993. The Shenzhen
Intermediate People's Court and the Guangdong Higher People's
Court handled the case and sentenced him to 17 years in prison in
addition to expulsion from China.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" call an economic criminal who violated China's
law a "victim" of a kidnaping case, those writing it must have
ulterior motives.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- With 500 km of China's largest
gas pipeline completed, gas is expected to be piped from Shaanxi
to Beijing in September this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Chengzhi, general manager of Beijing Natural
Gas Transportation Company (BNGTC), the 3.3 billion yuan pipeline
project with a total length of nearly 1,000 km, starting at
Jingbian county in Shaanxi and ending at Shijingshan district in
Beijing, runs through 22 cities and counties in the provinces of
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Hebei, and Beijing municipality.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the completed part of the pipeline-laying project
covers complex topography. The project is scheduled to be
completed in its entirety by September this year and to start gas
supplies to Beijing and Tianjin at the end of that month.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the pipeline will have an annual supply
capacity of 1.1 billion cubic meters in the first several years,
and will reach as high as two billion cu m in later years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing and Tianjin have long been afflicted by
power shortages, and suffer from serious air pollution owing to
heavy coal consumption.

Siqing reported in March to the NPC that during 1995 the Supreme
Procuratorate investigated 4,627 illegal detention cases."
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese government "tightly controls information",
how does the "Reports" account for the fact that the Supreme
Procuratorate reported to the NPC the figure of illegal detention
cases?
</P>
<P>
And since the Supreme Procuratorate made the exact figure
public, how can the "Reports" say that it is impossible to
estimate accurately the total number of people subjected to
arbitrary arrest or detention?
</P>
<P>
For another example, the "Reports" say that the Chinese
authorities fail to act in accordance with legal standards in an
attempt to show China as a country without a legal system. But
then, the "Reports" went on to say that "the 1988 Law on State
Secrets provides justification for denying a public trial. Details
regarding cases falling under this provision are frequently kept
secret."
</P>
<P>
That means that when the Chinese legal departments handle
affairs according to the Law on State Secrets, they will be
"infringing on human rights". Such contradictions can be found
throughout the "Reports."

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Increased Awareness in Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- "We should bring a prosperous
China into the 21st century, and also leave an excellent
environment to our coming generations."
</P>
<P>
This has become a growing call from members of China's
legislative body who are in Beijing for the fifth annual session
of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), since the
beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
"On no account shall we sacrifice our environment for profits,"
said a deputy.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion, an NPC deputy from northwest China's
Gansu Province urged protecting water-conserving forests in the
source of the Yangtze River, China's longest one in case the river
becomes the second Yellow River, a highly-silted river that carry
a large amount of silt from the Loess Plateau downstream to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
At the current session, 17 deputies set forth a joint proposal
on checking pollution in the Bohai Bay. And a deputy from north
China's Inner Mongolia warned that some polluting smaller paper
mills that had closed down in southern China are about to find
their way back in the north.
</P>
<P>
Some oceanographists also proposed extending ecological
protection and sustainable development to the vast seas. "It is an
important aspect of sustainable growth to enhance the development
of ocean resources," said Du Bilai, a noted oceanographist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ecological issue has also become a focus during
panel discussions at the Fifth Session of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's
top advisory body, which closed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
For a long period of time, some regions are merely seeking for
economic progress at the expense of the environment, said Cheng
Qing and He Shengtao, two members of the CPPCC National Committee.
They both spoke highly of the efforts made by the city of Benxi,
whose environmental conditions have been improved remarkably.
Moreover, they also praised the cities of Zhuhai, Dalian and
Shanghai for the efforts they have made in beefing up their
economic development while improving their environment in an
all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Some of the CPPCC members set forth a number of proposals on
the control of water and soil erosion, sandimentation and
improvement of irrigation facilities to help ensure a sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, deputies from Tibet, renowned as the vast expanse of
"holy land" owing to a good ecological environment and top-quality
atmospheric conditions, have also felt a pressing need for
ecological conservation. These deputies pledged to intensify the
efforts to monitor and protect top quality atmosphere and
surrounding so as to leave the best environment to the next
generation.

<P>
Two. Cooking Up Charges by Hook or Crook
</P>
<P>
In order to cook up charges for China's "violations of human
rights", the "Reports" refer to criminals and people who violate
the law in China, or who harm national security and public order
"political dissidents" and "political prisoners".
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" say that Wang Dan is a "political prisoner" who
was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment in 1996 for "announcing his
attention to investigate China's human rights situation in 1994".
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Wang was sentenced to four years imprisonment
with one year deprivation of political rights in 1991 for working
to subvert the Chinese government, in clear violation of the
country's criminal code.
</P>
<P>
After he was released on parole on February 17, 1993, he
contacted overseas anti-Chinese organizations in secret and became
involved in a series of activities that were intended to overturn
the Chinese government and harm national security. He was arrested
in accordance with the law on October 3, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing began Wang
Dan's trial, which was open to the public, on October 30, 1996,
and sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment with two years
deprivation of political rights for conspiracy to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
Wang did not plead guilty and appealed the decision to the
Beijing Higher People's Court, which heard the case in a public
trial on November 5, 1996, but rejected his appeal, upholding the
original sentence.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that Wang Dan was sentenced to prison not
because he was a dissident who announced "his intention to
investigate China's human rights situation", but because he
violated the law by harming national security.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are no "political prisoners" in China, and
people do not violate the law merely by expressing their own
ideology or opinions about public affairs. No one is punished by
law just because he or she holds a different political view.
</P>
<P>
It is a groundless assertion for the "Reports" to refer to
criminals who in fact harm national security and who would be
sentenced in a court of law in any other country for such
activities as "political prisoners", regardless of facts and
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" slander China by saying that "mental hospitals
have reportedly been used on occasion to control political
dissidents". The "Reports" claim that "dissident writer Wang
Wanxing, who was arrested in 1992 for protesting in Tian'anmen
Square on the third anniversary of the 1989 demonstrations, was in
good mental health but remained detained against his will at An
Kang Psychiatric Hospital in Shanghai."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Wang, who only had a middle school education,
was found jeopardizing the social order in Tian'anmen Square in
June, 1992. The police discovered that he had mental problems
after they removed him from the square, and sent him to An Kang
Hospital in Beijing, where doctors diagnosed him as suffering from
paranoid delusions.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said his attempt to disturb the social order was the
result of this problem and that he had difficulty in recognizing
the normal state of things and was not responsible for his
behavior. They decided that he should be hospitalized for
treatment. The hospital reports that Wang's health is better now.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the "Reports"' description of "in good mental
health" but "detained against his will at the An Kang Psychiatric
Hospital in Shanghai" is a groundless allegation.
</P>
<P>
It took a great deal of thought for the "Reports" to label a
mental patient with the names of "writer" and "political
dissident" in order to trump up charges about China's "violation
of human rights."

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Reports" accuses China of persecuting religious believers
and encroaching on freedom of religion. To support its
accusations, the "Reports" use people who used religion to cover
their criminal activity and who were therefore dealt with in
accordance with the law, calling them "defendants of conscious".
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" say that "In 1996 police continued to put
pressure on an underground evangelical sect called the
`Shouters'," and "Its members have been repeatedly detained,
fined, and imprisoned."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the "Shouters", which is not regarded as
orthodox by other Christian groups, was an evil religious
organization engaged in anti-government, anti-society criminal
activities against the law under the guise of religion. It was
threatening to "organize all Christian sects to resist the
government to the end" and getting its misguided followers to
harass the government and government leaders, and was involved in
criminal acts of rape and swindling people.
</P>
<P>
Some of the organization's leaders had behaved indecently with
more than a hundred women and forcibly held more than 20 young
female followers for a long period of time in the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
They were guilty of serious crimes and the Chinese government
punished them in accordance with the law. This had nothing to do
with religion. In fact, the Chinese state protects the freedom of
religion of the citizens and their normal religious activities in
accordance with the law. No one will be punished just for
religious beliefs or for normal religious activities. At the same
time, people cannot avoid penalties for criminal activity simply
because they believe in religion or flaunt the banner of religion.
</P>
<P>
Evil religious organizations like the "Shouters" which use
religion to cloak their law-breaking criminal activities were
dealt with by any government in the world in accordance with its
laws.
</P>
<P>
It is ridiculous for the "Reports" to use China's dealing with
evil religious organizations and criminal activities of violating
social order and swindling others or acts of rape as evidence of
its "violating human rights".
</P>
<P>
Three. Distorting Freedom and Vilifying China
</P>
<P>
In order to vilify China, the "Reports" use a lot of space
accusing it of having no freedom of speech, of the press, or of
information.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" say that China encroaches upon the freedom of
speech of citizens because it "does not permit citizens to publish
or broadcast criticism of senior leaders or opinions that
contradict basic Communist Party doctrine providing for a
Socialist state under the party's leadership", that China invades
the freedom of the press by requiring reporters to guard `state
secrets,", and that China tampers with the freedom of information
and communications by requiring Internet users "not to use the
Internet to endanger security."
</P>
<P>
According to the "Reports" logic, it seems that China can
conform to human rights only if it allows its citizens to deny
legal state political power and the present political system,to
endanger state security, and to reveal state secrets. Otherwise,
it will violate human rights. Obviously, this is a distortion of
internationally-recognized standards for human rights and
freedoms, and is utterly ridiculous.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is common knowledge that there can be no freedom of speech,
of the press, or of information in the world without some limits.
</P>
<P>
The 10th and 11th articles of the Declaration of the Rights of
Men in France in 1789 state explicitly that freedom of speech and
the press do not include "disturbing public order formed by the
law," and that those who "abuse the freedom are required to
shoulder the responsibilities" according to law.
</P>
<P>
According to the 19th article of the U.N. International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the freedom of speech,
which includes the right to seek, receive, and impart information,
"carries with it special duties and responsibilities"; People are
required to restrict their freedom of speech for "respecting the
rights or reputations of others," or "for protecting national
security, public order, public health, or morals" according to
law. The 20th article stipulates that "any propaganda for war," or
"any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or
violenc shall be prohibited by law".
</P>
<P>
China's lawful limits to freedom of speech, the press, and
information fully conform to the spirit of the international
convention on human rights and to international practice.
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. law limits the freedom of speech, press, and
information in a more severe way than does that of
China. Statistics showed that there are as many as 18 kinds of
limits in general languages in the U.S. According to the
interpretation of law cases in U.S. federal courts, application of
freedom of speech should not go beyond the limit of not violating
the stipulations of the U.S. Constitution, and any publications
are not allowed to libel the government or attempt to overthrow
the government.
</P>
<P>
The 2385th section, 18th article of the American Laws says that
whoever "advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty,
necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or
destroying the government of the United States," including
"printing, publishing, editing, issuing, circulating, selling,
distributing, or publicly displaying any written or printed
matter" for that aim shall be sentenced to as much as 20 years in
prison, or a fine of 20,000 dollars, or both.
</P>
<P>
The 1717th section also stipulates that all "letters and
writings containing matters advocating forcible resistance to any
law of the United States as nonmailable" and their owners are to be
punished according to the law. In addition, the United States is a
country which exercises strict administration and control over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. laws do not allow people to avail themselves of the
freedom of speech, the press, or of information to engage in
activities of opposing the government and endangering national
security, how can the "Reports" criticize China for observing the
stipulations of the Constitution and laws and requiring citizens
to "guard state secrets" and for prohibiting "going against the
country's basic principles" or "engaging in activities which
endanger national security?"

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Go Ahead with Building Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite growing Palestinian
anger and mounting international pressure, Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry out the controversial Har
Homa construction plan in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a two-day visit to Russia, Netanyahu told
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani Wednesday night at the
Ben-Gurion Airport that he had decided that the Har Homa
construction would begin within next week, the state-run Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Legally speaking, the government is waiting for the
green-light from the High Court of Justice which is reviewing
several petitions filed by peace activists who oppose the Har
Homa project. But the court is expected to reject the petitions
as it has done so several times in the past.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that bowing to the pressure from the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would induce further
Palestinian demands on Israel's withdrawing to the 1967 borders
and allowing the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to convene today the inner cabinet to discuss
the current crisis in relations with the PNA which has called an
international conference in Gaza Saturday to muster support.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strongly denounced the PNA's move to convene the
conference, which the United States, Russia, European Union and
some Arab countries have agreed to attend.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Wednesday, the Israeli government
said the meeting was a violation of the Oslo accords, which
stipulated that the two sides should resolve all differences
through direct negotiations before seeking international
arbitration with the agreement of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis was caused by a series of recent Israeli
decisions on the further troop pullbacks on the West Bank, the
plan to build new settlement of 6,500 apartments in Har Homa of
East Jerusalem and the order to close four Palestinian offices in
the controversial city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is demanding the Israelis to hand over
more land in every stage of the three-phase pullbacks, to revoke
the Har Homa plan and not to close the offices.
</P>
<P>
In a move to avoid escalating the current tension, Kahalani
has decided not to close the four offices in East Jerusalem
which the police claimed were run by the PNA, the Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The four Palestinian offices are the Office for Small
Projects, the Committee for the Wounded, Welfare and Development
Committee and the Office of National Institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani made the decision only after PNA lawyer Jawad
Boulos issued statements to him promising that the offices would
have nothing to do with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani would hold consultations today with Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein on the legality of closing the offices and
make a final decision.

observer Nasser al-Kidwa said Israel was aiming at "the

status and its demographic composition," as well as at continuing
a "colonial settlement campaign" in the area it has occupied since
1967.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The United States said on Wednesday that it
understood the feeling of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to call
for a international meeting in Gaza to voice his concerns over a
series of Israel's decisions, which were obviously violating
agreements reached by the Israelis and Palestinians over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for the Palestinians to express their
concerns about the present situation in the Middle East and to
hear the views of friendly countries like the United States,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called for the meeting following Israel's decisions to
build a Jewish neighborhood in historically Arab east Jerusalem,
to close four Palestinians offices in the same section of the holy
city and to pull out of the West Bank rural areas far less than
the Palestinians had expected.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the European Union, Japan, Norway and France
have been invited to attend the meeting scheduled to convene on
Saturday in Gaza. The State Department has announced that Edward
Abingdon, U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, will represent
Washington to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Businessmen Confident to Invest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Western businessmen
and bankers are confident that the economic goals China set for
1997 will not only benefit foreign enterprises which have come to
invest, but help the country itself to draw more investment from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
"I hold that the Chinese government is going in the right
direction with the economic plan proposed at the ongoing session
of the National People's Congress (NPC)," said Paul Portoff,
president of the Bayer China Ltd., one of the largest German
businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth NPC, China's legislature, Premier Li Peng said that the
Chinese government has set the goal for economic growth this year
at eight percent, and will try to keep price rises below 6.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the premier's speech at the NPC very important. It
is an indicator of the three basic principles which will be
framing the direction for foreign investment over the next year
and a half," said American businessman Laurence Brahm, managing
director of the NAGA Group Ltd., an investment advisory group.
</P>
<P>
The three principles he listed include a careful and meticulous
review of the state-owned assets in connection with the approval
of each investment project, the protection of Chinese domestic
brands and brand names on the domestic market, and the
consideration of foreign brands' dominance on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of investors, this should not be seen as
the measures of protection in nature. In fact, given the critical
transformation of the entire state-owned enterprise system which
will be expected to take place over the next 18 months, we have to
realize and accept this as a transitional period for the Chinese
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that multi-national businesses have come to
invest in China not because of its cheap labor, but because of the
potential huge market in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is very correct that China is shifting its priority of
investment to infrastructure, agriculture and the central and
western provinces and regions," said Paul Portoff, adding that
foreign businesspeople investing in central and western China and
in sectors like agriculture would surely continue to receive the
support that investors had received in the coastal areas in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"In the next few years, Bayer company is expected to increase
its investment in China to 400 million US dollars from the current
160 million US dollars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
David Wang, chairman and GEO of GE (China) Co. Ltd., said the
Chinese government has succeeded in preventing the overheated
economy, and that the increase of foreign investment will also be
at the rate the government would like to see.
</P>
<P>
"We look at investments in China very positively in the future.
Our clients have been increasing their investments in China over
the last few years in infrastructure, including in the sectors of
telecommunications, power stations and forestry. I believe that
with China's new economic plan, these kind of companies should
have good future in China," said Anders Biorck, Beijing office
director of Kandinaviska Enskilda Banken, one of the largest banks
in northern Europe.

NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The government is planning to
introduce a package for software and electronics exporters in the
export- import policy for 1997-2002, which is to be announced next
month, commerce ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The changes are likely to be integrated into the chapter on

The Commerce Ministry is considering several steps including
allowing software exporters to sell in the domestic market on-line
and allowing Internet connectivity for private electronic mail
providers, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
At present, exporters sell most of their software to clients
abroad on-line, but cannot use this channel for the domestic
market. Internet connectivity has been a long-standing demand of
private electronic mail providers and software companies.
</P>
<P>
Total software and hardware exports in 1995-96 were 2.6 billion
US dollars and are expected to cross 3 billion dollars in 1997-98,

Organization (WTO) for non-agricultural products. The government
gave the binding import duty rates in its offer under the Uruguay
round of talks on multilateral trade that concluded in December
1993.
</P>
<P>
The second initiative envisages dismantling of import licensing
and canalization of petroleum products at the end of QRS phase-out
schedule or even reworking the schedule if the balance of payments
(BOP) situation is critical.
</P>
<P>
The third step will be reimposing QRS in case the BOP situation
crosses the danger mark. Apart from this, the government will
reiterate its demand for imposition of higher binding tariff on
certain farm products such as milk and certain cereals which at
present attract zero or very low duty.

<HEADLINE> Governor Envisions Future Development of Thriving Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Governor Lu Ruihua says
the south China province has made "remarkable progress" in
establishing a market economy and a new managerial mechanism for
state-owned enterprises and will maintain its lead in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The governor, who is here attending the National People's
Congress session, made the remark at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
On Guangdong's future development, Lu said focus will be put on
boosting the efficiency of export-oriented light industrial
operations, and on the high and new technology sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the province targets a GDP growth of about ten percent
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong had a gross provincial product of close to 610
billion yuan last year, one sixth of China's total. In the same
year, the province had a foreign trade volume of 110 billion US
dollars and received actual overseas investment of 13.9 billion US
dollars, both ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The governor added that Guangdong made steady progress last
year in reform of state-owned enterprises, and that the 70 major
enterprise groups which received priority government support last
year are playing a "pillar" role in the provincial economy.
</P>
<P>
He said reform of the 187 pilot enterprises aimed at
establishing a modern enterprise system will be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Concerning poverty alleviation, Lu said that 400,000 people in
Guangdong were lifted out of absolute poverty last year and that
the provincial authorities are confident of basically lifting the
remaining 600,000 people out of poverty this year.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Commander Advocates for Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A former U.S. military
commander involved in the 1991 Gulf War has advocated Kuwait
should rely on western military allies for its security in view
of its insufficient resources to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
This came in an exclusive interview given by John Yeosock,
deputy commanding general of the coalition forces in the Gulf War
to end Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, with the local
English daily Arab Times, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is difficult for Kuwait to be militarily
self-reliant because of its small size, limited population and
the nature of the threats facing the country."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is reasonable or possible" for Kuwait to be
self-sufficient in defending its integrity, "simply because
Kuwait is not large enough to stand up to any adverse threat
from anywhere in the region," the former army commander added.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that it was important for Kuwait to retain a very
strong coalition with friendly nations, as it had been during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Yeosock arrived in Kuwait Monday to discuss defense
initiatives with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense, the National
Guard and the U. S. officials based in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the U.S. former military commander said what is of
"vital importance to Kuwait is to continue to nurture and foster
an armed force which is truly professional in all branches of
service. They have to continue to strive and incorporate the most
capable systems they are able to obtain."
</P>
<P>
Yeosock is currently an advisor to the U.S. Lockheed
Group company, Lockheed Martin Electronics and Missiles.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, Kuwait should possess a force that can be
reinforced by its allies. For this they need capabilities and
systems similar to those possessed by friendly nations which
when integrated will provide even greater deterrence," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the purpose of his current visit to Kuwait, the official
told the newspaper that "I am here in the interests of Kuwait
since I have a very personal interest to try and assure that
they can get on with building a professional and capable armed
force."
</P>
<P>
"I know that American industry and business can assist,
nurture, enhance and bolster a more professional force in
Kuwait," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had earmarked 12 billion U.S. dollars right after the
Gulf War in 1991 to reconstruct and strengthen its military
forces in a 10-year period.

<HEADLINE> Revisions Made to Two Drafts under NPC Deliberation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Revisions have been made to draft
amendments to the Criminal Law and a draft Defense Law at the
suggestions of deputies before the two drafts are put to a vote by
the National People's Congress (NPC), which has been in session
since March 1.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ju, chairman of NPC Law Committee, delivered a report on
the results of deputies' deliberations of the two drafts and a
draft method for the election of deputies from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth NPC, at the third
meeting of the presidium of the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC
today.
</P>
<P>
The report was adopted by the presidium.
</P>
<P>
The deputies held that the draft amendments to the Criminal Law
conform basically with actual conditions in the country, and will
be conducive to combating crime, protecting people, and
safeguarding the smooth progression of socialist reform,
opening-up and modernization, said Xue.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of a defense law is of great significance for
strengthening national defense, safeguarding national sovereignty
and unity, and territorial integrity and safety, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the deputies thus suggest that the NPC session adopt the
two drafts with some revisions.
</P>
<P>
The deputies have agreed to the draft method for the election
of deputies from the HKSAR to the Ninth NPC, and suggested that it
be approved by the session.
</P>
<P>
Based on proposals put forth by deputies, Xue said, the Law
Committee has made several revisions to the draft criminal law and
the draft defense law.
</P>
<P>
The committee has added to the draft amendments to the Criminal
Law provisions on hijacking of vessels and automobiles, loan
sharking (getting loans in an illegal way, then re-loan it to
other people for illegal profit), inclusion in publications of
content that insults the customs of ethnic minorities, and
smuggling, trafficking, transporting, manufacturing and illegal
possession of "ice."
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that loan sharking has run rampant and seriously
disrupted financial market order, the committee has decided to add
the provision to the draft.
</P>
<P>
For those smuggling, trafficking, transporting, and possessing
"ice" illegally, the added provision stipulate that punishment be
the same as that for the same amount of heroin smuggled,
trafficked, transported or possessed illegally.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft defense law makes stipulations on carrying
out defense education, guaranteeing the legitimate rights and
interests of servicemen, and their welfare, said Xue.
</P>
<P>
Since the Criminal Law contains an article on the crime of
endangering the interests of national defense, the Law Committee
has deleted the chapter on legal responsibilities in the draft
defense law, and added in its general rules this provision: "those
who violate this law and related laws by refusing to perform their
duties in defense or endangering the interests of national
defense, shall be investigated and bear legal responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
The committee also added the stipulation that "this law's
provisions on servicemen are applicable to the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force."
</P>
<P>
According to Xue Ju, the deputies have expressed their approval
of the draft method for the election of deputies from HKSAR to the
Ninth NPC, and the Law Committee has also agreed to its
stipulations and no revision was suggested.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Reiterates Non-Intervention Position in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has reiterated the Union govrnment's position of
not intervening in the Zanzibar political crisis, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmation followed renewed donor pressure urging that
the president initiate dialogue and action to resolve the
political impasse on the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chokala, the Press Secretary to the president, said in
an interview here on Wednesday that there was nothing new that
the donors have stated in their new request.
</P>
<P>
"The donors have been backing the opposition against the Isles
government since the general elections on October 22, 1995 after
Salmin Amour of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) was proclaimed the
winner," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new from the donor community on the Isles
political crisis and there is similarly nothing changed on the
side of the president," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chokala said the president had no mandate to change the Isles
general election results as preferred by donors and the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the press secretary said members of the House of
Representatives from the opposition Civic United Front (CUF)
should attend House sessions where the matter can be resolved in
a proper manner.
</P>
<P>
He said President Mkapa was preoccupied with the opposition
boycott of House sessions because they were denying the people
the right of representation.
</P>
<P>
They were also denying the government their contribution to
policy making, he added.
</P>
<P>
"CUF must accept to compromise on major issues with the Isles
government in order to settle the election wrangle in a peaceful
manner," stressed the presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hafidh Ally, a Zanzibar government spokesman said in
the town of Zanzibar that donor pressure on the Isles government
to meet CUF and find a solution to the crisis would not succeed.
</P>
<P>
He said the government of Salmin Amour was legitimate, an
authority put in place by majority consensus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman ruled out acceptance of donor assistance
accompanied by political conditionalities.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, a development cooperation official of
the European Union reiterated early this week that donors would
not assist any programs in Zanzibar if the matter was not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
In the last general elections, President Amour was re-elected.
However, the opposition CUF refused to accept the poll result,
claiming the election was "rigged".

<HEADLINE> Sichuan's Couples Embrace "One Child" Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Jia Maolin, a 92-year-old farmer
in Sichuan, China's most populous province, raised 15 children
after getting married at 18, counting on his descendants to build
up family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
But, he lived in an abyss of misery for most of his life, and
his wife died of poverty and overwork many years ago.
</P>
<P>
His grandson, Jia Qingfu, doesn't want to tread old Jia's
beaten path. The 28-year-old man spent five years farming
livestock before he and his wife decided to have a child.
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I built a chicken farm that produces 1,000 kg of
eggs a day. We earn more than 30,000 yuan each year," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
"I think early birth keeps newly-weds from pursuing their
dreams in their prime," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that more than a million young couples
in Sichuan shared Jia's view. The majority of child-bearing
couples said they would have one child.
</P>
<P>
One young couple in Ping'an Township delayed having a child
until they saved 500,000 yuan from their restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
The wife, named Gan Zeqiong, gave birth to a baby girl on their
sixth wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get rich before the child came. This way, we can
send her to the best school in China or maybe abroad when she
grows up," Gan said.
</P>
<P>
"Waiting to have children later benefits not only the family
but also the country," she added.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, the most densely-populated province in China, has a
population of 110 million, of which, 90 million live in rural
areas. The dilemma of growing population and shrinking farmland
has hindered Sichuan's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970s, the province began to practise family planning as
in other Chinese provinces, encouraging couples to limit
themselves to having one child.

<P>
As a result, Sichuan's population growth rate has dropped from
29.5 per thousand in 1970 to 17 per thousand in 1995. While the
per capita income of farmers rose to 1,900 yuan in 1996 from 187
yuan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
China has postponed hitting the 1.2 billion population mark for
nine years because of implementation of the "one child" policy.
</P>
<P>
The old idea of "the more children you have, the happier you
are" has given way to "having fewer but healthier births." Many
people would rather improve the quality of their lives than have
more children, said Xie Mingdao, a population expert.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, one-child families are provided with government
loans and raw farm materials such as fertilizer and improved seed
strains and given opportunities to study modern agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
China's social security programs assuage the fears of the
elderly that nobody will take care of them.
</P>
<P>
Luo Fenglan, an old woman in Baihe Village, said: "I can get a
monthly pension of 280 yuan when I come to the age of 60. That's
enough for me even if I have no support from my daughter."
</P>
<P>
Compelled by a fast-moving career-oriented lifestyle, young
urban couples voluntarily postpone marriage and pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu, a female post-graduate at the Sichuan Union University
said, early marriage and childrearing will cost me opportunities
to compete with my male partners."
</P>
<P>
Urban districts in China reflect a trend towards lower birth
rates, lower mortality, and lower population growth.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, a top official in charge of China's family
planning, believes the Chinese Government is capable of
controlling its population within 1.3 billion by the end of this
century.

KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) is to fund a 172,000 U.S. Dollar project to rehabilitate 54
km of road between Bamugolodde and Nakasongola in Uganda's
central district of Luweero.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily "the New Vision" today, the
project, which will start soon, is in line with Ugandan President

presidency last May.
</P>
<P>
The district administration has already signed the contract
with Chribbson Limited Uganda, which is to undertake the project.
</P>
<P>
The road to be rehabilitated has been in a sorry state. During
the civil strife in early 1980s, Museveni led a guerrilla war in
the Luweero district and got support from native people.

TIANJIN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- North and Northwest China
demonstrated explosive growth in foreign trade last year.
</P>
<P>
The export volume of the two areas soared to 14.4 billion US
dollars last year, 11.7 percent up from 1995' figure.
</P>
<P>
Their import volume totalled 29.3 billion US dollars, 21
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yixuan, a trade commissioner sent to Tianjin by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said,
apart from the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, these areas
remain under-developed though they have rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The export value of foreign-funded firms in Tianjin came to
2.15 billion US dollars, making half of the city's total export
last year. A local trade official predicted their export volume
would increase 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to changes in export structure, the export of high-tech
and value-added products increased rapidly while the export of raw
materials declined.
</P>
<P>
North and Northwest China cover one third of China's
territories and a population of 250 million.
</P>
<P>
The two areas have enhanced economic cooperation with the
Commonwealth of Independent States and other neighbouring
countries.

<HEADLINE> Law and Order, Priorities of Nepal's New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's new coalition
government will give top priorities to maintaining law and order
and speeding up the country's economic development, Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand said today.
</P>
<P>
Chand, whose eight-member cabinet took office Wednesday, told a
press conference here today that his government is committed to
facing and addressing the country's various problems like leftist
uprising, severe poverty and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the prime minister said that his
government will go to the root of the ultra-leftist armed movement
under the name of "People's War" and try to solve the problem
through dialogue instead of suppression.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government movement, launched by an ultra-leftist
group one year ago, has so far claimed over 80 lives including
political activists, policemen and civilians by resorting to
activities like looting, killing and armed confrontation with
police, mostly in remote hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
The new government will also ensure steady economic development
of the country through maintaining clean and impartial
administration, Chand said in a statement issued at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Corruption control will be put on the list of priorities of the
three-party government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was formed by Chand's National Democratic Party
(RPP), the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP) to replace the former
government, which resigned last week after losing a confidence
vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet is expected to announce a common policy
platform under an agreement of the three ruling partners in two or
three days, according to a cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
The Chand government will seek a vote of confidence in the
lower house of parliament within two weeks, sources said.

<HEADLINE> China's Rebuttal of US Human Rights Reports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of China's
State Council published an article today criticizing the United
States' attempt again to provoke a confrontation and interfere in
China's internal affairs by using the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the article entitled "Another act
of creating confrontation by using the pretext of human rights --
comments on the 'China' part of the 'human rights report' of the
US State Department for 1996":
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1997, the US State Department released its
"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1996" (hereinafter
referred to as "Reports"), in which it commented improperly on the
human rights situation in 194 countries and territories, setting
itself up as a "world human rights judge." The "China" part of the
"Reports" continues to spread slanderous rumors against China in
disregard of the Chinese people's strong opposition in the past
years, thus laying bare once again the attempt of the "Reports" to
create confrontation and interfere in China's internal affairs by
using the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
One. Playing the Same Old Trick by Repeating Fabrications
</P>
<P>
One of the major characteristics of the "Reports" is to repeat
the old trick and continue to vilify China by making fabrications
and distorting the facts.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" attempt to mislead the public by using materials
that were proven worthless long ago, and tried to turn lies into
truth by repeating this.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Reports," ignoring the fact that in 1996
China revised the "Law of Criminal Procedures" which was
originally adopted in 1979, use a large amount of words to attack
the 1979 law, saying that "The law provides that defense lawyers
may be retained no earlier than 7 days before the trial," and
that "Under the law, there is no requirement that the court
appoint a defense attorney for the defendant."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Article 110 of the revised law states that "as soon as
a people's court decides to begin trial proceedings, it should
send a copy of the indictment from the people's procuratorate to
the accused no later than seven days before the trial, and should
serve notice that the accused is able to seek counsel, or should
appoint counsel for the accused if necessary."
</P>
<P>
Here, the "no later than seven days before the trial" is
misquoted as "no earlier than 7 days before the trial;" and the
court is able to "appoint counsel for the accused" is misquoted as
"there is no requirement that the court appoint a defense attorney
for the defendant."
</P>
<P>
Although China has repeatedly pointed out that the materials,
which are claimed by the "Reports" as "violating human rights,"
confound black and white and are contrary to the facts, the
"Reports" have used the materials year after year. This calls for
more serious thought.
</P>
<P>
The "Reports" also cite some seemingly "new" materials and
certain individual cases, but most of them is fabricated and
contrary to the facts. For example, the "Reports" say that
"Chinese authorities in Fujian refused in August to provide
medical care for 76-year-old Catholic Bishop Zeng Jingmu, who had
contracted pneumonia," and that "Zeng has been detained for
holding illegal church services in his home."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Zeng Jingmu, who is from Chongren County in
Jiangxi Province, had been involved in illegal meetings in recent
years that seriously disrupted the public order, and refused to
stop this in spite of repeated warnings.
</P>
<P>
In March 1996, a local re-education-through-labor commission,
acting in accordance with the law, decided that he be subject to
three years of re-education-through-labor. At present, Zeng is in
good health and has not contracted pneumonia. The wording of
"contracted pneumonia" and "Chinese authorities ... refused ... to
provide medical care" in the "Reports" is a fabrication and is
unfounded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai students applying for
entrance into technical and vocational schools nationwide will be
required to pass a drug test, a senior Thai education official
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new requirement will be applied in all state technical and
vocational schools this academic year to prevent drug abuses in
the schools, said Thong-yu Kaewsaiha, director-general of the
Vocation Education Department.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will be flexible to allow each technical college
to set their own criteria to turn down applicants, the official
was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Drug users who are not chronically addicted may be permitted to
study under the close supervision of teachers and parents, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, only 0.6 percent of some 206,000
students at state technical schools nationwide have a history of
drug abuse, stressing that the requirement is designed to help
ensure drugs do not become a major problem in the schools.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Rules Out Relocation of Muslim Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Wednesday said Muslim settlers would not be relocated from
the Chittagong hill tracts (CHT), where the Chakma tribal rebels
have been seeking autonomy ever since 1973.
</P>
<P>
"We will neither force anyone to stay there or ask anyone to
leave any place," said Hasina in Chittagong city, who was taking
stock of the law and order situation in different districts of the
Chittagong division, particularly the three districts of the CHT.
</P>
<P>
She also directed the concerned authorities to take proper care
and steps for the repatriation of Chakma refugees from neighboring
India, beginning on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Her directive came at a time when the government is holding
talks with the tribal leaders in the capital Dhaka for a political
solution to the CHT problem.
</P>
<P>
The crucial fourth round of talks between the Chakma rebels and
the government of Sheikh Hasina began Wednesday and got bogged
down on the unresolved issues including the relocation of Muslim
settlers and land dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist rebels, who have been fighting a bush war in the
resource-rich hill districts, demanded removal of all Muslim
settlers from the plains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dawn-to-dusk strike was observed in the three hill
districts of the CHT. Strike organizers protested what they called
"unilateral peace deal" with the tribal rebels and were strongly
against the removal of Muslim settlers in the CHT.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Slashes Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move likely to
anger some of the country's trade partners, Lebanon's government
has decided to slash food imports dramatically in a drive to
prop up the agricultural sector and to activate local
industries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was quoted today by the Daily
Star as saying that the Agricultural Ministry had been given a
maximum of one month to prepare a list of agricultural items
exempt from the ban, mainly because they were needed for local
industrial use.
</P>
<P>
But the flow of all other agricultural products which can be
home-grown will be strictly banned as of October 1 this year, the
prime minister said at the end of a cabinet meeting Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has angered Jordan and Egypt recently with amendments
to the food import calendar that effectively restricted the flow
of fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Amman and Cairo regarded the alterations as violations of
existing trade accords.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said it was time for his country to lower its
dependency on food imports.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's current food imports bill averages 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars a year, and is considered a key reason for the
imbalance in foreign trade, the Beirut only English daily noted.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said some items which Lebanon remains unable to
produce in quantities to meet consumer demands, namely beans and
chickpeas, will be exempt from the ban.
</P>
<P>
But "classical products like tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce or
cucumbers, will be entirely home-grown," the billionaire prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He played down the impact the decision would have on the
country, which imported up to 80 percent of its food.
</P>
<P>
"Not too long ago we banned the import of bananas, and after
a very shot period of time, Lebanon turned from an importer of
banana to an exporter of the product," Hariri argued.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these decisions will offer a great incentive
for people to cling to their land and will also help increase
agricultural production and reduce imports," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that other measures to "encourage investment in
the agricultural sector across the country" were currently under
study and would soon be presented to parliament for
endorsement.

BRASILIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Cruzeiro beat Gremio 1-0 at the

<P>
After losing at home to Gremio 2-1 in their first meeting of

After a scoreless first half, Cruzeiro's Palhinha scored the
game's only goal less than 30 seconds into the second half.

<P>
Despite aggressive play, Gremio was unable to come back. The
team could not capitalize even when Cruzeiro lost a man in the
middle of the second half after Cleisson was expelled with a red
card.
</P>
<P>
Gremio, however, played without two of its starting lineup:
Dinho, who is sitting out a suspension, and Carlos Miguel, out

<P>
CANBERRA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian sprinter Dean
Capobianco faces the threat of a four-year world ban if he loses
his International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) hearing
against drug allegations this weekend in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old tested positive to the anabolic steroid
stanozolol at a track meet in the Netherlands in May last year,
but he was still allowed to race at the Atlanta Olympics after
being cleared by an independent tribunal namely Athletics
Australia (AA).
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, which claimed to have constructed a watertight case
against Capobianco late last year, refuted the outcome of the
Australian inquiry on reason of the lack of complete
evidence to the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AA spokesman David Culbert said Thursday the AA
stood by its decision to clear Capobianco.
</P>
<P>
Capobianco, who has maintained the test result was caused by
faulty testing procedures, has indicated he would take his case
to the civil court system whatever the outcome in Monte
Carlo.

KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,594 Ugandans died
in road accidents last year, a local newspaper, "the Crusader",
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the 1996 Traffic Offenses Report, released by the
police yesterday, as saying that the figure marked a 3.1 percent
increase in the number of fatalities on Ugandan roads from 1,546
deaths in 1995 when the grim harvest on the roads grew worse.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 1,289 Ugandans perished in road accidents.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed poor driving, poor roads, lenient laws and
drunken driving as the major causes of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan capital Kampala registered 289 accident deaths last
year, the highest among the cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda ranks second in Africa after Ethiopia in road traffic
accidents. According to 1995 statistics, Uganda had 161

<P>
LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The southern African region is
facing a serious threat of a locust invasion with continued heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
The warning is from the control organization for eastern and
southern Africa of the International Red Locust Organization.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted the organization's regional chief
Afete Gadabu as saying that the potential areas feared to be
affected stretch from Mozambique, Malawi's Lake Chilwa Plains and
Tanzania's Valley Ears which pose a threat to Zambia due to
proximity of the areas.
</P>
<P>
Gadabu said there is a serious possibility of locust breeding
in the area growing into destructive hoppers soon.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that depending on the wind direction in the
region, Mozambique's hoppers may head for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was put on such an alert last year, which promoted the
control organization into conjunction with the Agriculture
Ministry to launch a spray campaign against the pest.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Businessmen to Boycott Upcoming VAT Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen and industrialists
in Nepal have decided to boycott a new value added tax regime
(VAT) which the tax authorities is determined to impose from the
coming 1997-98 fiscal year starting in July.
</P>
<P>
A resolution against the decision to enforce the VAT this year
was unanimously adopted here Wednesday at the conclusion of a
national meeting on the impacts of the new tax.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, participated by those representing business and
industrial sectors from across the country, discussed various
aspects of VAT and concluded that the hasty introduction of the
VAT tax might jeopardize the whole economic system.
</P>
<P>
The new tax system would raise prices of daily commodities and
widen the already large gap between the rich and poor in the
country if implemented without adequate preparations, participants
warned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also formed a national committee to work out future
programs for trying to make the upcoming VAT system abolished.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from various business groups decided at the
meeting to defy the government's appeal to register all business
organizations under the VAT from April.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's former government decided to impose the VAT system this
year aimed at doubling the national revenue through curbing tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the new government, which took power Wednesday,
would continue its predecessor's VAT policy.

championships," said Russi. "The public on course and watching on
TV should feel the excitement and difficulty of our sport.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have done it with Birds of Prey."
</P>
<P>
The course is set high on the mountain with the start at an
elevation of 3,482-meters and will finish at the bottom of Red
Tail at 2,732 meters. Spectators will use lifts and shuttle buses
to reach the finish area.
</P>
<P>
The vertical drop of the course will be 750 meters with an
average gradient of 27 percent, increasing to 45 percent in
sections. Skiers should average about 100 kilometers per hour and
reach top speeds of 150 kph.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Hold Referendum on Superannuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
introduced the legislation setting up details of a referendum on
compulsory superannuation, TVNZ reported today.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is to be held by postal ballot over three weeks
from September 5, and people will be asked "are you for or against
the retirement saving scheme."
</P>
<P>
The government said if a majority approve the proposal, it will
quickly move to introduce legislation to implement the scheme, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Compulsory superannuation is conceived by the New Zealand First
party to replace the present practice of universal superannuation.
Under the scheme, all New Zealanders will have to set aside part
of their earnings as superannuation before the age of retirement.
</P>
<P>
Although the other major parties all oppose the scheme, the
holding of a referendum is contained in the coalition agreement
signed between the National Party and New Zealand First when they
formed the new government last December.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Weigh Neutron Star by Measuring X-Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found a way to
weigh a neutron star by measuring its flickering X-ray radiation,
confirming for the first time the existence of unstable orbits
close to a compact star.
</P>
<P>
Scientists did so by measuring X-rays emitted by materials
falling from an orbiting companion star into the neutron star's
innermost orbit and then into the neutron star itself, a
newsletter from Columbia University said.
</P>
<P>
"The team is the first to use the presence of the innermost
stable orbit, a unique prediction of Einstein's General
Relativity, to gauge the mass of a neutron star." the newsletter
says.
</P>
<P>
Neutron stars have masses similar to that of the sun but have
diameters of only a few kilometers. They are thought to consist
entirely of densely packed neutrons and other elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
"From the rate of the X-ray flickering, we can determine the
precise position of the innermost stable orbit and therefore the
mass of the neutron star," said Philip Kaaret, associate professor
at Columbia University and the leading researcher.
</P>
<P>
In the case of 4U 1636-536, a neutron star found in the Milky
Way galaxy, researchers found that the falling matter from a
companion star emits X-rays that flicker at up to 1171 times per
second.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Einstein's theory, researchers then calculated
the mass of the neutron star from the frequency of the X-ray
pulses.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- World silver-medalist Chen Lu left
Beijing with four more fellow Chinese skaters on Thursday to take
part in the World Figure Skating Championships in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who won the gold medal at the 1995 worlds but finished
second last year, admitted she could hardly get a medal this
time. She will be joined by Du Yankun in the women's individual
event at the championships slated from March 16-20.
</P>
<P>
Though being regarded as one of the hot favorites for medals in
the upcoming tournament by her rivals, Chen did not expect any
medal due to her right foot injury, which had banned her from
training for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible for me to defend my runner-up ," said
20-year-old Chen, who missed all tournaments since last world
championships including Asian championships in Beijing last
October.
</P>
<P>
"I just recovered and began my regular training for a month, so
I don't think to display satisfactory performance in Lausanne. I
will do my best but it will be nice for me to enter top six
places," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The world championships also serves as a qualifing tournament
for the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, with top 24
having direct access to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Other three members in the Chinese delegation are the men's
singles skater Guo Zhengxin and Shen Xue/Zhao Hongbo in the
doubles. They were squeezed out of the 24 places in respective
events last year.
</P>
<P>
"What they expect this time is to enter the 24 and qualify for
the Winter Olympics," said Guo Ruijiu, Secretary of the Chinese
Skating Association.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Enhance Intra-ASEAN Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of ASEAN economic
ministers meeting Hartarto has called for more intense intra-ASEAN
trade to help maintain the momentum of the region's high economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto made the remarks at the first ASEAN business summit
Wednesday, an official at the meeting said today.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN trade had improved significantly over the last few
years but there were still many opportunities to enhance ASEAN
trade, Hartarto said.
</P>
<P>
according to the ASEAN Secretariat, intra-ASEAN exports of all
goods grew 19.7 percent to 68.8 billion US dollars last year from
57.4 billion US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto, who is also Indonesia's coordinating minister of
production and distribution, said Indonesia will be one of the
world's five biggest economies by 2019 when its current 25-year
development plan ends.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had experienced growth of over 7 percent a year in
the first three years of the current 25-year development program,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will become one of the five biggest economies in the
world with a nominal gross domestic product of 2 trillion US
dollars based on purchasing power parity," Hartarto said.
</P>
<P>
he said Indonesia should have a per capita gross domestic
product of 3,800 US dollars by 2019.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said the government was also planning a decline in
population growth to an annual growth rate of less than 0.9
percent by 2019.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 22 million people living below the poverty line
and the government has pledged to bring the number down to zero in
ten years.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN chamber of commerce and industry (ASEAN CCI), the
organizer of the two-day ASEAN business summit which began
Wednesday, proposed ASEAN adopt a timetable to eradicate poverty
by 2020.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting, which is being attended by some 600
businessmen, including those from non-ASEAN countries, is aimed at
preparing "a map of journey" toward the global market.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Academics to Chart ASEAN's Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants a group of eminent
persons to chart ASEAN's path toward closer economic integration
beyond 2003 when the ASEAN free trade area (AFTA) takes effect,
according to Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would be put to ASEAN economic ministers who are
scheduled to meet in Cebu, the Philippines, this month, Narongchai
was quoted today by local press as saying
</P>
<P>
It would be best for academics to prepare the plan, rather than
government representatives, as they would be neutral and have more
time, he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the group was formed, he hoped it could complete its
recommendations in time for approval by the annual meeting of
ASEAN economic ministers in September. It could then go to ASEAN
leaders scheduled to meet informally in Kuala Lumpur in October.
</P>
<P>
Karen Kittisataporn, director-general of the Commerce
Ministry's business economics department, said ASEAN's eminent
persons would probably be asked to map out a direction for the
trade group between 2003 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was looking for closer economic integration by
liberalizing trade in goods, services, intellectual property and
investment.
</P>
<P>
AFTA would reduce all tariffs on goods traded among its members
to 0-5 percent by 2003. The ASEAN investment area scheduled to be
in place in 2010 would create a better environment for investors
both within and outside the region.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Rescue units and
firefighters throughout Colombia have been put on high alert as
forest fires raged in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 forest fires broke out in the country in recent
months due to high temperatures, and at least eight provinces have
declared a state of emergency, the Institute of Hydrology,
Meteorology and Environmental Studies said.
</P>
<P>
The fires have destroyed vast areas of crops and are
threatening important wildlife and nature reserves, which
constitute the richest ecological systems in the western
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit central province of Santander has reported more
than 150 fires this year.
</P>
<P>
A gigantic fire broke out last Sunday in Guaca city,
Bucaramanga province, devastating a large area of crops. So far
2,500 hectares of forests have been burnt down in the province,
said the fire chief of Bucaramanga city, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
The blaze is also threatening two neighboring cities, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to End Hospital Overcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health authority plans to
carry out a nation-wide reform to halt hospital overcharges for
medicines and expensive, unnecessary physical examinations.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals will be prohibited from profiting by prescribing and
selling unnecessary medicine to patients or by conducting
unnecessary physical examinations, according to a report in
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they will be permitted to raise fees for some
technical services such as clinical consultations and surgery, the
report quoted Li Hongshan, an official with Ministry of Public
Health, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are meant to end the practices of a number of
hospitals that often over-prescribe medicine and frequently
conduct expensive physical examinations with new high-tech
equipment on patients in order to compensate for low prices and
fees charged for consultations and some sophisticated treatments
requiring special equipment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to lack of investment from government and cheap technical
medical services, hospitals have to prescribe and sell expensive
medicines to make profits," Shi Wenhai, a doctor of People's
Hospital in Shaanxi Province, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, hospital income earned through
selling medicines has accounted for 50 to 80 percent of total
revenue of a hospital in some places, Shi said.

<HEADLINE> Berisha Approves Interim Government in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today approved an interim coalition government led by Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino.
</P>
<P>
Fino, a leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, was
chosen as prime minister by Berisha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The interim government was set up in a bid to end the nearly
two-week long unrest and to prepare for general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The new government is composed of 20 members from nine
parties. Berisha's Democratic Party takes six posts and the main
opposition, the Socialist Party, has five.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry goes to the hands of the Democratic Party
and the Defense Ministry and Finance Ministry are to be chaired by
Socialists. The new foreign minister, Arjau Starova, is from the
Union of Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan state was plunged to unrest more than 10 days ago in
the wake of the collapse of dozens of pyramid savings schemes in
which hundreds of thousands of Albanians were left penniless.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was blamed for allowing the schemes and was demanded to
resign.
</P>
<P>
The president was forced on Sunday to agree to form a coalition
government to oversee early general elections after violent
clashes swept the south.
</P>
<P>
Rebels, who have seized most part of the south, are still
insisting on the resignation of Berisha, who was re-elected for a
second five-year term by the Democrat-dominated parliament last
week.
</P>
<P>
Unrest still plagues the south. Armed gangs reportedly attacked
a hospital in Sarande overnight and shooting in Gjirokaster, from
where Fino comes, injured six people.
</P>
<P>
Besides the unrest in the south, anti-government rebels looted
weapons from a military base near Elbasan, 55 kilometers from
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some 300 people broke into the barracks in Bajram
Curri, about 200 kilometers northeast of Tirana, and looted
hundreds of assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 150,000 assault rifles were looted from
barracks during last week's violence. Heavy weapons, such as tanks
and anti-aircraft guns, were also found in the hands of the
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
About 40 people have been killed since clashes erupted more
than 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
In view of the volatile situation in Albania, many countries
have decided to evacuate their citizens living in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States today ordered a limited evacuation of its
government personnel and urged private American citizens to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have also
called on their citizens to leave.

<HEADLINE> Susanti Advances in All-England Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Susi Susanti keeps her dream alive
of winning her fifth All-England Championships title in her last
appearance in the event before retirement as her top-seeded
Indonesian compatriot Mia Audina was bumped out on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Olympic silver medallist's hope of becoming the
youngest All-England winner was crushed when she lost 6-11, 11-8,
11-5 in the second round to the unseeded Dai Yun of China.
Meantime, Susanti's title chances were considerably increased when
she advanced to the quarter-finals with two wins for the loss of
only five points in total.
</P>
<P>
Another seed, the former world junior champion from China, Wang
Chen, placed in the five to eight category, also went out. Her
straight games loss to South Korea's Ra Kyung-Min meant there are
surprisingly three South Koreans in the last eight as well as three
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese have qualified to the last eight in men's singles
competition which saw nine of the 16 seeds bidding their farewell.
</P>
<P>
The most noticable to go out was the second seed Commonwealth
champion Rashid Sidek of Malaysia, who led 6-2 in the second
game, but could not handle the powerful smashing of a revived
world champion, Heryanto Arbi of Indonesia, and was beaten 15-7,
15-8.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Arbi was struggling hard against the 20-year-old
Englishman Mark Constable and managed to survive a game down and
3-9 behind in the second to pull off a hard-earned 10-15, 15-10,
15-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
But another Indonesian big name, the former world champion Joko
Suprianto, did bow out, partly due to a heavily strapped thigh
strain.
</P>
<P>
Suprianto, who won his world title in this same arena four
years ago but also lost in the second round of the All-England
last year, was ousted by Japanese Open champion Peter Rasmussen
15-10, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
The young left-hander Dane had a tough time later when he
struggled to survive into next round with a win by 17-14 in the
final game against Sweden's Tomas Johansson.

<P>
WARSAW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The first consignment of food aid

<HEADLINE> Belgium Still World's Diamond Trade Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's diamond trade is still
the world's biggest with a turnover which rose by one-third in
1996, the Diamond High Council (DHC) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover jumped in value to 715.1 billion Belgian francs
(20.31 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, a 34 percent rise if
calculated with francs but 31 percent if with dollars, the DHC
said.
</P>
<P>
Imports of rough diamonds soared by 37 percent in value, to
357.7 billion francs (10.16 billion dollars). The major suppliers

</P>
<P>
Exports of polished diamonds rose by 32 percent in value to
357.4 billion francs (10.15 billion dollars), and the United
States remained the biggest market, followed by Hong Kong and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The northern Belgian port city of Antwerp, now accounting for
56 percent of the world turnover, consolidated its position as the
world's biggest diamond trading center, the council added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Enhances Economic Ties With South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade ties are
expected to boom between the Philippines and South Asia and the
Middle East in the coming years after Philippine President Fidel
Ramos paid a 10-day visit to five nations in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Bahrain Wednesday, Ramos described as an
"astounding success" his five-nation tour which took him to India,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He said the trip had advanced the frontiers of Philippine
economic diplomacy and established new bridgeheads in the
country's search for more markets.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ramos obtained assurances from the five
countries of their continuing support and cooperation with the
Philippines, especially in the area of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the five countries also pledged to provide easier
access for Philippine-made products to their domestic markets to
close the trade gap between the Philippines and their countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the five countries, especially the two oil-rich Middle
East states, have enjoyed a surplus in their trade with the
Philippines in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, whose trade gap widened to more than 12
billion U.S. dollars last year, has sought to tap more export
markets outside its traditional trade markets including the U.S.
and Southeast Asia. Among other regions, South Asia and the Middle
East are viewed by the Philippines as potential export markets.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Ramos conducted his first major foreign trip
to the five countries with a large group of leading Philippine
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
As a major achievement of his visit, Ramos brought back seven
bilateral agreements to strengthen cooperation between the
Philippines and these countries in economy, trade, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, joint business councils will be
established between the Philippines and the five nations to
promote bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
India agreed to make joint efforts with Manila to double their
trade from the 1996 level of about 250 million U.S. dollars to 500
million dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh agreed to promote and protect investment by the
Philippine businessmen in the country while Pakistan promised to
help the Philippines in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Qatar and Bahrain pledged to
continue their support to the ongoing peace process in the
southern Philippines by taking an active part in the region's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The four countries, all members of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC), helped the Philippine government in forging a
peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front last
September.
</P>
<P>
The historic peace accord ended nearly three decades of bloody
confrontation in the southern Philippines and created a peaceful
environment for the development of the region's war-shattered
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' visit also enhanced labor relations between the
Philippines and the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines signed two labor agreements with Qatar and
Bahrain to protect the welfare and rights of close to 50,000
Filipino overseas workers there.
</P>
<P>
These agreements are the first of its kind to be concluded by
the Philippines and the Middle East countries which hire almost
one-third of the about 4.2 million contract Filipino overseas
workers.
</P>
<P>
Overseas workers have played an important role in the
development of the Philippine economy in recent years by sending
home billions of dollars of remittances each year.
</P>
<P>
But cases of abuse of Filipino workers by their employers
happened now and then in the Middle East countries. Some cases
even affected relations between the Philippines and these
countries.

embassy in Brazil said.
</P>
<P>
France, who was the fifth in the foreign investor's list in

<HEADLINE> Sluggish Sheep Count Gets Government's Goat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 12 (Xinhua) -- It's getting more difficult to
separate the sheep from the goats in Mongolia these days.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of goats to sheep in the country has soared from 1:3
to 2:3 over the last few years, as breeders have flocked to goat
rearing to cash in on higher prices on the lucrative international
cashmere market.
</P>
<P>
Production of cashmere in Mongolia nearly quadrupled between
1993 and 1995, rising from 121.5 metric tons in 1993 to 232 metric
tons in 1994 and 421 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of goats has risen by 614,000, an annual rate of
11.7 percent over the last few years, while the number of sheep
has risen by just 113,600 over the same period to 13.5 million,
Serjhuu, an expert at the Mongolian State Statistics Bureau, was
quoted as saying in the People's Right newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Now Serjhuu is urging the government to take measures,
including tax breaks, to boost sheep rearing and slow down the
growth in the goat population to bring the ratio back into balance.
</P>
<P>
He says the sluggish growth in sheep numbers could hit supplies
of mutton, a staple food in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Serjhuu also warned that it could also lead to a shortage of
wool as well as sheepskin for relevant industries.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports to EU Rises to $19.83 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's trade with the European
Union (EU) hit some 40 billion US dollars last year, with Chinese
exports rising 3.8 percent from a year ago to reach 19.83 billion
US dollars, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
China's growing market demand this year will help increase the
country's imports from EU, compared with the volume last year
which fell 6.5 percent from the year of 1995 to 19.87 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade last year fell 1.6 percent from 1995,
according to a recent report from the General Customs
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Sino-EU trade in 1996 was handled primarily between China's
seven coastal cities or provinces and eight EU members.
</P>
<P>
China mainly exported light industrial and textile products,
home appliances for machines, electronic products and precision
instruments.
</P>
<P>
Almost 90 percent of the goods China sold to EU last year were
mostly garments, footwear, textiles, luggage and toys. Garments
accounted for almost 12.3 percent of the total Chinese exports to
EU, and machines and electronics products took about 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imported manufactured goods formed 94.8 percent of all Chinese
imports from EU last year. Among them, textile machinery is the
largest import category last year, valued at 960 million US
dollars and rising 6.3 percent from the year of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Regional Autonomy of National Minorities Areas Lauded (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhu) -- Deputies to the current session of
the Chinese legislature lauded China's system of regional autonomy
of national minorities, saying that without it there would not be
stability and prosperity in the areas populated by ethnic minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chaowen, chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which has been in its
fifth session since March 1, said: "The system of regional
autonomy of national minorities has played and will continue to
play a tremendous role in promoting national unity and social
stability, and regional autonomy of minority nationalities is a
key to the settlement of all issues concerning different ethnic
groups."
</P>
<P>
As an important political system of China, the system of
regional autonomy of national minorities demonstrates fully the
respect for and protection of the rights of national minorities.
</P>
<P>
Over past five decades, China has founded five autonomous
regions (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibetan, Xinjiang, and Guangxi),
30 autonomous prefectures and 124 autonomous counties.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey conducted last year showed that the population
of China's national minorities had reached 103 million. For
historical reasons, the overwhelming of them inhabit in the
outlying, mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities
covers the political, economic, cultural and educational fields.
Official figures show that all the ethnic minorities in the
country have representation in the NPC and generally speaking, the
proportion of their deputies in all NPC deputies is much higher in
term of population.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that a 1984 law and other regulations on
regional autonomy of national minorities have explicit terms to
specify that endeavors should be made to help the development of
the economic, cultural and educational undertakings in the areas
inhabited by people of various ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
The State also inclines to the autonomous areas in financial,
taxation, investment, loan-granting, foreign trade,
poverty-alleviation, educational and cultural policies, which has
helped to promote development in the ethnic-minority areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita income of farmers in the
autonomous areas reached 1,142 yuan in 1995, higher than the
national average for farmers. The average economic growth rate in
the five autonomous regions also exceeded the national average
last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the system of regional autonomy of minority
nationalities is very instrumental to the fostering of cadres of
minority nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"As for myself, I would not be what I'm like today, if without
the system," said Wang, who had been a cowherd of the Miao ethnic
group till 11, became China's youngest official at the ministry
level when he was 46.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the number of carders of minority
nationalities in China has exceeded 2.48 million.
</P>
<P>
In China, the heads of autonomous areas at all levels are
assumed by people of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the latest developments, China will modify the 1984
law and those formulated earlier in the near future, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Stepping up legislation will provide an effective guarantee
for the system of regional autonomy of national minorities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the Nationalities Committee will
promulgate a law concerning protection of the rights and interests
of people of the national minorities scattered around, a law on
the language and characters of the ethnic groups and regulations
on autonomy in the five autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang expressed his confidence that a relatively
complete system of socialist legality and supervision for issues
relating to national minorities will be set up before the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> East-West Cooperation in Developing Township Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The last couple of years have
seen a sharp increase in the number of rural enterprises set up
jointly by China's coastal and central-western regions.
</P>
<P>
According to deputies attending the on-going session of the
National People's Congress (NPC), the number of township-run
industrial projects established jointly by coastal and interior
areas had reached 30,000 by the end of 1996, with 2,500 of them
set up in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
These projects involve 30 billion yuan in investment, said Guo
Jianping, head of the Township Administration Bureau of Shaoshan
City, Central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
"Though we have lagged behind in township industries and rural
development, we can learn from the east and develop our township
industries," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
He said enterprises in interior areas will pay greater
attention than before to making distinctive products of better
quality as well as to exploring rural markets.
</P>
<P>
"Rural industries should seek development through technological
advances rather than launching highly polluting projects," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Denies Calling for Changes to Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has denied calling for 97 or any number of amendments to the
Constitution, saying it was not his idea at all.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said upon his arrival Wednesday from a 10-day visit to
South Asia and the Middle East that the 97 changes to the
Constitution was not proposed by him but by a "constitutional
study group", local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The President was reported earlier to favor at least 97
amendments to the Constitution to prepare the country for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"We have listed 97 necessary amendments, considering that we
must modernize, that we must leapfrog, that we must pole-vault
into the 21st century", Ramos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While denying it was his idea, Ramos, however, said that it was
the people's right to be heard on Constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
"As somebody rightfully said, the Constitution does not own the
people. It is the people who own the Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos also once more declared that he was
against moves to have his term extended beyond 1998, adding that
he hoped the people would not create a new issue out of the
extension of his power.

<HEADLINE> Stability, Development Feature China's March toward New Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite a bunch of thorny
problems, China is expected to maintain its momentum in political
stability, economic development, and social progress through the
next century.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion drawn in the current session of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, which has
been in session since the first date of this month.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, China has made great strides in reform
and opening-up and its modernization has entered a new period,
said an NPC deputy. The economic restructuring aimed at
establishing a socialist market economy is penetrating and the
country has scored marked progress in national economic and social
development. Its social productive forces, comprehensive national
strength and people's living standards have ascended a new height.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign to build a clean and honest government
and exercise an all-round administration over social security
issues have been effectively strengthened. And harsh punishment
has been meted out to corruption and crimes.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China has won increasing respects
from the international community for its principle of fairness,
essential flexibility and posture of neither being haughty nor
humble on the world arena.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies gave a full affirmation to these encouraging
achievements. Prof. Zhang Zhongli, president of the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences, said tremendous achievements in
China's domestic and diplomatic fields over recent years have been
scored during the period of smooth transition from the second to
third generation of collective leadership. The Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core have handled positively and
appropriately a number of major domestic and international complex
problems under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and demonstrated their
capabilities of coping with the overall situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from China's military circle also consented to Zhang's
views.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of Central Military Commission,
and other army generals held that the third generation of
collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at its core is a staunch
and mature leading body, which, they stressed, is worth trust and
support of the whole party, the whole army and all ethnic groups
in China.
</P>
<P>
The capability of the new generation of leadership to deal with
complex issues has withstood tests and been proven convincingly in
the three years' arduous efforts to bring inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Though there is no precedent to go by in the country's endeavor
to establish a socialist market economy, the Chinese leaders came
out with an effective, complicated prescription which was focused
on readjusting the monetary and financial policies, supplemented
with administrative and legal means.
</P>
<P>
The move has scaled down inflation rate from the 21.7 percent
in 1994 to 6.1 percent in 1996 while maintaining an economic
growth rate of around 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stability, Development Feature China's March Toward New Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Wu Shuqing, an economist, said: "Such a success is
unprecedented in China and has rarely happened elsewhere in the
world, and this indicates that the central authorities have become
more mature in exercising macro-controls."
</P>
<P>
To ensure a healthy development of the overall economy, China
has also formulated important strategies for further consolidating
agriculture and promoting a balanced economic development among
all regions.
</P>
<P>
Such strategies conform with the policy of grain safety for
China, which has a population of more than 1.2 billion, and
benefit the stability of rural areas where 800 million people
live.
</P>
<P>
They are also of important significance for preventing the
economic gap between eastern and western regions from widening.
</P>
<P>
As China has a huge domestic market potential, fears for a
slowdown in economic growth in the near future are not justified.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-owned economic sector suffering from low
efficiency faces tougher competition from non-stated-owned economic
sectors unleased by reforms. This has caused concern among people
of all social strata.
</P>
<P>
China has over the past three years basically set up the
framework of a macroeconomic control system compatible with market
economics and has meanwhile searched for a way to get state-owned
enterprises out of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
And a strategic thinking of attaching great importance to
rejuvenating big state-owned firms while giving greater freedom to
smaller ones and of speeding up structural readjustment has
gradually taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The NPC deputies noted that the strategy has been turned into
concrete policy measures in Premier Li Peng's report on the work
of the government. The report also reflects the market law of
survival for the fittest.
</P>
<P>
The deputies said they are optimistic about the prospect of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Economist Huang Da said: "If the established thinking is
closely followed, the ultimate solution of contradictions is only
a matter of time."
</P>
<P>
Lu Xueyi, a sociologist, perceived China's current tasks
from another angle.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that conflicts among various established
interests would exacerbate in the process of great changes, he
said, adding that similar experiences were reported in Western
developed countries when they moved from an agricultural society
to an industrial one.
</P>
<P>
From a sociological point of view, China's reform is a
reshuffling of established interests, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, though there exist contradictions among
regional interests, the overall objectives and corresponding
policies adopted by the central authorities have won support from
the overwhelming majority. The reason is that policy-makers have
always followed one same standard, namely, that polices should be
conducive to the development of productive forces, to boosting the
overall national strength, and to improving people's living
standard. The three "conducive's," in fact, are regarded as the
essence of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

PRAGUE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister, Akbar
Velayati, said today his visit to the Czech Republic, the first
since he became foreign minister 15 years ago, would help promote
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
An advisor to Czech Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, said his
country would maintain and improve economic cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to the Czech Republic, which ended
today, Velayati has held talks with his Czech counterpart, Josef
Zielenice, Klaus and Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy
on further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Czech-Iranian relations have developed. The
Czech Republic did not join the second round of economic sanctions
against Iran proposed by the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In October, 1995, Dlouhy held talks with the Iranian side on
the joint construction of a large-scale power station.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries developed rapidly, with the bilateral trade volume
amounting to 104 million U.S. dollars in 1996, increasing 60
percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Mineral Water Source Discovered In Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A Brazilian mining
geologist announced today that he has discovered a spring of
mineral water which has the highest flow in the world.
</P>
<P>
The spring is in the Curral Mountains, about 25 kilometers from
Belo Horizonte, capital of the state of Mina Gerais.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Hugo Steiner said the source has an extraction
capacity of 12 million liters per day, or 180 liters per second,
the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This water costs nothing. It is excellent for drinking and
therefore of a high commercial value," said the 53 year-old
geologist, who has been prospecting in the area since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said the present biggest source of mineral water in the
world was in Poland, and it had an extraction capacity of 9.8
million liters per day.

<HEADLINE> Boris Yeltsin Preparing for U.S.-Russian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has stopped many formal activities and meetings to concentrate on
studying documents for the U.S.-Russian summit in Helsinki next
week, the President's press secretary said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said NATO expansion, arms control and
Russian-U.S. relations would be the main items on the summit
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton will discuss
NATO's planned eastward expansion and Russia's stand on the plan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its NATO allies will meet in Madrid in
July to decide which former Warsaw Pact nations will get the first
invitations to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has repeatedly made its opposition clear and warned
that bringing its neighbors into the military alliance would
threaten Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton is aiming to convince Yeltsin that NATO's expansion
will stabilize Europe and pose no threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Clinton will also discuss arms control questions
such as how to interpret a 25-year-old anti-ballistic missile
(ABM) treaty and what follow-on limits on strategic nuclear
weapons should be put on the negotiating table, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Russian-U.S. economic, finance and investment relations will
also be on the agenda. Yastrzhembsky said that although there had
been some progress in cooperation, there were still problems that
needed to be addressed.

<HEADLINE> Era of Israeli-Russian Hostility Is Over: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said the relations between Israel and Russia
has reached a new level and the era of hostility is over.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Israel have reached a new level of relations in
politics and economy," Netanyahu told a news conference before
ending his visit in Moscow. "They will be able to strengthen
friendship and mutual understanding."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his visit will further promote bilateral
relations, especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister said that during his stay, he had a
general discussion with Russian leaders on the issue of Russia
supplying natural gas to Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that the two sides are interested in jointly
re-equipping Russian military aircraft and selling them to third
countries.

<P>
On the Middle East issue, Netanyahu praised Russia's active
role and hoped that Russia could help bring Syria back to the
negotiating table.

Russia and the United States over the issue of building new
Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem. Russian President Boris

As to Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran, Yeltsin said his
country did not and will not sell missile weapons to that country.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi will play singles
for the United States in a Davis Cup World Group quarter-final tie

Gullikson confirmed the news that Agassi leaked on Tuesday

It was Agassi's fourth match loss in a row, but Gullikson said

Gullikson had already named Jim Courier for the tie, which will
be played at Newport Beach, California, April 4-6. Courier was
instrumental in the United States' first-round victory over Brazil.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League (N)
led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today won a glorious victory in
the Senate elections held in all the four provinces.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results showed that out of a total of 46 Senate
seats the PML (N) secured 23, the Awami (People's) National Party
(ANP) four, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) three and the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) three.
</P>
<P>
PML(N) secured ten seats in Punjab, five in North West Frontier
Province (NWFP), three in Sindh and Balochistan each and two in
the Federal Capital while its arch rival PPP got only three seats
in Sindh.
</P>
<P>
Elections for a total of 27 Senate seats were held in Sindh,
NWFP and Balochistan today while all 15 senators from Punjab and
the Federal Capital had been elected unopposed. Election for the
four seats from the Federal-Administered Tribal Areas had been

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
suffered his first defeat of 1997 when he was crashed by Bohdan

<HEADLINE> Athens Ready for 2004 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A report released today by Athens
2004 Olympics Committee claims Athens of 2004 will be an idyll of
parklands free of traffic problems and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by Greek and foreign scientists, said the
public works project currently underway will significantly improve
life quality of the Greek capital, in time for the 2004 Olympic
Games which Athens is compaigning to host.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recently put
Athens alongside Rome as the frontrunners for the 2004 Olympics
destinations while indicating the city's suffocating air pollution
poses the greatest obstacle in the way of its bidding.
</P>
<P>
Last week IOC selected a shortlist of five cities, namely
Rome, Athens, Stockholm, Cape Town and Buenos Aires, to enter the
final bidding competition for the 2004 sports extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
The report has also drafted an action plan, with the
assistance of the country's Environment, Town Planning and Public
Works Ministry, to improve the capital's living standards and to
protect the environment, since the environmental factor plays a
potentially influential role in the selection.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the IOC assessment, the scientific report noted
that since 1990 smog levels in the city have shown a gradual
reducing trend and that the on-going public complex, which

ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed,
two others injured in a blast occurred earlier today in Karachi,

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Wednesday condemned recent attacks on the U.N. and associated
personnel and stressed that perpetrators should be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council emphasized the
unacceptability of such acts, which include murder, threats,
hostage-taking, shooting at vehicles and aircraft, mine-laying and
looting.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern that those attacks had sometimes been
carried out with the deliberate goal of disrupting negotiations,
international peace-keeping activities and hampering humanitarian
access.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming the inviolability of U.N. premises and the
importance of ensuring the safety of U.N. and associated
personnel, the council emphasized that the host country and others
concerned must take all appropriate steps to ensure the safety and
security of the U.N. personnel and premises.
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled resolution 868 (1993), by which the
council deemed such attacks to be interference with the exercise of
its responsibilities and stated that it would consider appropriate
measures in response.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Overall champion Pernilla
Wiberg of Sweden wins her first downhill while Austrian Renate
Goetschl captured the downhill title at the World Cup Finals of
the Alpine skiing at Vail, Colorado, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg, who became the first Scandinavian woman to win the

Super-G victories, roared down the 2,626-meter Vail Mountain
course in one minute, 43.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Goetschl, the 24th and last skier to race, successfully jumped

<HEADLINE> Fritz Strobl Wins Downhill at World Cup Alpine Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Fritz Strobl ended
his first full World Cup season today as he outclassed the field
to win the men's downhill at the World Cup Finals of Alpine skiing
at Vail, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Strobl, 24, streaked down the 2,704-meter course in one minute,
38.29 seconds to gain the victory on Vail Mountain.
</P>
<P>
As Strobl exulted after beating Italy's Kristian Ghedina and
Austrian Hannes Trinkl, French ace Luc Alphand frowned at failing
to fortify his lead in the overall standings after a sluggish
ninth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
Alphand, winner of three successive World Cup downhill titles,
was a full second slower than Strobl at 1:39.29 and picked up only
five points on overall rival Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, who
finished 11th in the race.
</P>
<P>
Alphand now leads 1994 World Cup overall champion Aamodt by 122
points with three races left in the season.
</P>
<P>
Ghedina, who finished the season standings in second place
ahead of Strobl, was 0.37 of a second behind in 1:38.66 with
Trinkl just two-hundredths of a second slower.
</P>
<P>
Alphand is striving for an historic World Cup overall title. If
he can hold off Aamodt, the 31-year-old racer would become the
first Frenchman since Jean-Claude Killy to win the overall crown
and the first speed specialist ever to claim the coveted title.

<HEADLINE> Canada Suspends Mission Operation in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
announced the temporary suspension of operations at the Canadian
High Commission in Lagos, Nigeria, due to safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, the suspension does not mean that Canada has broken
off bilateral diplomatic relations with the African country, the
government noted.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian officials at the Higher Commission have not been
given the security assurances by the Nigerians that we are
guaranteed in the Vienna Convention," Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is the desire of Canada that the Nigerian government ensure
that this matter be resolved quickly so that the High Commission
can resume normal operations as soon as possible," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Canadian High Commission in
Lagos has been without a security officer since December 1996 and
efforts by Canada to send a replacement have been blocked by the
failure of the Nigerian government to issue a visa for this
person.
</P>
<P>
Canada had no choice in this matter and the suspension of
operations had to be made, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Nigerian officials of making
"unfounded allegations" that Canada has supported recent acts of
violence in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of these allegations with the hindering of our
normal staffing has made it impossible to conduct routine
activities in Lagos," it added.
</P>
<P>
After suspension, Canadian consular affairs in Nigeria will be
managed by the embassy of the United States, while other High
Commission activities, such as visa services, will be transferred
to the High Commission in Accra, Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Canada's acting High Commissioner and other Canadian officials
in Lagos have already returned home, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> PLO Urges UN Assembly to Denounce Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization on Wednesday urged the General Assembly to denounce
Israel's new housing project in East Jerusalem and other actions
that violated U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Opening the debate in the 185-member assembly, PLO U.N.
observer Nasser al-Kidwa said Israel was aiming at "the
Judaization of occupied East Jerusalem and at changing its legal
status and its demographic composition," as well as at continuing
a "colonial settlement campaign" in the area it has occupied since
1967.
</P>
<P>
"All of these measures represent a flagrant violation of
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations
resolutions and a breach of the agreements concluded within the
framework of the Middle East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States on Friday vetoed a Security Council
resolution calling on Israel to abandon the project in Jabal Abu
Ghneim, East Jerusalem. This move forced Arab countries to raise
the issue in the General Assembly, where there is no veto.
</P>
<P>
Speakers in the assembly were also virtually unanimous in
criticizing Israel and a resolution similar to the vetoed council
draft was certain to be adopted by an overwhelming majority when
put to a vote, probably on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Wang Xuexian said the Chinese delegation is of the
view that recent move by the Israeli government is bound to set
serious obstacles to the Palestine-Israel peace process and be
detrimental to the Middle East peace process as a whole. He
urged Israel to call off its plan to build Jewish settlements in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Jerusalem should be settled by the parties
concerned through negotiations on the basis of the relevant U.N.
resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When final-status negotiations are soon to start, the parties
concerned should avoid any unilateral move contrary to this
approach, since it will only further complicate the question
instead of rendering any help to its proper settlement or to the
Middle East peace process," he noted.

NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street slid this
afternoon despite a report that raised hopes that the Federal
Reserve may not need to raise interest rates to keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 45.79 points to 7,039.37,
having recovered from a loss of more than 74 points.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 5-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling
483.12 million shares as against 491.33 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 7.08 to 804.26, and

</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve released its Beige Book report on regional
economic conditions this afternoon. The report showed that the

for workers hasn't led to marked wage increases -- a key force
behind inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
finally stood at 6.87 percent, higher than late Tuesday's 6.85
percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Gaza Meeting Appropriate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it understood the feeling of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to call for a international meeting in Gaza to voice
his concerns over a series of Israel's decision, which were
obviously violating agreements reached by the Israelis and
Palestinians over the past years.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for the Palestinians to express their
concerns about the present situation in the Middle East and to
hear the views of friendly countries like the United States,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called for the meeting following Israel's decisions to
build a Jewish neighborhood in historically Arab east Jerusalem,
to close four Palestinians offices in the same section of the holy
city and to pull out of the West Bank rural areas far less than
the Palestinians had expected.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the European Union, Japan, Norway and France
have been invited to attend the meeting scheduled to convene on
Saturday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has announced that Edward Abingdon, U.S.
consul general in Jerusalem, will represent Washington to attend
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel, worried that Arafat will use the meeting to assemble a
worldwide coalition to press the Jewish state into concessions,
was said unhappy over the U.S. participation and has tried to
dissuade Washington from attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Burns said: "It's appropriate that we go."
</P>
<P>
But he said the United States "does not see this meeting as a
forum for decisions on the Middle East peace issues or as a
negotiating session."
</P>
<P>
Neither it view the meeting "as an alternative to the direct
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Gets Weaker Against Mark, Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell sharply
against most European currencies Wednesday, hurt by a rally in the
mark and new evidence that reduced the possibility of higher
American interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar ended higher against the yen and hit the
strongest level against the pound in nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
The continuing speculation that the European Monetary Union
single-currency planned for 1999 could be postponed pushed the
German mark higher. In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6932
marks, down from 1.7044 marks Tuesday and its lowest level since
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The dollar cost 122.34 yen, up from 121.81. The pound cost
1.5992 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6072 dollars and the weakest
level since mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.4552 Swiss francs, down from 1.4718; 5.7100 French francs, down
from 5.7455; 1,687.50 Italian lira, down from 1,695.00; 1.3627

<HEADLINE> US Fed Report Shows Moderate Price Pressures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
said today there was little evidence of wage and price pressures
and the economy was expanding moderately.
</P>
<P>
In its closely-watched survey of economic conditions gathered
from its 12 district banks, the U.S. Fed said that regional
"economies continue to expand at a relatively moderate pace."
</P>
<P>
"Tight labor markets still dominate in almost all parts of the
country. Nevertheless, wage gains generally remain moderate," it
said. "Price pressures, such as those reported by most retail and
manufacturing contacts, appear to have been temperate."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey cited improved retail sales from a year
ago in most districts and "high levels of manufacturing activity,
with only pockets of weakness."
</P>
<P>
The survey said residential real estate markets were strong,
with increased building activity, higher sales compared with a
year earlier and rising home prices.
</P>
<P>
It said that commercial real estate markets were "even
stronger" with mild winter weather boosting activity along the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
The periodic Fed survey on its regional districts covered the
period from mid-January through March 3. The so-called Beige Book
report will be the major basis with which the U.S. will decide its
monetary policy in next policy-making meeting on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that the Fed will maintain its wait-and-see
attitude about engineering an interest rate increase in its next
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But most economists believe the U.S. central bank eventually
will raise short-term interest rates this year.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Americans Leave Albania (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration today
ordered a limited evacuation of its government personnel out of
Albania, urging private American citizens to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the concerns that we have about the security
situation in Albania, we are ordering a draw-down of non-essential
United States government personnel in Albania," said State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
"This is a precautionary measure because of the instability in
the country," he told reporters at a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that some 160 U.S. government employees and their
dependents will depart Albania, leaving 17 U.S. diplomats in the
U.S. Embassy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha and the opposition agreed last
week to form a broad-based coalition government and an early
election in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is reportedly going worse in the country
as the fighting is continuing in the South.
</P>
<P>
"The positive political steps taken by President Berisha...have
not yet succeeded in improving conditions in the country because
the insurgency continues," Burns noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that dependents and non-essential personnel of the U.S.
in Albania will leave in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we are advising American citizens to consider
departing Albania as soon as possible," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"Americans who wish to travel to Albania should not do so.
Americans who currently live in Albania should leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,000 private Americans in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burns said that his country welcomes the
appointment of Bashkin Fino as Albania's new prime minister by
Berisha.
</P>
<P>
"We do call upon the new government, and all opposition
forces, to establish a decent political dialogue that would
lead to a cessation of hostilities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Parents to Tell Children About Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged baby boomers who once tried drugs to drop the guilt
and tell their children about the dangers of drugs in an effort to
prevent children from drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"I think this business about how baby boomers all feel too
guilt-ridden to talk to their children is the biggest load of
hooey I ever heard. They have a bigger responsibility to talk to
their children," Clinton told a group of young people at a White
House anti-drug session with children.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he has had no problem telling his daughter,
Chelsea, about his own experimentation with Marijuana and neither
should any other baby boomer parent. Parents have an obligation to
talk to their children regardless of their own drug histories, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he told his daughter, "When I was 22 years old in
England and I thought there were no consequences, I tried
marijuana a couple of times. But if I had known then what I know
now, I would not have done it. It hadn't bothered me to tell her
that she shouldn't make the same mistakes I did."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was part of a town hall discussion, "Straight Talk on
Drugs," aired on ABC Radio as part of the station's month-long
public service campaign on the issue to prevent young people from
abusing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Surveys and statistics show that drug abuse was on the rise
among the young people in the United States in the last couple of
years although the situation was improving among the adults.

Zimbabwe, said the Zimbabwean government put a priority to the
promotion of trade relations with its neighbors, especially
Mozambique, whose Beira Port is an outlet to the sea for Zimbabwe.
