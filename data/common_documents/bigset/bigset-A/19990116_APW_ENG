<HEADLINE> Watertown, N.Y. Buried Under Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Residents of this northern New York city  
haven't spent much time worrying about the snow piling up in 
Buffalo or blowing across the Midwest. They've been too busy 
shoveling the 6.3 feet of snow that has fallen since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``My garbage bag was at eye-level when I put it out this week,''  
said city manager Jerry Hiller as he took a break from running a 
snow blower on his driveway. ``That's how high the snow is around 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City snow removal crews have been working nearly round-the-clock  
since New Year's Day, with the city getting at least 4 inches of 
snow every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``With steady snow 24 hours a day, by the time each truck plows  
its route, it's time to go out and do it again,'' Hiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not something anybody in the city of some 30,000  
residents wants to brag about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that's the notoriety we want,'' Hiller said  
Friday. ``Let Buffalo get the headlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The western New York city of Buffalo, which has a reputation for  
heavy snowfall, has gotten about 60 inches since Jan. 1. Normally, 
Watertown averages about 80 inches of snow for the whole year, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the blame for this winter's whopping snowfall at  
Watertown goes to Lake Ontario. Because of warm temperatures in 
November and December, the lake didn't freeze over. That means 
plenty of moisture could evaporate into the cold wind and turn to 
snow over land, said Edward Klein of the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most recent snowfall was caused by a storm that arrived  
from the Midwest, not lake-effect conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy blanket of snow around Watertown has collapsed roofs  
on barns, homes and businesses -- including a snowmobile dealership 
that was severely damaged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around New York state, 20 workers had to run for  
safety when a factory roof collapsed in Syracuse. Two-hundred 
residents of an apartment complex outside Rochester were evacuated 
when their roof started to collapse, and a bowling alley was 
evacuated just before its roof caved in at Rotterdam.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praise of Wife Evokes Tears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared  
moved to tears by her husband's off-the-cuff tribute for her 
perseverance through difficult times. ``I love her for it,'' 
President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons headlined the annual Democratic National Committee  
gala fund-raising dinner late Friday night. Seemingly tired after a 
quick shuttle to and from New York for an economic speech, the 
president spoke wistfully -- and at length -- about his 
administration's accomplishments over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I don't even know how to talk about what I believe  
Hillary has meant to the success of our endeavors,'' Clinton said. 
He ticked off a list of what she had done, where she had traveled 
``and just a thousand other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And she has done it under circumstances I think are probably  
more difficult than anyone who has ever done it before,'' the 
president said. Mrs. Clinton wiped her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love her for it, but our country should love her for it as  
well.''

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Sues Over Sex Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A 24-year-old hockey player is suing 24  
organizations and individuals involved in junior hockey in western 
Canada, alleging they willfully ignored sexual abuse by a coach who 
preyed upon the player for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The player, now on a college team, has obtained court backing  
for remaining anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	He formerly played for the Swift Current Broncos of the Western  
Hockey League, one of Canada's three top junior leagues. His coach 
was Graham James, who was sentenced two years ago to 42 months in 
prison for sexually abusing both the unidentified player and former 
National Hockey League player Sheldon Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, seeking $650,000 was filed Friday in Saskatchewan  
against 24 individuals and organizations who allegedly knew or 
should have known that James sexually assaulted some of his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The player's parents have also filed suit, naming many of the  
same organizations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's accountability we're looking for,'' the player's mother  
told The Canadian Press. ``From the league and team's perspective 
it was like (the abuse) never happened. We've never received an 
apology from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother alleged her son told Broncos team officials that  
James was abusing him but nothing was ever done. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals named in the suit, when asked for comment, said  
their responses would be made in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every citizen has the right to bring an action before the  
courts,'' said Western Hockey League president Dev Dley. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's hockey world was shocked when Kennedy decided to go  
public two years ago with his allegations against James. The case 
prompted nationwide soul-searching about the highly pressurized 
nature of junior hockey in Canada, and led many leagues to adopt 
new policies for screening coaches and protecting players. 
</P>
<P>
	James, among the individuals named in the suit, pleaded guilty  
to committing scores of sexual assaults on Kennedy and the 
unidentified player. He recently was granted parole and is living 
in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the groups named in the suit are the Western Hockey League  
and its parent group, the Canadian Hockey League, as well as the 
Swift Current Broncos and the Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Excited, Nervous About Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Like Phil Jackson had so many times before him,  
Tim Floyd walked onto the United Center floor a few steps behind 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this wasn't for pre-game introductions, this was to say  
goodbye. And as Floyd stood off to the side watching, he knew his 
job had just gotten much, much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed, just from our coaching staff's standpoint,  
because we all recognize the importance of what he could have meant 
to us this year in terms of wins and losses,'' Floyd said of how he 
felt when he learned Jordan was retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``But happy. For a guy that brought a lot of happiness to a lot  
of other people, if that's what he wants to do, because he 
certainly went out on top. We had a real cordial exchange of best 
wishes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after he joined the Chicago Bulls with the temporary  
title of director of basketball operations, Floyd is finally coach 
of the six-time NBA champions. But it's a far different team than 
the one Jackson left in June. The greatest player in the game is 
retired, and the rest of the Bulls are about to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is left with four players, a grand tradition, plenty of  
questions and very, very big holes to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) excited, real excited, about the opportunity that's in  
front of me,'' he said Friday, shortly after being named Chicago's 
head coach. ``(But) it's going to be a very difficult task, and I 
don't know that anyone has been in this exact situation before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not likely. Floyd takes over the NBA's team of the 1990s -- six  
titles in eight years -- as a rookie. He's been very successful at 
the college level -- 243-130 and runner-up for The Associated Press' 
national coach of the year in 1995-96 -- but has never coached in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	His toughest hurdle is Jordan's departure. Jordan openly mocked  
Floyd when he was touted as Jackson's successor, and he said he 
didn't want to play for anyone but Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But Floyd doesn't think fans will hold him responsible for His  
Airness' retirement. He checked with one of Jordan's friends before 
taking the job, and was told to go ahead. He was told Jordan was 
burned out, mentally drained from the season and not sure he wanted 
to play basketball again, Jackson or no Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's exactly what Jordan said when he retired Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't feel like that's an issue,'' Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides, most fans' ire is directed at chairman Jerry Reinsdorf  
and general manager Jerry Krause right now. Floyd, with his warm, 
friendly, downhome personality, has won over the fans he's met so 
far, quick to smile and chat when he's out. 
</P>
<P>
	He refuses to take himself too seriously, joking about the  
challenges ahead. And he's not interested in making the Bulls ``Tim 
Floyd's team,'' saying he'll run the same systems Jackson did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do recognize the tradition and I recognize what's at stake  
and I know there's a great deal at stake. But I'm looking forward 
to the task,'' he said. ``I still think this is an incredible 
opportunity for somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, though, Floyd knows exactly what he's in for.  
Six, golden championship trophies greet him every day when he goes 
to work, and title banners hang all over the Bulls' practice gym. 
</P>
<P>
	When he walked into the United Center last week, he couldn't  
help but feel butterflies. He doesn't expect them to go away 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they weren't there, then I think there'd be something  
really wrong with me,'' he said. ``I've attended games in the 
United Center before as a spectator and I'm aware of the atmosphere 
that's generated and the electricity that's been in the building 
since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope you can go out there and just not cheat the fans  
because you know how important this is to so many people.''

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Seeks Viagra Spray Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer Inc.  
says it has filed for a patent on a nasal-spray version of its 
anti-impotence drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	The company made the announcement Friday in response to two  
University of Kentucky researchers who claimed this week to have 
developed such a fast-acting spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly not ready to speculate in terms of when we'll  
have a product out,'' said Pfizer spokeswoman Mariann Caprino. ``We 
are moving forward in terms of investigating this as a potential 
delivery system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said the spray was developed and tested in England, but  
offered no other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The two UK College of Pharmacy professors, Lewis Dittert and  
Anwar Hussain, reported this week that the spray they've developed 
drops the time it takes Viagra to take effect from over an hour to 
five to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert released a statement Friday in response to Pfizer's  
claim that it also has a nasal version of Viagra in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not tell us they had a patent application in this  
area,'' Dittert said.

<HEADLINE> Grits'n Hard Toast Wins Holy Bull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Grits'n Hard Toast closed with a rush to  
overtake Doneraile Court in the closing stretch to win Saturday's 
$100,000 Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream, the year's first major 
test for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a strong ride by Robbie Davis, Grits'n Hard Toast stood  
fourth entering the final furlong before chasing down the leaders. 
He finished the 1 1-16th miles in 1:46 1-5, returning $31.20, 
$10.20 and $5. 
</P>
<P>
	Doneraile Court, the 2-1 second choice, edged Mountain Range for  
second and paid $5.60 and $4. Mountain Range returned $3.60 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, the 6-5 favorite, faded down the stretch to finish fifth  
in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holy Bull Stakes usually provides a showcase for Kentucky  
Derby hopefuls, but this year's field was not a strong one. 
</P>
<P>
	Grits'n Hard Toast won just two of six starts as a 2-year-old,  
finishing third in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes on Nov. 28 at 
Churchill Downs. The Kentucky-bred son of Bates Motel boosted his 
earnings to $137,547 with Saturday's win. 
</P>
<P>
	Doneraile Court opened a two-length lead turning down the  
backstretch, followed by Mountain Range, Stone Bridge and Vicar. 
Grits'n Hard Toast was next to last, 10 lengths off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain Range moved within a length of the leader heading to  
the far turn, but Doneraile Court spurted to a three-length lead 
approaching the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Doneraile Court led Mountain Range by two lengths at the eighth  
pole before Grits'n Hard Toast began his big move.

<HEADLINE> Drug Smugglers and Cops Match Wits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dean Wildauer knows it's out there.  
</P>
<P>
	Dangling a cigarette out the window of his Indiana State Police  
cruiser, the trooper squints at the traffic roaring eastbound on 
Interstate 70 through a light rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yeah, he says. It's out there.  
</P>
<P>
	It could be stashed in duffle bags in the back of that rented  
Lexus. Or maybe tucked inside the side panels of that minivan. It 
could be taped inside the tires of a new car on that car carrier or 
hidden in a washing machine in that moving van. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana is carved by Interstates 65, 70 and 80, earning it the  
title ``Crossroads of America.'' While it's a charming label if you 
are touring the Midwest, it's a harsh reality if you're trying to 
stop drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1919, when a young soldier named Dwight D. Eisenhower first  
thought up the idea of an interstate highway system, he envisioned 
broad ``ribbons across the land,'' allowing for faster travel and 
military deployment. Today, Wildauer and cops like him all over the 
country see the interstates as 24-hour pipelines that supply 
illegal drugs to rural high schools and big-city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	State troopers and southwest border agents assigned to stop the  
flow coordinate their efforts through Operation Pipeline, a federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration program active in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	Its hub is the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), a one-story  
brick building on the north end of Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, 
Texas, where more than 250 state and federal law enforcement 
officials track smugglers, scan criminal databases to link cases 
and provide 24-hour intelligence to officers in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Those officers are equipped with fiberscopes that allow them to  
peer into gas tanks, density meters that show when something's 
stuffed in a door or tire, giant border X-rays that can see into 
tractor trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, authorities even load busted drug couriers and their  
vehicles onto military cargo jets and fly them to their delivery 
points so authorities can make drug deliveries and arrest those on 
the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, authorities have pulled more than 1.5 million pounds  
of marijuana and more than 207,000 pounds of cocaine off U.S. 
highways and interstates, according to the DEA. That includes more 
than 170,000 pounds of marijuana and more than 19,000 pounds of 
cocaine in the first eight months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, state and federal officials estimate, nine out of 10 drug  
shipments on the interstate highways get through. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to dry them up, Wildauer says, would be to stop and  
search every car. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, state troopers in New Mexico and New Jersey  
noticed a trend. More routine traffic stops along interstates were 
turning into sizable drug busts. The two states independently set 
up highway interdiction programs and before long saw a jump in drug 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	They began sharing information with other states on how to turn  
moving violations into major drug arrests. In 1984, this 
cooperation grew into Operation Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	The program trains officers on traffic details to look for  
things that don't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Do the lug nuts look shiny? Maybe they've been removed recently  
to stash drugs in the tires. 
</P>
<P>
	See any shiny screw heads that should be painted over? Any  
out-of-place weld marks? Those could also point to hiding places. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50 courses were taught last year, training about 4,000  
officers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the heart of the program is the daily intelligence supplied  
to the field by EPIC. This recent case from Oklahoma typifies how 
it works: 
</P>
<P>
	An Oklahoma Highway Patrol officer pulls a car over because it  
was weaving. The two people in it act nervous and give conflicting 
stories. One says they are coming from Dallas, the other says 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicious, the officer calls EPIC and asks for a check on the  
car and its occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	EPIC has access to databases on drug cases from the FBI, DEA and  
U.S. Customs. It also keeps track of all highway stops called in to 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPIC search finds that the vehicle crossed the border at  
Laredo, Texas, about eight hours earlier. A drug-sniffing dog is 
called in and alerts officers to the trunk. A search reveals 20 
kilos of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls like this pour into the center's main operations room,  
keeping the phones ringing around the clock. The center receives 
about 30,000 calls per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Operation Pipeline, the drug business -- worth $52  
billion a year in the U.S. according to the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy -- remains one step ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug organizations run communications networks that tell  
couriers which roads police are patrolling most. They use drivers, 
such as senior citizens, who don't fit the stereotype of drug 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hauling dope, it has no race, it has no religion,'' Wildauer  
says. ``Age doesn't matter. I've locked up a grandmother and her 
grandkids for hauling marijuana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal drug business pays its drivers so well, authorities  
say, that most will go to jail rather than inform on higher-ups. 
The going rate for transporting marijuana is around $100 per pound, 
with loads ranging anywhere from a couple pounds to several 
hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs are often stashed in hidden compartments of cars or  
trucks, but authorities have seen cocaine molded into pottery or 
even heated to a liquid state and soaked into bulk packages of 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	When authorities figure out where drugs are being hidden,  
concealment methods change, creating a daily cat-and-mouse game on 
interstates and along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Ordonez, a U.S. Customs inspector with glaring eyes and a  
sixth sense that goes off when something's not right, has worked 
three ports of entry along the Mexican border, questioning 
thousands of drivers crossing each year. He loves outsmarting drug 
couriers, but he knows the multibillion dollar drug business is 
beating him and everyone else along the 2,000-mile border 
senseless. 
</P>
<P>
	This doesn't make Ordonez want to give up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every 100 pounds of pot I catch is another 100 pounds that  
won't wind up in some high school somewhere,'' he says as another 
big truck pulls up to his booth. ``And I know how to find the 
dope.''

<P>
	Ordonez looks for drivers who won't make eye contact, the ones  
tapping the steering wheel nervously. He questions drivers if he 
sees a key chain with only one key on it. Why no house key? He is 
suspicious of those who seem unfamiliar with their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with cars, about 1,000 commercial trucks pass through El  
Paso's Ysleta Port of Entry each day. More and more, drug dealers 
are using big trucks to conceal their goods. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ordonez is suspicious of a truck, he sends it to the docks  
to be unloaded and searched. Some trucks are driven through a 
massive X-ray that scans the tractor and trailer. On average, about 
100 trucks a day will be scrutinized; the rest pass through 
unsearched. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Paso del Norte Port of Entry, which links downtown El  
Paso with the bustling Mexican city of Juarez, 10 lanes of 
automobiles stretch in lines several blocks long. Inspectors in 
dark-blue uniforms move through the lines, tapping their hands on 
the sides of vehicles, pounding small hammers against tires and 
hunching over to point flashlights into wheel wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees of the drug smugglers watch, noticing which inspectors  
are being the most thorough. The men use cell phones to tell 
couriers which lanes to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	A banged-up GMC van with tan and burgundy stripes pulls up to a  
customs booth. The driver nervously rolls down the window, 
releasing a strong scent of air freshener. Is he trying to hide 
something? 
</P>
<P>
	An inspector directs the van to a parking area. A drug-sniffing  
dog circles the vehicle, stops midway down the driver's side and 
barks. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors rip out the van's inside panels, exposing 20 bricks  
of marijuana -- about 140 pounds worth nearly $500,000 on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Turner congratulates his dog, Willie, on the find and  
gives high-fives to the other inspectors gathered to check out the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This,'' Turner says, ``makes it all worthwhile.''  
</P>
<P>
	But the inspectors are aware that while they were tied up with  
this bust, several other loads probably went through. Smugglers, an 
agent explains, will sometimes allow themselves to get caught with 
a load of pot so a colleague can sneak a stash of cocaine through 
while the inspectors are busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that they're doing it,'' the agent says, ``but how can  
we stop all of them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Due east of El Paso, Sgt. Lynn Calamia of the Louisiana State  
Police is wondering the same thing. His state is carved by two drug 
pipelines, Interstate 20 in the north and I-10 in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Calamia heads state police interdiction efforts. In the first  
seven months of 1998, his 25-person team confiscated more than 
$15.8 million in drugs on Louisiana interstates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always coming through,'' Calamia says. ``All hours of the  
day and night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just that morning, in fact, one of his patrols in Covington,  
La., pulled over a weaving car. The two women in it gave 
conflicting stories, prompting the officer to ask for consent to 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	In the trunk he found a huge tin of coffee creamer, an odd thing  
to take on a trip. A closer look revealed the tin had a hidden 
compartment holding a little over a pound of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Calamia has seen gas cylinders on the back of a truck that had  
been cut open, stuffed with drugs, resealed and pressurized. He's 
seen cars rigged with intricate trick compartments: turn on the 
defroster, click the turn signal and wiggle the gear shift all at 
once and the passenger side air bag compartment lifts open. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to highway interdiction, said Lt. Col. Ronnie Jones,  
deputy superintendent of operations for the Louisiana State Police, 
is pulling over as many vehicles as possible. One Louisiana 
interdiction officer, for example, will pull over 40 to 50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately,'' Jones said, ``an awful lot of people probably  
get through with dope and are laughing at us from somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Indiana, Wildauer sits in the shadow of an overpass,  
waiting for the next traffic violation, the next potential drug 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a Band-Aid over a bullet wound,'' he says. ``We may slow  
the bleeding, but we'll never stop it.''

 *Jack David    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Jack David, who founded the Blue Moon Tavern,  
Seattle's most-famous watering hole, died Jan. 10. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	David bought the University District tavern with his brother,  
Jim, in 1956. He took over his brother's interest three years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he sold the place in 1966, David was credited for  
fostering the ambiance of the bar, which attracted beatniks, 
hippies, artists, victims of the 1950s Communist-baiting, and 
anti-Vietnam War activists -- along with countless college students 
and the occasional patron who just wanted a beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack David set the tone,'' Seattle historian Walt Crowley  
said. ``He's legendary. He not only tolerated but encouraged the 
beats, the rads, the Reds, the hippies, the anarchists and the rest 
of the jolly crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Moon supporters lost a bid to have it recognized by the  
Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board in 1990, developers agreed to 
sign a 40-year lease, Crowley said, preserving the legacy.

 *Arthur Fatt    	
</P>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Arthur C. Fatt, one of the founders of  
Grey Advertising and a former chief executive of the company, died 
Tuesday at his winter home here. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lawrence Valenstein, Fatt started Grey in 1925 with a  
handful of employees in New York. By the time they retired, Grey 
had become one of the nation's leading advertising agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the accounts that Fatt brought to the company were Ford  
Motor Company, Proctor &AMP; Gamble and Chock Full o' Nuts. He wrote 
the well-known line for the Greyhound Lines bus company, ``Leave 
the driving to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grey Advertising, which now has offices in 90 countries, was  
ranked last year by Advertising Age as the world's sixth-largest ad 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenstein began in 1917 when he was 18 by borrowing $100 from  
his mother to lease space on Fifth Avenue and start a direct mail 
advertising company. He named his company Grey Studios, so the 
story goes, because the walls had been painted gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, Fatt, then 17, turned up to apply for a job as  
an office boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before long, Fatt was Valenstein's partner. They expanded the  
company and in 1925 changed its name to Grey Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatt became president and chief executive in 1956, succeeding  
his partner, who died in 1982. Fatt retired in 1976 after serving 
six years as founder-chairman.

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mario D. Grossi, a radio physicist who helped  
develop the concept of the tethered satellite, died of vascular 
disease Monday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Grossi was born in Giuncarico, Italy, and moved to the United  
States in 1958. He was affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian 
Center for Astrophysics for many years. He also was a consulting 
scientist at defense contractor Raytheon Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s Grossi and his colleague, Giuseppe Colombo,  
developed the concept of the tethered satellite, a technique that 
connects satellites to spacecrafts and allows them to drag through 
the lower atmosphere. Tethered satellites have several 
applications, including the generation of electrical power in 
space.

</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Monroe ``Bud'' Karmin, winner of a 1967  
Pulitzer Prize in journalism for stories investigating the 
influence on gambling of organized crime, died Friday after a long 
battle with cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	After college, service in the Air Force from 1950 to 1952 and  
studies at the Columbia University School of Journalism, Karmin 
joined The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmin and colleague Stanley Penn won their Pulitzer Prize for  
an expose of mafia dominance of gambling in the Bahamas. Karmin 
left the Journal in 1974 and worked for the Chicago Daily News, 
Knight Ridder Financial News and U.S. News and World Report before 
joining Bloomberg News as editor at large. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named to the Hall of Fame of the Washington chapter of  
the Society of Professonal Journalists, was president of the 
National Press Club in 1995. His last job was writing a column and 
other articles for Bloomberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son, a daughter and five  
grandchildren.

 *Doan Khue    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Former Defense Minister Gen. Doan Khue, a  
candidate for president during a government reshuffle in late 1997, 
died Saturday after a lengthy battle with cancer, Vietnam 
Television reported. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Khue was considered a conservative in the Communist Party  
Politburo and was given the Ho Chi Minh Medal, Vietnam's highest 
honor, this past week. 
</P>
<P>
	His death takes the number of Politburo members down to 17 from  
19 at the last party Central Committee plenum. 
</P>
<P>
	Khue began his career as an army officer in 1967. He worked his  
way up the ranks and became vice defense minister in 1980, the same 
year he joined the Politburo. He was named chief of staff in 1987 
and was promoted to four-star general in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He became defense minister in 1991 and resigned in 1996 amid  
reports of ill health.

                           *Tweet Kimball    	
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tweet Kimball, an heiress who amassed one of the  
nation's most eclectic art and book collections and established the 
Cherokee Ranch Foundation, died Friday at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball, heiress of a Tennessee ranching family, lived alone in  
a Scottish-style castle on her 5,000-acre Cherokee Ranch north of 
Sedalia. In 1996 she sold development rights to the land for $2 
million, and a conservation easement assures the property will 
remain undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a living trust, Kimball retained use of about 2,000 acres  
to raise her champion strain of Santa Gertrudis cattle. The 
property -- appraised at about $20 million -- is in an area under 
intense development pressure as an exclusive Front Range 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
	Living in London during World War II, Kimball became good  
friends with Winston Churchill. She eventually befriended eight 
U.S. presidents. Britain's Princess Anne was a castle guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball gathered one of the nation's most eclectic art and book  
collections, including originals by Rubens, Bruegel, and Pliny the 
Elder. Her collection of rare books included a third folio of 
Shakespeare's works, published while Shakespeare was living. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball served as a director of the Denver Art Museum and the  
World Wildlife Fund USA Council. In 1961, she established the Rocky 
Mountain Santa Gertrudis Association.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Buzz Kulik, who directed dozens of television  
films including ``A Storm in Summer'' and ``Brian's Song,'' died 
Wednesday of heart failure. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Kulik began his career in 1947 directing cameras at Yankees  
Stadium. He also directed episodes of television anthology series, 
including ``Lux Video Theater,'' ``Kraft Theater'' and ``Playhouse 
90.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He received his first Emmy nomination for directing an episode  
of ``Dr. Kildare'' in 1961 and others for 1975's ``Babe'' and 
1972's ``Brian's Song,'' which was so popular it became one of the 
few television movies to have a theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
	He won an Emmy Award for 1970's ``A Storm in Summer.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kulik also directed several features including the 1973 Burt  
Reynolds film ``Shamus'' and Steve McQueen's last movie, ``The 
Hunter'' (1980). Other TV film credits include 1986's ``Women of 
Valor'' and the 1985 miniseries ``Kane &AMP; Abel,'' as well as ``Rage 
of Angels'' (1983) and ''From Here to Eternity'' (1979).

<HEADLINE> Are We Back to the Go-Go Days? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David L. Babson, a pioneer of modern stock  
market investing, demonstrated to a public scarred by losses during 
the Great Depression and wartime inactivity that money could be 
multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
	After what they had been through, few investors in the late  
1940s viewed the stock market as an opportunity for growth of 
capital. They were happy just to get their 6 percent dividends each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Babson taught that dividends were good for preserving capital  
but that corporate growth could build capital into something more. 
He succeeded, and then the new ``gunslinger'' institutional 
managers caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund managers churned huge amounts of money in and out of  
speculative small company shares. ``Performance'' became the name 
of the game. Speculate. Make money quickly. Take a ride on the 
go-go stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	It provokes the question: Is something of the sort happening  
again? 
</P>
<P>
	As Babson, who created the David L. Babson company, said in a  
speech to mutual fund managers, ``When, on average, mutual funds 
churn their holdings at an annual rate of 40 percent -- when some 
turn them over two or three times faster than average -- when even 
pension funds shift their assets at 20 percent per year, can anyone 
seriously call this investing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Securities markets, he said, resemble a ``gigantic parimutuel  
operation.'' What happens when a performance stock runs into a 
problem? Will these ``restless holders try to hit the exits all at 
once?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every investor knows about performance. Any company with a  
bearing on the Internet is studied as a possible performance stock. 
Performance is the name of the game today, as it was in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``With many of these stocks selling at 50 to 100 times earnings  
and 10 to 15 times sales, performance may already be running out 
its string,'' he said. He observed that the spotlight is too 
focused on daily numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	He called attention to the big difference between ``promising  
growth stocks'' and mere ``frenzied trading'' in which an 
understanding of growth is subverted by a fad that might have the 
fate of all other fads. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is,'' Babson noted, ``almost no one in history has  
made a fortune -- and kept it -- by trading or speculating in the 
stock market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, he said, ``it's very easy to measure your performance,  
but it isn't easy to measure the risks you take in seeking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The folks at David L. Babson &AMP; Co. of Cambridge, Mass., thought  
the remarks were so acutely pertinent to the current marketplace 
that they printed them in the Jan. 8, 1999 staff letter. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Babson died on Dec. 14, 1998. The address to the  
investment managers was delivered here 31 years ago on Jan. 13, 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months after his address the go-go stocks began a plunge  
that, on average, erased 75 percent of their market prices, and 
many fell 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Steve Francis Rises to Greatness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Steve Francis has always found comfort  
on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he was shooting at bent rims on playgrounds, in chilly  
junior high school gyms or a firehouse basement, Francis focused on 
putting the ball in the basket, not on the struggles of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	His dedication has paid off. The skinny, 6-foot-3 guard now runs  
the show for fifth-ranked Maryland, using blurring quickness and 
acrobatic moves to break down defenses. He then scores or sets up 
teammates with pinpoint passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best 1-on-1 player on the team, maybe in the  
country,'' Maryland center Obinna Ekezie said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has not been easy for Francis to earn such praise. His  
life has been full of sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 6 when his father abandoned the family and by age 10  
Francis was working summer jobs to ease the financial burden on his 
mother, Brenda. 
</P>
<P>
	School was also a struggle. Francis was academically ineligible  
to play as a freshman at Blair (Md.) High School, saw little action 
as a 5-foot-3 sophomore and missed his junior season with a broken 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Then things got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis dropped out of school during his senior year after his  
mother died of cancer at age 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``For six or seven months after that, I couldn't move,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis took refuge at a tiny firehouse gym that was also the  
home of an outreach program for youths. At about the same time he 
got a tattoo on his right arm -- a 4-inch cross with the words, ``In 
Memory'' on top and ``Brenda'' in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, the 20-year-old Francis rubs the tattoo each time he  
prepares to take a free throw for Maryland. After spending two 
years playing for junior college teams that never lost a 
regular-season game, he is enjoying success at the Division I 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis leads Maryland in minutes, scoring and steals and is the  
main reason why the Terrapins are talking about reaching the Final 
Four for the first time. Instead of being burdened by the lofty 
expectations, Francis has carried himself as if he hasn't got a 
worry in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason for that. Steve had adversity in his life at  
an early age,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said. ``I think you 
handle it two ways: One, you just quit and don't make anything out 
of yourself. Or like Steve, you become determined to go the other 
way and be something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even on those rare occasions when his game is off, the junior  
still gives NBA scouts and opposing coaches something to think 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis went 3-for-14 from the field earlier this month in a  
home loss to Duke, but his whirling reverse layup in the first half 
was the most spectacular play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Steve Francis,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``He  
looks like he can score every time he gets the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he can. But Francis has blended his game with that of his  
teammates, learning to play the point and shooting guard in order 
to mesh with a squad already deep with talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came in here, a lot of people said, `He's going to be  
the one who's going to lead them to this or that.' I'm not trying 
to lead this team,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the offense is struggling, the Terrapins look to  
Francis to make something happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time our offense breaks down he just creates something.  
That's the advantage we have over almost everyone else,'' Ekezie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis may not be the team leader -- the three starting seniors  
have assumed that responsibility -- but he is the engine on a 
Maryland team that has been in the top 5 since the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	He is averaging 17 points per game and was impressive enough in  
his first dozen games to warrant selection as a candidate for the 
Wooden Award, presented annually to the nation's best college 
basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've played well so far, but I can be a lot better,''  
he said. ``There is a lot of stuff that I need to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big question around Maryland these days is whether Francis  
will round out his game at College Park next season or take a shot 
at the NBA, where he stands a good chance of being a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope Steve really enjoys this year and he helps us be a  
very good team,'' Williams said. ``Whatever happens after that 
happens.''

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Randle Not Expected To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- John Randle's streak of 107  
consecutive starts will likely come to an end on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle, the Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman, said  
his hyperextended left knee was still bothering him and he might 
not start in the NFC Championship Game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Stalin Colinet will play probably the first quarter,  
the second quarter, and maybe I'll just kind of work myself into 
the game,'' Randle said. ``I may play some nickel situations in the 
first quarter. It just depends on the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randle, the Vikings sack leader with 10 1/2, hasn't missed a start  
since Nov. 22, 1992. He injured his knee on the final play of 
Minnesota's 41-21 playoff victory over Arizona last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle missed practice Wednesday and wore a knee brace during  
practices Thursday and Friday.

<HEADLINE> For Brazil's Poor, Life Stays Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's decision to sharply  
devalue its currency was a shock to world markets but registered 
little more than a dull thud in the life of Paulo Januario's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is 16 years old, where is he going to find work?''  
Januario, 41, a security guard on Rio's poor north side asked on 
Saturday. ``My problem isn't Brazil's economy, it's my own economy 
and how I cope with everyday life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Januario is among the two-thirds of Brazil's 160 million people  
earning up to 390 reals a month. It doesn't matter much to him that 
last week's devaluation means he earns 17 percent less in dollar 
terms -- $270 today as opposed to $325 a week ago. Like most 
Brazilians, he is unlikely to buy dollars as a hedge against 
inflation or to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brazil's decision to sharply devalue its currency could  
lead the government to adopt measures needed to heal the economy. 
If it can reduce 29-percent-a-month interest rates, the likelihood 
of creating jobs for people like Januario's son goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the mountains in Rio's Ipanema district, the drop in the  
value of the currency has an immediate and painful impact on 
Brazil's small middle class. It reduces the buying power that sent 
record numbers of Brazilians traveling abroad in the past 4 1/2 years 
and created a boom in imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm earning the same money, but overnight it isn't going as  
far,'' said Ronaldo Maia. The 60-year-old judge sat in a travel 
agency waiting to buy an airplane ticket suddenly made more 
expensive because overseas fares in Brazil are quoted in U.S. 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzana Saldana, a professor at the Federal University of Rio de  
Janeiro, said her car payment -- also indexed to the dollar -- just 
jumped from 1,800 reals a month to 2,200 (roughly $1,500 before and 
after the devaluation). ``I haven't had my salary readjusted in 
four years and now my money is worth even less,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, a ``doleiro'' who buys and sells dollars on the  
illegal but largely tolerated parallel market, said business has 
tripled in the past week. His rates were 4 centavos better than 
bank rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Brazil's middle class purchased dollars to  
hedge their losses as inflation rose to around 2,700 percent a 
year, and the local currency was devalued at about the same rate. A 
1994 economic stabilization plan meant, for a time, that a dollar 
bought just 82 centavos to the real. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time at the start of the real plan when I thought  
I'd have to go out of business, but now it's almost like old 
times,'' said the doleiro, who would only identify himself as 
Rodrigo.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Young Defends Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There was no bribery involved in Atlanta's  
Olympic bid for the 1996 Summer Games, former Atlanta mayor and 
United Nations ambassador Andrew Young said as the scandal 
involving payoffs for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City 
widens. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarianism, not bribery, motivated Atlanta's assistance to  
Third World athletes and Olympic officials before and after the 
1996 Games, Young told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely no money changed hands,'' he said of Atlanta's  
winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised money, we raised it openly, we discussed it  
publicly. It's inconceivable to me that Atlanta (dealings), prior 
to the bid, could be conceived as a bribe to get the Olympics,'' he 
said in today's editions of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the city was helping the less fortunate.  
</P>
<P>
	``You are expected to help people in need in the Olympic family,  
particularly if you come from a rich country such as this,'' said 
Young, who helped Billy Payne mastermind Atlanta's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee asked 13 of its members to  
explain their actions in dealing with the bid committees in Salt 
Lake City and other cities. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
said that nine cases could possibly be serious enough to lead to 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we bid (in 1990), people wanted us to help,'' Young  
said. ``And you can't have an operation that makes that much money 
and have poor people with nothing and them not ask for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the president of Mozambique mentioned in 1991 that his  
country's runners weren't getting enough protein, Young said he 
helped organize a shipment of food and protein that was paid for by 
U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when David Sikhulumi Sibandze, an IOC member from  
Swaziland, became ill on a visit to Atlanta during the bidding 
process, he was sent to a doctor and received free hospital tests 
after complaining of chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never did anything for anybody in a humanitarian way  
related to the Olympics that we hadn't done anyway and that we 
wouldn't do if the Olympics wren't involved,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young served as an unpaid adviser to Salt Lake's successful bid  
for the 2002 Games.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A group of Protestant churches says the $2  
million cost of Pope John Paul II's visit to Mexico City later this 
month is proof that Roman Catholic leaders are removed from the 
struggles of the country's poor, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoniram Gaxiola, spokesman for the Secretariat of Public  
Relations for Evangelical Churches, also criticized plans to build 
a $7 million evangelical center at the Catholic Church's Basilica 
of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing but a fight by the Catholic Church to recover  
ground lost'' to other churches, the daily Reforma quoted Gaxiola 
as saying. ``But this already is an irreversible situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Papal Nuncio Justo Muller said the $2 million price tag for John  
Paul's Jan. 22-27 visit includes transportation, food and housing 
for the pope and his delegation, Reforma reported. A leading 
Mexican bank, Banamex, will cover the costs, which the church plans 
to pay back through the sale of medallions commemorating the trip. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Seventeen members of a special Chiapas state  
police force have been detained for allegedly shooting and wounding 
two young men suspected of embezzlement, the government news agency 
Notimex reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the Special Unit Against Crime, including its  
chief, Pedro Martinez Tamayo, are accused of using unnecessary 
force against the two men early Friday, Notimex quoted state 
prosecutor Eduardo Montoya as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya said state officials were ensuring that the two young  
men, Raul Hernandez and Jose Damian, received medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Notimex did not give details of the Friday shooting or the men's  
injuries. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican police have seized 10,000 sea turtle  
eggs that apparently were stolen from coastal nesting grounds in 
the southern state of Oaxaca, a news report said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said two men were transporting the eggs along a highway  
in Oaxaca state early Friday and ran away when they saw the 
officers approaching them, the daily Reforma reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The men fled and police recovered seven sacks and three baskets  
containing the eggs, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican law prohibits the harvesting of turtle eggs, which are a  
popular delicacy in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Countries in the Americas will accept  
the plan of Venezuela's president-elect to replace his country's 
constitution, provided it is done legally, U.S. Ambassador John 
Maisto said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing state governors in the western city of Barquisimeto,  
Maisto said President-elect Hugo Chavez's plan should take place 
``within a democratic and constitutional framework'' and be ``the 
product of negotiations and consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, a former army paratrooper who led an unsuccessful  
coup attempt against Venezuela's democratically elected government 
in 1992, says a new constitution is needed to overhaul what he says 
is the country's antiquated political system. He takes office on 
Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had long been wary of Chavez, denying him a  
tourist visa because of his coup attempt. But after Chavez won a 
landslide victory in Dec. 6 presidential elections, the Clinton 
administration congratulated him and urged him to respect 
democracy.

<HEADLINE> 'Scully' Questions Sex Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At first, Gillian Anderson figured she didn't  
fit the standards for a sex symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana Scully, her character on ``The X-Files,'' is too  
straight-laced, too button-downed. But her popularity kept growing.

<P>
	``At first I thought it was bizarre. I just didn't get it,''  
Anderson says in Redbook's February issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scully is a change of pace, I guess. There's something about  
her intelligence that mixes with the male fantasy of `What does she 
really look like underneath those tailored suits?'''

<HEADLINE> Senate Response to First Arguments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reaction from senators on Saturday after House  
prosecutors completed their opening arguments in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``We are getting close to some votes  
here on motions, and that will be real test of what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.: ``Today, they did not tie those  
explicit details to high crimes and misdemeanors. The real question 
is whether having an illicit affair and lying about it rises to 
high crimes and misdemeanors. No one touched that subject. Strike 
touched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: ``The House managers understand  
that based on the current record and with the arguments presented 
to date, they are not going to win this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo.: ``I think they did a very good job  
wrapping up and summarizing. ... I would think a large majority (of 
senators) have not made up their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.: ``If he hadn't lied, where would you  
have been, and about what? A consensual act. ... If you say lying 
about a noncrime can be converted into a high crime by the way you 
handle it, that sets a pretty low standard for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.: ``There are two ways to deal with  
presidential misconduct. One through the criminal justice system, 
the other through impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.: ``There's a sense developing in the  
Senate there will probably be witnesses called. ... It's almost 
reached a point of inevitability that witnesses will be called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,: ``The managers today made an  
overwhelming case that these facts are important and that perjury 
and obstruction of justice ..., if proven, are impeachable 
offenses.''

<HEADLINE> Borden, Chow Take Honors at Reese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Amanda Borden and Amy Chow, two of the  
``Magnificent Seven'' women's team that won the Olympic gold in 
1996, took the women's top honors Saturday at the Reese's 
Gymnastics Cup, the sport's annual night of lighthearted 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Borden and Chow wrapped up first place with enthusiastic floor  
exercise routines. Borden, the 1996 Olympic team captain and now 
team manager of the Arizona State University gymnastics squad, 
performed to a Michael Jackson medley. Chow, a sophomore pre-med 
student at Stanford, did an acrobatic ``Freeze Frame'' 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Waller, 30-year-old former national champion, teamed with  
2000 Olympic hopeful Blaine Wilson, 24, to win the men's event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Davis and Natalie Lacuesta were the rhythmic winners.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is my favorite part about gymnastics, being able to  
perform for people and having a good time,'' Borden said. ``For 
people like me who really aren't into serious competition anymore, 
this is what I love to do. This is the only reason I continue to do 
gymnastics is because it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a night for entertainment, not intense competition, with  
John Macready doing a floor exercise in tuxedo, Jason Gatson 
blindfolded on the horizontal bar and Kristie Phillips in knee-high 
pink boots on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regular gymnastics is also to entertain the crowd, but this  
also gets the crowd involved,'' Wilson said. ``You can pull them 
out of their seats and get them down on the floor almost. You're 
still a little nervous, though. You don't want to fall on your 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody did, unless it was on purpose as part of the show.  
</P>
<P>
	There were eight two-gymnast teams, three men's artistic teams,  
three women's artistic teams and two women's rhythmic teams. Each 
team member performed in two events. 
</P>
<P>
	The runaway crowd favorite was 1996 Olympian Macready. Wearing  
sunglasses and a shimmering silver suit, Macready began his first 
routine robot-like, synchronizing his movements to a suitably 
mechanical soundtrack, then swinging onto the horizontal bars as 
Guns N' Roses' ``Welcome to the Jungle'' blared through Wells Fargo 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round, Macready came out as a maestro, complete  
with tux and baton, and hamming his way through a routine to the 
``William Tell Overture.'' Macready had five 10s and a nine from 
the six judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The only performance to earn a 10 from all six judges was by  
rhythmic gymnast Mila Marinova with a ribbon. But it wasn't enough 
to overcome the overall performance of the team of Davis and 
Lacuesta, who between them have won the last four national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good showcase for rhythmic because we're supposed to  
perform, we're supposed to express. It's great to have the audience 
there,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The performances were more show biz than athletic competition,  
and so was the judging. The judges included actresses Joan Van Ark 
(``Dallas and Knot's Landing''), Sean Young (``Blade Runner'' and 
``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective''), television actors James Avery 
(``Fresh Prince of Bel Air'') and Jimmy James (`NewsRadio''), 
recording artist Mya and ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White.

	Prosecutors Demand Clinton's Removal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors today demanded President  
Clinton's removal from office, telling senators that otherwise the 
presidency itself may be deeply damaged. In his speech concluding 
the opening statements of House prosecutors, Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
said Clinton had ``broken his covenant of trust with the American 
people.'' Still, there was little evidence that Clinton's 
Democratic support had eroded. Meanwhile, Clinton's legal team said 
it would be ready with a strong defense when the trial resumes 
Tuesday.

	NATO To Hold Emergency Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO will hold an emergency session tomorrow  
in Brussels to consider a response to the execution-style massacre 
of dozens of people in southern Kosovo, the State Department 
spokesman said today. NATO's contingency plans involve the possible 
bombing of Serb installations. Dozens of bodies were scattered 
around the village of Racak today, a day after a fierce attack by 
Serb forces on ethnic Albanian villages. The death toll, which 
included elderly men, apparently is the highest in a single attack 
since the Oct. 12 cease-fire agreement brokered by U.S. envoy 
Richard Holbrooke. 

</P>
<P>
	Saddam Denounces Sanctions  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denounced  
U.N. sanctions today, saying nothing could compare to their 
``mischief and damage.'' In a speech broadcast on Arab News 
Network, a London-based satellite television channel, Saddam asked 
``why the evil forces have targeted Iraq alone and focused on it in 
such a manner and for such a long time.'' His speech marked the 
eighth anniversary of the outbreak of the 1991 Persian Gulf War in 
which a U.S.-led coalition of forces liberated Kuwait from seven 
months of Iraqi occupation. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Prepares State of Union  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with his political fate in jeopardy,  
President Clinton is preparing a State of the Union address that 
aides say offers an ambitious agenda geared to the challenges of 
the 21st century and the needs of aging baby boomers. In a series 
of previews of Tuesday night's speech, Clinton already has 
announced initiatives to improve military readiness, improve food 
safety, reduce violence against children and help Americans with 
long-term health care needs. He also is expected to call for 
increasing the minimum wage even though Congress ignored a similar 
call last year.

	Colombia Seizes 880 Lbs. of Cocaine  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's navy said today it had found  
880 pounds of cocaine on a fishing boat seized by the U.S. Coast 
Guard after a three-day pursuit in the Caribbean. Drug sniffing 
dogs detected the cocaine hidden in 12 automotive batteries stored 
on the vessel, after it was escorted by the Coast Guard back to 
Colombia's Caribbean port of Cartagena yesterday. Colombia is the 
world's top cocaine producer, exporting roughly 80 percent of the 
cocaine sold in the United States.

	Man Crushed by Brick Wall Survives  
</P>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A man who survived a death sentence  
that involved being crushed under a toppled brick wall said today 
his survival was proof of his innocence. Shuma Khan, convicted of 
sexually assaulting a boy, was buried yesterday beneath the rubble 
of the 15-foot wall -- the punishment for homosexuality in parts of 
Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban Islamic militia. But he lived 
and under Taliban law, a death sentence is commuted if the 
convicted person survives the execution. ``I was wrongfully 
convicted for sodomy. And God has proven my innocence,'' Khan told 
The Associated Press today.

	Guilty Plea Involves Super Bowl  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Robert William Greer Jr. was willing to  
plead guilty to murder for strangling a man -- but only if he could 
watch the Super Bowl before heading to a state prison. Prosecutors 
agreed, and District Judge Bob Gill sentenced Greer to 18 years in 
prison. Greer asked that he not be imprisoned until Feb. 1, so he 
could watch the Super Bowl at the Tarrant County jail. Greer told 
his attorneys that the Jan. 31 game would be the best ever if the 
Minnesota Vikings play in it. They face the Atlanta Falcons 
tomorrow for the chance to advance to the Super Bowl.

	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Luke Recker scored 24 points and  
four of his teammates also finished in double figures as No. 23 
Indiana upset arch-rival No. 13 Purdue 87-76 today. A.J. Guyton had 
21 points and William Gladness scored 13 for the Hoosiers, who 
hadn't won at Mackey Arena since 1993 and had lost six of the last 
seven games between the two teams. Indiana (16-5, 3-3 Big Ten) 
snapped a three-game losing streak on the road, all conference 
games.

<HEADLINE> How Vikings and Falcons Match Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Matchups for Sunday's NFC title game between 	
the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons: 
</P>
<P>
                    *WHEN THE VIKINGS HAVE THE BALL 	
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings set an NFL record with 556 points in the regular  
season, never scored fewer than 24, went over 30 in 11 games, over 
40 four times and hit 50 once. And they're versatile. If Randall 
Cunningham (7), Cris Carter (80) and Randy Moss (84) are 
controlled, there's tight end Andrew Glover (82), running backs 
Robert Smith (26) and Leroy Hoard (44), and return man and 
third-down specialist David Palmer (22). In last Sunday's game 
against Arizona, Palmer even played a little quarterback, running 
and trying to pass from the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	But while teams know what's coming from Cunningham and his  
receivers, they can't do much to stop them. The Falcons may try to 
line up their best cornerback, Ray Buchanan (34) on Moss, but 
Buchanan is just 5-foot-9, giving Moss an 8-inch advantage. The 
other corner, Ronnie Bradford (23), is 5-10, so look for 6-2 nickel 
back Michael Booker (20) to see a lot of Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-teaming Moss and Carter just gives Glover and Matthew  
Hatchette (89) more room -- Hatchette has assumed a bigger role 
since Jake Reed (86) was injured. Free safety Eugene Robinson (41) 
is the leader of the secondary and played the Vikings (without 
Moss) four times in two seasons in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to top the passing game is to put pressure on  
Cunningham. The Falcons' Chuck Smith (90) is one of the league's 
unsung pass rushers, Lester Archambeau (92) led the team with 10 
sacks, and Travis Hall (98) and Shane Dronett (75) are effective 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Vikings' offensive line is one of the league's best.  
Left tackle Todd Steussie (73), left guard Randall McDaniel (64) 
and center Jeff Christy (62) are all going to the Pro Bowl and 
David Dixon (71) and Korey Stringer (77) weigh nearly 700 pounds 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota had more trouble this season with big lines, and  
Atlanta's is relatively small. Hall weighs 300 pounds and Dronett 
has bulked up 25 pounds to 295, but Smith and Archambeau are 265 
and 275. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean a lot of yards rushing for quick slasher Robert 	
Smith and Hoard, the short-yardage man. Smith had 1,187 yards 
during the season and Hoard averaged 4.2 yards a carry, a lot for a 
big back. But the Atlanta linebackers, Jessie Tuggle (58), 
Cornelius Bennett (97) and Henri Crockett (91), all had good years, 
particularly Bennett, who at 33 was thought to be past his prime. 
Tuggle is the NFL's leading active tackler, with 1,682 over a 
12-year career.	
</P>
<P>
                    *WHEN THE FALCONS HAVE THE BALL 	
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' offense may be its best defense, if it can control  
the ball and clock by running Jamal Anderson (32), whose 1,846 
yards were the ninth most by any back in an NFL season. His 410 
regular-season carries set an NFL record. Anderson did it despite 
an offensive line that had to adjust from the run-and-shoot at the 
beginning of the 1997 season, meaning it had to learn run-blocking 
all over again. He also will be missing injured fullback Bob 
Christian, but Brian Koslowski (85), a journeyman tight end, has 
filled in well. The Falcons led the league in time of possession, 
more than 33 minutes a game, and they'll need to do that Sunday 
against a defense that can be exploited. 
</P>
<P>
	Left tackle Bob Whitfield (70), the only first-round pick on the  
offensive line, will probably play against perennial All-Pro John 
Randle if Randle starts at right end instead of at tackle, as 
expected. But the key run-stopper is nose tackle Jerry Ball (96), a 
338-pound, 12-year veteran who had his best season since his Pro 
Bowl days in Detroit nearly a decade ago. The Minnesota linebackers 
are relatively small but very quick, particularly Ed McDaniel (58), 
Dwayne Rudd (57) and Dixon Edwards (59). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chandler (12) had his best season for the Falcons with a  
quarterback rating of 100.9 that was fourth in the league, ahead of 
John Elway, Brett Favre and Troy Aikman among others. His two 
principal targets, Tony Martin (80) and Terance Mathis (81) both 
had over 1,100 yards receiving and 130 catches between them. Each 
averaged 17.9 yards a catch, making them deep threats against a 
Minnesota secondary that makes big plays but also gambles a lot. 
Right cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock (37) had seven interceptions, 
returning three for TDs and strong safety Robert Griffith (24) had 
five and is better than most strong safeties at man-to-man 
coverage. He often plays cornerback in nickel packages. 
</P>
<P>
	If both are double-covered look for tight end O.J. Santiago 	
(88).	
</P>
<P>
                           *SPECIAL TEAMS 	
</P>
<P>
	The kickers, Minnesota's Gary Anderson (1) and Atlanta's Morten  
Andersen (5), are 1-2 in career field goals (Anderson has 418 and 
Andersen 401). Neither has slowed down with age -- Anderson is 39, 
Andersen 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had a perfect season -- 59-of-59 on extra points and  
35-of-35 on field goals. Andersen was almost as good, missing one 
extra point and going 23-of-28 on field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Minnesota has an extra weapon in punter Mitch Berger, who  
also handles kickoffs and had 42 touchbacks during the regular 
season. That's important. Of those kickoffs that were returned, 
four went for touchdowns and the special teams also gave up a punt 
return for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Tim Dwight (83) a potential problem for the Vikings.  
</P>
<P>
	Dwight averaged 27 yards a return for the Falcons and returned  
one for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer handles the kickoff and punt return duties for Minnesota. 	
He averaged four yards fewer than Dwight on kickoffs but had an 
88-yard TD return.	
</P>
<P>
                      *COACHING AND INTANGIBLES 	
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dan Reeves, who underwent quadruple heart bypass  
surgery a month ago, has been in eight Super Bowls as player, 
assistant coach and head coach, losing in 1987, 1988 and 1990 as 
head coach of the Broncos. He has two former head coaches on his 
staff: defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, who coached the Rams in 
1995-96; and offensive line coach Art Shell, a Hall of Fame tackle 
as a player, who was coach of the Raiders for almost five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little postseason experience among the Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	Chandler is in the playoffs for the first time in his 11-year  
career after playing for teams like Arizona, Indianapolis and Tampa 
Bay. Bennett played in four consecutive losing Super Bowls with 
Buffalo, and Robinson was in the last two with Green Bay. Martin 
(San Diego, 1995) and backup defensive back Randy Fuller 
(Pittsburgh, 1996) also have Super Bowl experience. White (Detroit, 
1992) and Buchanan (Indianapolis, 1996) have both played in 
conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota coach Dennis Green now has the longest tenure with one  
team, after Marty Schottenheimer quit in Kansas City. Green has 
been to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, but his record is 
just 2-4. The victories came last Sunday against Arizona and last 
season against the Giants, when the Vikings rallied from a 
nine-point deficit in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, who quarterbacked a star-studded but underachieving  
team in Philadelphia, has never gone this far in the playoffs. He's 
never been past the second round. The most experienced of the 
Vikings is Edwards, who played on three Super Bowl winners in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest intangible in this game will be the noise.  
</P>
<P>
	While visitors have won four of the last 10 NFC title games,  
none has played indoors, where both artificial noise and the crowd 
often make it impossible for opposing offenses to hear signals. In 
Minnesota's 28-14 victory over Green Bay during the regular season, 
the Packers were called for five illegal procedure penalties on one 
touchdown drive.

<HEADLINE> Apartments Have Risen on Quake Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The deathtrap that was Northridge Meadows has  
given way to a new apartment complex called Parc Ridge. There's a 
pool, a gym and a playground, and a sign that boasts ``Luxury 
Living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, Northridge Meadows had a sign, too. It promised  
``Luxury Resort Living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people died there when the magnitude-6.7 Northridge  
earthquake struck at 4:31 a.m., Jan. 17, 1994. All lived on the 
first floor, crushed when the second and third stories collapsed 
onto them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northridge quake was America's costliest natural disaster:  
72 dead; 9,000 injured and $25 billion in property damage. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $6.3 billion in 
assistance, but says nearly a third of those who applied for 
federal aid have yet to completely rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Parc Ridge, a 158-unit, three-story complex on Reseda Boulevard,  
opened in November with much fanfare from local politicians. The 
$16.8 million project was financed with city and federal housing 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing that betrays the death and destruction visited  
here five years ago. Some tenants didn't even know its predecessor 
was Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	But most do know its past. Some, according to maintenance  
supervisor Lee Rosenberg, had priests bless their units before they 
moved in. Others, he said with uplifted eyebrows, moved in because 
of what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the driveway stand 16 trees, planted in honor of the dead.  
But there is nothing -- not a sign or a plaque -- that explains their 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't publicize or play it up out of respect for them,''  
said Eddie Cohen, whose Northridge Redevelopment Group owns the new 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Them'' included Sharon and Phil Englar, who lived in No. 102  
and died holding hands, lying in bed. Darla Enos died in No. 123, 
crushed in her bedroom while her husband was already up and 
drinking coffee in the kitchen; he survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The old 164-unit Northridge Meadows was doomed by its location  
near the quake's epicenter and by outdated building codes. Its 
walls tore like cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Structural requirements enacted since the quake require thicker  
concrete walls, and additional connections between framing and 
foundations to prevent buildings from sliding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel really good about what we did here,'' Cohen said. ``We  
provided the community with a high standard and incredible 
amenities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parc Ridge has rented 95 units, Cohen said. Some are set aside  
for low-income renters with a two-bedroom apartment going for $625, 
compared to market value of $1,095 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a single Northridge Meadows tenant moved back, but some of  
them can't forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people who used to live here come by and look at  
it,'' Cohen said. ``They talk about how scary it was and about how 
safe this looks now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most renters said they are relatively untroubled by the site's  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to go on,'' said 22-year-old college student Arny  
Pollack, who lives on the first floor. ``Everything here is up to 
code now. I do feel bad about the people who died here. But people 
die. It's a way of life. And you've got to live life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upstairs and down the hall, Raja Hamawe, 32, said she knows what  
happened five years ago. ``I think about it and it makes me 
scared,'' said the mother of two. ``But it is such a nice building 
now. It is safe now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are concerned not about structural safety but about  
displaced spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty scary,'' said Luciano Bayardo, 22, who lives with  
Marlene Estrada, 18, and their 14-month-old daughter, Clarissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about it at night,'' Bayardo said. ``I know it sounds  
weird, but one night I went to bed and locked the doors and turned 
out the lights and the next morning I came out and all the doors 
were unlocked and the lights were on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who comes here, all our family, they say watch out  
for ghosts and stuff,'' she said with a chuckle.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Wins Cross-Country Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUMFORD, Maine (AP) -- John Bauer, who's always skied well in the  
national cross-country championships, earned his ninth U.S. title 
Saturday in the men's 30-kilometer race while three-time Olympian 
Nina Kemppel of Anchorage, Alaska, added her fourth women's crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a two-time Olympian from Champlin, Minn., covered the  
four-lap course in 1 hour, 13 minutes, 43.4 seconds, 8.3 seconds 
ahead of 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Swenson of Boulder, Colo., a professional mountain bike  
racer and former Dartmouth College ski captain who raced in the '94 
Olympics. Marcus Nash of Fryeburg, Maine, another two-time Olympic 
racer, was third in 1:14.37.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemppel, who already has qualified for the world championships  
next month in Austria, was timed in 43:43.4 over the two 7.5K laps 
at Black Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Douglas, a former Middlebury College racer from Ketchum,  
Idaho, took the silver medal in 44:07.5 and University of Vermont 
skier Tessa Benoit of South Pomfret, Vt., was third in 45:08.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a struggle for me out there today,'' Kemppel said. ``I  
was cramping up really bad from about 9 Ks. It was a struggle just 
to get up the hills, definitely not ideal conditions for me ... six 
inches of mushy snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the men raced at mid-morning, snow conditions were ``rocket  
fast,'' Bauer said. ``I was wearing glasses but I had to keep 
blinking away tears in my eyes because of the speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to upset recent history, he said, when he would ski  
well in the national championships and then run into sickness and 
other problems overseas. ``I've been healthy all along so far, and 
I'm going to stay healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling too consistent this year to have anything go  
wrong,'' he said. ``I didn't feel I had a great race today, like I 
was pushing myself. I was tired but I don't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five men and four women will be chosen from these races to join  
Kemppel in Ramsau, Austria, Feb. 18-28 for the Nordic World 
Championships.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Disrupts Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A power outage at the Federal Aviation  
Administration's regional air traffic control center disrupted air 
travel throughout the Northwest and delayed flights for about 8,000 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage and the failure of a backup generator lasted about 35  
minutes Friday when controllers lost radar and radio 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA halted all plane departures in the region until the  
problem was fixed, which delayed more than 8,000 passengers, some 
for several hours. No safety problems were reported, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a domino effect,'' said Sue Warner-Bean, a Horizon  
Airlines spokeswoman. ``If a flight is delayed on one route, then 
the next flight and the next flight and the next flight is 
delayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-bound jets were left waiting at distant airports, and 46  
planes were temporarily grounded at Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem began about 2 p.m. Friday at the Seattle Air Route  
Traffic Control Center, which controls air traffic for all of 
Washington, the western two-thirds of Oregon, the Idaho panhandle, 
small portions of Montana and Nevada and a portion of northern 
California. It is one of 20 such centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The backup power supply generator didn't work when it was  
supposed to,'' said Mitch Barker, FAA spokesman. ``We don't know 
what triggered that having to come on. It may have been a 
commercial power blip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Puget Sound Energy, which supplies power to  
the FAA facility, said electricity to the building was not cut off 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's outage, controllers used backup communications  
at Sea-Tac Airport to communicate with pilots in the air, Barker 
said.

<HEADLINE> European Hospitals Face Drug Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Hospitals across Europe have been  
warned about the possibility of improperly labeled medical supplies 
after two premature babies died from a dose of medicine mislabeled 
as glucose, a Belgian hospital administrator said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first baby died of cardiac arrest under mysterious  
circumstances Thursday at the Gasthuisberg hospital in Leuven, 15 
miles east of Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	When a second baby died Saturday, doctors linked the deaths to a  
bottle labeled as 5-percent glucose that turned out to be potassium 
chloride. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart Van Daele, the hospital's general director, said the death  
of the first baby had puzzled doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could not be explained that a baby that appeared to be in  
reasonably good health could deteriorate so badly within a few 
minutes and be the victim of cardiac arrest. It was not normal,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only at the moment that the liquid was injected (into  
the second baby) that a link was being established between the 
product and the syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although potassium chloride is a natural element in the body, an  
injection could be lethal for premature babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about a product with another label, in  
different packaging that was provided by the firm this way and that 
could not be differentiated,'' Van Daele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Health Minister Marcel Colla told the VTM television  
network that he immediately warned neighboring nations ``that there 
is a problem with this product from this firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colla refused to name the company responsible for the supply,  
saying only that it was German. Authorities are now investigating 
the deaths and the circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Blind Man Guilty of Drunken Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A blind man who slammed into a tree  
after taking his friend's BMW out for a spin has been fined $513 
for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Council, 39, said he thought he knew the roads in  
Mufreesboro well enough to navigate them with the help of friend 
Jeffrey Hamilton. So after having a few drinks on Dec. 10, the pair 
put the top down on Hamilton's BMW convertible and went for a drive 
in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Council missed a sharp left curve and slammed head-on into a  
tree. He suffered a broken arm; Hamilton had a shattered leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men later admitted to troopers that they'd been drinking.  
On Friday, Council was ordered by Rutherford County General 
Sessions Court to pay $513 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Council, who was wearing wraparound sunglasses when he crashed,  
told troopers to ``never let a blind man drive.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Prepares State of Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with his political fate in jeopardy,  
President Clinton is preparing a State of the Union address that 
aides say offers an ambitious agenda geared to the challenges of 
the 21st century and the needs of aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday night, I'm going to ask the country to go back to work  
because we've still got a lot to do,'' the president told a 
Democratic party gala late Friday before settling in for a weekend 
of rehearsing the speech with aides in the White House family 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a president who is looking backward in the seventh  
year of his presidency,'' said White House communications director 
Ann Lewis. ``He is looking forward. In fact, these are ideas that 
you might see in a first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of previews of Tuesday night's speech, Clinton  
already has announced initiatives to improve military readiness, 
improve food safety, reduce violence against children and help 
Americans with long-term health care needs. He also is expected to 
call for increasing the minimum wage even though Congress ignored a 
similar call last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A big question is how Clinton will follow up on last year's call  
to ``save Social Security first.'' He used that slogan to beat down 
Republican tax-cut proposals, but has not shown his hand on what he 
wants done to ensure the solvency of the Social Security fund when 
the baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Clinton will tell Congress that ``this is the year we  
should get it done'' and shed some light on his thinking, stressing 
that any solution has to have bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's strong economy gives him strong footing for his  
speech. Clinton will boast of a record budget surplus, the lowest 
unemployment in nearly 30 years, the highest home ownership rate in 
history and the creation of nearly 18 million new jobs during his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will make his nationally televised address at 9 p.m. EDT  
Tuesday from the House chamber, where a month earlier lawmakers 
voted mostly on party lines to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech comes on the same day as the opening of the White  
House defense in his Senate impeachment trial, a coincidence that 
even some Democrats say creates an awkwardness warranting 
postponement of the address. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Saturday that the State of the  
Union is an opportunity for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president can help himself by delivering a strong State of  
the Union speech and acting presidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president can help himself by delivering a strong State of  
the Union speech and acting presidential,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides, however, see the speech as an opportunity to  
stand before an audience of tens of millions of Americans and 
demonstrate that he is focusing on their needs, regardless of his 
own political peril. The appearance is likely to provide a boost in 
the polls even for a president who enjoys extraordinarily high 
approval ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about doing the peoples' business,'' Lewis said,  
insisting that the impeachment drama has not changed the planning 
for Clinton's speech. The president has indicated he will not 
mention his political troubles; last year he did not mention the 
Monica Lewinsky affair even though it dominated the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The partisan repercussions from the impeachment fight are likely  
to sour the mood for many major achievements in Congress. Moreover, 
the Republican-led Congress is not inclined to jump on the 
Democrats' bandwagon as both parties jockey for position for the 
presidential race in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has successfully used the State of the Union speech to  
frame the policy agenda for Congress. His Social Security theme put 
the brakes on GOP tax cuts even as the president achieved some of 
his own prized goals, such as winning a down payment on money to 
hire 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Clinton will renew his call to restrict teen smoking,  
calling for a new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax. He'll also propose 
$600 million to build on his initiative to put 100,000 police on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will renew his proposals for school construction  
spending and to allow Americans as young as 55 years old buy in to 
Medicare.

<P>
	``This is about doing the peoples' business,'' Lewis said,  
insisting that the impeachment drama has not changed the planning 
for Clinton's speech. The president has indicated he will not 
mention his political troubles; last year he did not mention the 
Monica Lewinsky affair even though it dominated the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The partisan repercussions from the impeachment fight are likely  
to sour the mood for many major achievements in Congress. Moreover, 
the Republican-led Congress is not inclined to jump on the 
Democrats' bandwagon as both parties jockey for position for the 
presidential race in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has successfully used the State of the Union speech to  
frame the policy agenda for Congress. His Social Security theme put 
the brakes on GOP tax cuts even as the president achieved some of 
his own prized goals, such as winning a down payment on money to 
hire 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Clinton will renew his call to restrict teen smoking,  
calling for a new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax. He'll also propose 
$600 million to build on his initiative to put 100,000 police on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will renew his proposals for school construction  
spending and to allow Americans as young as 55 years old buy in to 
Medicare.

<HEADLINE> LSU Professor: Dean Spanked Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A Louisiana State University professor  
claims in a lawsuit that an associate dean pulled her onto his lap 
and spanked her while chanting ``You're a bad girl!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne H. Piper claims that Richard Nelson, associate dean of  
communications, spanked her Jan. 12 while she was talking to him 
about a chance to lecture at Indiana University for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Piper, 43, said the conversation soured when she defended how  
long she would be gone from LSU's Manship School of Mass 
Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson spanked her while another associate dean, Ron Garay,  
``sat idly by, watching and laughing,'' the lawsuit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	It also claims that Nelson had previously made sexual comments  
and advances toward her, most recently on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's wife, Valoie, said Friday that university lawyers have  
told her husband not to talk about the suit but said Nelson ``has 
never had any sexual interest in her at all. He's innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nelson said her husband and others were congratulating  
Piper on prospects for a new job when she fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to help her up, and he gave her a pat,'' Mrs. Nelson  
said. ``She took it as a public spanking of some kind and it 
wasn't. There was nothing sexual intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to her lawsuit, Nelson also told Piper that she got a  
job at LSU only because she is black, and ``that all she had to do 
was smile pretty to get whatever she wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which names LSU and Nelson, was filed in state  
district court and seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU officials declined to comment on the lawsuit, and telephone  
messages left at Garay's home Saturday were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Mysteries and Intrigue Down Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Pete Sampras is beat up and burned  
out, too weary of body and mind to make the long trip Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Open champ Patrick Rafter wishes he were back in New York,  
or snorkeling in the Bahamas, anywhere far from the pressure of 
winning at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi is prancing again on his bandy legs, wondering if  
he can find the game he left behind four years ago at the 
Australian Open -- the last time he won a Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
	Petr Korda, the sad-eyed and skinny defending champion, is under  
siege, scorned by his colleagues after escaping harsh punishment 
for taking a banned steroid. A year ago, Korda joyfully 
scissor-kicked his way to his first major title at age 30, and 
everyone loved him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as play begins again Monday under the retractable roof of  
the National Tennis Center, his racket-wielding comrades want him 
tossed from the circuit for a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda proclaims his innocence loudly, saying he never  
``knowingly'' took the steroid nandrolone, which was found in his 
urine sample after Wimbledon last year. And he shrugs off the fact 
that he's not even seeded in the Australian Open this year after 
falling to No. 21 in the rankings. For Korda, the only words that 
matter are ``game, set, match,'' followed by his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Top seed Marcelo Rios has a bad back, or maybe a strained  
hamstring, whatever. He quit during a first-round match at a tuneup 
in Auckland, collected a fat appearance fee and skipped town 
without saying much. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he'll play at the Australian Open, where he reached the  
final a year ago but lost all his prize money at the casino. Maybe 
he'll play, maybe he won't. Rios has never been easy to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's whole Australian Open is a mystery mingled with the  
intrigue of the attempted Korda coup and the predictable 
unpredictability of the weather, which can swing from 120 degrees 
to chilly rain in a single session. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Sampras leaves no clear favorite among the men,  
even if the oddsmakers lean toward Agassi and Mark Philippoussis. 
The winner could just as well emerge from the Spanish camp, perhaps 
No. 2 seed Alex Corretja or No. 4 Carlos Moya, both of whom lost 
their most famous matches to Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	It was against Corretja that Sampras vomited on court at the  
1996 U.S. Open, yet still won after 4 hours, 9 minutes, when the 
Spaniard double-faulted on match point. And it was Moya that 
Sampras thrashed in the Australian final two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Sampras out, the way is open for any of the top  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only speculate that (Sampras) must not be feeling too  
good to give up the opportunity to win a slam,'' Agassi said. ``I 
didn't think I would see the day when he would choose rest over a 
slam, but that must speak volumes for the way he is feeling. But I 
can say from my perspective that I'm glad that he's not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women at the Australian Open are no less of a puzzle, though  
for more commendable reasons: the greatest depth and balance in WTA 
history. Not much separates No. 1 Lindsay Davenport and No. 2 
Martina Hingis, the two-time defending champ, from the rest of the 
top contenders: Venus and Serena Williams among the younger 
generation, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles among the older crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in Mary Pierce, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Jana Novotna,  
Anna Kournikova, Irina Spirlea and Dominique van Roost, and you 
have a dozen players capable of walking off with the winner's 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles has never lost in the Australian Open, taking the title in  
1991, '92 and '93 before she was stabbed, and in '96 after her 
comeback. She missed the last two years due to injuries, but might 
be ready to challenge once again. 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, including four  
Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, coming back after major knee and wrist surgery in the past  
two years, beat both Williams sisters in three-set tuneup matches 
in Sydney before falling to Davenport. Those matches and her strong 
finish in 1998 have given her the confidence that she has what it 
takes again at 29 to win another major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much beaten everybody in the last few  
tournaments,'' Graf said. ``And that gives me a good outlook for 
what's coming.''

<HEADLINE> Priests Sought in Unusual Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In Boston, the pitch is personal -- spend a weekend  
with Cardinal Bernard Law to talk about whether the priesthood is 
in your future. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milwaukee, it's advertising -- billboards offering ``the  
World's Greatest Boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in Providence, R.I., God has taken to the airwaves -- looking  
for MTV fans who might hear the calling. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a shortage of clergy, Catholic leaders across the  
country are using their influence and imaginations to persuade more 
young men to become priests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful that pop-culture forces push young men to pursue sex and  
money more than religion, Law hopes his personal time might nudge 
young men to make the difficult choice to forgo marriage and devote 
their lives to the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month he'll spend a weekend at St. John's Seminary in the  
city's Brighton section with about 30 men recommended by diocesan 
priests as potential seminary candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to have that kind of personal contact with the young  
men,'' said John Walsh, an archdiocese spokesman. ``He's very 
enthusiastic about the priesthood, and that comes through. He's a 
great advertisement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investment has paid off in the past. Of 52 men who attended  
two earlier retreats, 10 have entered the seminary and others are 
considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	While many dioceses use modern techniques like advertising,  
Catholic clergy say the old-fashioned, personal approach favored by 
Law will be the key to rejuvenating the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore diocese is doing both -- running ads and holding  
retreats, and arranging for seminarians to speak to children in the 
fifth and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Catholic Conference, the number of priests  
in the country fell from 58,132 in 1965 to 48,097 in 1996. The 
average age of ordained priests in 1996 was 58. The number of 
Catholics, meanwhile, has grown from 46.6 million to 61.2 million 
in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A USCC survey found many young men consider becoming priests,  
but very few priests encourage the ambition. In another survey, 
only 33 percent of priests said they had actively encouraged boys 
to enter seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has acknowledged it has obstacles to overcome,  
especially the damage caused by pedophile priests which has scared 
some men off, and made many priests reluctant to develop close 
relationships with youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	But those close relationships do pay off, clergy say.  
</P>
<P>
	Law is hoping his efforts will meet with the same success that  
his friend, Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell, has had in Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at  
Georgetown University showed Knoxville had the highest ratio of 
priests to Catholics -- one in 3,610 -- in the nation. The next 
highest is the diocese of Fargo, N.D., which has one priest for 
every 6,531 Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell was the first bishop in Knoxville, a new diocese that  
was carved out of the Nashville diocese in 1988. When he arrived, 
he said he'd act as his own vocations director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really bought it,'' said Ed Miller, editor of the  
diocesan newspaper. ``But he really did, and he really made a 
campaign to get young men interested in the priesthood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Cummins, 30, who was ordained in 1995, is one  
of Knoxville's newest priests. He said O'Connell's personal touch 
helped him make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met with the bishop and talked with him. He has a good way  
of helping people to discern,'' Cummins said. ``I think that's what 
is so good about Bishop O'Connell. He is able to invite people 
without pushing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said O'Connell -- who left Knoxville and was installed as  
Bishop in Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday -- had been using weekend 
retreats to recruit priests for years. But he said the key to 
O'Connell's success was that he was extremely popular with the high 
school kids in the diocese, who called him ``the Bish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With some bishops that wouldn't be dignified perhaps, but he  
loved it,'' Miller said. ``They had an annual youth Mass and they 
would pack this thing. ... When he would come in, this whole mass 
of kids would start yelling `Bish Bish Bish!'''

<HEADLINE> Lesbians Wed by Methodist Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- With tears and a kiss, two women  
exchanged promises Saturday in a ``holy union'' ceremony blessed by 
more than 90 United Methodist ministers in a dramatic mass defiance 
of a church law against same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise to love you the rest of my life,'' a tearful Ellie  
Charlton, 63, told Jeanne Barnett, 68, a retired state unemployment 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind them on the stage, the ministers lined up on risers and  
chanted a blessing that could cost them their jobs: 
</P>
<P>
	``O God, our maker, we gladly proclaim to the world that Jeanne  
and Ellie are loving partners together for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone wants to file charges against us, this is what the  
charges are for, praying this prayer,'' said the Rev. Donald Fado, 
pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist Church in suburban 
Sacramento, the organizer of the ceremony that was part church 
service and part civil rights demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our church, unfortunately, I'm allowed to come into their  
home and bless their house, bless their car, bless their tractor 
and even bless their dog, but I am not allowed to bless them,'' 
Fado said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 clergy, lay leaders, gay men, lesbians and other  
supporters filled the Sacramento Convention Center for the 
ceremony, which featured folk songs, dancing and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you can see there's a lot of love for us,'' Charlton  
said after the ceremony. ``The closet is dark and damp and 
unhealthy. I hope those of you who are in the closet can find a way 
to come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, a dozen protesters waved neon-green signs  
that read ``Brides of Satan'' and ``Methodist Fag Church'' while 
three women sang, in formal hymn style, ``God hates fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they call it, it's an abomination and a blasphemy in  
the eyes of God,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Topeka, Kan., who 
has led anti-gay pickets around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony takes place in a state where voters next year will  
decide whether only marriages between a man and a woman are legal. 
The initiative, placed on the ballot by a Republican senator who 
could not get the Legislature to pass the same measure, is expected 
to generate an expensive and emotional fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The unprecedented service dramatizes the conflict that has been  
simmering for years within the United Methodist Church, with 8.5 
million members America's second biggest Protestant body after the 
Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the church's legislature, the General Conference, took  
a stand against clergy around the country who had been quietly 
performing same-sex couple blessings. It added these words to the 
Methodists' Book of Discipline: ``Ceremonies that celebrate 
homosexual unions shall not be conducted by our ministers and shall 
not be conducted in our churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, the Rev. Jimmy Creech performed a blessing for a  
lesbian couple in his Omaha, Neb., congregation. In March, a 
Methodist tribunal decided to take no action against Creech. The 
denomination's supreme court overturned that decision in August, 
finding Creech guilty and declaring the ban to be binding law. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago conducted his 33rd  
same-sex ceremony for two men in his congregation. Dell is likely 
to face a church trial within weeks and could be defrocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days before charges were filed against Dell, Fado  
announced his desire to lead a public same-sex service as an ``act 
of ecclesiastical disobedience.'' Charlton and Barnett, two active 
members of St. Mark's, stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about sexuality. This is about the authority of  
Scripture,'' said the Rev. John Sheppard II of the First United 
Methodist Church of Yuba City. He said the ceremony violates ``more 
than 2,000 years of Christian moral tradition.''

<HEADLINE> Hyde: Presidency Could Be Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic summation, lead prosecutor Henry  
Hyde told the Senate impeachment trial today that the presidency 
could be ``permanently damaged'' if President Clinton is not 
removed from office for perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks ending the House prosecutors' opening  
arguments, Hyde said the framers of the Constitution knew the 
presidency could be ``gravely damaged if it continued to be 
unworthily occupied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If on impeachment, the president is not convicted and removed  
from office despite the fact that numerous senators are convinced 
that he has ... egregiously failed the test of his oath of office, 
violated the trust of the American people and dishonored the office 
... then the office of the presidency has been deeply, and perhaps 
permanently damaged,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked Democrats to  
meet to discuss the possibility of calling witnesses later in the 
trial, but he got a cool response from Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott suggested in a letter to Daschle that ``a bipartisan group  
of senators could anticipate and help resolve in advance any 
complications'' brought about by witness testimony. ``We should 
consider safeguards now so that testimony could begin as soon as 
fairness allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle said such a move would violate the Senate's previous  
agreement, which calls for the witness question to be settled later 
in the process. ``I agree that the prospect of witness testimony 
poses a number of troubling considerations that we would be forced 
to confront,'' Daschle wrote. ``It is my hope that such 
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who spoke briefly at the beginning of the prosecution  
case, waited while the other 12 House managers presented different 
aspects of the case over three days. Then, in his summation, the 
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said that it would harm 
the nation's standing in the world ``if a presidential perjurer 
represents our country in world affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde strongly denied that the House managers were  
``Clinton-haters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a question of who we hate, this is a question of  
what we love; and among the things we love are the rule of law, 
equal justice before the law and honor in our public life,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public galleries were full again on a chilly Saturday as the  
lawmaker-prosecutors opened their final arguments, seeking to show 
that the offenses they accuse Clinton of committing meet the 
impeachment standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Constitution, and the American people, entrust to the  
president singular responsibility for enforcing the rule of law. 
Perjury and obstruction of justice strike at the heart of the rule 
of law,'' Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., told a hushed Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``A president who has committed these crimes has plainly and  
directly violated his most important executive duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., his Southern tones echoing in the  
chamber, sought to put a human face to a case dominated by legal 
distinctions. He told senators a high crime was simply ``if a high 
person hurts a person of low means'' and that Clinton's effort to 
``fix this case'' when sued by Paula Jones met that standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the case was one of ``serious offenses colored by sex  
and there is absolutely no way to get around that. And I know it is 
uncomfortable to listen to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also cautioned senators that if they convict Clinton they  
would put a ``burden'' on the next president: ``Don't lie under 
oath when you are a defendant in a lawsuit against an average 
citizen. Have the courage to apply the law in a fair manner to 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Saturday's proceedings got under way, Clinton entered  
the Oval Office to applause from guests invited to his weekly radio 
broadcast. He exhorted Americans to observe Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day as a day of community service, and then settled down with aides 
to rehearse his upcoming State of the Union address. He told 
Democrats at a party gala late Friday night that he was 
``determined to make the most of the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., another of the prosecutors,  
reminded senators they have impeached and removed federal judges 
for perjury. ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard of 
integrity for the president than the standard it has already 
established for federal judges,'' Canady argued in prepared 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors attacked the defenses erected by the Clinton  
legal team, saying concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky from 
a court was public, not private, conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers, there is  
not a bright line separating official misconduct by a president 
from other misconduct of which the president is guilty,'' Canady 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyer said, ``I'm not offended by the 'so what' defense. If that  
is all you have then try it.'' He said presidential lawyers seemed 
to feel their only chance was to ``attack the prosecutor and 
attempt to confuse those who sit in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House is prepared to establish that the president, William  
Jefferson Clinton, willfully and repeatedly violated the rule of 
law and abused the trust placed upon him by the American people,'' 
Buyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a sharp distinction between a man trying to hide an  
extramarital affair from his wife and what Clinton is accused of 
doing in hiding his actions from the court in the Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing the proceedings into the weekend, senators were  
anxious to stay on schedule for the crucial decision on whether to 
invite the president to testify and whether to summon several of 
his close aides and associates as witnesses. House prosecutors have 
relentlessly pressed for permission to call witnesses later in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House already has said Clinton would not testify.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment with  
perjury and obstruction of justice in the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds, or 67 of the 100 senators, most vote for conviction  
to remove the president from office, and there are no indications 
that any Democrats would vote against the president. Twelve 
Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans in order to remove 
Clinton from office if the GOP stayed united.

<HEADLINE> Fox Entertainment Chief Wants More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fox's new entertainment chief wants the  
television network to be about more than cartoons and car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Herzog, who replaced Peter Roth last week as head of  
programming at Fox, indicated the network may be overdoing it with 
edgy reality shows. His top priority is to develop comedy programs 
that use real actors instead of animated characters, he said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has struck ratings gold with reality shows that depict  
animals attacking, buildings collapsing and cars crashing. Herzog 
told television critics at a news conference that the specials will 
still have a place on Fox, just not such a prominent one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to rely on the stuff long-term,'' said the  
former Comedy Central president. ``It's great for short-term gains. 
We need to look at it like that. You could probably say that we've 
been doing a little too much of that lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is also being overrun this year with prime-time animated  
characters. In addition to ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the 
Hill,'' it recently debuted ``The PJ's,'' created by Eddie Murphy. 
Two more cartoons will debut in March: ``Family Guy'' and 
``Futurama,'' the latter created by ``Simpsons'' creator Matt 
Groening. Except for ``That '70s Show'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' live 
comedies are absent from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog said cartoons are easier to make distinctive and can  
often be cheaper to produce than shows with live actors -- no small 
consideration in the financially constricted world of network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing about animated characters is they can't get  
bored or tired and run off to make a movie,'' Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are limits. Herzog, whose success at Comedy Central  
was largely due to ``South Park,'' said those foul-mouthed cartoon

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Seeks Viagra Spray Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer Inc.  
says it has filed for a patent on a nasal-spray version of its 
anti-impotence drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	The company made the announcement Friday in response to two  
University of Kentucky researchers who claimed this week to have 
developed such a fast-acting spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly not ready to speculate in terms of when we'll  
have a product out,'' said Pfizer spokeswoman Mariann Caprino. ``We 
are moving forward in terms of investigating this as a potential 
delivery system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said the spray was developed and tested in England, but  
offered no other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The two UK College of Pharmacy professors, Lewis Dittert and  
Anwar Hussain, reported this week that the spray they've developed 
drops the time it takes Viagra to take effect from over an hour to 
five to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dittert released a statement Friday in response to Pfizer's  
claim that it also has a nasal version of Viagra in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not tell us they had a patent application in this  
area,'' Dittert said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares State of Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with his political fate in jeopardy,  
President Clinton is preparing a State of the Union address that 
aides say offers an ambitious agenda geared to the challenges of 
the 21st century and the needs of aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday night, I'm going to ask the country to go back to work  
because we've still got a lot to do,'' the president told a 
Democratic party gala late Friday before settling in for a weekend 
of rehearsing the speech with aides in the White House family 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a president who is looking backward in the seventh  
year of his presidency,'' said White House communications director 
Ann Lewis. ``He is looking forward. In fact, these are ideas that 
you might see in a first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of previews of Tuesday night's speech, Clinton  
already has announced initiatives to improve military readiness, 
improve food safety, reduce violence against children and help 
Americans with long-term health care needs. He also is expected to 
call for increasing the minimum wage even though Congress ignored a 
similar call last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A big question is how Clinton will follow up on last year's call  
to ``save Social Security first.'' He used that slogan to beat down 
Republican tax-cut proposals, but has not shown his hand on what he 
wants done to ensure the solvency of the Social Security fund when 
the baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Clinton will tell Congress that ``this is the year we  
should get it done'' and shed some light on his thinking, stressing 
that any solution has to have bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's strong economy gives him strong footing for his  
speech. Clinton will boast of a record budget surplus, the lowest 
unemployment in nearly 30 years, the highest home ownership rate in 
history and the creation of nearly 18 million new jobs during his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will make his nationally televised address at 9 p.m. EDT  
Tuesday from the House chamber, where a month earlier lawmakers 
voted mostly on party lines to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech comes on the same day as the opening of the White  
House defense in his Senate impeachment trial, a coincidence that 
even some Democrats say creates an awkwardness warranting 
postponement of the address. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Saturday that the State of the  
Union is an opportunity for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president can help himself by delivering a strong State of  
the Union speech and acting presidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president can help himself by delivering a strong State of  
the Union speech and acting presidential,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides, however, see the speech as an opportunity to  
stand before an audience of tens of millions of Americans and 
demonstrate that he is focusing on their needs, regardless of his 
own political peril. The appearance is likely to provide a boost in 
the polls even for a president who enjoys extraordinarily high 
approval ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about doing the peoples' business,'' Lewis said,  
insisting that the impeachment drama has not changed the planning 
for Clinton's speech. The president has indicated he will not 
mention his political troubles; last year he did not mention the 
Monica Lewinsky affair even though it dominated the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The partisan repercussions from the impeachment fight are likely  
to sour the mood for many major achievements in Congress. Moreover, 
the Republican-led Congress is not inclined to jump on the 
Democrats' bandwagon as both parties jockey for position for the 
presidential race in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has successfully used the State of the Union speech to  
frame the policy agenda for Congress. His Social Security theme put 
the brakes on GOP tax cuts even as the president achieved some of 
his own prized goals, such as winning a down payment on money to 
hire 100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Clinton will renew his call to restrict teen smoking,  
calling for a new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax. He'll also propose 
$600 million to build on his initiative to put 100,000 police on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will renew his proposals for school construction  
spending and to allow Americans as young as 55 years old buy in to 
Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Jewel Thief on Run Dies As Pauper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A convicted jewel thief who lived the high life for  
years while on the run from police died as a pauper. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Henry Cook was believed responsible for at least $17  
million in jewelry heists. At various times, he sported a 28-carat 
diamond, drove Cadillacs and lived in an elegant villa in the 1960s 
and 1970s, even though he had no visible means of support. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities relied on fingerprints to determine that he was the  
emaciated 73-year-old man who checked into a $49-a-night motel in 
Pompano Beach in Nov. 15 under a false name and died a few days 
later, the FBI said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He died of heart and renal failure, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cook was dubbed a ``a master criminal'' by Miami detectives  
after a $1.7 million robbery of a Pompano Beach jeweler in 1963. He 
was given life in prison, but the sentence was overturned on a 
technicality and he was not retried. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been on the run since 1989, when he was indicted in  
connection with a $2 million burglary of a Port Arthur, Texas, 
jewelry store four years earlier. The loot was never recovered, 
said FBI spokesman Mike Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook's group was accused of taking $14 million in merchandise in  
two years from eight jewelry store burglaries across the South, 
including Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Cook was featured on the TV show America's Most Wanted  
as a thief who stayed in the best hotels and always one step ahead 
of police. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Cook's gangs typically cut neatly through  
ceilings and walls, bypassed sophisticated alarm systems, and used 
acetylene torches to slice into safes. Often they resealed the 
building so the crime would not immediately be discovered.

<HEADLINE> Rey-Bellet Wins Downhill, Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANTON, Austria (AP) -- Corinne Rey-Bellet of Switzerland, who  
had never before won a race, made World Cup history Saturday by 
winning two on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	By capturing a downhill and a super-giant slalom within four  
hours, Rey-Bellet became the first skier in World Cup history to 
win two different events in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I did today was just great,'' Rey-Bellet said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The piste was perfect. I was dreaming of a World Cup victory,  
but I never thought I would win two in one day,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski officials first said that Rey-Bellet had equaled the feat  
achieved by Erika Hess of Switzerland at Alpe d'Huez, France, in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	After checking their records again, however, they discovered  
that Hess had indeed won a slalom and the first heat of a giant 
slalom on the same day. But the second heat of the giant slalom was 
run the next day, meaning Rey-Bellet was indeed the first to 
accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey-Bellet stormed down the icy, bumpy Kandahar course in one  
minute, 28.01 seconds to win the downhill, then mastered the same, 
but shortened course in the Super-G race, clocking 1:23.18. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria had a  
frustrating day, finishing sixth in the downhill and second in the 
Super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Meissnitzer padded her World Cup overall lead and now has  
1,100 points. Hilde Gerg of Germany, third in the downhill and 12th 
in the Super-G, remained second with 782. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister of Austria finished second in the downhill,  
covering the 2,377-meters in 1:28.20 
</P>
<P>
	She capped a fine showing by finishing third in the Super-G,  
clocking 1:23.59 on the 2,127-meter course that had become softer 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey-Bellet missed the entire 1997 World Cup season after tearing  
knee ligaments. She then hired a psychologist to help her regain 
self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a super run. It's a great feeling to finally win a World  
Cup race. That's what I trained for all these years,'' Rey-Bellet 
said after her downhill victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey-Bellet's previous best was a third place in a giant slalom  
in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was fourth in the last downhill in Veysonnaz,  
Switzerland, last month, and clocked the fastest times in both 
training runs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around for quite some time and I've been gathering  
experience'' the Swiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The training times gave me confidence for the race,'' she  
said. ``I felt good yesterday, I felt I was steady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was harder today but I skied better than yesterday.  
I skied the bottom part perfectly,'' said Rey-Bellet, who gave 
Switzerland its first downhill victory in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally scheduled for Friday, the downhill had to be moved to  
Saturday after a heavy snowfall.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Extends Downhill Standings Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Norwegian Lasse Kjus strengthened his  
lead in the World Cup downhill standings by capturing his third 
victory of season in the discipline Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who missed the last World Cup meet because of recurring  
bronchitis, covered the circuit's longest and most demanding 
Lauberhorn course in 2 minutes, 25.10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished the 2.7 miles more than half a second ahead of  
Olympic bronze medallist Hannes Trinkl, whose second-place finish 
started a run of five consecutive Austrian skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinkl had his best showing in five years, clocking 2:25.66,  
just .01 ahead of teammate Hans Knauss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone has to stop the Austrians,'' joked Kjus, the 1996  
overall World Cup champion. ``But seriously, I am just happy I won 
even though I was not 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who won the season-opening downhill in Val d'Isere,  
France, also placed first and second in a double downhill in Val 
Gardena, Italy, just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus' bronchitis prevented him from racing the last downhill in  
Bormio, Italy, won by Hermann Maier. Kjus was also forced to miss a 
giant slalom in Adelboden, Switzerland, earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus leads the downhill with 380 points, 110 ahead of Maier, the  
reigning World Cup overall, super-G and giant slalom champion, who 
has made the downhill title a goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a hungry man,'' Kjus said of Maier. ``He wants to win  
everything but I will make it tough on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his fourth-place finish Saturday earned him another 40  
points, Maier was was unhappy with his time of 2:25.75. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' said Maier, the winner of a shortened  
downhill moved to Wengen from Veysonnaz last year. ``If one of the 
coaches could have told me how far behind I was a third of the way 
down, I would have given up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Austrian added to his lead atop the overall  
standings where he has 961 points, 242 ahead of his nearest 
challenger Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, who finished seventh on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Killing Quads' Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A Texan accused of being the middle man in  
a deadly custody battle has been convicted of murdering a woman who 
had moved to Florida to start a new life with her six children. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors found Daniel Rocha, 29, guilty Friday of first-degree  
murder and a lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the 
third degree for the November 1997 killing of Sheila Bellush, who 
was shot and stabbed with her young quadruplets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Just prior to her death, Mrs. Bellush, 35, had moved from Texas  
to Florida with the quadruplets and two teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tragic for everybody involved. But the real tragedy is  
six kids that don't have a mother anymore,'' said the victim's 
widower, Jamie Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed that Mrs. Bellush's wealthy ex-husband,  
Allen Blackthorne, told Rocha that she was abusing their two 
teen-age daughters and that he wanted to regain custody of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Sarasota State Attorney Charlie Roberts depicted Rocha  
as the driving force behind a plot to kill Mrs. Bellush. Rocha made 
arrangements to hire someone to harm Mrs. Bellush as a favor to 
Blackthorne, his golfing pal, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense lawyer Jack McGill said Rocha intended only for Mrs.  
Bellush to be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bellush ``was not to be killed .... There was never any  
intent of that,'' McGill told jurors. ``That was the act of a 
madman, the act of someone who had gone berserk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Rocha's, Samuel Gonzales, testified he recruited his  
cousin Jose Luis Del Toro, who borrowed a .45-caliber handgun and 
drove from Texas to Florida. He then allegedly contacted Gonzales, 
saying he had broken in to Mrs. Bellush's home and killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and  
struck a deal for his testimony in return for a 19-year prison 
term. Del Toro is jailed in Mexico and is fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackthorne has not been charged and has denied any involvement  
in a plot to kill Mrs. Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bitter divorce, Mrs. Bellush was granted custody of  
their two daughters, and the girls were adopted by her second 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughter Stevie Bellush, 14, testified at the trial that her  
mother was ``loving and understanding'' and never abused her or her 
13-year-old sister. It was Stevie who found her mother's body, with 
the quadruplets, unharmed but covered in blood.

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Wins 60-Meter Dash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ja'Warren Hooker, make way for Patrick Jarrett.  
</P>
<P>
	Hooker, the 1998 NCAA indoor 55-meter champion and the  
third-place finisher in the 100 meters at the NCAA outdoor 
championships, was upset by the unheralded Jarrett in the 60-meter 
dash Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning victory by the 25-year-old New York Tech runner  
over the Washington sophomore came at the inaugural New York Sports 
Museum Collegiate Invitational at the Armory Track and Field 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, the New York state 100 and 200 champion in 1990 and  
1991, first beat the injured Hooker in the trial heats in 6.77 
seconds to 6.89, then came back 30 minutes later and won the final 
in 6.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooker, competing with his left foot heavily taped because of  
shin splints, finished second in 6.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was surprised that he beat a sprinter considered one of  
the best in the collegiate ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know who he was until they announced him before the  
heats,'' said Jarrett, a member of New York Tech's winning 
400-meter relay team at last year's NCAA Division II Championships 
and a member of the Jamaican 400 relay team that finished fourth at 
last summer's Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might have been a problem if I knew who he was.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hooker was the one with the problem Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not blaming injury,'' he said, before heading toward the  
first aid room for treatment. ``I didn't run a great race. I'll be 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently injured the shin while overtraining in Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	While Hooker was not at his best, Jarrett was superb, especially  
for someone who claims he ``hates indoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took the lead from the outset and held off the hard-charging  
but laboring Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big accomplishment for me,'' Jarrett said. ``There  
was no pressure thinking about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so confident in my training now. If I run my race, I'm  
going to compete with the best. And if I run my race, I'm going to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jarrett's performance was the scene stealer, there were  
some other outstanding efforts in the 10-team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Villanova's Carmen Douma, the NCAA indoor mile champion and the  
NCAA outdoor 1,500-meter champion, ran away from the field in the 
women's field, winning by about 50 meters in 4:51.69. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dominique Calloway, an NCAA finalist in last year's outdoor  
championships, led a 1-2 Ohio State finish in the women's 60-meter 
hurdles. Calloway was timed in 8.34, making her a provisional 
qualifier for this year's NCAA indoor championships. Donika 
Merriman was second at 8.40.

<HEADLINE> One of Octuplets Fights Infection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- One of the seven surviving Houston octuplets has  
developed an infection, and one of his sisters was tested Saturday 
for the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ikem Louis and his sister Gorom have stopped breast milk  
feedings and are on antibiotic treatment, said Dr. Carol Lynn 
Berseth. Tests on Friday indicated that Ikem had developed an 
infection. His sister Gorom was evaluated Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are among eight babies born last month to Nkem Chukwu  
and husband Iyke Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other babies are all progressing on their feedings and  
doing well,'' said Dr. Berseth, the attending neonatologist at 
Texas Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The other five siblings continue to receive breast milk and  
remain in critical but stable condition, Dr. Berseth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chukwu, a native of Nigeria, delivered her first baby,  
Ebuka, on Dec. 8. Two weeks later, on Dec. 20, she delivered seven 
more children, led by Chidi. Odera, a girl who weighed 10.3 ounces 
at birth, died a week after birth.

<HEADLINE> Text of Henry Hyde's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of closing remarks by House manager Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., to the Senate during the impeachment trial of President 
Clinton, as transcribed by Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the president, distinguished  
members of the Senate, 139 years ago -- 136 years ago at a small 
military cemetery in Pennsylvania, one of Illinois' most 
illustrious sons asked a haunting question: Whether a nation 
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal can long endure. 
</P>
<P>
	America is an experiment never finished. It's a work in  
progress. And so that question has to be answered by each 
generation for itself just as we will have to answer whether this 
nation can long endure. 
</P>
<P>
	This controversy began with the fact that the president of the  
United States took an oath to tell the truth in his testimony 
before the grand jury, just as he had on two prior occasions, sworn 
a solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and 
to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most memorable aspects of this entire proceeding was  
the solemn occasion wherein every senator in this chamber took an 
oath to do impartial justice under the Constitution. But I must 
say, despite massive and relentless efforts to change the subject, 
the case before you, Senators, is not about sexual misconduct, 
infidelity, adultery. Those are private acts and are none of our 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not even a question of lying about sex. The matter before  
this body is a question of lying under oath. This is a public act. 
The matter before you is a question of the willful, premeditated, 
deliberate corruption of the nation's system of justice through 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	These are public acts. And when committed by the chief law  
enforcement officer of the land, the one who appoints every United 
States district attorney, every federal judge, every member for the 
Supreme Court, the attorney general, they do become the concern of 
Congress. And that's why your judgment, respectfully, should rise 
above politics, above partisanship, above polling data. 
</P>
<P>
	This case is a test of whether what the founding fathers  
described as ``sacred honor'' still has meaning in our time 222 
years after those two words, ``sacred honor,'' were inscribed in 
our country's birth certificate, our national charter of freedom, 
our Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Every school child in the United States has an intuitive sense  
of the sacred honor that is one of the foundation stones of the 
American house of freedom, for every day in every classroom in 
America, our children and grandchildren pledge allegiance to a 
nation under God. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement is not a prideful or arrogant claim. It's a  
statement of humility. All of us as individuals stand under the 
judgment of God or the transcendent truths by which we hope finally 
to be judged. So does our country. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidency is an office of trust. Every public office is a  
public trust, but the Office of the President, is a very special 
public trust. The president is the trustee of the national 
conscience. No one owns the office of the president -- the people 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is elected by the people and their representatives  
in the electoral college. And accepting the burdens of that great 
office, the president in his inaugural oath enters to a covenant, a 
binding agreement of mutual trust and obligation with the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after his election and during his first few months in  
office, President Clinton spoke with some frequency about a new 
covenant in America. In this instance, let's take the president at 
his word that his office is a covenant, a solemn pact of mutual 
trust and obligation with the American people. Let's take the 
president seriously when he speaks of covenants, because a covenant 
is about promise making and promise keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	For it's because the president has defaulted on the promises he  
made, it's because he has violated the oaths he has sworn, that he 
has been impeached. The debate about impeachment during the 
constitutional convention of 1787 makes it clear that the framers 
regarded impeachment and removal from office on conviction as a 
remedy for a fundamental betrayal of trust by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The framers had invested the presidential office with great  
powers. They knew that those powers could be and would be abused if 
any president were to violate in a fundamental way the oath he had 
sworn to faithfully execute the nation's laws. 
</P>
<P>
	For if the president did so violate his oath of office, the  
covenant of trust between himself and the American people would be 
broken. Today, we see something else that the fundamental trust 
between America and the world can be broken if a presidential 
perjurer represents our country in world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	If the president calculatedly and repeatedly violates his oath,  
if the president breaks the covenant of trust he's made with the 
American people, he can no longer be trusted. And because the 
executive plays so large a role in representing our country to the 
world, American can no longer be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	It's often said we live in an age of increasing interdependence.  
If that's true -- and the evidence for it is all around us, then the 
future will require an even stronger bond of trust between the 
president and the nation, because with increasing interdependence, 
comes an increased necessity of trust. 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the basic lessons of life. Parents and children  
know it; husbands and wives know it; teachers and students know it; 
as do doctors, patients, suppliers, customers, lawyers, clients, 
clergy and parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater the interdependence, the greater the necessity of  
trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater the interdependence, the greater the imperative of  
promise-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust, not what James Madison called the parchment barriers of  
laws, is the fundamental bond between the people and their elected 
representatives; between those who govern and those who are 
governed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust is the mortar that secures the foundations of the American  
house of freedom. And the Senate of the United States, sitting in 
judgment on this impeachment trial should not ignore or minimize or 
dismiss the fact that that bond of trust has been broken, because 
the president has violated both his oaths of office and the oath he 
took before his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, it's often been asked: so what? What is the  
harm done by this lying under oath, by this perjury? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, what is an oath? An oath is an asking almighty God to  
witness to the truth of what you're saying. Truth telling, truth 
telling, is the heart and soul of our justice system. I think the 
answer would have been clear to those who once pledged their sacred 
honor to the cause of liberty. The answer would have been clear to 
those who crafted the world's most enduring written constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	No greater harm can come -- can come than breaking the covenant  
of trust between the president and the people, between the three 
branches of our government, and between our country and the world, 
for to break that covenant of trust is to dissolve the mortar that 
binds the foundation stones of our freedom into a secure and solid 
edifice. And to break the covenant of trust by violating one's oath 
is to do grave damage to the rule of law among us. 
</P>
<P>
	That none of us is above the law is a bedrock principle of  
democracy. To erode that bedrock is to risk even further injustice. 
To erode that bedrock is to subscribe to a divine right of kings 
theory of governance in which those who govern are absolved from 
adhering to the basic moral standards to which the governed are 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	We must never tolerate one law for the ruler and another for the  
ruled. If we do, we break faith with our ancestors from Bunker 
Hill, Lexington, Concord to Flanders Fields, Normandy, Hiroshima, 
Panmunjom, Saigon and Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's be clear -- the vote you are asked to cast is in the final  
analysis a vote about the rule of law. The rule of law is one of 
the great achievements of our civilization for the alternative to 
the rule of law is the rule is the rule of raw power. 
</P>
<P>
	We here today are the heirs of 3000 years of history in which  
humanity slowly and painfully, and at great cost, evolved a form of 
politics in which law not brute force, is the arbiter of our public 
destinies. 
</P>
<P>
	We're the heirs of the ten commandments and the mosaic law,  
moral code for a free people, who having been liberated from 
bondage, saw in law a means to avoid falling back into the habits 
of slaves. We're the heirs of Roman law, the first legal system 
which peoples of different cultures, languages, races and religions 
came to live together to form a political community. 
</P>
<P>
	We're the heirs of the Magna Carta, by which the free men of  
England began to break the arbitrary and unchecked power of royal 
absolutism. We're the heirs of a long tradition of parliamentary 
development in which the rule of law gradually came to replace 
royal prerogative as the means for governing a society of free men 
and free women. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, we're the heirs of 1776 and of an epic moment in human  
affairs when the founders of this republic pledged their lives, 
their fortunes and yes, their sacred honor to the defense of the 
rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we're the heirs of a tragic civil war which vindicated the  
rule of law over the appetites of some for owning others. We're the 
heirs of the 20th century's great struggles against totalitarianism 
in which the rule of law was defended at immense cost against the 
worst tyrannies in human history. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule of law is no pious aspiration from a civics textbook.  
The rule of law is what stands between us and the arbitrary 
exercise of power by the state. The rule of law is the safeguard of 
our liberties. The rule of law is what allows us to live our 
freedom in ways that honor the freedom of others while 
strengthening the common good. 
</P>
<P>
	Lying under oath is an abuse of freedom. Obstruction of justice  
is a degradation of law. There are people in prison for such 
offenses. What in the world do we say to them about equal justice 
if we overlook this conduct by the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Some may say, as many have in recent months, that this is to  
pitch the matter too high. The president's lie, it is said, was 
about a trivial matter; it was a lie to spare embarrassment about 
misconduct on a private occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The confusing of what is essentially a private matter and none  
of our business with lying under oath to a court and a grand jury 
has been only one of the distractions we've had to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, as men and women with a serious experience of public  
affairs, we can all imagine a situation in which a president might 
shade the truth when a great issue of national interest or national 
security is at stake. We've been all over that terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	We know the thin ice on which any of us skates when blurring the  
edges of the truth for what we consider a compelling, demanding 
public purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Morally serious men and women can imagine the circumstances at  
the far edge of the morally permissible when, with the gravest 
matters of national interest at stake, a president could shade the 
truth in order to serve the common good. 
</P>
<P>
	But under oath for a private pleasure?  
</P>
<P>
	In doing this, the office of the president of the United States  
has been debased and the justice system jeopardized. In doing this, 
he's broken his covenant of trust with the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	The framers also knew that the office of the president could be  
gravely damaged if it continued to be unworthily occupied. That's 
why they devised the process of impeachment by the House and trial 
by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It is in truth a direct process. If on impeachment the president  
is convicted, he's removed from office and the office itself 
suffers no permanent damage. If on impeachment the president is 
acquitted, the issue is resolved once and for all and the office is 
similarly protected from permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But, if on impeachment the president is not convicted and  
removed from office despite the fact that numerous senators are 
convinced that he has, in the words of one proposed resolution of 
censure, ``egregiously failed the test of his oath of office, 
violated the trust of the American people, and dishonored the 
office by which they entrusted to him,'' then the office of the 
presidency has been deeply and perhaps permanently damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	And that is a further reason why president Clinton must be  
convicted of the charges brought before you by the House and 
removed from office. To fail to do so, while conceding that the 
president has engaged in egregious and dishonorable behavior, that 
has broken the covenant of trust between himself and the American 
people, is to diminish the office of president of the United States 
in an unprecedented and unacceptable way. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Senators, permit me a word on my own behalf and on behalf  
of my colleagues in the House. I want to clarify an important 
point. None of us comes to this chamber today without a profound 
sense of our own responsibilities in life and of the many ways in 
which we have failed to meet those responsibilities to one degree 
or another. None of us comes to you claiming to be a perfect man or 
a perfect citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as none of you imagines yourself perfect, all of us,  
members of the House and Senate, know we come to this difficult 
task as flawed human beings under judgment. That is the way of this 
world -- flawed human beings must, according to the rule of law, 
judge other flawed human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue before the Senate of the United States is not the  
question of its own members' personal moral condition, nor is the 
issue before the Senate the question of the personal moral 
condition of the members of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue here is whether the president has violated the rule of  
law and thereby broken the covenant of trust with the American 
people. This is a public issue involving the gravest matter of 
public interest. And it's not affected one way or another by the 
personal moral condition of any member of either House of Congress 
or by whatever expressions of personal chagrin the president has 
managed to express. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, we of the House don't come before you today lightly,  
and if you will permit me it is a disservice to the House to 
suggest that it has brought these articles of impeachment before 
you in a mean spirited or irresponsible way. That is not true. 
</P>
<P>
	We have brought these articles of impeachment because we're  
convinced in conscience that the President of the United States 
lied under oath, that the president committee perjury on several 
occasions before a federal grand jury. We have brought this 
articles of impeachment because we are convinced in conscience that 
the president willfully obstructed justice and thereby threatened 
the legal system he sworn a solemn oath to protect and defend. 
</P>
<P>
	These are not trivial matters. These are not partisan matters.  
These are matters of justice, the justice that each of you has 
taken a solemn oath to serve in this trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of us have been called Clinton-haters. I must tell you  
distinguished Senators, that this impeachment trial is not for 
those of us from the House, a question of hating anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a question of who we hate, it's a question of what  
we love. 
</P>
<P>
	And among the things we love are the rule of law, equal justice  
before the law and honor in our public life. All of us are trying 
as hard as we can to do our duty as we see it; no more and no less. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, the trial is being watched around the world. Some of  
those watching, thinking themselves superior in their cynicism, 
wonder what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
	But others know, political prisoners know, that this is about  
the rule of law, the great alternative to arbitrary and unchecked 
state powers. The families of executed dissidents know that this is 
about the rule of law, the great alternative to the lethal abuse of 
power by the state. Those yearning for freedom know this about the 
rule of law -- the hard, one structure by which men and women can 
live by their God-given dignity and secure their God-give rights in 
ways that serve the common good. 
</P>
<P>
	If they know this, can we not know it?  
</P>
<P>
	If across the river in Arlington Cemetery there are American  
heroes who died in defense of the rule of law, can we give less 
than the full measure of our devotion to that great cause? 
</P>
<P>
	I wish to read you a letter I recently received that expresses  
my feelings far better than my poor words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Chairman Hyde, my name is William Preston Summers. How  
are you doing? I am a third grader in room 504 at Chase Elementary 
School in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm writing this letter because I have something to tell you.  
I have thought of a punishment for the president of the United 
States of America. The punishment should be that he should write a 
100-word essay by hand. I have to write an essay when I lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad to lie because it just gets you in more trouble. I  
hate getting in trouble. It's just like the boy who cried 'wolf' 
and the wolf ate the boy. It is important to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to tell the truth because it gets you in less trouble.  
If you do not tell the truth, people do not believe you. It is 
important to believe the president because he is a important 
person. If you cannot believe the president, who can you believe? 
If you have no one to believe in, then how do you run your life? 
</P>
<P>
	I do not believe the president tells the truth any more right  
now. After he writes the essay and tells the truth, I will believe 
him again. (signed) William Summers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's a P.S. from his dad: ``Dear Representative Hyde, I  
made my son William either write you a letter or an essay as a 
punishment for lying. Part of his defense for his lying was that 
the president lied. He's still having difficulty understanding why 
the president can lie and not be punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, on June the 6th, 1994, it was  
the 50th anniversary of the American landing at Normandy, and I 
went ashore at Normandy and walked up to the cemetery area where, 
as far as the eye could see, there were white crosses, Stars of 
David. And the British had a bagpipe band scattered among the 
crucifixes, the crosses, playing Amazing Grace with that pierceful, 
mournful sound that only the bagpipe can make. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you could keep your eyes dry you were better than I. But  
I walked up to one of these crosses marking a grave because I 
wanted to personalize the experience. I was looking for a name. But 
there was no name. It said, ``Here lies in honored glory a comrade 
in arms known but to God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How do we keep faith with that comrade in arms? Well, go to the  
Vietnam memorial and the national mall and press your hands against 
the 58,000, a few of the 58,000 names carved into that wall and ask 
yourself how we can redeem the debt we owe all those who purchased 
our freedom with their lives. How do we keep faith with them? 
</P>
<P>
	I think I know. We work to make this country the kind of America  
they were willing to die for. That's an America where the idea of 
sacred honor still has the power to stir men's souls. 
</P>
<P>
	My solitary, solitary hope is that 100 years from today people  
will look back at what we've done and say, ``they kept the faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I'm done.

<HEADLINE> Hyde: Presidency Could Be Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a final flourish, House prosecutors  
demanded President Clinton's removal from office Saturday, telling 
a hushed audience of senators that otherwise the presidency itself 
may be ``deeply and perhaps permanently damaged.'' Senate leaders 
sparred over the issue of witnesses at the historic impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morally serious men and women can imagine circumstances at the  
far edge of the morally permissible'' in which a president could 
shade the truth for the good of the nation, said white-haired Rep. 
Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor summing up three days of opening 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``But under oath, for a private pleasure?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a question that cut to the core of the case, allegations  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in an attempt 
to conceal his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Hyde concluded the prosecution's presentation,  
Clinton attorney Gregory Craig said the president's legal team 
would be ready with a ``strong vigorous defense, based on the 
facts, the law and the Constitution'' when the trial resumes on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate officials estimate that 1,500 people have stood in line  
each day to witness a few minutes of the drama. The trial, with 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, is the first such 
presidential impeachment proceeding since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde addressed the trial and a nationwide television audience as  
Clinton labored over a speech of a different variety -- the State of 
the Union address he will deliver next Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the three-day presentation by the House Republicans,  
there was little, if any, evidence that Clinton's Democratic 
support had eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the current record, they (House prosecutors) are not  
going to win this trial,'' said Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli 
of New Jersey. ``They need somebody to come before the Senate and 
give unexpected testimony or to commit a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one Republican, Vermont Sen. James Jeffords, sounded  
skeptical of the case. ``If you say lying about a non-crime (an 
affair) can be converted into a high crime by the way you handle 
it, that sets a pretty low standard for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds votes to convict a president and remove  
him from office. Republicans hold a 55-45 majority, so even if all 
GOP senators vote against Clinton, a dozen Democratic votes would 
be required to strip the nation's 42nd president of his powerful 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the House wrapped up its case, the Senate's  
Democratic and Republican leaders were maneuvering for advantage on 
the witness issue, which threatened an outbreak of partisan 
hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott released a letter he had dispatched  
to the Democratic leader on Friday night, suggesting creation of a 
bipartisan group of senators that could ``save us time and trouble 
in the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott added that he knew the White House had been in contact with  
the Democrats, and he added it would be proper if he joined in any 
future conversations with the president's team. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle declined the  
invitation for a bipartisan group. ``It is my hope that such 
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican favor granting the House's request to call  
witnesses; many -- but not all -- Democrats oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	That issue won't be settled for at least another week, although  
many Republicans and Democrats say they expect the GOP to insist, 
at a minimum, on depositions of such possible witnesses as Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	It fell to Hyde, known in the House for his flashes of  
eloquence, to close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us have been called Clinton haters,'' he said. ``This  
is not a question of who we hate, this is a question of what we 
love ... the rule of law, equal justice before the law and honor in 
our public life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican noted proposed resolutions of censure  
that would sharply criticize Clinton for violating the people's 
trust. And he said if senators believed such allegations and yet 
voted to acquit the chief executive, ``the office of the presidency 
has been deeply, and perhaps permanently, damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By his actions, Hyde said, Clinton had ``broken his covenant of  
trust with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must never tolerate one law for the ruler and another for  
the ruled, he said. ``If we do, we break faith with our ancestors 
from Bunker Hill, Lexington and Concord to ... Desert Storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans were scathing, folksy and serious by turn as  
they wrapped up their case. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., derided Clinton for mounting a  
``so-what'' defense against the charges. ``The facts are stubborn. 
President Clinton lied, under oath. President Clinton committed 
perjury, repeatedly, willfully, premeditatedly. President Clinton 
obstructed justice, by tampering with evidence and witnesses,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unlike most House  
prosecutors, paced the area behind the podium, speaking in a soft 
Southern drawl. ``I'll try to get you out so we can all have some 
lunch,'' he said in one momentary aside. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Charles Canady of Florida said the Senate should not  
allow a president who has ``made himself a notorious example of 
lawlessness to remain in office.''

<HEADLINE> Countries Seek Stable Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Finance ministers from leading  
European and Asian economies Saturday agreed on tighter cooperation 
to stabilize exchange rates and avoid the sort of market chaos that 
is rocking Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 ministers wrapped up two days of talks with calls for  
action to prevent exchange rate jolts, but they said they were 
waiting for further talks with the United States before tackling 
any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone agrees we need to take steps to avoid swings in  
exchange rates,'' said German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, 
who chaired the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine said the crisis in Brazil and earlier tumult in Asian  
and Russian markets showed that ``leaving everything wide open 
gives rise to difficulties. ... It's our duty to get to grips with 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same topics -- Brazil and action on currency -- were expected  
to dominate the agenda later Saturday in Frankfurt when deputy 
finance ministers from the G-7 group of world economic powers meet, 
including U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Europe-Asia meeting, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa said concrete proposals would need to be worked out later 
in talks involving the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers shied away from controversial proposals from Germany  
and Japan that would coordinate buying and selling by central banks 
to keep currencies within fixed bands or target values and thereby 
soften exchange rate shocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi said it was too early to  
talk about such plans, while Lafontaine said target rates for 
leading world currencies could only come when the U.S., European 
and Japanese economies were on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first step is for economies to converge. Economic policy  
decisions need to be coordinated,'' Lafontaine told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned there was a ``need to scale down growth expectations  
worldwide'' following the turbulence in Latin America, Asia and 
Russia. But European and Asian officials sought to downplay the 
potential impact of Brazil's woes on their markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International  
Monetary Fund, was prevented from attending by snow in Washington, 
but in a written statement, he predicted Asia's ``recovery will be 
underway by the end of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European Union Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said  
``growth in Europe will be more robust than in other parts of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa floated the idea of anchoring Asian currencies to a  
basket comprising the Japanese yen, U.S. dollar and the new 
European currency, the euro, rather than leaving them pegged to the 
dollar. He said the launch of the euro as the common currency of 11 
EU nations on Jan. 1 was a good opportunity to look afresh at the 
world financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating on the ``flexible stability'' concept put forward by  
Lafontaine, officials said it would involve closer monitoring of 
capital movements and greater coordinated intervention by central 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers agreed a closer eye needed to be kept on speculators,  
whose sudden movements of huge amounts of foreign currencies have 
been blamed for undermining markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start with (controlling) short-term flows of  
capital, speculation,'' Lafontaine said. ``Surveillance should be 
stepped up, that was universally agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown called for  
the creation of a global financial watchdog to closely monitor 
potential crisis spots and become ``the world's early warning 
system for regional and global economic risk.''

<HEADLINE> NATO To Hold Emergency Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO will hold an emergency session Sunday in  
Brussels to consider a response to the execution-style massacre of 
dozens of people in southern Kosovo, the State Department spokesman 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proposed the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the ambassadors to the 16  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries would convene at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels ``in light of this outrageous situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin pointed out that NATO in October developed contingency  
plans for dealing with Kosovo, the Serbian province where ethnic 
Albanian separatists have been fighting with Serb police and 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no doubt of NATO's resolve,'' Rubin said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO's contingency plans involve the possible bombing of Serb  
installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the U.S. official said a U.S.-brokered cease-fire in  
Kosovo was shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton condemned the atrocity ``in the strongest  
possible terms'' and called the atrocity ``a clear violation'' of 
the Serbs' ceasefire agreement with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a deliberate and indiscriminate act of murder  
designed to sow fear among the people of Kosovo,'' Clinton said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	National security advisers conferred on Saturday at the White  
House, and Rubin said Albright spoke by telephone with several NATO 
counterparts, including foreign ministers in Great Britain, France, 
Germany and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright discussed strategy for a NATO meeting she hoped could  
be scheduled Sunday or Monday, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said discussions  
with U.S. allies would occur ``on a number of different levels to 
address this and move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of bodies were scattered around the village of Racak on  
Saturday, a day after a fierce attack by Serb forces on ethnic 
Albanian villages. The death toll, which included elderly men, 
apparently is the highest in a single attack since the Oct. 12 
cease-fire agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Racak village said Serb forces rounded up the  
victims, drove them up a hill and shot them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been problems and violations of the agreement for  
many weeks now, and clearly it is shaky,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not as bad as it was last fall, but it's heading rapidly  
in 
</P>
<P>
	hat direction,'' Rubin said. ``If there are reprisals or a  
spiral of escalation as a result of this atrocity, we could be 
there very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a harshly worded statement Saturday, Clinton, who was briefed  
by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, said Serb authorities 
must immediately identify the perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a clear violation of the commitments Serbian authorities  
have made to NATO. There can be no justification for it,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs also ``must withdraw security forces, carry out all  
the commitments they have made to NATO and cease their 
repression,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> 'Nanny' Dismissed From Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fran Drescher was dismissed from a lawsuit by  
a stunt woman who claims she was injured during filming of 
``Beautician and the Beast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Drescher, who was executive producer as well as star of the  
movie, was dismissed Friday along with two producers and a writer, 
said her attorney, Donald Etra. A director and a producer are still 
named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Doest, 46, claimed she was sprayed with a harmful fire  
retardant in July 1996 while preparing for a scene. She is seeking 
unspecified damages for asthma, exhaustion and other problems, 
according to her Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe (Ms. Doest) was injured. Second, any  
purported claim she has must be brought by way of a workers' 
compensation action, and not a civil suit,'' Etra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drescher is also a star of the TV series ``The Nanny.''

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea Involves Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Robert William Greer Jr. was willing to  
plead guilty to murder for strangling a man -- but only if he could 
watch the Super Bowl before heading to a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors agreed, and District Judge Bob Gill sentenced Greer  
to 18 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in about five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer, 52, was arrested in Las Vegas in April after 10 years on  
the run. He pleaded guilty for the slaying of 73-year-old John 
Dobbs in suburban Fort Worth in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer asked that he not be imprisoned until Feb. 1, so he could  
watch the Super Bowl at the Tarrant County jail. Greer told his 
attorneys that the Jan. 31 game would be the best ever if the 
Minnesota Vikings play in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday for the chance to  
advance to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer would not necessarily be prohibited from watching the game  
in prison, but he apparently thought his chances were better in the 
county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill told Greer that he has no control over when inmates are  
transferred to prison, but that he would make a recommendation to 
the sheriff's department.

<TEXT>
<P>
	--House prosecutors wrapped up their three-day opening  
presentation with Rep. Henry Hyde telling senators the presidency 
could be ``permanently damaged'' if President Clinton is not 
convicted and removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked Democrats for a meeting  
to discuss ``safeguards'' and to ``resolve in advance any 
complications'' in case witnesses are called at the trial. Senate 
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle rejected the request, saying ``it is 
my hope that such arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The president delivered a radio address from the Oval Office  
calling on Americans to engage in community service in honor Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. He then settled down with aides to rehearse 
his State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made a folksy presentation  
designed to put a human face on a case dominated by legal 
distinctions. He told senators in his closing argument that a high 
crime occurs simply ``if a high person hurts a person of low 
means'' and that Clinton did that when he tried to ``fix'' the 
Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., reminded senators they have  
impeached and removed federal judges for perjury. ``The Senate 
should not establish a lower standard of integrity for the 
president,'' he argued.

<HEADLINE>  Elway, Kubiak Might Be Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- They joined the Denver Broncos in the same year,  
1983, as a star quarterback and a studious backup, and it appears 
they will be going out at the same time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway and Gary Kubiak could both be making farewell  
appearances at Mile High Stadium on Sunday when the Denver Broncos 
entertain the New York Jets in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who announced last summer that this would be his final  
season but who has recently declined to talk about his future, 
would leave the game as the winningest quarterback in NFL history 
(148 victories). He and Miami's Dan Marino are the only 
quarterbacks to have thrown for 50,000 yards in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak, who served as Elway's understudy for nine seasons and  
who has been the Broncos' offensive coordinator for the past four 
seasons, is reportedly set to become the new head coach at the 
University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing can become official until after Sunday's game, since  
Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan won't give the university 
permission to talk to Kubiak until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	While neither Elway's retirement nor Kubiak's departure are 100  
percent certainties, their colleagues talk as if both will leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are this is John's last game at Mile High Stadium,''  
Shanahan said on Friday. ``I think it would be a surprise if he 
does come back. I'm hoping he does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was reminded on Friday that a year ago he asked his wife  
and four children to cast a vote at the dinner table on whether he 
should play the 1998 season. He said the vote was 5-1 to play, with 
his being the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there has been a vote for 1999, he said, ``No, at least  
not yet. Everybody has been so busy, it's hard to get them all 
together. And I won't allow any absentee ballots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Kubiak, who has declined comment since his name  
surfaced as Colorado's No. 1 candidate on Thursday, Elway said, 
``Gary Kubiak will be a great head coach no matter where he lands. 
We've talked about this, and he knows he's in a perfect situation. 
He could stay where he is. He can pick and choose. From CU's 
perspective, they couldn't get a better guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak interviewed for the new head coaching vacancy with the  
Cleveland Browns, but that team is believed leaning toward 
Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak would replace Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado last  
Saturday to accept a lucrative offer from the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp promised that officials  
would move ``expeditiously'' to name a successor since national 
letter-of-intent signing day is Feb. 3 and recruiting will suffer 
the longer the Buffaloes go without a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan refused to say whether Kubiak would depart immediately  
if he accepted the Colorado job. If the Broncos beat the Jets and 
Kubiak takes the CU job, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said he expected 
that Kubiak would stay with the team through the Super Bowl.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tweet Kimball, an heiress who amassed one of the  
nation's most eclectic art and book collections and established the 
Cherokee Ranch Foundation, died Friday at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball, heiress of a Tennessee ranching family, lived alone in  
a Scottish-style castle on her 5,000-acre Cherokee Ranch north of 
Sedalia. In 1996 she sold development rights to the land for $2 
million, and a conservation easement assures the property will 
remain undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a living trust, Kimball retained use of about 2,000 acres  
to raise her champion strain of Santa Gertrudis cattle. The 
property -- appraised at about $20 million -- is in an area under 
intense development pressure as an exclusive Front Range 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
	Living in London during World War II, Kimball became good  
friends with Winston Churchill. She eventually befriended eight 
U.S. presidents. Britain's Princess Anne was a castle guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball gathered one of the nation's most eclectic art and book  
collections, including originals by Rubens, Bruegel, and Pliny the 
Elder. Her collection of rare books included a third folio of 
Shakespeare's works, published while Shakespeare was living. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball served as a director of the Denver Art Museum and the  
World Wildlife Fund USA Council. In 1961, she established the Rocky 
Mountain Santa Gertrudis Association.

Stadium. He also directed episodes of television anthology series, 
including ``Lux Video Theater,'' ``Kraft Theater'' and ``Playhouse 
90.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He received his first Emmy nomination for directing an episode  
of ``Dr. Kildare'' in 1961 and others for 1975's ``Babe'' and 
1972's ``Brian's Song,'' which was so popular it became one of the 
few television movies to have a theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
	He won an Emmy Award for 1970's ``A Storm in Summer.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kulik also directed several features including the 1973 Burt  
Reynolds film ``Shamus'' and Steve McQueen's last movie, ``The 
Hunter'' (1980). Other TV film credits include 1986's ``Women of

who in the early 1980s survived an assassination attempt by the 
Irish Republican Army, died Friday at 79. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed a judge in 1964 and served as lord chief  
justice -- Northern Ireland's senior position overseeing the highest 
court of appeal -- from 1971 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry was awarded an honorary lordship in 1979, and three years  
later survived an IRA bid on his life while visiting Queen's 
University in Belfast. None of four bullets fired hit him, but one 
struck and wounded a professor nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Lowry took up a new senior judicial post in London.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Raymond Peynet, the cartoon illustrator whose  
drawings of young lovers embodied romance for generations of 
French, died Thursday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet created his starry-eyed ``Lovers'' during World War II:  
They hold hands, kiss and embrace in an expression of tender 
devotion that his daughter, Annie Peynet, said reflected his own 
happy marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet also designed a series of dolls portraying the women of  
Paris. Britain's Queen Elizabeth purchased a set on a state visit 
here in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Peynet's drawings of ``Les Amoureux'' (The Lovers) were widely  
used in France to symbolize Valentine's Day and were emblazoned on 
scarves, greeting cards, posters, jewelry, a postage stamp, and 
even national lottery tickets sold on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Two museums in Japan and two in France are devoted solely to  
Peynet's work. Three statues of the Lovers were erected in Japan, 
including one in Hiroshima symbolizing love and peace.

<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Aldo van Eyck, considered the most  
important Dutch architect of the 20th century, died Thursday. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck's most famous creation was the State Orphanage designed  
in Amsterdam in 1959, which was credited with smashing all 
architectural conventions of the time. The simple, villagelike 
structure featured small houses for the children linked by covered 
plains and walkways. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck, who often collaborated with his wife, Annie, also  
designed a colorful house for single mothers in the Dutch capital 
and dozens of children's playgrounds throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 magazine article named Van Eyck the nation's Architect of  
the Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Eyck also gained fame by designing the 1949 international  
exhibition of experimental art at Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum, 
featuring works by Dutch, Belgian and Danish artists.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Dixie Dot Com scored the biggest victory  
of his career Saturday when he defeated Event of the Year by 4 1/2 
lengths in the $316,000 San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes for 
4-year-olds at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores, Dixie Dot Com covered 1 1-16 miles in  
1:41 and paid $12.40, $4.20 and $3.60. Event of the Year returned 
$3 and $2.60, while Old Topper was another 4 1/2 lengths back in third 
and paid $6.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com had been second in his last three starts,  
including the Hollywood Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great way to break our seconditis,'' trainer Bill  
Morey Jr. said. ``We've had some tough seconds, and finally we put 
it together. I think this is his best race. I think our horse 
developed a little more the past year than Event of the Year did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Event of the Year under Corey Nakatani rallied for second but  
never threatened Dixie Dot Com, who carried six pounds more. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $190,800, increased Dixie Dot Com's career  
earnings to $482,775, with five wins in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a companion feature, See You Soon overtook Sonja's Faith in  
the closing strides of the $150,000 San Gorgonio Handicap to win by 
a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	See You Soon covered 1 1-8 miles on the turf in 1:49 and paid  
$4.80, $2.80 and $2.60 under Alex Solis.

<HEADLINE> Edwin Moses at Drug Testing Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The IOC and other governing bodies in  
sports, to gain credibility with athletes, must demonstrate they 
want to be fair and impartial in drug testing, hurdles great Edwin 
Moses said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the critical function they will have to do is  
establish that they are serious about the problems and maintain 
focus on major issues,'' Moses said at a forum organized by Duke to 
examine issues raised by the testing of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses was joined by former Olympic swimmer Donna de Varona, USA  
Track &AMP; Field executive Craig Masback as well as doctors and 
professors at the meeting, which hopes to influence an IOC drug 
conference scheduled to take place next month in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses said sports governing bodies must be aware of athletes'  
rights and due process. And in today's fast-paced society, just 
finding athletes to test them is difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're looking for athletes all over the world, it's hard  
keeping a moving roster of people,'' he said during a break in the 
task force meeting of the Duke Conference on Drugs in Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is worried that the issue is tarnishing the image o its  
games, especially in light of the bribery scandal involving Salt 
Lake City's bid for the next Winter Games, said John Weistart, 
co-director of the Duke law school's new Sports Law and Policy 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they control it, it poses a similar threat to  
commercial sponsorship,'' Weistart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doriane Lambelet Coleman, a forum organizer who competed  
internationally in track and field in the 1980s, said Saturday's 
meeting also will be used to jump-start a larger drug conference in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's forum -- the first project for the new policy center --  
is important because of the cross-section of participants, said 
Coleman, also a Duke law lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all at one table for the first time to try to talk  
about developing a model to resolve issues of drugs and sports with 
a particular emphasis on the Olympic sports,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenting an aboveboard testing program to young people is also  
important, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olympic sports sort of grows with children as a target,''  
Coleman said. ``There's been people here who said it's important we 
present definitively and with integrity why (doping is) a problem.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Acquitted in Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Steve Javie is not out of the woods yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The NBA referee still must meet with Internal Revenue Service  
officials to resolve his tax debt involving airline tickets he 
received from the league, but he has been cleared of income tax 
evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the acquittal of Steve Javie proved, as we have known  
all along, that no reasonable person would consider this conduct to 
be criminal,'' said Howard Pearl, general counsel for the National 
Basketball Referees Union. ``The problem is that the resources, 
emotional and financial, that are required to fight the government 
are more than most people possess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated about five hours before returning the  
acquittals on four counts against Javie on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old Javie was the only NBA referee to plead innocent  
to charges that had tried to evade taxes on income he received by 
downgrading airline tickets provided him by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other referees were charged with tax evasion for failing to  
report as income the difference between the first-class ticket they 
were given by the league to travel to games and the coach tickets 
on which they decided to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Javie pleaded guilty to the charges and most were  
sentenced to probation or short periods of house arrest and ordered 
to pay the taxes. Only one other referee went to trial, but Jess 
Kersey pleaded guilty several days into the trial this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the NBA reinstated seven referees who had been forced  
to resign because of the tax evasion charges. Javie was the only 
one of the referees who did not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Javie had argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000  
in income over three years because the money was value earned from 
frequent-flyer miles, which are not taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	The referees' contract entitles them to first-class tickets, or  
their financial equivalent, for any flight of more than two hours. 
Prosecutors admit the referees are allowed to downgrade tickets and 
take the difference in cash -- as long as they pay taxes on the 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney Greg Magarity said Javie used  
frequent-flyer miles to upgrade the cheaper ticket into a 
first-class ticket. Therefore, Magarity said the travel 
reimbursement money was the payment for the frequent-flyer miles; 
the IRS claims that same money was unreported income.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Drug Enforcement Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was supposed to be just another busy Labor Day weekend in  
North Florida. But in less than 24 hours, Highway Patrol Trooper 
Richard Blanco would find himself strapped into the cockpit of an 
Air Force cargo jet delivering illegal drugs to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1993, and Blanco was part of a four-man drug interdiction  
team patrolling Interstate 95 near Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1:30 Saturday afternoon, one of the officers pulled a  
U-Haul truck over for a traffic violation. Blanco and his partner 
were nearby and rolled up just as the U-Haul came to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	After the driver and passenger gave conflicting stories, the  
officers gained consent to search. Opening the cargo space, they 
found about $3 million worth of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver and passenger were arrested and the local office of  
the Drug Enforcement Administration was contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Before long, the two couriers agreed to deliver the drugs to New  
York City, leading police to the main dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time DEA got clearance for the delivery, it was almost  
midnight. Even driving straight through, they'd never get there on 
time, and that could make the New York dealer suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	So a DEA agent called the Air Force and the Navy to see if  
either had an airplane in Jacksonville that could handle the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanco couldn't believe it. An airplane?  
</P>
<P>
	The best they could find was a C-141 cargo jet -- the second  
largest cargo jet in the military -- based at Andrews Air Force Base 
near Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	They loaded the driver, the passenger and the U-Haul into the  
plane. Blanco and his partner rode in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they arrived, the trap went off without a hitch. Four  
people were arrested, two from Miami and two from New York 
</P>
<P>
	In his 19 years of police work, no single event has stuck in  
Blanco's head like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' he says. ``It was a real team effort.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Were Hurt in Holocaust Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It happened even to American citizens: Greta Leibowitz was 10  
years old when she and her sister played with Anne Frank amid 
corpses at the Bergen-Belsen death camp in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Now retired in California, she awaits the compensation Germany  
has just agreed to pay hundreds of U.S. citizens -- including Jewish 
GIs -- who were imprisoned by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't care I was an American citizen. All they cared  
about was that I was a Jew,'' said the 65-year-old resident of 
Reseda, Calif., near Los Angeles, whose last name is now Rhoads. 
</P>
<P>
	The money can't compensate for the horror of ``waking up each  
morning, and not knowing whether my mother or sister were still 
alive. You often woke up next to dead bodies,'' said Rhoads. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 11-year-old sister ``was so sick she wasn't moving, I  
thought she was dead,'' said Rhoads, sobbing and unable to speak 
for a moment. ``I screamed and she moved and I said 'Oh my God, 
she's alive.''' 
</P>
<P>
	About 230 survivors who were U.S. citizens when they were  
inmates of the camp are to receive one-time payments of $30,000 to 
$250,000 each, depending partly on how long they were held, said 
Steven Perles, a Washington attorney who represents some of them. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Rhoads' 66-year-old sister, Barbara Maaskant, of  
Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, a naturalized American citizen, had returned to  
his native Hungary before the war to marry and raise a family in 
the town of Munkach, outside Budapest. In 1944, while he was 
working in New York, the Nazis arrested his wife and daughters, 
forcing them to march for a week to cattle cars that took them to 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's barracks at Belsen was another American, Jack Wolf,  
now 69 and living in New York City. Before the war, his 
Brooklyn-born father had moved with his own parents to their native 
Amsterdam. Wolf was born just a walk from Anne Frank's house. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1945, when the British liberated Bergen-Belsen, Greta  
Leibowitz's father, Sam, ``was almost certain we were dead,'' she 
said. But one day in Manhattan, a soldier showed up at the 
restaurant Leibowitz owned on Broadway with photos of the family -- 
proof they had survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Greta weighed 40 pounds at liberation.  
</P>
<P>
	Being a U.S. citizen ``is the reason I'm still alive,'' said the  
mother of two, retired from her job in Hollywood's entertainment 
industry. ``Otherwise, we would have gone with all my cousins who 
were taken away to gas chambers at the beginning of the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, she came closest to death after the war at an  
American hospital in Germany. She had presented her mother, Rose, 
with a rose -- and pricked her finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so weak, and I got a bad infection that almost killed  
me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Being American also saved the lives of Wolf, his parents and his  
sister, who now lives in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Months before liberation, the family was suddenly transported  
from the northern German camp to the Swiss border and exchanged for 
German nationals deported from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wolf stepped off a ship in New York in 1945, he was a  
rebellious 16-year-old and ``found everything wrong with this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But then,'' said the retired federal government employee, ``I  
grew up, and realized that no matter how much is wrong in this 
country, this is the greatest country in the world. As a Jew, I am 
a minority among many others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations grew out of a 1995 settlement of survivor Hugo  
Princz's court battle with the German government. The New Jersey 
man and 10 others split $2.1 million in that case. Attorney General 
Janet Reno then asked Justice Department officials to try to 
determine whether other Americans might be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	It could take up to six months for the hundreds of others to  
receive the funds, pending final approval by the German parliament. 
The exact terms are to remain secret until then, the U.S. State 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six months, you're kidding me!'' said Rhoads, among the  
youngest in the group. ``When you think about the age of these 
people, it's just impossible that they're dragging this out. How 
dare they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Marks, another Washington lawyer representing victims,  
said ``the true significance of the payments is psychological -- 
Germany's recognition of the wrongs it committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf's catharsis came last year, when he visited his old  
Amsterdam neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three times I stood in front of the apartment where I was  
taken from,'' he says. ``I didn't have the guts to ring the bell. 
Finally, one day, I rang, and nobody was home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An elderly stranger on a bicycle approached Wolf and said: ``You  
know, I am terribly sorry. I am very, very ashamed of what happened 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf replied: ``'Don't be. Sir, I am standing here.'''  
</P>
<P>
	``I get tears in my eyes now,'' said Wolf. Being American  
``means everything.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Wins 60-Meter Dash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ja'Warren Hooker, make way for Patrick Jarrett.  
</P>
<P>
	Hooker, the 1998 NCAA indoor 55-meter champion and the  
third-place finisher in the 100 meters at the NCAA outdoor 
championships, was upset by the unheralded Jarrett in the 60-meter 
dash Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning victory by the 25-year-old New York Tech runner  
over the Washington sophomore came at the inaugural New York Sports 
Museum Collegiate Invitational at the Armory Track and Field 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, the New York state 100 and 200 champion in 1990 and  
1991, first beat the injured Hooker in the trial heats in 6.77 
seconds to 6.89, then came back 30 minutes later and won the final 
in 6.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooker, competing with his left foot heavily taped because of  
shin splints, finished second in 6.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Jarrett won the 200 in a sparkling 21.21, faster than his  
outdoor best by .01 seconds. The ailing Hooker finished fourth in 
the 200 in 21.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was surprised that he beat a sprinter like Hooker,  
considered one of the best in college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know who he was until they announced him before the  
heats,'' said Jarrett, a member of New York Tech's winning 
400-meter relay team at the NCAA Division II Championships and a 
member of the Jamaican 400 relay team that finished fourth at last 
summer's Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might have been a problem if I knew who he was.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hooker was the one with the problem Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not blaming the injury,'' Hooker said, before heading  
toward the first aid room for treatment. ``I didn't run a great 
race. I'll be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently injured the shin while overtraining in Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	While Hooker was not at his best, Jarrett was superb, especially  
for someone who claims he ``hates indoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took the lead from the outset and held off the hard-charging  
but laboring Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big accomplishment for me,'' Jarrett said. ``There  
was no pressure thinking about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so confident in my training now. If I run my race, I'm  
going to compete with the best. And if I run my race, I'm going to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He showed his 60 victory was no fluke by easily winning the 200,  
beating Ohio State's Andrew Pierce by .30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hold me down!'' Jarrett shouted after his 200 triumph. ``I'm  
going to take off. I'm a well-oiled machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jarrett's performances were the scene stealers, there were  
some other outstanding efforts in the 10-team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce won the 400 in 46.85, breaking the Armory record, and  
anchored Ohio State to victory in the 1,600 relay with a 400 leg of 
45.6. The Buckeyes were timed in 3;10.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Villanova's Carmen Douma, the NCAA indoor mile champion and the  
NCAA outdoor 1,500-meter champion, ran away from the field in the 
women's field, winning by about 50 meters in 4:51.69. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dominique Calloway, an NCAA finalist in last year's outdoor  
championships, led a 1-2 Ohio State finish in the women's 60-meter 
hurdles. Calloway was timed in 8.34, making her a provisional 
qualifier for this year's NCAA indoor championships. Donika 
Merriman was second at 8.40. 
</P>
<P>
	George Mason's Angie Brown, the NCAA long jump champion, won  
with a modest leap of 19 feet, 11 1-2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	And Villanova's Carrie Tollefson, the NCAA 5,000-meter cross  
country champion, took the women's 3,000 in 9:33.74.

<HEADLINE> Coleman To Sign With Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets have agreed to  
terms with free agent Derrick Coleman, according to published 
reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, the NBA's rookie of the year in 1991 and an eight-year  
veteran, will sign a multi-year deal on Tuesday, when training 
camps officially open and NBA teams can begin signing players, the 
Winston-Salem Journal and The Charlotte Observer reported. Both 
newspapers cited sources not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Coleman's deal would be for six years averaging  
around $6 million a year; the Observer said it would be for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bass, the Hornets' vice president of basketball operations,  
declined to comment on Coleman late Friday. Coleman's agent, Harold 
McDonald, told the Philadelphia Daily News that Coleman would not 
be returning to the city and had reached an agreement with another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Observer reported that Philadelphia has landed  
Charlotte free-agent center Matt Geiger, offering him a six-year 
contract that would pay him on average $8 million per season. 
Coleman spent the last three seasons with the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of Coleman would make it unlikely the Hornets would  
re-sign Vlade Divac, another free-agent center for Charlotte with 
Geiger from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac has been asking for a contract averaging in excess of $10  
million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman has averaged 19.2 points and 10.4 rebounds in his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 17.6 points and 9.9 rebounds in 59 games with the  
Philadelphia 76ers last season. The Sixers chose to exercise a 
buyout clause in his contract, making him a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman has not played more than 60 games in any of the past  
four seasons and appeared in only 11 games in the 1995-96 season 
when he was with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets had also been negotiating with free-agent centers  
Theo Ratliff of Philadelphia and Isaac Austin of the Los Angeles 
Clippers. But Ratliff will remain with the 76ers, the Observer 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Countries Seek Stable Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With Brazil providing a fresh example  
of the havoc drastic currency swings can cause, Europe's biggest 
economies and Japan pushed for international measures today to 
promote more stable exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the finance ministers meeting in Frankfurt failed to put  
forward any detailed plan to tame currency markets or smooth out 
capital flows. And the seemingly contradictory terms they used to 
state their goals -- ``flexible stability'' and ``free movement of 
capital, but ... controlled'' -- indicated how difficult it would be 
to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone agrees we need to take steps to avoid swings in  
exchange rates,'' German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said at 
the end of the two-day meeting of European Union and Asian finance 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have discovered that leaving everything wide open gives  
rise to difficulties'' -- like this week's Brazil crisis, he said, 
refering to the plunge in the South American nation's stock market 
after the government devalued its currency. ``It's our duty to get 
to grips with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa, conceded their  
idea of an ``exchange rate regime among major currencies'' to 
reduce ``excessive volatility'' was still undefined -- and faces 
significant opposition from Washington and from central bankers 
like Wim Duisenberg, president of the new European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is wary of any talk of exchange-rate ties,  
warning such plans could be hugely expensive and have a history of 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants at the Frankfurt meeting said they hoped  
differences could be worked out among the Group of Seven leading 
industrial countries, including the United States. Finance 
ministers from the group are to meet Feb. 20 in Bonn and a summit 
of leaders is set for June. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa suggested emerging Asian economies link their  
currencies to the dollar, yen and Europe's new single currency, the 
euro, in a trade-weighted average known as a currency basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea would be somewhat of a throwback to the systems that  
prevailed in Asia up to when the financial crisis there began in 
mid-1997, only this time with less reliance on the dollar alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said a couple Asian ministers expressed interest in the  
idea, but others reacted skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Thailand went into a deep problem, we were pegged to the  
basket,'' Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda noted with a 
chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand maintained a basket system that had kept its currency,  
the baht, artificially high and caused a massive sell down when it 
was abandoned under pressure in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, Japan and France also called for controls on currency  
speculators, particularly the secretive investment companies known 
as hedge funds, which buy and sell huge amounts of foreign 
currencies and have been blamed for provoking market upheavals. 
</P>

	``It is necessary to enhance financial sector supervision,''  
Lafontaine and Miyazawa said in a joint statement that called for 
tighter reporting requirements for hedge funds and financial 
institutions investing in them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Europeans appeared to back away from earlier proposals  
for target rates, or bands within which the leading world 
currencies -- the dollar, yen and euro -- would be allowed to 
fluctuate. Central banks would have to coordinate buying and 
selling to prevent currencies lurching outside the bands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Target rates are not the only solution,'' said Italian  
Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``We are not talking about controls 
in the old sense of the term.''

<HEADLINE> Rey-Bellet Wins Women's Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANTON, Austria (AP) -- Corinne Rey-Bellet of Switzerland  
stunned the downhill favorites to capture her first World Cup 
victory today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Rey-Bellet stormed down the icy, bumpy Kandahar  
course in 1 minute, 28.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Michaela Dorfmeister was second in 1:28.20, and Hilde  
Gerg of Germany third in 1:28.30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a super run. It's a great feeling to finally win a World  
Cup race. That's what I trained for all these years,'' Rey-Bellet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey-Bellet's previous best finish was third in a giant slalom in  
Crans-Montana, Switzerland, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was fourth in the last downhill at Veysonnaz,  
Switzerland, in December, and clocked the fastest times in both 
training runs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The training times gave me confidence for the race,'' she  
said. ``I felt good yesterday, I felt I was steady. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was harder today but I skied better than yesterday.  
I skied the bottom part perfectly,'' said Rey-Bellet, who gave 
Switzerland its first downhill victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria finished  
sixth, .87 seconds behind Rey-Bellet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disappointed of course,'' Meissnitzer said. ``I tried too  
hard. I should have skied more smoothly. I lost half a second just 
after the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renate Goetschl of Austria, the World Cup downhill champion and  
two-time winner this season, was fourth, .68 seconds behind 
Rey-Bellet. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the race I didn't think I would achieve a good  
result,'' Dorfmeister said. ``The visibility was very bad on parts 
of the course and the preparation of the skies played a very 
important role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerg said she made ``a big mistake.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I drifted too close to the net. Later I made up some time but  
I couldn't catch up,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The downhill was followed by a Super-G. Originally scheduled for  
Friday, the downhill had to be moved to today after a heavy 
snowfall.

<HEADLINE> Cops, Customer Wounded in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A suspected bank robber was killed and two  
police officers and a customer were wounded in a shootout during an 
attempted robbery in the heart of the city's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was shot in the head Friday after the gun battle  
with pursuing officers, said police spokesman Sherman Ackerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Dennis O'Mahoney, who was shot in the upper left leg  
and ankle, and Mark Cota, who was shot in the knee, were 
hospitalized in fair condition. The customer was in critical 
condition following surgery with gunshot wounds to the eye and 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Two suspects, one armed with a gun, came into a Bank of America  
branch during the evening rush hour and ordered everyone onto the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is your classic takeover style robbery,'' Ackerson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Witness Michael Howatt said the gunman was at a teller's window  
when the customer leapt on him and they fell to the floor. Two 
shots were fired, and the robber got up and went back to the 
teller's window. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee managed to hit the alarm, Ackerson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bike messenger Jason Hopson said he saw a suspect briskly  
walking away from the bank, taking off his mask. When the man 
turned a corner, ``there was an eruption of gunfire'' with 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was chaos,'' he said. ``Dozens of people were running.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nick Queja, who works at a nearby parking garage, said the  
suspect, an Oakland man, crouched by a car and fired at the 
officers until he was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still searching Friday night for the second suspect.

<HEADLINE> Rochon Takes World Cup Dual Moguls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Canadian skiers Stephane Rochon  
and Pierre-Alexandre Rousseau finished 1-2 Saturday, dominating the 
first World Cup dual moguls event of the season while Sandra 
Schmitt of Germany picked up her first victory as she won the 
women's contest despite a steady snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a good time watching my teammate,'' Rochon said at  
the midpoint of the Sprint Shootout weekend ``because he's so 
excited, so happy and jumping around after making his first podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember my first top-3, two years ago in Breckenridge, and  
I was the same way. And today I have my first win in dual moguls 
and that makes me very excited, too,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochon said the day-long snow was deceptive because it created  
soft snow conditions on the course for a brief time ``but the other 
skiers would push it to the side, so it was not always so soft. You 
had to be careful and to keep your focus; it was a long day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's semifinals, Schmitt defeated local favorite Ann  
Battelle while Swedish skier Marja Elfman beat Brooke Ballachey of 
South Lake Tahoe, Calif. Schmitt then edged Elfman while Battelle 
earned her second top-3 of the season, beating Ballachey, her 
roommate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great having a World Cup in your hometown,'' Battelle  
said, ``but it's also pretty stressful. I spent a lot of time 
skiing this week, maybe too much, but getting up on the mountain 
skiing was the only way, sometimes, to get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brooke'll find that out next week at Heavenly; I've been  
telling her it'll be hectic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend winds up with aerials on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> House Republican Lays Out Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial has not  
consumed all of Congress' attention, a top House Republican said 
today, citing GOP plans to improve schools, offer tax relief and 
preserve Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida  
laid out some of the priorities for House Republican members in the 
year ahead, starting with education. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler, vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference,  
outlined plans to ensure more money goes to classrooms and schools 
are more accessible to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	While Fowler said she expects Clinton to support a greater  
investment in education, she hoped the president would make sure 
the money ends up in local schools ``rather than in an expanded 
education bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said she would like Clinton, in his State of the Union  
address Tuesday night, to offer a plan to rescue the troubled 
Social Security system -- a priority he outlined in his speech last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will join with you next week in listening to the president,  
and in hoping that along with promises about saving Social 
Security, he will also offer a plan to save it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing tax relief for American families should be another  
objective for the year ahead, Fowler said, stressing that a budget 
surplus makes this feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the president remembers that the surplus is not the  
government's money. It's your money. And you are entitled to 
getting some of it back,'' she told listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	To accomplish these goals, Congress has to leave behind ``the  
acrimony of last year'' and work together, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	She resolved that in 1999 Republicans would ``focus our energies  
on results, not rhetoric; on similarities, not differences; and on 
action, not political posturing.''

<HEADLINE> Jet Players Have Playoff Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Here's how inexperienced in playoff situations the  
New York Jets really are: 19 of their players have been in the 
postseason, including 11 who have played in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, of course, the Jets aren't nearly as playoff savvy  
as the Denver Broncos, who won the NFL title last year and are in 
the Super Bowl chase for the third straight year. New York's last 
postseason appearance was in 1991, a short-lived one-game affair, 
and it hasn't been to the AFC Championship game since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Jets aren't exactly novices when it comes to the kind  
of pressure that accompanies Sunday's game for the AFC crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enough maturity on this team,'' said Bill Parcells, who  
coached the Giants to two Super Bowl victories -- one over Denver -- 
and lost with New England in the big game before overseeing the 
Jets' stunning turnaround from 1-15 to the verge of their first 
Super Bowl in 30 years. ``It is not like a team without playoff 
experience. We have quite a few who do have it for various teams 
and situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are inexperienced. If we were, it would have  
showed up last week. But Denver certainly has an edge there in 
these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York actually played more pressurized games this season than  
Denver. The Broncos, seeking a sixth Super Bowl appearance, surged 
to a 13-0 start, pursuing an historic unbeaten season. 
</P>
<P>
	But is that the same as playing each week with playoff or  
division race survival on the line? The Jets needed road wins in 
New England, Kansas City, Tennessee, Miami and Buffalo during their 
12-4 regular season to reach the top of the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave us a lot of confidence to go into places like Miami  
and Buffalo and win on the road with so much at stake,'' said 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, the AFC's leading passer, just ahead 
of Denver star John Elway. ``We know we can win on the road. But we 
also know this is a tough game. We feel like we can get it done if 
we play good football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good football might not be enough at Mile High Stadium, where  
the Broncos have won 18 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets need to be stingy right away to avoid Denver  
duplicating its trademark quick start. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the Broncos lead the AFC in scoring with 501 points  
(the Jets scored 416), they outscored opponents 144-54 in the first 
quarter and 156-87 in the second. By halftime, the Broncos were in 
control nearly every week, leading each home game but one -- they 
were 21-21 with Kansas City -- and averaging a 23-8 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Broncos are slouches in any portion of a game. But  
with NFL Most Valuable Player Terrell Davis spearheading the 
attack, they are dominant early. Often, that has rendered the final 
30 minutes of games insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Denver players say there's no way they'll have anything  
but a positive edge Sunday. No nerves or jitters, other than the 
eagerness to get after the opponent and get back to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say what we went through last year is an  
advantage,'' said safety Steve Atwater, referring to how the 
Broncos used the wild-card route to the championship. ``But we've 
got to do the things we did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to want it even moreso than last year. I hope  
we have a feeling like we're underdogs and go out and make things 
happen, which was our attitude last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Jets went 9-7 and barely missed qualifying for  
the playoffs. Parcells then brought in such key free agents at 
Testaverde, Curtis Martin, Keith Byars, Kevin Mawae and Anthony 
Pleasant. They have been among the leaders of the team's 
resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them, with their teammates, will carry the same fever and  
passion into Sunday's matchup that the Broncos bring. And nearly as 
much big-game experience.

<HEADLINE> Sisters Sentenced for Slave Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge has sentenced two  
deaf-mute sisters to eight years in prison for forcing a Mexican 
family into slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Lozano, 34, and Guadalupe Lozano, 27, were convicted in  
November of conspiracy charges involving civil rights, alien 
smuggling and extortion, plus two counts of involuntary servitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, who were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harry Lee  
Hudspeth on Friday, could have been given life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the pair lured four family members from Mexico  
in 1994 with promises of jobs, residency, and government benefits. 
Instead, the victims, including two deaf-mute adults, were forced 
to beg for money and sell trinkets, then turn over earnings of 
about $5,000 a month, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims also testified that the Lozano sisters beat them and  
took their passports to keep them from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigration service began investigating the Lozanos early  
last year after learning of the family's plight from the Mexican 
consulate, which had received abuse complaints from relatives in 
Monterrey, Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Volunteering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans should make Monday's Martin Luther  
King Jr. holiday ``a day on, not a day off'' by joining a 
nationwide volunteer campaign, President Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Vice President Al Gore and District of Columbia Mayor  
Anthony Williams, Clinton planned to set an example with his own 
community service project at a home for the elderly in northwest 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a drive by the administration's Americorps national  
service program to deploy 100,000 volunteers nationwide on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To honor what would have been Dr. King's 70th birthday, I urge  
all Americans to rise to the highest calling in our land -- the 
calling of active citizenship,'' the president said in his weekly 
radio broadcast from the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with the holiday, the White House released a  
report from Clinton's long-floundering initiative on race 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, titled ``Pathways to One America in the 21st  
century,'' is meant to serve as a ``a guide to some of our 
communities' best ways to building that elusive `one America': one 
neighborhood, one school system, one workplace at a time,'' Clinton 
said. The report chronicles 123 programs around the country that 
are working to improve race relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Americorps projects include painting schools, reading to  
children and cleaning up parks to mark the King holiday on Monday, 
a day off for federal workers and many in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton publicized the Americorps Web site (www.americorps.org)  
and urged Americans to log on and sign up for projects in their 
area. Donating blood is another good way to observe the holiday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this national holiday should be a day on, not  
a day off,'' Clinton said. ``For as Dr. King once said, `Life's 
most persistent and urgent question is what are you going to do for 
others?'''

<HEADLINE> Has-Beens, Never-Weres in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- While they come from vastly different  
backgrounds, the Atlanta Falcons have much in common. No one wanted 
most of these guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's constant motivation for me,'' said Jamal Anderson, the  
201st player selected in the 1994 draft. ``I don't care how long I 
play, I'll always remember the teams that passed me by. I'm still 
keeping tabs on the running backs who were picked ahead of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the NFL's second leading rusher with 1,846 yards, has  
plenty of teammates who are also seething. The team that will meet 
Minnesota in the NFC championship game Sunday is dominated by 
low-round draft picks, bargain-basement free agents and aging 
players who were supposedly washed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Anderson, rookie offensive tackle Ephraim Salaam was a  
seventh-round draft pick. Other players who made it past the first 
round include: offensive guard Calvin Collins (sixth); defensive 
tackle Travis Hall (sixth); linebacker Henri Crockett (fourth); 
tight end O.J. Santiago (third); and defensive end Chuck Smith 
(second). 
</P>
<P>
	As least those players were drafted. Five-time Pro Bowl  
linebacker Jessie Tuggle wasn't. Neither was center Robbie Tobeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are hundreds of players picked over me who are not even  
in the league now,'' said Tuggle, a 12-year veteran. ``I guarantee 
you if I was free right now, there's 29 other teams that would want 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Pro Bowl quarterback Chris Chandler was a freebie from  
the Tennessee Oilers, acquired for fourth- and sixth-round picks. 
Defensive end Lester Archambeau was traded by the Packers for 
someone named James Milling. Offensive guard Gene Williams cost the 
Falcons a fifth-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Cornelius Bennett and safeties Eugene Robinson and  
William White were all in their 30s when they signed with the 
Falcons, their best days supposedly behind them. San Diego figured 
33-year-old Tony Martin was on the downside of his career when it 
sent the receiver to Atlanta for a mere second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Shane Dronett was cut twice within a year --  
including by the Falcons -- before returning to Atlanta as a last 
resort. Receiver Terance Mathis signed on after starting one game 
in four years for the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest road of all was traveled by fullback Bob Christian,  
one of the Falcons' most valuable players before a knee injury 
finished his season. A 12th-round pick in 1991, he was cut three 
times before ever playing an NFL game, even failing to make the 
London Monarchs of the World League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some steals on this team,'' said Anderson, who  
naturally considers himself the biggest one of all. ``Outside of 
Bob Whitfield, who's a first-rounder on my line? Who's a 
second-rounder? 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about this team. In essence, when you look at the  
Falcons, it's just a bunch of guys who were low-round picks for the 
most part, but love to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitfield, a left tackle who was drafted eighth overall in 1992,  
and cornerback Michael Booker, the No. 11 pick last season, are the 
only starters chosen in the first round by the Falcons. The only 
prime free agents lured to Atlanta were Pro Bowl cornerback Ray 
Buchanan and kicker Morten Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at their team, there are some No. 1 draft  
picks,'' Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ``But there are also 
some guys that were looking for jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons went 15-2 this season, proving that there's more to  
player evaluation than how fast they run the 40 or how much they 
can bench press. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to the intangibles,'' Anderson said. ``Are  
you an athlete? Can you play this game? Sometimes you've got teams 
whose only prerequisite is size, speed and strength. But that's not 
always what makes a football player. I wasn't the strongest player 
or the fastest player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Falcons were infatuated with pure physical skills in  
the past. While that philosophy worked with Deion Sanders (1989) 
and Whitfield, it also led to such disastrous first-round picks as 
Aundray Bruce, Steve Broussard, Bruce Pickens and Lincoln Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You appreciate it more ... when you're not in a situation  
where you're given everything, when you're not the poster boy for 
the entire organization,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons traded away their No. 1 picks from 1994-96 before  
Dan Reeves took over as coach and head of football operations. Over 
the last two years, he selected Booker and Keith Brooking in the 
first round, but Atlanta has still been more productive with its 
later picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Four starters were taken in rounds three through seven, while  
Tim Dwight (a fourth-rounder this season) has been one of the 
team's most dynamic players as a kick returner and third receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an opportunity to play right away strictly because of  
the salary cap,'' Reeves said. ``It's important to make some good 
decisions, whether it's free agents or sixth- and seventh-round 
draft choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to Salaam, who showed glimpses of the same domination  
on film as his San Diego State teammate and fellow offensive 
lineman Kyle Turley, a first-round pick by the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what motivates those guys when they're coming  
out of college,'' Reeves said. ``Now that they've got to make a 
living at it, how are they going to respond? Ephraim is a great 
example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is the rest of the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``For one reason or another, someone else didn't want us,''  
Anderson said, grinning. ``Now, they all want us.''

<HEADLINE> Calamity May Offer Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disaster looms on several fronts in the  
Worldwatch Institute's millennial-ending look at the planet, but 
researchers see a possible economic boom for governments and 
companies that commit to head off social and environmental 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Avoiding calamity ``represents the greatest investment  
opportunity in history,'' says institute founder Lester R. Brown, 
pointing to the spread of efforts to recycle raw materials in 
several industries and development of alternative energy sources, 
particularly wind power. 
</P>
<P>
	He cites one effort by a large U.S.-based corporation,  
Interface, to lease and recycle industrial carpet products now 
manufactured in seven countries and sold in 110. The company 
chairman agrees with Brown's concerns but says Interface's efforts 
to develop and lease totally recyclable products are short of 
spectacular in a $1.3 billion business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace is not really ready for it yet,'' said  
Interface head Ray Anderson of Atlanta, Ga., who has written a 
book, ``Mid-Course Correction,'' on the need to create industries 
that return ``every valuable molecule'' for possible use again. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a new economy based on renewable resources, rapid  
deforestation, falling water tables and accelerating climate change 
could undermine economies around the world in the next century, 
said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwatch releases its annual report Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Unexpected developments just over the past year include a record  
increase in the average global temperature during the year, record 
losses from destructive storms and floods, and the astounding 
number of people displaced by natural disasters -- 300 million, or 
more than the population of North America. The worst disasters were 
in China, Bangladesh and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not have been surprised if 1998 was warmer,'' said  
Brown. ``What we didn't expect was that it literally would go off 
the chart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global average temperature increased 0.2 degrees Celsius or  
more than 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit. That sounds small, but if the 
trend continues into the next century, major global climate 
disruption is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, the report notes huge percentage increases  
in electricity from the wind and the sun. Wind power has increased 
an average of 25.7 percent a year and solar power 16.8 percent a 
year since 1990. Use of renewable energy sources still represents 
only 19 percent of energy use, however, with the bulk from coal, 
oil or natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind power now provides 7 percent of Denmark's electricity, 23  
percent in northern Spain. The report says just three U.S. states -- 
North and South Dakota and Texas -- could harness enough wind to 
light up the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cites predictions made by ``futurists'' in the 1890s  
for this century. They correctly predicted widespread use of 
electricity and telephones, but thought pollution would end and had 
no inkling of the birth control pill, the Internet, two world wars, 
nuclear weapons or the specter of ``a billion people struggling 
just to survive,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental researcher Christopher Flavin, one of several  
co-authors of the report, said some big surprises can be expected 
in the next century, as well. But the report avoids any outright 
predictions for the next 100 years and certainly not the next 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A major question, he said, is which countries will lead in the  
new technologies. Now, Germany is ahead of the United States in 
development of the $2 billion wind power industry and Japan leads 
in use of solar energy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing we know for sure is the next century is not  
going to be like the 20th century. We're going to see most trends 
change at some point.'' said Flavin in an interview. Oil 
consumption, water use, and harvesting of needed protein from land 
or sea cannot continue to grow indefinitely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need to shift those trends is going to create some  
significant economic disruptions,'' Flavin said, ``and some of the 
biggest investment opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Hosts People's Inaugural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The governor arrived Saturday night wearing  
pink wraparound sunglasses, a bandana on his bald head, three 
earrings and a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt. His wife wore leather. Black 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Body's back for tonight. Thank you, everyone. Let's party  
Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So declared Gov. Jesse Ventura at an inaugural ball as  
unorthodox as his campaign. And his supporters -- more than 13,000 
of them -- loved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a political event, but it's more of a people's  
event, a celebration,'' said Sherry Nielsen, 51, of Sauk Rapids. 
``The whole concept of his party is that everyone can come, not 
just the upper echelon, and I think that whole concept is kind of 
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural party was, in fact, dubbed ``The People's  
Celebration'' by organizers. The University of Minnesota marching 
band brought the crowd to its feet with ``Minnesota Rouser'' and 
then a video montage traced Ventura's path from the campaign trail 
to the statehouse as Minnesota's Reform Party governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer flowed more freely than champagne, and jeans far  
outnumbered tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Wones, 21, arrived in a T-shirt bearing the slogan: ``The  
Governor is Ready to Rumble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a fan of his when he was wrestling, too,'' Wones said of  
the former professional wrestler nicknamed ``The Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teen blues guitarist Jonny Lang, a personal favorite of  
Ventura's, headlined the evening's entertainment, and Warren Zevon 
was also on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13,800 tickets, ranging from $10 to $20, were scooped up in  
a little over a day last month. Those who were unable to get 
tickets could watch the show on the Internet or on public TV 
stations.

<HEADLINE> House Arguments Fail To Sway Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said curiosity, and  
the possibility of hearing new evidence, led her to attend the 
three days of arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it ended Saturday afternoon, the Texas Democrat, who  
opposes Clinton's removal from office, said she didn't hear 
anything unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was still a case on hearsay,'' said Jackson Lee, who sat  
alone every day in a row of seats set out for House members in a 
rear corner of the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying the 13 House Judiciary Committee Republicans did an  
``able job'' arguing the case against Clinton, Jackson Lee said 
they offered nothing else but ``the strong emphasis that the 
president perjured himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson Lee, who also is a member of the Judiciary Committee  
that voted articles of impeachment against the president, said she 
thought it was important to attend the trial since the process 
began in the House. She said she was in the Capitol on Jan. 7 when 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist swore in the 100 senators for the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	She also plans to continue the vigil next Tuesday, when Clinton  
attorneys open three days of arguments in defense of the president 
-- the same day of the annual State of the Union address before a 
joint session of Congress.

<HEADLINE> House Strategy Relies on Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors relied heavily on Monica  
Lewinsky's credibility to make their impeachment case that 
President Clinton had lied and obstructed justice and to plead for 
trial witnesses to resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a criminal court, such a strategy that highlights  
contradictions would be ``a sure loser,'' a legal expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is not a criminal trial. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on  
Saturday called it ``a political process'' before a body divided 
along party lines on the issue of removing Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House prosecutors' immediate concern was to win the right  
from senators to go beyond the well-known, voluminous body of 
written evidence to summon witnesses they hope will tip 12 
Democratic senators to the Republican side and win a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	With their opening trial presentation done, the all-Republican  
prosecution team's drive for witnesses will continue in private -- 
where they must identify specific reasons to call the witnesses and 
convince senators they can keep such a process concise and 
controlled. They were signs Saturday they had gained some support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not averse to having some limited testimony by a few  
witnesses ... that would help us'' resolve conflicts in testimony, 
said Sen. John Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island whom 
Democrats had once hoped would help them defeat a vote on 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Over three days, the prosecutors delivered to the Senate, in  
painstaking detail, a case alleging a broad conspiracy by Clinton 
to illegally conceal his extramarital affair from Paula Jones' 
lawyers, and then to keep certain embarrassing facts about that 
relationship from a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers identified a half-dozen alleged lies by Clinton to  
the grand jury and some eight more in his deposition in the Jones 
case. And they identified several other acts they said the 
president committed to hide evidence or influence the testimony of 
other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But to make the case, they had to assert that the testimony of  
witnesses such as Ms. Lewinsky and Oval Office Secretary Betty 
Currie, which conflicted with that of the president, was more 
believable. They repeatedly tried to bolster the former intern, 
calling her ``very credible'' and her assertions in past testimony 
``common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot  
believe the president,'' Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida argued at 
one point Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost by definition, if a case is built on conflicting  
testimony, there is reasonable doubt,'' said John Douglass, a 
former Iran-Contra prosecutor and now a professor of criminal law 
at the University of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the criminal world, it's a sure loser to begin with. This  
is a case no prosecutor would ever bring, facing a burden of proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt in front of an unbiased jury,'' Douglass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the impeachment trial, there is no burden for prosecutors  
to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt -- since each senator 
determines his or her own standards for conviction or acquittal. 
And a Senate composed of 100 politicians is hardly an unbiased 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	To win a conviction, the House prosecutors must win 67 votes.  
They have a lesser threshold to meet in winning the right to call 
witnesses, just 51 senators can authorize such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dean, the White House counsel under Richard Nixon who went  
to prison for the Watergate cover-up, said, ``I thought the most 
interesting weakness was the call for witnesses. If they need 
witnesses to make their case, they do not have clear and convincing 
evidence to bring to the Senate. Clear and convincing evidence 
would not call for witnesses to make the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why then, are the prosecutors pushing so hard for the Senate to  
invite President Clinton to testify, and summon Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. 
Currie and presidential friend Vernon Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
	``Any trial lawyer will tell you that in the course of a trial,  
stuff happens. If you start calling witnesses, you don't know what 
happens. The dynamic changes. It's an ``X'' factor,'' explained Ira 
Reiner, the Los Angeles district attorney from 1984-92.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Thompson Sets Swimming Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Five-time Olympic champion Jenny  
Thompson, who shattered two world records last month, broke the 
100-meter individual medley world record at a World Cup 
short-course meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson followed up her record-breaking peformance by winning  
the 50-meter butterfly, giving her five gold medals at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100 medley, the American knocked 0.02 seconds off the  
short-course world mark set by Slovakian Martina Moravcova one 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who also holds the world record in the short-course  
50-meter and 100-meter butterfly which she set in College Station, 
Texas, last month, clocked 1:00.41 to beat Moravcova's 1:00.43. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm on a roll,'' said Thompson, who spent some time  
training in Canberra following a short vacation in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a winning streak going, and I hope I can keep it  
going forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, Thompson  
spent some time with coach Gennadi Touretski, the Russian who also 
coaches Michael Klim and Alex Popov. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned a lot from him,'' Thompson said. ``He has a  
different way of explaining things, and I think his stroke 
technique has helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Thompson also won the 100-meter butterfly and  
50-meter freestyle on Friday night and the 50-meter butterfly and 
100-meter freestyle on Saturday, in which she was just .33 seconds 
off the five-year-old world mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson won $2,000 from international swimming federation FINA  
for the world record and she is also in the running for another 
$10,000 which is the total prize money to be divided among world 
pace setters during the Australian stop on the short-course series. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup moves to Hobart on Monday and Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials gave Thompson a small rest after breaking the world  
record so she was able to recover for the 50-meter butterfly. She 
then went out and won in 26.36 -- just 0.31 off her own world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been great but I was just too tired,'' Thompson  
said when asked by a television commentator poolside if she thought 
it was possible to break two world records in consecutive events. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson clocked 53.34 seconds in the 100 meters to beat German  
Katrin Meissner and Alison Sheppard of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Claim Ambitious Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans have a new leader and an  
ambitious legislative agenda that has nothing to do with 
impeachment, a GOP leader said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agenda is not a partisan agenda. Rather it is an American  
agenda,'' Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., vice chairwoman of the House 
Republican Conference, said in the Republicans' weekly radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Her remarks echoed pledges from Senate Republicans last week,  
who promised that the impeachment trial under way in the Senate 
will not consume all the legislators' time and energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to use every minute that we're not in the  
impeachment trial preparing for our legislative agenda,'' Sen. Kay 
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said shortly after President Clinton's 
trial on allegations of for alleged perjury and obstruction of 
justice began. 
</P>
<P>
	And Fowler's remarks follow meetings last week in her home  
state, at which top Republican donors from across the country 
vented irritation with the party's top leaders and GOP losses in 
the 1998 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson heard  
complaints from a few GOP backers at one session Thursday in Palm 
Beach that the party's themes have disappeared into an impeachment 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bardes, one of about 100 ``Eagles'' invited to the  
session, said Nicholson took tough questions in stride. Eagles are 
contributors who donate at least $15,000 annually to the Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a right to be concerned as a result of the last  
election,'' said Bardes, who came away from the session encouraged 
about GOP legislative plans. ``I think Nicholson, et al., 
understand that there were mistakes made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her address, Fowler said the House GOP, under leadership of  
the new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., will focus on 
education, Social Security, tax relief and military funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear in saying that it is an agenda that will  
succeed only if Congress works together in a bipartisan manner, 
leaving behind the acrimony of last year,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are committed to working with Clinton on a number of  
fronts, she said. She also challenged the president, who is 
scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night, 
to follow up on a pledge from last year's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton said that saving Social Security would be  
his top priority,'' Fowler said. ``It is now one year later, and we 
are still waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Entertainment Chief Wants More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fox's new entertainment chief wants the  
television network to be about more than cartoons and car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Herzog, who replaced Peter Roth last week as head of  
programming at Fox, indicated the network may be overdoing it with 
edgy reality shows. His top priority is to develop comedy programs 
that use real actors instead of animated characters, he said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has struck ratings gold with reality shows that depict  
animals attacking, buildings collapsing and cars crashing. Herzog 
told television critics at a news conference that the specials will 
still have a place on Fox, just not such a prominent one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to rely on the stuff long-term,'' said the  
former Comedy Central president. ``It's great for short-term gains. 
We need to look at it like that. You could probably say that we've 
been doing a little too much of that lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is also being overrun this year with prime-time animated  
characters. In addition to ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the 
Hill,'' it recently debuted ``The PJ's,'' created by Eddie Murphy. 
Two more cartoons will debut in March: ``Family Guy'' and 
``Futurama,'' the latter created by ``Simpsons'' creator Matt 
Groening. Except for ``That '70s Show'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' live 
comedies are absent from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog said cartoons are easier to make distinctive and can  
often be cheaper to produce than shows with live actors -- no small 
consideration in the financially constricted world of network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing about animated characters is they can't get  
bored or tired and run off to make a movie,'' Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are limits. Herzog, whose success at Comedy Central  
was largely due to ``South Park,'' said those foul-mouthed cartoon 
characters weren't right for broadcast television. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedies with live actors ``are in desperate need of  
reinvention,'' he said. ``Whether I can figure it out will tell the 
tale of whether I can make this job or not.''

<HEADLINE> Couple May Have Faked Death Twice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMER, Pa. (AP) -- Prosecutors believe a man faked his own death  
to collect $1.5 million in insurance -- 10 years after his wife 
allegedly did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as blatant a scam to defraud an insurance company as  
one can imagine,'' Attorney General Mike Fisher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has filed charges in Lehigh County against Lee Likhit  
Kongsiri, 60, and his wife, Phatcha, who are believed to be living 
in Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Mrs. Kongsiri filed documents with nine  
insurance companies to get benefits on the pretext that her husband 
had died from a heart attack while on vacation in Thailand in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told a grand jury that seven of the nine companies  
believed Mrs. Kongsiri. But Prudential and Allstate suspected fraud 
and alerted authorities, prompting a grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities investigating the case became aware of the  
Kongsiris' new life after one of their two sons, his wife and her 
parents visited Thailand and were met in August 1996 at Bangkok 
International Airport by Lee and Phatcha Kongsiri, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Lee and Phatcha Kongsiri's daughter-in-law were  
unaware of the staged death and videotaped the Kongsiris at the 
airport. The tape was presented to the grand jury as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury concluded that there was also a successful case  
of fraud in 1985, when Mrs. Kongsiri -- then using the first name 
Silivai -- also went to Thailand and allegedly faked her own death. 
</P>
<P>
	She then allegedly returned to Palmer a year later, calling  
herself Phatcha, and married her husband again. That case will not 
be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Thailand has an extradition treaty with the United  
States, authorities said they were confident that they will be able 
to prosecute the Kongsiris.

<HEADLINE> Pork Producers Rip Consumer Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Standing at the meat case at her local  
supermarket, Mary Jo Lyon felt sick. Her distress was not the meat, 
but the prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork chops were $2.50 a pound last week; hams were $1.50. Not  
surprising, unless you consider that the Fayette, Mo., pig farmer 
and her husband Ovid had just sold a 615-pound boar for 6 cents a 
pound and several 250-pound hogs for 11 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is wrong there big time,'' Lyon said ``Somebody is  
making a killing but I don't know where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As pork producers across the country grapple with an oversupply  
problem that has maxed slaughterhouses and dropped prices to their 
lowest levels in 40 years, many are questioning why consumers 
haven't seen a major drop in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	At its lowest levels in December, hog farmers were getting $8 to  
$10 per hundredweight. That means a 250-pound hog that brought in 
about $120 a year ago was only worth around $20 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices last week rose to about $25 per hundredweight after the  
government announced millions of dollars in aid for hog farmers, 
but the price is still a drastic cut from the $45 to $50 levels of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers say they are suffering while processors and retailers  
reap the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say in the last five years, in Colorado, a minimum of  
one half of hog producers have exited the business,'' said John 
Lang, an Eaton, Colo., producer. ``Financially, it won't work. They 
just aren't able to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department economist Annette Clausson said retail  
pork prices have dropped, including a 4.7 percent decrease last 
year. Another 3 to 4 percent decrease is expected this year, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail price never goes up as much as the farm price would  
but then it also doesn't go down as much and it takes a longer time 
(to be affected),'' Clausson said. ``You don't see the swings in 
the retail prices for a lot of your meats that you do in the farm 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clausson said that USDA figures show that a pound of center cut  
bone-in chops cost $3.39 in December 1997. Last month, that same 
pound of meat cost $3.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency figures don't take into account sales promotions at  
individual grocery stores, Clausson said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Juanita Miller, the prices are a real steal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen pork chops this cheap in a while,'' Miller said  
as she loaded her basket at a Giant supermarket in Upper Marlboro, 
Md., with four packages of chops at $1.39 a pound. The regular 
price is $2.99 a pound. ``This is too good to be true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were similar throughout the Washington region this week.  
At Giant, the pork roast ends were 79 cents a pound. At Food Lion, 
picnic shoulder roasts were 69 cents a pound and at Super Fresh, 
pork spareribs were $1.99 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hammonds, president of the Food Marketing Institute, a trade  
organization representing thousands of grocery stores across the 
country, said retailers are not taking advantage of pork farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retailers recognize that pork producers are in real trouble,''  
Hammonds said. ``They are ... aggressively moving low price pork to 
consumers. Our prices are reflecting our purchase cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds and some economists say the oversupply problem will  
inevitably overwhelm retail demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many hogs,'' Hammonds said. ``That is not a  
retailer-driven problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we like to think is if retailers would drop the price,  
we'd move a lot more pork,'' said Michigan State University 
economist Laura Martin. ``That's just not how it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clausson said retail pork prices also reflect additional costs  
for things like marketing, transportation, packaging -- a statement 
even the National Pork Producers Association agrees with. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a direct correlation between prices paid to  
producers and prices consumers pay,'' said association Vice 
President Dallas Hockman. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Hockman said his organization is pushing to get grocers  
to offer pork specials. He said while some retailers are offering 
pork chops at 88 cents a pound, others are asking for $3.99 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're asking is for them to recognize the situation we're  
under,'' Hockman said.

<HEADLINE> Padres, Miceli in Three-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Reliever Dan Miceli and the San Diego Padres  
avoided arbitration when they agreed to a $4.6 million, three-year 
contract on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miceli, who was 10-5 with a 3.22 ERA as a setup man for Trevor  
Hoffman, will earn $1.1 million this season, $1.5 million in 2000 
and $2 million in 2001. He made $750,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's developed into one of the better setup guys in  
the league,'' general manager Kevin Towers said. ``He's a guy who 
could close for a lot of other clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves left-handed starter Sterling Hitchcock as the only  
Padres player eligible for arbitration. Towers said the two sides 
remain well more than $1 million apart in negotiations for a 
multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got our work to do,'' said Towers, who plans to speak at  
length on Sunday with Hitchcock's agent, Tommy Tanzer. Hitchcock 
was MVP of the Padres' NL championship series win over Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Northeast, Midwest Seek Thaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- First snow, then sleet. Now comes the thaw.  
</P>
<P>
	At least that's what many in the Northeast and Midwest were  
hoping for today after winter storms lashed the region Thursday and 
Friday with every permutation of precipitation -- snow, sleet, rain 
and ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Roofs, especially, were starting to feel the strain after  
nearing 3 feet of snow piled up in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Livingston County, a 51-year-old woman was trapped  
for nearly two hours Friday after her carport collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	A buildup of snow and ice was also blamed for part of a roof  
giving way at a Lockheed Martin manufacturing plant in Syracuse. 
The collapse sent about 20 workers scurrying for safety, but no one 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the Rochester suburb of Penfield, about 200 residents of  
an apartment complex were evacuated Friday when a roof began to 
collapse under the weight of 2 feet of snow. Nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was much the same elsewhere in the region.  
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, as the slippery storm changed to ice and then rain,  
cars continued to slide off highways while others plowed through 
foot-deep flooding that swamped roads and forced pedestrians to 
hurdle slush puddles. More than 100 vehicles had to be towed in the 
region, said state police Lt. Paul Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
	In suburbs of Cleveland, snow collapsed a metal greenhouse at a  
market and caved in the garage roof of an apartment complex, 
damaging four cars. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the region were expected to rise into the 40s  
and possibly 50s today and stay there through Tuesday, the National 
Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't entirely good news -- in some parts of Ohio where the  
snow has started to melt, homeowners could get flooded basements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a 25 percent increase in our business because of  
the weather,'' said Tony Caserta, manager of Gem City Home 
Improvement and Water Proofing in Dayton. ``All of that rain and 
sleet we have been having has caused an extra amount of water and 
many basements that wouldn't normally leak are leaking now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about 100 flights canceled out of LaGuardia and Newark  
airports, hundreds of New York Jets fans started screaming ``seats, 
seats, seats'' Friday to get to Denver for Sunday's football game 
against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't just take a later flight Sunday or Monday because  
the game will be over,'' said United Airlines spokesman Gary 
Lonieski. ``We're getting them out there. We don't want anybody to 
be disappointed.''

<HEADLINE> Wife Convicted in 'Murder Mystery' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- Just days before he was killed last  
Valentine's Day, Stephen Hricko wrote in his diary that he hoped to 
salvage his marriage during a weekend murder-mystery retreat with 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Kimberly Hricko, was convicted Friday of poisoning him  
and then setting their hotel room on fire to cover up the crime. 
She faces life in prison for the first-degree murder and arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mrs. Hricko, a 33-year-old surgical technician,  
confided in friends and co-workers before the death that she was 
bitterly unhappy in her nine-year marriage and longed to get rid of 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Mrs. Hricko stood to collect $400,000 from life  
insurance policies taken out on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments Friday, prosecutor Robert Dean detailed  
Mrs. Hricko's ``coldblooded and sinister'' plot to kill her husband 
by injecting him with the powerful drug succinylcholine chloride to 
stop his breathing. Then, he said, she set fire to the hotel suite 
they shared at an Eastern Shore resort hours after the couple 
watched a Valentine's Day murder-mystery play on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The whodunit onstage portrayed a groom sipping poisoned  
champagne who drops dead during a toast and the audience tries to 
solve the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys, who said they would appeal the verdict,  
argued that Hricko drank heavily the night he died and may have 
accidentally set his bedspread on fire. They also theorized that 
Hricko committed suicide, though they never said how he might have 
killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Hricko, 42, the victim's sister, said the verdict won't  
assuage the family's pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help a little bit, but ... Steve's not back,'' she  
said. ``This didn't right the wrongs, but maybe this will prevent 
someone from doing the same thing.''

	Clinton Support Holding Strong  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite three days of arguments by House  
Republicans in the impeachment trial, there is little evidence that 
President Clinton's Democratic support in the Senate has eroded. 
Although House prosecutors Saturday demanded Clinton's removal from 
office, Democratic Senator from New Jersey Robert Torricelli said 
based on the current record, the prosecutors aren't going to win. 
And one Republican, Vermont Sen. James Jeffords, sounded skeptical 
of the case. ``If you say lying about a non-crime (an affair) can 
be converted into a high crime by the way you handle it, that sets 
a pretty low standard for me,'' he said. 

</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Massacre Triggers NATO Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department says NATO will hold an  
emergency session Sunday in Brussels to consider a response to the 
execution-style killings of dozens of people in southern Kosovo. 
NATO's contingency plans involve the possible bombing of Serb 
installations. The bodies were found Saturday, shot or mutilated in 
what appears to be the worst slaying in the nearly year-old 
conflict in the separatist province. The discovery came a day after 
Serb forces attacked the area in southern Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Ventura Hosts People's Inaugural  
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura arrived Saturday night  
wearing pink wraparound sunglasses, a bandana on his bald head, 
three earrings and a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt at an inaugural ball as 
unorthodox as his campaign -- and his supporters -- more than 13,000 
of them -- loved it. ``The Body's back for tonight,'' Ventura said. 
``Thank you, everyone. Let's party Minnesota.'' The inaugural party 
was, in fact, dubbed ``The People's Celebration'' by organizers. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Sanctions Denounced by Saddam  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denounced  
U.N. sanctions Saturday, saying nothing could compare to their 
``mischief and damage.'' His speech marked the eighth anniversary 
of the outbreak of the 1991 Persian Gulf War in which a U.S.-led 
coalition of forces liberated Kuwait from seven months of Iraqi 
occupation. Earlier, about 6,000 people marched through the center 
of the city in a government-organized demonstration against a U.S. 
proposal to remove the cap on Iraqi oil exports. 

</P>
<P>
	Methodist Ministers Wed Lesbians  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Two lesbians who have been together  
for 15 years exchanged promises on Saturday in a ``holy union'' 
ceremony blessed by more than 90 United Methodist ministers. The 
ceremony before more than one-thousand people was held in defiance 
of a church law against same-sex marriages. The blessing could cost 
the ministers their jobs. California voters next year will decide 
whether only marriages between a man and a woman are legal. 

</P>
<P>
	Venezuela Joins Colombian Talks  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President-elect Hugo Chavez of Venezuela traveled  
to Cuba on Saturday for private talks with Fidel Castro and 
Colombian President Andres Pastrana. The talks were expected to 
address attempts to bring peace to Colombia, which has been wracked 
by a 34-year civil conflict. Pastrana, who arrived in Havana for an 
official visit on Thursday, has referred to Chavez's trip to Cuba 
at the same time as ``coincidental.'' But, he has noted that the 
Venezuelan leader had expressed interest in helping end the 
guerrilla war in neighboring Colombia.

<P>
	Guilty Plea Involves Super Bowl  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Robert William Greer agreed to plead  
guilty to murder and go to prison -- but only if he could watch the 
Super Bowl before being sent up. Greer, a Minnesota Vikings fan, 
asked that he be allowed to watch the game at the Tarrant County 
jail -- and then be shipped off the day after. Prosecutors agreed to 
the deal, and Greer was sentenced to serve 18 years. 

</P>
<P>
	Maple Leafs 4, Flyers 3  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Steve Sullivan scored two goals and Derek  
King had the game winner as the Toronto Maple Leafs halted 
Philadelphia's 15-game unbeaten streak with a 4-3 victory over the 
Flyers on tonight. King's goal, his 16th, came after stopping the 
puck that had caromed wide of the net, and firing a slap shot from 
the left circle past John Vanbiesbrouck with 5:19 left in the third 
period. It was the first Flyers' defeat since a 5-4 loss on Dec. 10 
to New Jersey. 

</P>
<P>
	No. 11 St. John's 88, Rutgers 78  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lavor Postell scored 16 of his 21 points in the  
second half and No. 11 St. John's pulled away over the final four 
minutes for an 88-78 victory over Rutgers on tonight. The Red Storm 
(15-3, 6-1 Big East) won for the 12th time in 13 games and for the 
14th straight time at home. Rutgers (10-6, 3-4) lost for the fourth 
time in fifth game.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Wins 100-Meter Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Five-time Olympic champion Jenny  
Thompson broke the women's world 100-meter medley short-course 
record today at a World Cup swim meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson bettered a one-month-old record set by Slovakia's  
Martina Moravcova by two one-hundredths of a second in the 25-meter 
pool at the Sydney International Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson won in 1 minute, 00.41 seconds to set the first world  
record of the two-day meet. Earlier she won the 100-meter freestyle 
earlier, and on Friday took the 100-meter butterfly and 50-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson clocked 53.34 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle to  
beat German Katrin Meissner and Alison Sheppard of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson hinted she was on track to break the long-standing  
world record of 53.01, set in 1993 by China's Le Jingyi, at the 
next World Cup in Hobart beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel very spectacular, but my time was my best time,  
so I was happy with that,'' Thompson said after the 100 freestyle. 
``Maybe in Hobart I'll go faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South African Penny Heyns made it two wins in two races, again  
beating Australia's Samantha Riley to take her second breaststroke 
event at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns won the 50-meter sprint in 31.29 seconds, with Helen  
Denman of Australia second in 31.27, and Riley third in 31.81. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Heyns won the 100-meter breaststroke ahead of Riley.  
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Ian Thorpe won the 200-meter freestyle in 1 minute,  
46.35 seconds, overtaking Italy's Massi Rosolino by a half second 
late in the race. Australia's Grant Hackett was third.

<HEADLINE> Minnie Pearl Auction Draws Faithful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Hundreds of diehard country music fans  
bid on the belongings of the late Minnie Pearl on Saturday, vying 
for mementos of the Grand Ole Opry legend known for her big grin 
and shrill ``Howdeeeee!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of the best,'' Gary Allgood said after paying $350  
for one of Miss Pearl's trademark straw hats, with its wide brim 
and $1.98 price tag dangling from the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Allgood and his wife, Verla, drove 14 hours from Houston for the  
auction. They saw Miss Pearl perform in 1967 at the Grand Ole Opry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just country people. We love country music,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 pieces went on the auction block to settle the  
estate of Minnie Pearl, whose real name was Sarah Cannon. She died 
in 1996 at the age of 83 after more than half a century on the 
Grand Ole Opry and 20 years on the syndicated television show ``Hee 
Haw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Henry Cannon, died one year later. The couple had  
no children. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the items on the auction block were jewelry, furniture  
and knickknacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of history here,'' auctioneer Lester Arutt said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate estimate Saturday on how much money was  
bid at the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Hufnagel, 53, of Goodlettsville, picked up a color  
photograph of Miss Pearl with several other country music stars. He 
once got a hug from Miss Pearl while she signed autographs at her 
store on Music Row. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gave a really nice hug,'' Hufnagel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beth Hall, 51, of Smryna, who saw Miss Pearl perform 31 years  
ago at the Opry, said the auction was an appropriate way to dispose 
of Miss Pearl's belongings, because the fans would treasure them as 
much as any relative could. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnie would be happy about this,'' Hall said. ``Minnie would  
look at this as her last audience. These people wouldn't be here if 
they didn't love her.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Stocks Soar; Currency Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Stock markets responded with  
euphoria to Brazil's decision to let its currency float, the latest 
strategy aimed at lifting Latin America's largest economy out of 
the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil announced Friday it would temporarily stop using its cash  
reserves to prop up its beleaguered currency, the real. Investors 
took this to mean that interest rates would fall and stimulate new 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week alone some billions of dollars left the country and  
I am obliged to defend the real,'' President Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said, explaining his decision in a televised speech on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devaluation will reduce the doubt in relation to our  
economy and create the conditions to lower interest rates,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Brazil's Central Bank announced it would no longer prop up  
the currency, the real plunged as low as 1.60 to the dollar before 
strengthening slightly to 1.43 at the close of trading. That was 
down from 1.32 at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks across the globe headed in the opposite direction,  
however, and the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest 
-- closed up 33.4 percent Friday, all but wiping out the 33.5 
percent it lost in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the devaluation taken into account, the gain in dollar  
terms was nearly cut in half, to 16.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move effectively floated the real -- if only for one day -- a  
more dramatic step after the Central Bank tried a smaller 
devaluation of 8 percent on Wednesday. The bank made that 
devaluation by extending the band in which the currency could trade 
to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank usually enforces the bands by intervening in  
foreign exchange markets to sell its dollar reserves to bolster the 
currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move to calm the waters, Claudio Mauch, the Central  
Bank's director for financial system supervision, said Friday he 
would stay on in his post. His abrupt resignation a day earlier had 
caused further turmoil in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil in August, when investors  
pulled money out in fear that the government couldn't cover a $65 
billion budget deficit and might default on loans. Since then, more 
than $40 billion has left the country, dropping reserves to around 
$35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cheered the Central Bank's move Friday, saying its  
earlier, more controlled devaluation had been smaller than what 
many economists thought necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Controlled devaluations never work when expectations are  
negative,'' said Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank president. 
With Friday's step, ``the government is taking a more realistic 
attitude toward foreign exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the action, analysts say Brazil's troubles aren't over.  
Economists at Bankers' Trust said the devaluation would increase 
the country's deficit, which Brazil has pledged to decrease under 
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	And the government-run Institute of Applied Economic Research  
says inflation is almost certain to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the government agreed to budget reductions in  
exchange for a $41.5 billion aid package put together by the IMF. 
Making those cuts will be harder now because with the devaluation, 
the same tax revenue in reals will mean less in dollar terms. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coleman To Sign With Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- For the second time in three seasons, the  
Charlotte Hornets have balked at paying an eight-figure salary to 
keep a center. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of re-signing Vlade Divac, the Hornets have agreed to  
give free-agent center Derrick Coleman of the Philadelphia 76ers a 
six-year contract that will pay him slightly more than $6 million 
per season, NBA sources told The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman will sign the deal Tuesday, when training camps  
officially open and teams can begin signing players. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac became a free agent after last season but wanted a deal  
worth nearly $11 million annually, a figure the Hornets said would 
use up virtually of their money available under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said they wanted to limit their center's salary to  
about $6 million. Such a move would free them up to target other 
priorities on the team, including renegotiating the contract of 
forward Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice was acquired in a trade with Miami in November 1995, the  
last time Charlotte was unwilling to meet the salary demands of its 
starting center. Alonzo Mourning, who was seeking a deal worth 
about $12 million per year, was sent to the Heat in the 
multi-player trade that brought Rice to Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning played in two NBA All-Star games while with Charlotte,  
but in the case of Divac, the Hornets questioned if it was worth 
their while to spend more than $10 million a year on someone who 
was never an all-star. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, the NBA's rookie of the year in 1991, has averaged 19.2  
points and 10.4 rebounds in his career, which began in New Jersey 
before he went to Philadelphia three seasons ago. He averaged 17.6 
points and 9.9 rebounds this past season. Divac averaged 10.4 
points and 8.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Coleman brings better numbers to the Hornets, his  
reliability has become an issue. Coleman, selected to the 1994 
All-Star game while with New Jersey, has not played more than 60 
games in any of the past four seasons, including just 11 games in 
1995-96. He appeared in 59 games this past season, when his play 
was limited by ankle problems and an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets also had been negotiating with free-agent centers  
Theo Ratliff of Philadelphia and Isaac Austin of the Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte did not attempt to re-sign reserve center Matt Geiger,  
who is close to signing a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, The 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who has played the last three seasons with the Hornets,  
is expected to agree to a six-year deal worth $54 million, the $9 
million per year maximum allowed under the new collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be done as early as Tuesday, but is not certain.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers are still considering acquiring Los Angeles Lakers  
backup center Elden Campbell.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Battles Cross-Dresser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- A male civilian Air Force  
employee who has been wearing a bra, makeup and earrings on the job 
is fighting a mandate forcing him to dress like a man. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Government Employees Local 1897 filed  
a complaint on behalf of the employee after a squadron commander 
ordered him to change his attire. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee, who was not identified in a Northwest Florida  
Daily News story Saturday, said he wants the reprimand removed from 
his file, an apology from the officers who punished him, permission 
to continue dressing as he wishes and $580,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee said that he wears earrings, women's glasses and a  
bra while he works as an airfield management specialist. He said he 
has dressed in much the same way since he started working at 
Eglin's Base Operations Center five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	David Plante, president of the AFGE chapter, said Eglin  
supervisors are trying to establish regulations not allowed by the 
union contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisors first brought up the employee's attire in July 1996,  
according to Air Force records. A civilian supervisor at Eglin 
occasionally has asked him to appear less feminine. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1998, the commander of the 46th Operations Support  
Squadron gave the employee a written reprimand and ordered him to 
stop wearing women's clothing at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Air Force does everything possible to successfully resolve  
a dispute,'' Eglin spokesman Lt. Col. Matt Durham said.

<HEADLINE> Utah Agonizes Over Image-Tarnishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With statehood shimmering on a distant  
horizon, Brigham Young stood before his embattled Mormon followers 
and spoke candidly of bribing federal officials ``to grease the 
wheels.'' Young justified catering to corruption in 1861 to serve a 
higher cause -- protecting the faith's polygamists while gaining 
support for statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, that rationale resonates down the decades as the city  
Young founded on the edge of the Great Basin agonizes over the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something in Mormonism that we're willing to make  
compromises politically to achieve what we want to do, and I can 
see Mormons doing that,'' says Elbert Peck, editor and publisher of 
Sunstone, an independent Mormon periodical. ``I mean, we were 
willing to pay bribes to get statehood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael R. Otterson, the church's director of media relations,  
took strong exception to Peck's statement, saying that ``to infer 
that there is something inherent in our faith that espouses 
anything other than the highest ethical and moral standards is 
irresponsible and blatantly false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four investigations -- by the Justice Department, the city,  
and the national and international Olympic committees -- trying to 
determine if the 2002 Winter Games were bought and sold, Utahns are 
painfully aware their longed-for debut on the global stage has 
taken a doozy of a pratfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of behavior is not according to the standards of  
this community,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt told a national television 
audience last week. ``We revolt at being even associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's sentiments about the still-unfolding scandal are  
shared by many of Utah's more than 2 million inhabitants, 70 
percent of whom, like Leavitt, are members of The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and  
a longtime local church leader, says he feels angry ``because our 
reputation is damaged.'' He feels sad ``that every dream we all had 
of bringing the world to our doorstep and being gracious hosts now 
is at risk, and those dreams have been popped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For an image-conscious faith of 10 million members that has  
58,000 missionaries knocking on doors in 123 countries and 
territories, the seamy headlines are a painful reminder that almost 
everyone outside Utah and its immediate neighbors sees Salt Lake 
City and the Mormon heartland as one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way public opinion and image work, it's not what happened  
so much as what people think happened,'' says Jan Shipps, a noted 
historian of Mormonism. ``And the identity of Salt Lake City with 
the Latter-day Saints and the church means that this is something, 
for better or worse, the church will have to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, the faith's hierarchy and the city's Olympic boosters  
have kept their distance over the years, neither wanting the 2002 
Games to be perceived as the Mormon Olympics. Some see that as a 
charade, since most of the boosters are influential Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses owned by the Mormon church gave $210,938 of the $15  
million raised by Salt Lake's Olympic Bid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret the church has viewed this thing as a  
proselytizing opportunity and opportunity to show that Mormons 
aren't as weird as people think,'' says Stephen Pace, a community 
activist and longtime critic of the Olympics push. 
</P>
<P>
	Church President Gordon B. Hinckley, architect of the church's  
vast public relations network, has labored long to burnish the 
faith's image as a world religion far removed from its peculiar and 
polygamous roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Basking in the enormous success of the church's media-friendly  
150th anniversary reenactment of the Mormon trek to Utah in 1997, 
Hinckley sat for an interview with Shipps, who asked then about the 
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said the church hierarchy was divided over Salt Lake's  
effort to bring the Olympics to town. He declined to disclose his 
own opinion but said once the bid was won the church felt 
``honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City will be on the map for those few days across  
the world,'' he told Shipps. ``This is the headquarters of the 
church and it is going to be a great thing. And it is a great 
opportunity for us and we must seize that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it happened, the scandal broke Nov. 25, just 10 days after  
the church's governing First Presidency told members the church 
supported Utah's Olympic efforts and called attention to the need 
for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the scandal has escalated, the church has had little to say  
beyond a one-paragraph statement that says the affair should be 
addressed by the local and international Olympic organizations and 
the ``various investigative bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes without saying that the church would hope and expect  
that high moral and ethical standards would be applied in any 
aspect of the Salt Lake Olympics,'' the statement says. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Salt Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson, a political scientist  
and Mormon, sees his fellow adherents as ``still a strange 
people,'' with two elements underlying the collective psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``One is sort of holier-than-thou. We believe that we are kind  
of a righteous, holy people,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The other, he says, comes from the Mormons' refugee pioneer  
heritage. After all, it's been only a century since the bitter 
battles with the federal government over polygamy, which the church 
abandoned in 1890, and statehood, which came six years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense of a need for international validation or  
national validation, and I think that's at risk right now,'' Wilson 
says. ``If we fail now because of this big faux pas, I think Utahns 
are going to be very upset and really hurting.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Holds Rare Saturday Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- These days, it takes a rare and momentous  
occasion, such as President Clinton's impeachment trial, for the 
Senate to pull itself together for a Saturday session in the middle 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't always the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Such meetings were common in the 19th century and became rarer  
only after the airplane made it easier for senators to escape the 
capital for weekend trips to their home states. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, the third and final day of presentations by  
House lawmakers making the case for Clinton's removal from office, 
the presence of all senators who could be there was required. 
</P>
<P>
	It could just as well have been a regular weekday session.  
</P>
<P>
	The senators, 98 of the 100, were seated at their mahogany  
desks, wearing business suits and, for the men, ties. Some listened 
intently, arms folded across their chests. Others took copious 
notes or read papers from white binders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
returned home, Inouye to attend a funeral, McCain a memorial 
service, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber was silent except for a few stray coughs, the buzz  
of blown noses, the rustling of papers and the microphone-enhanced 
voices of the House lawmakers speaking from a lectern in the well 
of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pages busied themselves delivering notes and envelopes to the  
senators, along with boxes of tissue and glasses of water as staff 
ushered members of the public into and out of the visitors' 
galleries overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate might meet again next Saturday to continue  
questioning of both parties in the case. And if the Senators 
ultimately decide to hear from witnesses, they could spend many 
more Saturdays in session. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1800s, it was Congress' practice to spend half the year  
in the nation's capital and the other in their home states. The 
time constraints often required Saturday sessions, said Donald 
Ritchie, the Senate's associate historian. 
</P>
<P>
	As late as the 1950s, even when not in session, it was not  
unusual for senators and their staffs to work in their offices on 
Saturdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point came in 1958. The first transcontinental  
airplanes were introduced, and ``for the first time, senators from 
almost any state could go home on weekends, even from California,'' 
Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from members who wanted to spend weekends at  
home, Senate leaders agreed not to schedule votes on Monday 
mornings or Friday afternoons, Ritchie said. The practice has 
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The last really grave issue that forced a Saturday meeting early  
in a congressional year was the question of whether the United 
States should follow through with threats of force to drive Iraq's 
occupying army from Kuwait. The Senate met for nearly nine hours 
Jan. 12, 1991, before voting 52-47 to endorse the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
	Not war but money almost always is the reason for weekend Senate  
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually it's the end of the budget year, and spending bills to  
keep the government functioning must be approved. Senate leaders 
bent on adjourning by a specific date will stretch the regular 
workweek to Saturday, Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of fights over money and the subsequent shutdown of the  
federal government, senators met on one Saturday in November 1995 
and on three consecutive Saturdays the following month. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, President Carter's proposals to handle the  
energy crisis prompted a marathon Senate session that began on 
Saturday, Oct. 14, 1978, and ended when lawmakers recessed at 7:16 
p.m. on Oct. 15.

<HEADLINE> How the Jets and Broncos Match Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Matchups for Sunday's AFC title game between the 	
New York Jets and Denver Broncos:	
</P>
<P>
                      *WHEN THE JETS HAVE THE BALL 	
</P>
<P>
	Just as they did against Jacksonville, the Jets want to control  
the clock and keep Denver's potent offense off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Curtis Martin (28), who had 36 carries vs. the  
Jaguars, will be busy again, particularly if the game is close. 
Martin has power and speed, although he isn't quite in the class of 
Terrell Davis (30). Martin also is dangerous on screen passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde (16) led the AFC in passing and has been  
protected well by a surprisingly solid, mistake-free line led by 
center Kevin Mawae (68), rookie tackle Jason Fabini (69) and 
veteran tackle Jumbo Elliott (76). The line will be tested by 
Denver's Trevor Pryce (93) and Maa Tanuvasa (98) up front -- both 
had 8.5 sacks -- and zone blitzes featuring linebackers Bill 
Romanowski (53), Glenn Cadrez (59), a former Jet, and John Mobley 
(51). 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde has displayed poise and a surprising nimbleness when  
forced out of the pocket. He rarely forces his throws, which was a 
past problem, and has many weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyshawn Johnson (19) has become an all-purpose threat at  
wideout, running every kind of route, catching high, low and 
in-between passes, blocking and handling end-arounds. He matches up 
well with Denver defensive backs, who might struggle with his size 
(6-foot-3, 212). Only safety Steve Atwater (27) is comparable, and 
he doesn't have the speed to stay with Johnson. Backup cornerback 
Tory James (20), who is 6-1 and 195, might see more action. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Chrebet (80) also runs every type of pattern and is most  
dangerous on third downs out of the slot. If Johnson consistently 
draws double-teams, Chrebet or speedy Dedric Ward (89) could become 
major factors. Denver does not have a strong secondary, although 
cornerbacks Ray Crockett (39) and Darrien Gordon (21) are 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Kyle Brady (88) has been an effective blocker and is  
vastly improved as a receiver. But he dropped two passes last 
Sunday against Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Two veterans who might make a difference are fullback Keith  
Byars (41), a steady blocker and fine receiver, and David Meggett 
(22), who has been most effective as a pass-catcher. 
</P>
<P>
                    *WHEN THE BRONCOS HAVE THE BALL   	
</P>
<P>
	Davis is the most formidable offensive weapon in football. He  
proved that once again with 199 yards rushing and two TDs against 
Miami last Saturday. Not only is he a 2,000-yard runner with power, 
speed, moves and moxie, but Davis is a first-rate receiver who 
averaged 8.7 yards a catch during his MVP season. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's favor is its strong group of linebackers, led by  
All-Pro Mo Lewis (57) and Bryan Cox (51). Both are versatile and 
will draw much of Davis' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis has faced many excellent linebackers this year,  
including All-Pro Zach Thomas last Saturday, and still been a 
dominant performer. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's line is one of the league's best, even without  
perennial Pro Bowl tackle Gary Zimmerman, who retired before the 
season. Center Tom Nalen (66) is just as good as Mawae and will 
work against a pair of overachieving tackles, Ernie Logan (93) and 
Jason Ferguson (72), most of the time. Guard Mark Schlereth (69) 
and tackle Tony Jones (77) are formidable veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets will attempt to confuse the Broncos with their  
defensive schemes, but John Elway (7) has seen everything -- and 
generally dealt with everything -- in his superb career. Elway 
showed he still can scramble against Miami, but look for him to 
work medium-range to All-Pro tight end Shannon Sharpe (88) and 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most intriguing matchup is Pro Bowl WR Ed McCaffrey  
(87) and fellow receiver Rod Smith (80) against cornerbacks Aaron 
Glenn (31), Otis Smith (45) and Ray Mickens (24). Glenn, a Pro 
Bowler, returned last Sunday from a sprained ankle, but is not 100 
percent, which means Mickens might move over from the slot. 
Regardless, Denver will try to get R. Smith deep against O. Smith, 
who had a good year, but was beaten for two scores by Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver scored an AFC-high 501 points and has moved the ball at  
home against everyone. Elway's skill at reading defenses and the 
line's ability to pick up stunts and blitzes provide the Broncos 
with a solid edge. 
</P>
<P>
                           *SPECIAL TEAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Jets had one of the top three special teams in  
the league. Not now. They've been vulnerable to runbacks, 
particularly on punt returns, where opponents have a 3-yard edge. 
Jacksonville broke an 88-yard kickoff return last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	While returners Meggett, Kevin Williams (23) and Ward haven't  
been big-time threats -- the Jets miss injured Leon Johnson, even 
though he was inconsistent this season -- placekicker John Hall (9) 
has gotten steadier. He nailed a 52-yarder last Sunday and his 
kickoffs generally get to the end zone. Hall has overcome much of 
close-range problems this year. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kidd (17), New York's third punter of 1998, was the best of  
the lot, but nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rouen (16) is one of football's best punters and Denver's  
coverage has been good. Gordon always ranks among the league's top 
punt returners, and Vaughn Hebron (22) was third in the AFC with a 
26.4 kickoff return average. Hebron returned a kickoff 95 yards for 
a touchdown this season, Denver's first kickoff return for a score 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Elam (1) made the Pro Bowl after another terrific year. He  
tied Tom Dempsey's record with a 63-yard field goal and scored 127 
points (23-for-27 on FGs, 58-for-58 on PATs). His deep kickoffs 
aided a solid coverage unit. 
</P>
<P>
                             *COACHING   	
</P>
<P>
	A wash.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells has been to three Super Bowls and won two, and his  
work in turning around one of NFL's worst franchises has been 
remarkable. His staff, led by defensive coordinator Bill Belichick 
and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, favors aggressive, 
innovative schemes that make the best use of New York's personnel. 
Parcells also knows how to challenge his players and how to keep 
them at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Mike Shanahan, who did a wonderful job taking the  
Broncos from wild card to NFL champion last season, then not 
allowing them to lose focus in 1998. The fact they couldn't go 
undefeated became insignificant when they righted themselves the 
last two weeks. Shanahan is just as inventive as his Jets 
counterparts and won't panic. Plus, he has the better team. 
</P>
<P>
                           *INTANGIBLES   	
</P>
<P>
	While Parcells and his coaches have been this route before, and  
he has 19 players with previous playoff experience, these Jets 
haven't been to a title game together. They made some errors 
against Jacksonville that would be more costly against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York also won some big road games and such key players  
as Testaverde, Martin, Byars, Cox, Pepper Johnson and Elliott are 
pressure-tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Broncos have been through every challenge -- and  
conquered them -- in the last two years. They haven't lost at home 
since the 1996 playoffs. The environment at Mile High Stadium can 
only help them. 
</P>
<P>
	If it comes down to talent, location and recent history, Denver  
has the edge. But if it's a matter of destiny ... .

<HEADLINE> U S West, Olympics Back Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Things got better Saturday for the  
beleaguered Salt Lake Organizing Committee -- better by $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the amount of a check U S West president Sol Trujillo  
handed to SLOC chairman Robert Garff. It had been held up amid the 
scandal over Salt Lake Olympic boosters' lavish wooing of 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	And, from Switzerland, president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the  
IOC might step in to help the 2002 Winter Games cope with any 
financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps, Samaranch indicated  
some flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We signed a contract, and each partner should in principle  
abide by that,'' he said. ``It depends on what help Salt Lake City 
wants. We will find a solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told the newspaper that the IOC executive board  
probably will decide next week to ban member visits to cities 
bidding for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo, flanked by Gov. Mike Leavitt and Garff at a press  
conference, said he was impressed with Salt Lake's efforts to get 
to the bottom of corruption, expose it and get on with the business 
of staging the games. 
</P>

	``We're investing significant dollars and we expect to have the  
kinds of results associated with the sponsorship,'' Trujillo said. 
``There has been candor and forthrightness. I believe this state is 
stepping up to the values and principles of the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, U S West said it was withholding a $5  
million payment -- part of the company's $60 million cash and inkind 
services commitment -- until it had assurances the scandal would not 
interfere with the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC's two top executives resigned Jan. 8, two others were  
put on administrative leave and the man who led the bid effort, Tom 
Welch, was stripped of his consulting contract and pension. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Garff beamed as he held the check, made out to  
Olympic Properties of the United States, the joint venture of the 
SLOC and the United States Olympic Company to raise sponsorship 
revenue for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a welcome sight?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is symbolic of what will happen when integrity is  
restored to the games,'' Garff said. ``It's symbolic in every way 
of the good times ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said he remains confident the 2002 Winter Games will raise  
all the money it needs from sponsors. It already has commitments 
for 75 percent of the $1.4 billion budget. Another $250 million 
must yet be raised from sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said Saturday that he has had calls from many  
existing sponsors, and they are sticking with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not explicitly agreed to help Salt Lake if  
sponsors shy away, Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense they are prepared to do so,'' he said. ``They share  
responsibility in this. It's appropriate that they do (help).'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of U S West make it very clear we're moving one  
direction -- forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't know when an independent SLOC ethics panel  
will finish its investigation, but ``the truth will be put on the 
table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make it very clear what happened with full detail,''  
Leavitt said. ``All our knowledge will be disclosed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel is conducting one of four investigations. The  
others are by the IOC, USOC and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In the newspaper interview Saturday, Samaranch reiterated that  
he believed that a smaller committee -- and not the full IOC 
membership -- should be responsible for awarding the games in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has tried to change its voting system,'' he said.  
``But it's very difficult to convince members to give up their 
rights. We're now going to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is awaiting the decisions of Jan. 24. If we prove  
then that we are determined to clean up, then the worst of the 
crisis will be over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any changes in the system would be in place before the selection  
in June of the 2006 Winter Games site. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday  
that he has written to 13 members implicated in its inquiry into 
cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and other favors 
accepted during the course of Salt Lake City's successful bid for 
the 2002 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine risk expulsion and four face lesser sanctions, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- FBI investigators have approached several escort services  
seeking information about whether Salt Lake bid boosters bought 
prostitutes for IOC members, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Salt 
Lake attorney Gerald Mooney said the escort services he represents 
are refusing to release records unless compelled by law to do so. 
Such services are legal in Utah if properly registered as a 
sexually oriented business, and many advertise as dating services. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador Andrew  
Young told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution there was no bribery 
involved in Atlanta's Olympic bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
Humanitarianism, not bribery, motivated Atlanta's assistance to 
Third World athletes and Olympic officials before and after the 
1996 Games, Young told the newspaper for Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely no money changed hands,'' he said of Atlanta's  
winning bid. ``We raised money, we raised it openly, we discussed 
it publicly. It's inconceivable to me that Atlanta (dealings), 
prior to the bid, could be conceived as a bribe to get the 
Olympics,'' he said in Saturday's editions of the newspaper.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Things got better Saturday for the  
beleaguered Salt Lake Organizing Committee -- better by $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the amount of a check U S West president Sol Trujillo  
handed to SLOC chairman Robert Garff. It had been held up amid the 
scandal over Salt Lake Olympic boosters' lavish wooing of 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	And, from Switzerland, president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the  
IOC might step in to help the 2002 Winter Games cope with any 
financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps, Samaranch indicated  
some flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We signed a contract, and each partner should in principle  
abide by that,'' he said. ``It depends on what help Salt Lake City 
wants. We will find a solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told the newspaper that the IOC executive board  
probably will decide next week to ban member visits to cities 
bidding for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo, flanked by Gov. Mike Leavitt and Garff at a press  
conference, said he was impressed with Salt Lake's efforts to get 
to the bottom of corruption, expose it and get on with the business 
of staging the games.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Crisis Began a Year Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year ago this weekend, President Clinton  
rode in his limousine to his lawyer's offices in downtown 
Washington and spent close to six hours answering questions about 
events stretching back to his days as governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	That weekend changed everything. Most Americans -- Clinton among  
them -- were unaware of events that had been set in motion that 
would embarrass him before the world and put him on trial before 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's press secretary had shrugged off the sexual harassment  
lawsuit brought by former Arkansas state worker Paula Jones as ``a 
distraction but ... not a burdensome distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would soon know just how distracting, and how  
burdensome, this matter would become. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday newspapers reported on the president's testimony. The  
Associated Press said Clinton had been given ``the inglorious 
distinction of the first American president to testify as a 
defendant in any criminal or civil suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going in, he had been unaware he would be confronted by  
questions about a former intern, a pert young woman from 
California, Monica Lewinsky. Leaving, he had to know that his life 
had taken a fateful twist. 
</P>
<P>
	How it unfolded:  
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Jan. 16: Tipped off by Pentagon worker Linda Tripp and  
her secret tape recordings, Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr 
gets permission to make a federal case of the president's affair 
and alleged cover-up. Starr's agents act quickly, knowing that 
Newsweek magazine is working on a story that could tip their hand. 
</P>
<P>
	They confront Ms. Lewinsky as she arrives in the vast, airy food  
court of a local mall for lunch with her friend, Mrs. Tripp. They 
take her to a ritzy hotel room, where prosecutors pressed the 
tearful 24-year-old until almost midnight, urging her to help prove 
the president was obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mrs. Tripp shares her information about the affair  
with Paula Jones' attorneys on the eve of the long-awaited 
presidential deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, Jan. 17: Unaware of Starr's actions, Clinton arrives  
to testify, and is caught off guard by numerous, detailed questions 
about Ms. Lewinsky. He stammers and hesitates. Under oath, he 
denies that they had ``sexual relations'' and says he doesn't 
remember being alone with her. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the presidential limousine headed back to the White  
House at 4:20 p.m., ``He knew that someone was talking,'' said 
David Schippers, chief Republican investigator on the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, much of Washington knew it, too -- thanks to a  
then-obscure Internet site known as the Drudge Report, which said 
Newsweek was sitting on a blockbuster story about the president's 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was no longer a popular president settling comfortably  
into his second term, tinkering with his legacy for the history 
books. He was a president in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, on Wednesday morning, Jan. 21, newspapers and  
TV broadcasts brought the nation the story that would dominate the 
news in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	January: Pundits boldly predict Clinton will resign within days.  
With the first lady standing by his side, the embattled president 
jabs his finger at a cluster of reporters and TV cameras and 
declares, ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss 
Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	March: Another woman tells her story. In an interview on CBS'  
``60 Minutes,'' former White House aide Kathleen Willey says 
Clinton made a sexual advance inside the Oval Office suite in 1993 
when she came to him at a moment of personal crisis, seeking a job. 
</P>
<P>
	April: A federal judge dismisses the Jones lawsuit. Mrs. Jones  
appeals, and Clinton eventually will settle the suit out of court 
for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	July: After months of stalemate, Ms. Lewinsky agrees to  
cooperate with Starr in exchange for immunity from prosecution. She 
turns over a critical piece of evidence: a dress stained during an 
intimate encounter with the president. And after eight days of 
grand jury testimony Mrs. Tripp, who secretly tape-recorded her 
friend's conversations that disclosed the affair and alleged 
cover-up, emerges from the courthouse and tells Americans, ``I'm 
just like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	August: Ms. Lewinsky breaks her silence before Starr's grand  
jury. Clinton follows on Aug. 17, testifying by videotape from the 
White House. For the first time, he admits ``inappropriate intimate 
contact.'' But other statements during his testimony will later be 
condemned as perjury by the House. Clinton goes on national 
television to acknowledge an inappropriate relationship that was 
``a personal failure on my part.'' The White House backdrop for his 
speech is carefully arranged by a Hollywood producer. 
</P>
<P>
	September: Starr sends the House of Representatives a report  
alleging ``substantial and credible information ... that may 
constitute grounds for impeachment.'' The House posts the report, 
including its details of the presidential sex life, on the 
Internet. Bookstores sell out of copies of the report. Its tawdry 
details become fodder for late-night comedians. Amid dire 
predictions from the pundits, the four-hour videotape of the 
president's grand jury testimony is televised nationally. Yet, 
Clinton's poll numbers go up. 
</P>
<P>
	October: The House votes 258-176 on Oct. 8 to open an  
impeachment inquiry. Merchants say the most popular Halloween 
costumes are Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton masks. 
</P>
<P>
	November: Democrats pick up five House seats, a blow to  
Republicans who believed the election would increase their 
majority. Exit polls show almost two-thirds of voters don't want 
Clinton impeached. White House aides speculate that the momentum 
toward impeachment has faltered. Democrats attack Starr's tactics 
at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. But Republicans are furious 
over Clinton's evasive responses to their 81 questions about his 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	December: The House Judiciary Committee approves four articles  
of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury, obstruction of justice 
and abuse of power. Republican House leaders block Democratic 
efforts to schedule an alternative vote on censure. On the eve of 
the House debate on the impeachment articles, Clinton orders air 
strikes on Iraq. Some Republicans cry foul, but the vote is 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1868, the House votes Dec. 19 mostly  
along party lines to impeach Clinton on two articles alleging 
perjury before the grand jury and obstruction of justice in the 
Jones case.

<HEADLINE> Epic Honor Wins Golden Date Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- Epic Honor ran down entrymate Blue Tune in  
the stretch and then pulled away in a driving finish to win 
Saturday's $150,000 Golden Gate Derby by a length and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Jeff Bonde and ridden by Lonnie Meche, Epic Honor  
came off a six-week layoff to earn the $90,000 first prize while 
covering the 1 1-16 miles in 1:43.58. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, the colt stamped himself as one of Northern  
California's top 3-year olds by winning the early test for aspiring 
Triple Crown candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The colt had some hard races so we backed off him,'' said  
Bonde, whose entry finished 1-2 in the eight-horse field. ``But the 
time off did him good. He's been training really nicely and today 
he showed he can come back from a break and do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Tune, ridden by Russell Baze, had forced the pace with  
Absolute Harmony and went in front at the top of the stretch, only 
to be worn down by his stablemate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse ran a great race,'' Baze said. ``He didn't switch  
leads again down the lane and that made a little difference. A 
horse gets a little tired racing on his left lead all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonde said both Epic Honor and Blue Tune may run in the El  
Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows on March 6, the next major 
Kentucky Derby prep race in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely the biggest win I've ever had,'' said  
Bonde, who has been training in the area for 25 years. ``Both of my 
horses ran well today and as a trainer, that's all you can ask for. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in defeat, I'm happy with Blue Tune but he's going to  
have to change leads to get to the next level. Epic Honor finished 
with a lot of enthusiasm and that's what it's going to take to 
compete in the races down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long shot Brave Gun rallied to take third. The odds-on entry of  
Absolute Harmony and Voice of Destiny, who between them had won 
their last five races, finished out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't fire at all,'' said Adalberto Lopez, Absolute  
Harmony's rider. ``He never felt comfortable and didn't relax. It 
was just one of those days. Nothing went right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voice of Destiny, who won three straight races, including the  
California Juvenile at Bay Meadows on Nov. 14, was coming off a 
two-month layoff due to a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time off may have affected him,'' said his rider, Rafael  
Meza. ``He gave me a little run and then started struggling. You 
have to throw away this race. His attitude wasn't quite the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Epic Honor and Blue Tune coupled in the wagering, the entry  
returned $9 to win, $9.60 to place and $5.40 to show. Brave Gun 
returned $13.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Fugitives Caught at Mexican Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two men wanted in a bank robbery and the  
shootings of a Louisiana car salesman and Iowa police chief were 
apprehended by U.S. Customs agents at the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Taylor and Michael Taylor, both 20 and unrelated, were  
detained Friday when they tried to re-enter the United States after 
being turned back from Mexico because they did not have proper 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of killing the salesman Jan. 7 in  
Shreveport, La., robbing a bank in Lamoni in southern Iowa the next 
day and shooting Lamoni police Chief Dale Killpack in the eye as he 
chased them. 
</P>
<P>
	Killpack is recovering from surgery to remove his right eye.  
</P>
<P>
	The two were denied bond during a hearing in front of a judge  
Saturday and remained at a Laredo jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials said Timothy Taylor had $87,898 in a backpack  
he carried while Michael Taylor had $38,496 in his pants pockets. 
Agents also confiscated a knife and two samurai swords. 
</P>
<P>
	Car salesman Chester Howell, 56, was shot and left to die while  
taking the Taylors on a test drive, police said. Mary Howell said 
she hopes to get answers about her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really want to know, and I'll probably get a  
nonsensical answer, is why they felt they had to kill him,'' she 
said. ``There were other people who could identify them. He would 
have said, `Take the car and go.' To kill him for a $2,500 car -- 
pointless.''

<HEADLINE> Lafayette To Keep Football Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- Lafayette College's board of trustees voted  
Saturday to save the school's 116-year-old football program, remain 
in Division I, and keep its Patriot League affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees were considering several options to make Lafayette  
sports more competitive, including dropping football or moving to 
Division III. Either option could have ended the nation's oldest 
college football rivalry between Lafayette and Lehigh, which have 
played 134 times since 1884. 
</P>
<P>
	The college will keep all 23 of its varsity sports and undertake  
a fund-raising effort in support of its athletic programs, the 
trustees decided in a special vote in New York that concluded a 
three-month study of the college's sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
	More fundraising is needed for the school to compete, said board  
of trustees chairman Lawrence Ramer. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees also reaffirmed Lafayette's policy of providing  
financial aid to student-athletes based solely on need. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette trustees authorized a study of the college's athletic  
program last October after the athletic department expressed 
concern that more money was needed to maintain the teams. Only five 
of Lafayette's 23 varsity teams had winning records last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic department recommended dropping four varsity  
sports. A faculty committee favored dropping to a lower division 
but said, ``If a varsity sport needs to be sacrificed to support 
other varsity programs, the logical choice is football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette, one of the smallest Division I schools with only  
2,200 students, spends more per student on its varsity programs 
than any of its Patriot League competitors. But most of its 
athletic funding comes from tuition, and it can't keep up with the 
overall spending of other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	College president Arthur Rothkopf received hundreds of letters  
from alumni, students and parents after suggesting the review last 
fall.

<HEADLINE> Statement by White House Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of White House Special Counsel Gregory Craig's statement  
following the House managers' presentation during the Senate 
impeachment trial of President Clinton, as transcribed by Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House Republican prosecutors have the constitutional  
burden to prove their case that the president of the United States 
should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	After three uninterrupted days of presenting that case, they  
have failed to meet their burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, nothing in any of the presentations, nothing in the  
five-volume, 60,000 page record, nothing in the testimony of at 
least 100 witnesses has proven their case. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republicans' case ends as it began, an  
unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the 
constitutional standard to remove the president from office. That 
standard is clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike federal judges, who are appointed for life and who serve  
during good behavior, our president is elected by all the people 
and should only be removed for the most grave offenses against the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple truth is that the House Republican prosecutors failed  
to demonstrate that the will and interest of the American people 
would be served by nullifying the results of a national election. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, on behalf of the president, we will present a strong,  
vigorous defense based on the facts, the law and the Constitution. 
And we look forward to the day when all of us can return to the 
important business of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.

<HEADLINE> Hyde: Presidency Could Be Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a final flourish, House prosecutors  
demanded President Clinton's removal from office Saturday, telling 
a hushed audience of senators that otherwise the presidency itself 
may be ``deeply and perhaps permanently damaged.'' Senate leaders 
sparred over the issue of witnesses at the historic impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morally serious men and women can imagine circumstances at the  
far edge of the morally permissible'' in which a president could 
shade the truth for the good of the nation, said white-haired Rep. 
Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor summing up three days of opening 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``But under oath, for a private pleasure?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a question that cut to the core of the case, allegations  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in an attempt 
to conceal his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Hyde concluded the prosecution's presentation,  
Clinton attorney Gregory Craig said the president's legal team 
would be ready with a ``strong vigorous defense, based on the 
facts, the law and the Constitution'' when the trial resumes on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate officials estimate that 1,500 people have stood in line  
each day to witness a few minutes of the drama. The trial, with 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, is the first such 
presidential impeachment proceeding since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde addressed the trial and a nationwide television audience as  
Clinton labored over a speech of a different variety -- the State of 
the Union address he will deliver next Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the three-day presentation by the House Republicans,  
there was little, if any, evidence that Clinton's Democratic 
support had eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the current record, they (House prosecutors) are not  
going to win this trial,'' said Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli 
of New Jersey. ``They need somebody to come before the Senate and 
give unexpected testimony or to commit a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one Republican, Vermont Sen. James Jeffords, sounded  
skeptical of the case. ``If you say lying about a non-crime (an 
affair) can be converted into a high crime by the way you handle 
it, that sets a pretty low standard for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds votes to convict a president and remove  
him from office. Republicans hold a 55-45 majority, so even if all 
GOP senators vote against Clinton, a dozen Democratic votes would 
be required to strip the nation's 42nd president of his powerful 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the House wrapped up its case, the Senate's  
Democratic and Republican leaders were maneuvering for advantage on 
the witness issue, which threatened an outbreak of partisan 
hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott released a letter he had dispatched  
to the Democratic leader on Friday night, suggesting creation of a 
bipartisan group of senators that could ``save us time and trouble 
in the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott added that he knew the White House had been in contact with  
the Democrats, and he added it would be proper if he joined in any 
future conversations with the president's team. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle declined the  
invitation for a bipartisan group. ``It is my hope that such 
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican favor granting the House's request to call  
witnesses; many -- but not all -- Democrats oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	That issue won't be settled for at least another week, although  
many Republicans and Democrats say they expect the GOP to insist, 
at a minimum, on depositions of such possible witnesses as Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	It fell to Hyde, known in the House for his flashes of  
eloquence, to close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us have been called Clinton haters,'' he said. ``This  
is not a question of who we hate, this is a question of what we 
love ... the rule of law, equal justice before the law and honor in 
our public life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican noted proposed resolutions of censure  
that would sharply criticize Clinton for violating the people's 
trust. And he said if senators believed such allegations and yet 
voted to acquit the chief executive, ``the office of the presidency 
has been deeply, and perhaps permanently, damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By his actions, Hyde said, Clinton had ``broken his covenant of  
trust with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must never tolerate one law for the ruler and another for  
the ruled, he said. ``If we do, we break faith with our ancestors 
from Bunker Hill, Lexington and Concord to ... Desert Storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans were scathing, folksy and serious by turn as  
they wrapped up their case. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., derided Clinton for mounting a  
``so-what'' defense against the charges. ``The facts are stubborn. 
President Clinton lied, under oath. President Clinton committed 
perjury, repeatedly, willfully, premeditatedly. President Clinton 
obstructed justice, by tampering with evidence and witnesses,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unlike most House  
prosecutors, paced the area behind the podium, speaking in a soft 
Southern drawl. ``I'll try to get you out so we can all have some 
lunch,'' he said in one momentary aside. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Charles Canady of Florida said the Senate should not  
allow a president who has ``made himself a notorious example of 
lawlessness to remain in office.''

	Prosecutors To Wrap Up Opening Phase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton  
resumes at 10 a.m. EST today with House prosecutors expected to 
wrap up their opening arguments. The lead prosecutor, House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is expected to 
deliver a summation. Prosecutors are trying to show that lying 
under oath and obstruction of justice, the crimes of which Clinton 
is accused, meet the Constitution's ``high crimes and 
misdemeanors'' standard for removal. Clinton's lawyers, who cannot 
interrupt the House presentation, sat quietly during the arguments, 
waiting for their turn next Tuesday. 

</P>

	Northeast, Midwest Seek Thaw  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Many in the Northeast and Midwest are hoping  
for a thaw today after winter storms lashed the region Thursday and 
yesterday with every permutation of precipitation -- snow, sleet, 
rain and ice. Roofs, especially, were starting to feel the strain 
after nearly 3 feet of snow piled up in some places. Temperatures 
in the region were expected to rise into the 40s and possibly 50s 
today and stay there through Tuesday, the National Weather Service 
said. 

</P>
<P>
	Power Outage Disrupts Flights  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A power outage at the Federal Aviation  
Administration's regional air traffic control center disrupted air 
travel throughout the Northwest and delayed flights for about 8,000 
passengers. The outage and the failure of a backup generator lasted 
about 35 minutes yesterday when controllers lost radar and radio 
communications. The FAA halted all plane departures in the region 
until the problem was fixed, which delayed more than 8,000 
passengers, some for several hours. No safety problems were 
reported, officials said.

	Dozens Found Massacred in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bodies of dozens of men were found  
scattered on a hillside and in ravines in southern Kosovo today, 
many of them mutilated, the day after a fierce attack by Serb 
forces on ethnic Albanian villages. Reporters counted at least 35 
bodies. Reporters and international verifiers were prevented on 
Friday from reaching the besieged area around the village of Racak, 
where the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels said at least 46 were 
killed, including eight guerrillas. Some had their eyes gouged out 
or heads smashed in, and one man lay decapitated in the courtyard 
of his compound. All wore civilian clothing, and many were older 
men. Verifiers said many had been shot at close range.

	Philip Morris Starts Farmers' Fund  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Philip Morris will contribute $300 million  
to a trust fund to help tobacco farmers offset losses stemming from 
a declining demand for their product. In a letter obtained 
yesterday by The Associated Press, the company said it would put 
the money into the fund regardless of whether other tobacco 
companies decide to participate. Philip Morris would make 
additional payments over the next nine years if the three other 
companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard -- 
decide to contribute. Eventually, the fund could grow to $5.15 
billion.

	U.N. Makes Little Progress on Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council has made little  
progress on Iraq and may be more divided than ever after a week of 
discussing whether to resume weapons inspections. Council members 
say they are pleased and even encouraged that they are finally 
discussing Iraq and have proposals in hand a month after the 
U.S.-British airstrikes ended U.N. oversight of Baghdad's weapons 
programs. The key question is whether to abandon efforts to disarm 
Iraq or keep trying in the face of Baghdad's decision to never 
again allow U.N. weapons inspections. France and Russia subscribe 
to the former, but the United States and Britain insist that the 
council follow resolutions requiring inspectors to certify that 
Iraq has destroyed all its banned weapons.

	Orioles' Angelos Arrives in Cuba  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A delegation that included Baltimore Orioles owner  
Peter Angelos arrived last night for weekend meetings with 
officials to work out the rules for possible exhibition games in 
Baltimore and Cuba. ``We appreciate the hospitality of the Cuban 
government and our own government's support of the two games,'' 
Angelos said. President Clinton announced he would let the Orioles 
play a Cuban team as part of a plan to increase relations between 
the countries while maintaining the U.S. economic embargo.

	Tyson Returns to Ring  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Nineteen months after he bit a chunk off  
Evander Holyfield's ears, Mike Tyson returns to the ring. Tyson 
begins his second comeback from an enforced ring absence when he 
meets Francois Botha in a scheduled 10-round fight tonight. The 
32-year-old Tyson, who weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds is a 6-1 
favorite against Botha, who briefly held the IBF title and has lost 
once in his career. Botha has 24 knockouts, but is not known for 
his punching power. He holds a size advantage of about three inches 
over Tyson and outweighs him by 10 pounds.

<HEADLINE>  Pak Signs 3-Year Contract With IMG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Maybe now Se Ri Pak will be able to  
concentrate only on golf. 
</P>
<P>
	After a sensational season on the course and a muddled situation  
outside the ropes, Pak signed a contract with International 
Management Group, the same agency that represents Tiger Woods, 
David Duval and Annika Sorenstam. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was signed Thursday night over dinner. Pak had been  
scheduled to hear a last-ditch offer from Cornerstone Sports, but 
signed with IMG before the latter meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG declined comment, but the deal was confirmed Friday by  
family adviser Yeong Shin by Samsung, Pak's corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``IMG will handle everything,'' said Shin, as he and her father,  
Jun-Chul Pak, watched her struggle to a 2-over 74 in the first 
round of the HealthSouth Inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, who became the youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open and  
the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors, had been shopping 
for a management firm since last month, when Samsung agreed to give 
up management of the South Korean star. 
</P>
<P>
	Shin said he expects endorsement contracts to follow shortly.  
Pak has played the Callaway Big Bertha irons and the Maxfli 
Revolution ball, although she did not have deals with any other 
company except Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samsung will still be primary sponsor,'' Shin said. ``She will  
still have Samsung on the hat and Astra on the shirt. But IMG will 
negotiate with Callaway and for other equipment endorsements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the systematic and scientific management through IMG  
will help Pak remain a top-notch player,'' Samsung spokesman Ahn 
Ho-moon said from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will split 30 percent of the profits with Samsung. Pak will  
receive the remaining 70 percent, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung, the Korean electronics magnate, signed Pak to a 10-year  
contract in 1996, then sent her to the United States to work with 
swing coach David Leadbetter. 
</P>
<P>
	She tied for first in the LPGA qualifying school, then  
challenged Sorenstam as the top player in the world with the most 
remarkable rookie season on the LPGA Tour since Nancy Lopez in 
1978. She was voted AP Female Athlete of the Year, and was voted 
player of the year by the Golf Writers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with winning the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff and the  
LPGA Championship, Pak won two other tournaments -- all in a 10-week 
stretch -- and set two scoring records in one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But off the course, her life was far from smooth.  
</P>
<P>
	Leadbetter said she was playing too much. Pak played six  
straight tournaments on two occasions late in the year and 
complained of a sore shoulder and fatigue. She also was 
hospitalized for fatigue during her celebrated homecoming to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	When the season ended, Pak fired manager Steven Kil, rehired him  
and fired him again -- all within two weeks. She also ditched 
Leadbetter, decided to go back to him, then received notice that he 
was leaving her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find very strong people to take care of everything --  
interviews, schedule, practice and time for me to relax,'' Pak said 
recently.

<HEADLINE> Elway Legacy: Mile High Memories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- His 16-year journey got off to a bad start when he  
was labeled a spoiled brat for refusing to play for the team that 
drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
	The spurned team owner proclaimed, ``John Elway will never be  
any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Irsay of the Colts got it all wrong, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway went on to become one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	He will leave the game -- possibly Sunday after the AFC  
championship -- with a decidedly different reputation than the one 
Irsay imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is respected, even revered. He is treated in his adopted  
home of Denver as if he were a demigod. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway is Denver's Moses,'' said Broncos tight end Shannon  
Sharpe. ``He has led Denver out of obscurity and into the land of 
milk and money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, after four months of pondering his future, Elway said  
he intended to play just one more season. But since then there has 
been no talk of retirement or going-away presents or goodbye tours, 
which is just the way Elway wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day Michael Jordan retired, Elway was asked what it's  
like to go out on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter when he went out,'' Elway said, ``he was going out  
on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for the 38-year-old blond gunslinger with  
the John Wayne walk and the knack for late-game heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	A season after finally winning his Super Bowl ring, Elway has  
his Broncos back in the AFC title game, this time against the 
upstart New York Jets. He's within one victory of his fifth Super 
Bowl appearance, and another championship would be a fitting end to 
his Jordanesque career. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game Sunday could be his last, and most likely will be  
his farewell to Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even thinking about that,'' he said. ``I don't want to  
take the focus off what we're doing, and that's to win the football 
game. I'm not even letting that enter my mind, what I'm doing next 
year. This is what I came back for. So I'm going to enjoy it now 
and then cross that bridge when the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is more important than that right now to me. I'll get  
plenty of time to make that decision in the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Elway has already made a firm decision, he hasn't told his  
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard him discuss it,'' running back Terrell Davis  
said. ``If it is his last season, I don't think we're going to find 
out about it until after the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, everyone will probably be reminiscing about Elway's  
extraordinary career. 
</P>
<P>
	His 148 victories as a starter are the most in NFL history, and  
he and Dan Marino are the only quarterbacks who have thrown for 
more than 50,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those passes came at Mile High, of course, where Elway  
has created countless magic moments. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite comebacks was the desperation drive that  
included two successful fourth-down plays in the closing minutes of 
a 26-24 divisional playoff win over Houston in January 1992. 
Another was the 20-19 victory over Kansas City the following season 
when he threw two touchdown passes in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also fondly recalls that in his rookie season in 1983 he  
threw three touchdown passes in the fourth quarter in a 21-16 
victory over Baltimore, the team he rejected after it selected him 
with the No. 1 overall draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Elway and Mile High victories have become almost  
synonymous. Including postseason, his career record as a starter at 
home is an amazing 102-25 (.803). 
</P>
<P>
	Ask his teammates about their favorite Elway moments, and they  
quickly come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely that fourth-and-6 pass against Houston here, when  
he avoids a sack and throws that great pass to Vance Johnson,'' 
said safety Tyrone Braxton, who has played with Elway for 11 
seasons. ``I was on the sideline thinking how unbelievable a play 
that was. I was like, `Wow.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Tom Nalen said he will always remember last season's  
``helicopter play in the Super Bowl, when Elway sacrificed his body 
and flipped around to get that crucial first down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will always remember The Drive, when Elway led the Broncos  
98 yards to tie the Cleveland Browns with 39 seconds in the AFC 
title game in January 1987. Denver went on to win 23-20 in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Elway gained admiration from foes, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``He may, in fact, ultimately be the greatest to have ever  
played this game at that position,'' said Marty Schottenheimer, who 
was tormented by Elway as coach at Cleveland and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I steadfastly believe that it doesn't have anything to do  
with his arm strength or with the people around him. The guy is the 
greatest competitor I have ever witnessed in sport. That, to me, is 
the quality I will always remember about John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to retire, he is going to be greatly missed by  
all of us.''

<HEADLINE> 76ers Close to Deal With Geiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Matt Geiger is close to signing a $54  
million, six-year contract with the Philadelphia 76ers, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who played the last three seasons with Charlotte, is  
expected to finalize the deal as soon as the NBA's new collective 
bargaining agreement is put into writing. That could be done as 
early as Tuesday, a source who asked not to be named told the AP on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger would get the maximum salary allowed under the new labor  
deal with the signing, also reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer 
and Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing a free-agent center is one of the Sixers' primary needs  
heading into the shortened NBA season. When teams get the OK to 
begin signing and trading players, the Sixers' top priority is to 
sign their own free agent, Theo Ratliff. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing Geiger allows Ratliff to play power forward instead of  
center, and also makes forward Derrick Coleman expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, also a free agent, has agreed to a six-year deal with  
the Charlotte Hornets, NBA sources told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stated all along, if it can be worked out, I'd love to  
have Derrick back,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said last week. 
``He'll have a lot of options, especially in a shortened season. 
He'll probably have some contenders come after him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers could not comment on potential signings because the  
collective bargaining agreement that ended the lockout is not yet 
in effect.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Gas Blast Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN OAK TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three natural gas explosions  
tore a house apart during the night, killing one woman and injuring 
four other people. 
</P>
<P>
	A gas odor was reported in the area late Friday and a utility  
worker was on the way when the first explosion happened somewhere 
inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``The house was just a big ball of flame,'' said neighbor Cassie  
Nance, 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Gary Danforth said he felt the blast at his home four  
or five miles away in the Livingston County community northwest of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Energy Co. crews were working to shut off the house's  
natural gas line four hours later when a second explosion happened 
outside the house, damaging an adjacent convenience store. A third 
blast took place inside the store 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the blasts was not immediately determined, Danforth  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman living in the house was killed, authorities said. A male  
occupant of the house, two firefighters and a utility worker were 
treated for burns.

<HEADLINE> Del. Murder Trial Reaches Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jurors reached a verdict Saturday in the  
murder trial of a wealthy and politically connected attorney 
accused of killing his mistress, the governor's scheduling 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury began deliberations Thursday in the case against Thomas  
Capano, 49. Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee said he would 
receive the verdict Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano was arrested in November 1997 and charged with  
first-degree murder in the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey. 
Prosecutors say he killed her in June 1996 and dumped her body at 
sea because she wanted to end their secret, three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stand in his own defense, Capano said another  
mistress of his -- prosecution witness Deborah MacIntyre -- 
accidentally shot Ms. Fahey in a jealous, suicidal rage at his home 
June 27, 1996. He admitted dumping Ms. Fahey's body in the ocean 
but said he did so to protect himself and Ms. MacIntyre.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say U.S. Needs 'Bad Guy' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States needs Iraq's Saddam Hussein  
-- or a ``bad guy'' nemesis like him -- to rally support for U.S. 
foreign policy and defense spending, world affairs experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of the recent past. The U.S. enemies list has included  
Manuel Noriega and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Today, in addition 
to Saddam, there are Moammar Gadhafi, Slobodan Milosevic and Fidel 
Castro, although the aging Cuban leader has lost a good deal of his 
evil persona of late. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam emerged as a top U.S. threat when he  
invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The move angered his Persian Gulf 
neighbors and more importantly endangered the smooth functioning of 
the world's oil supplies. The strike prompted President Bush to 
compare Saddam to Hitler and organize an international force to 
expel Saddam's forces from the neighboring emirate. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton ordered airstrikes against Iraqi targets  
over four days in December, he, like Bush, had overwhelming public 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gates, former CIA director and deputy national security  
adviser during the Gulf War, said Americans have been 
``conditioned'' to see Saddam as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart of it, I think, is against America's favorite bad  
guy,'' Gates said, speaking of the Dec. 16-19 U.S.-British assault 
on Saddam's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	A tangible enemy helps unite the nation and justify a massive  
military -- 1.4 million strong and costing about $280 billion a year 
-- equipped and trained to fight two regional wars at once if 
necessary, analysts say. The end of the Cold War officially put 
Moscow in the U.S. friend column, shifting the focus to new foes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Soviet Union was the `Evil Empire,' other leaders  
around the world could have attracted our attention but mostly 
didn't because we were so focused on the Soviet threat,'' said 
Robert Ebel, a national security expert at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now these other people have popped up in their place -- the  
rogue of the week -- whomever we are confronting now,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration targeted Iraq last month after Saddam refused  
to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, required as part of the 
Gulf War cease-fire to ensure he didn't rebuild his chemical and 
biological weapons to threaten his neighbors again. 
</P>
<P>
	Since late December, Iraq has challenged U.S. and British  
aircraft enforcing flight-interdiction rules over northern and 
southern swaths of Iraq. Iraqi pilots are flying into the 
off-limits airspace as Iraqi air defense sites launch missiles at 
the enforcers. No Western planes have been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Army Col. Harry Summers said the United States has a  
long history of demonizing enemies, sometimes an entire population 
like the Japanese during World War II, but more often individual 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps explain things to the American people,'' Summers  
said. ``It always makes it easier to fight a war if you demonize 
people so that you're not killing human beings, you're killing the 
devil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Iraq, the Clinton administration is focusing its  
ire on Saddam partly because U.S. officials believe the Iraqi 
president's policies are harming his own poverty-stricken people, 
said Ebel of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy for us to personalize the matter in Iraq. We  
have nothing against the people, just Saddam Hussein,'' Ebel said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a similar situation in Cuba, where Castro has ruled with a  
communist iron hand for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton eased a U.S. embargo against Cuba this month to allow  
Americans to send more money to needy Cubans while increasing 
people-to-people exchanges between the countries, direct mail 
service and the sale of food and agricultural goods to 
nongovernment entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steps are designed to help the Cuban people without  
strengthening the Cuban government,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Most foreign policy analysts say the U.S. administration should  
have eased or lifted the embargo against Cuba long ago but is 
reluctant to do so because Castro has been demonized by every 
president since John Kennedy and because of strong opposition by 
Cuban exiles in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is really a bankrupt policy in Cuba and has been  
for decades,'' said Robert Beisner, professor emeritus at American 
University, who is writing a book about U.S. foreign policy. 
``Demonizing Fidel for so many years makes it harder to reverse 
course now.''

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Randle Not Expected To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- John Randle's streak of 107  
consecutive starts will likely come to an end on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle, the Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman, said  
his hyperextended left knee was still bothering him and he might 
not start in the NFC Championship Game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Stalin Colinet will play probably the first quarter,  
the second quarter, and maybe I'll just kind of work myself into 
the game,'' Randle said. ``I may play some nickel situations in the 
first quarter. It just depends on the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randle, the Vikings sack leader with 10 1/2, hasn't missed a start  
since Nov. 22, 1992. He injured his knee on the final play of 
Minnesota's 41-21 playoff victory over Arizona last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle missed practice Wednesday and wore a knee brace during  
practices Thursday and Friday.

	40 Bodies Seen After Kosovo Fight  
</P>
<P>
	RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bodies of up to 40 people, many of  
them mutilated, were found in a southern Kosovo village today, the 
day after Serb forces launched a fierce assault on the area. 
Reporters and international verifiers who were prevented from 
reaching the village of Racak the previous day arrived today and 
saw the bodies scattered on a hillside. Some had their eyes gouged 
out or their heads bashed in, and one man lay decapitated.

	Power Outage Disrupts Flights  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A power outage at the Federal Aviation  
Administration's regional air traffic control center disrupted air 
travel throughout the Northwest and delayed flights for about 8,000 
passengers. The outage and the failure of a backup generator lasted 
about 35 minutes yesterday when controllers lost radar and radio 
communications. The FAA halted all plane departures in the region 
until the problem was fixed, which delayed more than 8,000 
passengers, some for several hours. No safety problems were 
reported, officials said. 

</P>

	Ice, Rain Glaze the East  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snow and freezing rain put a hard-shell finish  
on the East yesterday, causing deadly highway accidents, backing up 
airline flights and knocking out power to thousands of people. The 
snow that blanketed the Northeast on Thursday was topped by 
freezing rain early yesterday, creating a slick coating over much 
of the region during the morning rush hour. As the day wore on and 
temperatures climbed out of the teens, people found themselves 
slogging through slush and high water. At least 10 people died 
since Wednesday in traffic accidents in West Virginia, Maryland, 
Massachusetts and Maine that were blamed on rain, snow and ice.

	Prosecutors Wrap Up Opening Phase

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After alleging that William Jefferson Clinton  
``violated the laws of this land,'' prosecutors at the president's 
impeachment trial are set to argue that his conduct amounted to 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting his removal. Continuing 
the proceedings into the weekend, senators were anxious to stay on 
schedule for the crucial decision on whether to invite the 
president to testify and summon several of his close aides and 
associates as witnesses. Before the ``court'' of the Senate, the 
House ``managers'' were presenting their third and final day of 
opening arguments today.

	Marine Pilot Has One Charge Dropped  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A judge yesterday dismissed negligent  
homicide charges against a Marine pilot in the Italian ski gondola 
tragedy that killed 20 people -- but the aviator still faces more 
serious charges. The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission 
Viejo, Calif., will be court-martialed next month on the graver 
charges of involuntary manslaughter, as well as several lesser 
charges. The prosecutors' decision to seek dismissal of the 
negligent homicide charges was viewed as a strategic move -- 
possibly aimed at forcing jurors to convict Ashby on more serious 
charges at his court-martial next month.

	Navy Recruiting More Non-Graduates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy, faced with a worrisome 22,000 job  
vacancies, has decided to start accepting more recruits who have 
not earned a high school diploma. In announcing the decision 
yesterday, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said it was among a series 
of moves intended to improve the Navy's war preparedness and raise 
morale. The job gap has meant that some sailors among the 372,000 
on active duty are forced to fill positions outside their own 
specialty or to do double duty, he said of the 22,000 unfilled 
jobs, 18,000 are aboard ships at sea.

	FDA Approves New Leg Drug

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration approved the  
first drug in 15 years to help several million Americans with a 
circulatory disorder so painful it inhibits walking. But the 
approval of Pletal yesterday for the painful leg syndrome known as 
intermittent claudication, the Latin word for limping, came amid 
criticism that the drug may endanger certain heart patients. The 
disorder occurs in people, mostly the elderly, who have poor blood 
circulation in their legs.

	Blackhawks Beat Rangers 3-1  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Maneluk scored on a breakaway and Jocelyn  
Thibault stopped 31 shots to snap the Chicago Blackhawks' 
seven-game winless streak with a 3-1 victory over the New York 
Rangers last night. Maneluk took advantage of a bad line change by 
New York to skate in alone on goalie Mike Richter and beat him at 
4:48 of the third period with a wrist shot from 12 feet for his 
fifth goal of the season. That broke a 1-1 tie and gave the 
Blackhawks only their fourth victory in 21 road games this season. 
Tony Amonte added an empty-net goal for Chicago, his 24th, with 
three seconds left.

<HEADLINE> Cops Looking for Buckeyes Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State offensive coordinator Mike  
Jacobs was being sought on assault and domestic violence charges 
Saturday night after allegedly beating his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint filed in Franklin County Municipal Court charged  
that Jacobs ``struck Robbin Jacobs ... across the face several 
times causing her eyes to swell and discolor.'' The complaint also 
said Jacobs pulled his ex-wife's hair and pushed her against a car 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies had tried to arrest Jacobs at Ohio State's  
Woody Hayes Athletic Center on Saturday morning, but were unable to 
find the assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all showed up this morning at Woody Hayes,'' Ohio State  
athletics director Andy Geiger said. ``I think that they left and 
Mike had arranged to turn himself in or come in at some other time. 
I don't know whether he is in there or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for the Franklin County Sheriff's Department  
said Jacobs was still being sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are looking for him. They have been since last night,''  
said Cpl. Richard Rabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs is in his fourth year on coach John Cooper's staff. He  
and his ex-wife have four children. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic violence complaint stated that Jacobs struck his  
wife in a car on Interstate 270 at 12:15 a.m. Saturday. The report 
said Robbin Jacobs had ``swollen, blackened eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger said, ``I don't know what it's all about. It's his  
business. He needs to resolve it, not for Ohio State's sake, but 
because he's a citizen and whatever is going on needs to be dealt 
with. It's kind of sad. ... He's got to figure all this out.''

<HEADLINE> Korda Escapes Grilling at ATP Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Petr Korda, accompanied by three  
security guards, rushed out of an ATP Tour meeting without a word 
Saturday night after escaping a grilling from players about his 
positive steroid test amid calls for a ``zero tolerance'' drug 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talk of a boycott of Monday's start of the Australian  
Open to protest the handling of the case against the defending 
champion, there was no discussion of any player action, and Korda 
never spoke during the three-hour session, which was attended by 
more than 200 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang all spoke at the  
meeting, and though they had said before going in that they wanted 
to know specifics of the Korda case, none pressed him for details 
or proposed any immediate reprisals by the tour against him at the 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament will not be affected by any anti-doping case  
coming into it,'' said ATP Tour chief executive officer Mark Miles. 
``But it was pretty clear that (players) have the expectation, and 
really require, a world class (drug) program so that the field is 
even, that all players will be treated consistently and fairly ... 
and that our sport is clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a witch hunt. The focus of this discussion was on  
the program, how it's written, how it's implemented. Not so much on 
this case, except to say, 'What are we going to learn from it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Korda nor anyone among the tour leaders addressed  
details of the ``exceptional circumstances'' that led an appeals 
panel to reduce his punishment after he tested positive for the 
banned anabolic steroid nandrolone after Wimbledon last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was assigned a black mark which obviously doesn't belong to  
me and I'll have to try and remove it, although I don't know how 
yet,'' Korda told Czech TV from Melbourne before the meeting. ``I 
still can't explain the mystery even to myself. I know very few 
people trust me now but I'll do everything I can to solve it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I was tested 10 times and nine tests were OK,  
except for the Wimbledon one. My conscience is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Tennis Federation, upset by the appeals board  
ruling, has taken the case to the Committee for Arbitration in 
Sports in Lausanne, Switzerland. Korda's lawyers are seeking to 
block the ITF action, and Korda has claimed that he didn't 
knowingly take the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent in the writing of the (exceptional circumstances)  
rule was never to allow for a circumstance where a player can 
simply make a case that he didn't knowledgeably take a banned 
circumstance and therefore he shouldn't be punished,'' Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptional circumstances would only come into play, Miles said,  
in something like a player receiving a banned drug without his 
knowledge during an operation or as a result of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us have viewed exceptional circumstances to have meant  
simply a general denial,'' Miles said. ``The players expect a 
program that is tough and that has zero tolerance for cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Player Council president Todd Martin, who arrived late for the  
meeting after his victory in the final of a tournament in Sydney, 
described the atmosphere in the room as ``calm,'' and said only one 
player encouraged Korda to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel very strongly about having the strongest (drug)  
program we possibly can, but we also respect the fact that the 
process was set up for our benefit and to protect us against any 
situation that can harm us inappropriately. We'll wait for the 
appeals process to be over in a few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he would rather see Korda have the chance to play  
until his case is resolved, but be given the maximum one-year 
suspension, along with forfeiture of prize money and points, if 
he's found guilty. Martin also said he and many other players would 
be willing to go along with a two-year suspension policy in the 
future, as suggested by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it says about tennis players is that, especially in an  
individual sport, we rely on being able to compete on a level 
playing field, and if that's not happening, we feel something is 
wrong,'' Martin said.

<HEADLINE> 19 Senators on Sunday Talk Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No need to keep feeling sorry for senators  
forced to sit in virtual silence during the Senate's impeachment 
trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-fifth of the Senate -- 19 to be exact -- was scheduled  
to appear Sunday on national television news programs. And this 
despite an admonition by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., earlier this week that senators should refrain from 
publicly discussing the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being impartial, which is the oath we took, doesn't mean not  
having an opinion,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who plans 
to appear on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer has been among several senators who after each session  
of the Senate trial have been willing to discuss the day's events 
with reporters. Though difficult to quantify, senators seem to have 
split roughly evenly between those who avoid commenting to 
journalists and those who do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Those like Schumer who have talked publicly about the trial say  
their status is different from that of regular jurors, in part 
because it includes politics. Unlike most jurors, senators are 
being lobbied by constituents about the trial, and many of them 
have campaigned either for or against Clinton over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many of them feel it is proper to talk about the case --  
within limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain amount of powder that should be kept dry,''  
said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., who said he might appear on ``Larry 
King Live'' on CNN. ``It's proper to talk about the process, but I 
don't want to make declarations about how I'll vote prior to a 
given vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, walk briskly past reporters when they are  
approached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the decision at the very outset that I wouldn't discuss  
anything,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his 19 colleagues slated to appear on the talk  
shows, he said: ``You will note that I'm not one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 who were scheduled for appearances on Sunday, 10 were  
Democrats and nine were Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eds: The 19 are: Sens. Robert Bennett, R-Utah; Barbara Boxer,  
D-Calif.; Larry Craig, R-Idaho; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M.; Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.;

<HEADLINE> Miami's Avery Hurt by Late Nights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins running back John Avery  
acknowledges that part of the reason for his rookie struggles was 
his inability to stay awake during team meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Staying up too late playing video games.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have some program for dealing with it, don't  
they? ... I think I have it handled now,'' Avery said in the 
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, offensive coordinator Kippy Brown became so  
exasperated with Avery that he kicked the rookie out of a meeting. 
That was in the week leading up to Miami's wild-card playoff game 
against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was limited to one carry in the Dolphins' two playoff  
games, working almost exclusively as a kickoff returner. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a team situation that I'm not going to get into,''  
Brown said, refusing further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery said: ``It only happened a couple of times, but he was  
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, Miami's first-round draft pick, rushed for 503 yards on  
143 carries and had two rushing touchdowns. The former Mississippi 
standout also caught 10 passes for 67 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson would not comment on Avery's inopportune  
naps. He was critical early this season of the running back's 
tendency to try to juke defenders rather than hitting the hole, but 
later said Avery's performance was satisfactory for a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has dealt with the problem in different ways in the  
past. When he coached the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson cut linebacker 
John Roper for falling asleep. Then again, Johnson also has let 
other players slide for the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us in training camp that guys fall asleep,'' Avery  
said. ``There was that one guy he cut. Then he said Troy Aikman 
fell asleep one time. He said, 'You think I'm going to cut Troy 
Aikman?'''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Deride Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wrapping up their opening arguments, House  
prosecutors today launched a blistering attack on what they called 
President Clinton's ``so-what'' defense. They told senators he 
should be removed from office because he ``abused the trust placed 
upon him by the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked Democrats to  
meet to discuss the possibility of calling witnesses later in the 
trial, but he got a cool response from Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott suggested in a letter to Daschle that ``a bipartisan group  
of senators could anticipate and help resolve in advance any 
complications'' brought about by witness testimony. ``We should 
consider safeguards now so that testimony could begin as soon as 
fairness allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle said such a move would violate the Senate's previous  
agreement, which calls for the witness question to be settled later 
in the process. ``I agree that the prospect of witness testimony 
poses a number of troubling considerations that we would be forced 
to confront,'' Daschle wrote. ``It is my hope that such 
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public galleries were full again on a chilly Saturday  
morning as the House prosecutors opened their final arguments, 
seeking to show that perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of 
justice are offenses that meet the impeachment standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Constitution, and the American people, entrust to the  
president singular responsibility for enforcing the rule of law. 
Perjury and obstruction of justice strike at the heart of the rule 
of law,'' Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., told a hushed Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``A president who has committed these crimes has plainly and  
directly violated his most important executive duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., his Southern tones echoing in the  
chamber, sought to put a human face to a case dominated by legal 
distinctions. He told senators a high crime was simply ``if a high 
person hurts a person of low means'' and that Clinton's effort to 
``fix this case'' when sued by Paula Jones met that standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the case was one of ``serious offenses colored by sex  
and there is absolutely no way to get around that. And I know it is 
uncomfortable to listen to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also cautioned senators that if they convict Clinton they  
would put a ``burden'' on the next president: ``Don't lie under 
oath when you are a defendant in a lawsuit against an average 
citizen. Have the courage to apply the law in a fair manner to 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Saturday's proceedings got under way, Clinton entered  
the Oval Office to applause from guests invited to his weekly radio 
broadcast. He exhorted Americans to observe Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day as a day of community service, and then settled down with aides 
to rehearse his upcoming State of the Union address. He told 
Democrats at a party gala late Friday night that he was 
``determined to make the most of the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., another of the prosecutors,  
reminded senators they have impeached and removed federal judges 
for perjury. ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard of 
integrity for the president than the standard it has already 
established for federal judges,'' Canady argued in prepared 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors attacked the defenses erected by the Clinton  
legal team, saying concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky from 
a court was public, not private, conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers, there is  
not a bright line separating official misconduct by a president 
from other misconduct of which the president is guilty,'' Canady 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyer said, ``I'm not offended by the 'so what' defense. If that  
is all you have then try it.'' He said presidential lawyers seemed 
to feel their only chance was to ``attack the prosecutor and 
attempt to confuse those who sit in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House is prepared to establish that the president, William  
Jefferson Clinton, willfully and repeatedly violated the rule of 
law and abused the trust placed upon him by the American people,'' 
Buyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a sharp distinction between a man trying to hide an  
extramarital affair from his wife and what Clinton is accused of 
doing in hiding his actions from the court in the Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing the proceedings into the weekend, senators were  
anxious to stay on schedule for the crucial decision on whether to 
invite the president to testify and whether to summon several of 
his close aides and associates as witnesses. House prosecutors have 
relentlessly pressed for permission to call witnesses later in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House already has said Clinton would not testify.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers, who cannot interrupt the House presentation  
to object, sat quietly at the prosecution table during the 
arguments, waiting for their turn Tuesday. But White House special 
counsel Gregory Craig launched a brief salvo outside the Senate 
chamber, saying prosecutors wanted to ``expand and extend this 
proceeding for one reason: They do not have a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment with  
perjury and obstruction of justice in the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds, or 67 of the 100 senators, most vote for conviction  
to remove the president from office, and there are no indications 
that any Democrats would vote against the president. Twelve 
Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans in order to remove 
Clinton from office if the GOP stayed united. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a first moment of surprise Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, suddenly objected to the House  
prosecutors' ``continued use of the word 'jurors''' to describe 
senators, who have a multipurpose role that also includes making 
trial decisions reserved for lawyers and judges in regular 
courtroom proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, who has had little to do as presiding officer, made  
his first ruling of the trial: ``The objection is well taken. The 
Senate is not simply a jury but a court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who had just told the Senate that Clinton  
violated perjury and obstruction of justice statutes, quickly 
concluded his remarks without referring to the word ``jurors,'' as 
he had done several times previously.

<HEADLINE> Senate Reaction to First Arguments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reaction from senators on Saturday after House  
prosecutors completed their opening arguments in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. 

</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``We are getting close to some votes  
here on motions, and that will be real test of what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.: ``Today, they did not tie those  
explicit details to high crimes and misdemeanors. The real question 
is whether having an illicit affair and lying about it rises to 
high crimes and misdemeanors. No one touched that subject. Strike 
touched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: ``The House managers understand  
that based on the current record and with the arguments presented 
to date, they are not going to win this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo.: ``I think they did a very good job  
wrapping up and summarizing. ... I would think a large majority (of 
senators) have not made up their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.: ``If he hadn't lied, where would you  
have been, and about what? A consensual act. ... If you say lying 
about a noncrime can be converted into a high crime by the way you 
handle it, that sets a pretty low standard for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.: ``There are two ways to deal with  
presidential misconduct. One through the criminal justice system, 
the other through impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.: ``There's a sense developing in the  
Senate there will probably be witnesses called. ... It's almost 
reached a point of inevitability that witnesses will be called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,: ``The managers today made an  
overwhelming case that these facts are important and that perjury 
and obstruction of justice ..., if proven, are impeachable 
offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.: ``My standard is clear and convincing  
evidence. I think if we were in a court of law and a motion was to 
be made today to dismiss the case because of lack of the 
prosecution having carried out its responsibility, I would reject 
that motion.''

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman: Regrets He's Had a Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From his days as a child TV star to work as a  
part-time security guard, Gary Coleman has regrets. Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, he sued his adoptive parents and broke all  
contact with them, wound up the butt of jokes about washed-up 
careers, and been sued himself for allegedly striking a woman who 
had sought a lengthier autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chose to be in this business,'' he told US magazine for its  
February issue. ``It was an uninformed choice, and I will always 
regret it. But I have to bite the bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was the tiny, round-cheeked star of ``Diff'rent  
Strokes,'' which spent eight years on NBC before its end in 1986. 
He was born with severely atrophied kidneys and regularly undergoes 
dialysis treatment. The condition stunted his growth. 
</P>
<P>
	He still occasionally appears on screen. A role as an elf in a  
made-for-cable Christmas movie was the most satisfying in years, he 
said. ``He wasn't a cute elf -- he was just an elf.''

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Paintings Head to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After dazzling the nation's capital, an  
exhibit of Vincent van Gogh paintings is headed for a city that 
truly appreciates money, madness and fame, for a four-month run 
expected to draw nearly 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum,  
Amsterdam,'' 70 paintings ranging from his dark ``Potato Eaters'' 
to the stunning ``Wheatfield With Crows,'' opens Sunday to rock 
concert-type hype. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is the  
second and last U.S. stop before the paintings go back to Amsterdam 
on May 16. ``These pictures will not travel again in this number in 
our lifetimes,'' Van Gogh Museum Director John Leighton said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	LACMA is charging what is believed to be the highest price ever  
for a ticket to a U.S. museum exhibit: $23.50 for an adult weekend 
pass, including service charges, largely to pay for security, 
transportation and the climate-controlled exhibit space. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the costs of parking, food, a $5 audio tour and souvenirs  
from the two shops, and it makes for an expensive family outing. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't dampened demand for the biggest thing to come to  
Los Angeles since the King Tut exhibit in 1978. More than 200,000 
tickets have been sold and the museum expects 900,000 people will 
tour the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching van Gogh mania sweep Washington, Los Angeles  
museum officials took a number of steps to cut down on gridlock. 
Tickets are time- and date-stamped. The museum will be open 12 
hours a day, seven days a week. A tent will be set up in a field 
behind the museum to shelter visitors waiting for their assigned 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	All this in a movie town with a rap as a cultural wasteland.  
</P>
<P>
	``The entertainment industry has masked for many years the  
truths of Los Angeles,'' said Andrea Rich, the museum's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Gogh show's three-month run at the National Gallery of  
Art in Washington drew 450,000 people, including President Clinton. 
Tickets there were free, but scalpers fetched more than $100 on 
some days. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings, which trace van Gogh's career from age 27 to his  
suicide at 37 in 1890, are on loan from the Van Gogh family's 
collection at the museum of the Van Gogh Foundation in Amsterdam 
while it is being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	The works include such famous paintings as ``The Bedroom,''  
``Self-Portrait as an Artist'' and ``Wheatfield with a Reaper,'' 
along with lesser-known works that trace his development as an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gogh's life story -- including the episode in which he  
severed his own ear -- has been embraced by popular culture. 
Hollywood has made several films, most notably ``Lust For Life'' 
starring Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Van Gogh represents the long held popular notion of what an  
artist should be: poverty stricken, struggling, misunderstood in 
his own time, passionate, antisocial, awkward, psychologically 
different,'' said museum Director Graham Beal. ``Then there's the 
final gratifying (element) of him seeming to go mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, his paintings are worth a fortune. Prices paid at auction  
include $82.5 million for ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' in 1990 and 
$71.5 million last November for a self-portrait. Neither is in this 
exhibit. Nor are the famous ``Irises'' or ''The Starry Night.''

	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- Rickey Bower and Kim Stacey gave  
the United States a sweep of the halfpipe events in the World 
Snowboarding Championships on Saturday.

of Dorian Vidal of France and Anna Hellman of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first gold medals for the Americans in the

International Skiing Federation. Many leading halfpipe competitors 
who are members of the breakaway International Snowboarding 
Federation stayed away from the championship.

<HEADLINE> 62 Players File for Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Only 62 players filed for salary arbitration this year, the  
second-lowest total in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the World Series champion New York Yankees, the total isn't  
significant. Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera filed, 
meaning their payroll will grow to about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas pitchers Rick Helling and Aaron Sele also were among those  
who filed Friday. Barring settlements, they'll exchange figures 
with their teams Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, when 40 players filed, the only year fewer players  
went to arbitration was 1995. Following the 232-day strike, just 56 
players filed and only eight had hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players who file settle before their cases are heard. Just  
eight were decided by arbitrators last year, with owners winning 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Los Angeles Dodgers players settled before the deadline,  
with pitcher Carlos Perez getting a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract. Ismael Valdes ($4,275,000) and outfielder Todd 
Hollandsworth ($850,000) got one-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis agreed to a $1.8 million, two-year contract with  
left-hander Lance Painter and a $550,000, one-year contract with 
right-hander Alan Benes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Curtis Leskanic got a $2.6 million, two-year deal with  
Colorado, and Albie Lopez, another reliever, agreed to a $1.35 
million, two-year contract with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder David Bell agreed to a two-year contract with Seattle  
that is worth $1,775,000, and outfielder Roger Cedeno and the New 
York Mets agreed to a $487,500, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati right-hander Jason Bere became the first of the  
players who filed to settle, agreeing to a $1.2 million, one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-one players filed Friday and joined Toronto first baseman  
Carlos Delgado, who filed Thursday. Because of Monday's Martin 
Luther King holiday, all will exchange numbers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and the Houston Astros had the most players filing, six  
each, followed by the Rangers with five. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the decrease in the overall total -- a record 161 were in  
arbitration in 1990 and the total topped 100 from 1986 through 1993 
-- is due to clubs releasing and threatening to release marginal 
players rather than arbitrate with them. As a result, more than 
half of the players who filed -- 33 -- were eligible for arbitration 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are seven of the so-called ``Super Twos,'' those with  
2-3 years of major league service who became eligible for 
arbitration under the 1990 lockout settlement. Among them are 
Helling, Houston closer Billy Wagner, St. Louis shortstop Edgar 
Renteria and Montreal starter Dustin Hermanson, all set to receive 
huge raises. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the 1996 collective bargaining agreement, 75 percent  
of cases will be scheduled for three-man arbitration panels and 25 
percent for single arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new twist, the labor lawyers in the commissioner's office  
have asked teams to confer with them before settling arbitration 
cases to give them a chance to argue against agreements they think 
are too high. But the process isn't mandatory and some clubs won't 
follow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two free agents found new teams Friday. Pitcher Mike  
Mohler and St. Louis agreed to a one-year contract, while infielder 
Luis Rivera and Anaheim agreed to a minor league deal.

<HEADLINE> Graham Uses Folksy Ways in Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strolling around the well of the Senate, South  
Carolina's Lindsey Graham used a folksy approach to urge a 
``cleansing'' of the presidency through removal of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's presentation Saturday was remarkable both for his  
relaxed style and for his message. Calling himself a ``son of the 
South'' who grew up amid racial segregation, Graham said that 
Clinton cannot be a civil rights champion if he is guilty of 
perjury in a sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's been an articulate spokesman for civil rights  
for our citizens,'' Graham told the Senate. ``When those rights had 
to be applied to him, he failed miserably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, 43, was swept into office during the 1994 Republican  
capture of Congress. Before the impeachment drama, he was best 
known for his role in the attempted coup than nearly ousted Newt 
Gingrich as House speaker in 1997. He is a vocal advocate of term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	He bucked the other Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee  
when he voted against one of the four articles of impeachment 
originally lodged against Clinton -- the one alleging perjury in the 
Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham served as a judge advocate in the Air Force and is a  
major in the South Carolina Air National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	During Saturday's arguments, he used a clip-on microphone so he  
could move away from the lectern and -- unlike most of his House 
colleagues -- he used only notes to deliver his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a clear attempt to be less formal: ``I'll try to get you  
out so we can all have some lunch,'' Graham said at one point. And 
later: ``If this is a football game, we're almost to halftime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham was deadly serious in his message, which focused on  
past impeachment trials of federal judges and how the Senate had 
determined that wrongful conduct outside official duties could be 
grounds for removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is  
about restoring honor and integrity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham also referred to Clinton's continuing popularity, saying  
senators must trust that people would believe they did the proper 
thing if the president were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will trust you. This is a cynical age, but I'm an  
optimist that no matter what you do, this country will get up and 
go to work the next day and we'll feel good,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Wrap Up Opening Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After alleging that William Jefferson Clinton  
``violated the laws of this land,'' prosecutors at the president's 
impeachment trial are set to argue that his conduct amounted to 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting his removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing the proceedings into the weekend, senators were  
anxious to stay on schedule for the crucial decision on whether to 
invite the president to testify and summon several of his close 
aides and associates as witnesses. House prosecutors have 
relentlessly pressed for permission to call witnesses later in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our purpose. We try,'' House Judiciary Committee  
Chairman Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, said today before the 
House managers were presenting their third and final day of opening 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Those lawmakers-turned-prosecutors were prepared to contend that  
lying under oath and obstruction of justice meet the Constitution's 
standard for removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, R-Ill., was expected to deliver a summation.  
</P>
<P>
	As Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the presiding officer,  
peered down at the Senate from his elevated dais Friday, Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla. argued that the president, his friend Vernon 
Jordan, his secretary Betty Currie and at least two staff aides 
should testify because their testimony conflicts with that of 
Clinton.

	``Time and again somebody is not telling the truth and time and  
again an analysis of ... all the testimony together with common 
sense says it's the president who is not telling the truth,'' 
McCollum said. ``But if you have serious doubts about the 
truthfulness'' of key witnesses, he said, they should appear in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House already has said Clinton would not testify.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers, who cannot interrupt the House presentation  
to object, sat quietly at the prosecution table during the 
arguments, waiting for their turn Tuesday. But White House special 
counsel Gregory Craig launched a brief salvo outside the Senate 
chamber, saying prosecutors wanted to ``expand and extend this 
proceeding for one reason: They do not have a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment with  
perjury and obstruction of justice in the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds, or 67 of the 100 senators, most vote for conviction  
to remove the president from office, and there are no indications 
that any Democrats would vote against the president. Twelve 
Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans in order to remove 
Clinton from office if the GOP stayed united. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening argument phase of the trial is governed by a  
bipartisan agreement that postpones the question of witnesses for 
at least another week. But, as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., 
acknowledged, ``there may be very well'' a party-line vote on the 
witness question.

	Members of the public were in line on an icy Washington morning  
Friday for 50 gallery seats filled on a rotating basis. Those there 
late Friday afternoon saw the only fleeting moment of surprise in a 
trial governed mostly by 19th century rules that require senators 
to remain silent ``on pain of imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, suddenly objected to the House  
prosecutors' ``continued use of the word 'jurors''' to describe 
senators, who have a multipurpose role that also includes making 
trial decisions reserved for lawyers and judges in regular 
courtroom proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, who has had little to do as presiding officer, made  
his first ruling of the trial: ``The objection is well taken. The 
Senate is not simply a jury but a court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who had just told the Senate that Clinton  
violated perjury and obstruction of justice statutes, quickly 
concluded his remarks without referring to the word ``jurors,'' as 
he had done several times previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the interruption, Barr asked the Senate to conclude  
``that William Jefferson Clinton in fact and under the law, 
violated his oath and violated the laws of this land, and convict 
him on both articles of impeachment ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., another prosecutor, likewise argued  
that Clinton committed federal crimes, even though impeachable acts 
need not be criminal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton ``turned the judicial system on its head for his  
own legal and political gain. This case is about perjury, multiple 
obstructions of justice, false and misleading statements and 
witness tampering, all committed or orchestrated by the 
president.''
