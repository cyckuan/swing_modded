KNICKS LOOKING FOR TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf correcting fact that Steve Nash was acquired by
Dallas, not Vancouver.) (th)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks were still talking to teams about making a
trade before Tuesday night's midnight deadline while waiting for
the Charles Oakley trade to become official.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was traded to Toronto for Marcus Camby last Wednesday. To
complete the deal, Oakley was supposed to arrive in Toronto for his
physical Monday at noon, but he was not on his scheduled flight.
One league official said the deadline for Oakley to report was
extended to 5 p.m. Tuesday. If Oakley fails to show up, according
to the league official, the Raptors have to either void the deal or
waive the physical for the 34-year-old forward.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Raptors and Knicks said they expected Oakley
to arrive and pass his physical, clearing the way for the deal to
go through before the league's lockout is scheduled to begin at
midnight Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, all player-related business between teams will
cease. That leaves the Knicks with a small window of time to
complete a deal for a point guard. As of Monday, there was no trade
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can pop up,'' the team president, Ernie Grunfeld,
said. ``But in all likelihood, this is what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have shown interest in Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon,
the former Laker Nick Van Exel and the former Sun Steve Nash.
However, Van Exel was traded to the Nuggets and Dallas acquired
Nash last week, and their new teams appear eager to hold on to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon is still a possibility. But a deal for him would be a
better salary-cap fit for both teams after the lockout ends and
players are under next year's salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Once Brandon's balloon payment of $7 million for next year kicks
in, the Bucks, if they are under the salary cap, would be able to
take back multiple players in a deal. In such a scenario, the
Knicks could send Milwaukee Chris Childs, John Starks and Chris
Mills. Under his current pre-July 1 salary, Brandon, a base-year
compensation player, makes just $1.6 million. &QL;

MEL GIBSON GETS `LETHAL': FOURTH TIME'S THE CHARM

 Includes a color slide of Mel Gibson with Danny Glover and Chris
Rock in a scene from ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's hard to get Mel Gibson to do something he doesn't want to
do.
 &HT;    Not only can he be highly intimidating on a personal level _
those cheery blue eyes have turned icy in everything from ``Mad
Max'' (1979) to ``Ransom'' (1996) _ but few can match the Hollywood
clout of an actor/director who has not only a string of
$100-million-plus hits but also a couple of Oscars for
``Braveheart'' (1995).
 &HT;    Which means that for as long as Gibson said that three was
plenty, the ``Lethal Weapon'' series wasn't going anywhere. Without
his key role as cop-on-the-edge Martin Riggs, it just wasn't
happening.
 &HT;    ``I know, a few years ago I said I would never do another
`Lethal,''' Gibson admits, sipping coffee at the Regency Hotel in
New York. ``I told people they should just send the script to
another action star. Maybe they could call it `Angry Bruce 4.'''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, here is ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' opening July 10 and
bringing back Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo and Joe Pesci _ plus
newcomer Chris Rock _ for a typically explosion-laded action
comedy.
 &HT;    Gibson may still have his reservations _ at one point, Glover's
Detective Murtaugh asks him, ``Aren't we too old for this sh-t?'' _
but he seems comfortable with his decision.
 &HT;    ``I liked that we decided to do more of a personal story with
this one, instead of just having an archvillain,'' Gibson says.
``We get more deeply into the lives of Riggs and Murtaugh ... and,
of course, there are some explosions and sh-t.''
 &HT;    Surprise _ it's not Shakespeare.
 &HT;    ``It's an action series that has never taken itself too
seriously,'' Gibson says amiably. ``It's fun. It's not meant to be
a night at the opera.''
 &HT;    It was nighttime, however, when Gibson and series director
Richard Donner, struck by the idea for the sequel, called Glover
for his opinion,
 &HT;    ``It was late at night,'' Gibson recalls. ``I said, `Danny,
let's do another ``Lethal Weapon.'' Are you up for the ride?'
 &HT;    ``He said, `Yeah.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `OK, so you're excited?'
 &HT;    ``He said, `Oh yeah.'
 &HT;    ``I think he was sleeping when I called,'' Gibson concludes.
 &HT;    Later, though, Glover got more into the spirit of things.
 &HT;    ``Danny and I started talking about the sequel, and we were
crying with laughter,'' Gibson recalls. ``We just kept one-upping
each other, and it became obvious we had to do it.''
 &HT;    Actually making the movie was less hilarious, though.
 &HT;    ``I experienced something that has never happened before on one
of these movies,'' Gibson says. ``I was sprinting after a bad guy.
I jumped over a park bench and pulled a hamstring muscle.
 &HT;    ``Maybe we are getting too old for this, uh, stuff.''
 &HT;    It's his call, though, because Gibson controls his Hollywood
destiny, both through his own starpower and through his flourishing
production company, Icon Films.
 &HT;    And no, the icon referred to is not Gibson himself. The company
had its roots one day when the actor and a longtime friend,
accountant Bruce Davey, were shooting the breeze in Gibson's den on
the Australian cattle ranch he shares with his wife Robyn and their
six children.
 &HT;    ``I said, `I am so sick of seeing stupid movies,''' he recalls.
```We should just start a company and stop yapping about how things
stink.'''
 &HT;    All they needed was a name.
 &HT;    ``My eyes started scanning the bookcase, and there was this
reference book about Russian icons,'' the actor says. ``I thought,
`Hmmm, Icon. That's not too shabby.'''
 &HT;    Icon quickly made a name for itself, producing the box-office
hit ``Maverick'' (1994), ``Immortal Beloved'' (1994), the
Oscar-winning ``Braveheart,'' ``187'' (1997) and, most recently,
the children's film ``Fairy Tale _ A True Story'' (1998). Its next
offering is Gibson's ``Payback,'' due this fall.
 &HT;    ``That one I wanted to do because it's just a quick, slam-bang
thriller,'' Gibson says. ``It's about a guy who gets f--ked out of
some money and goes through all sorts of stuff to get it back. The
whole thing happens in 95 pages. It's like a whack in the face.''
 &HT;    Gibson relishes the Hollywood heft Icon has given him.
 &HT;    ``As an actor, you're kind of like this leaf being battered
constantly in the breeze,'' he says. ``And some days the breeze
turns into a hurricane. Your will is not your own, to a degree.''
 &HT;    Now Gibson's will is his own, and his company has a dozen
projects in development, with four films apiece in the works at
Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Paramount.
 &HT;    ``I'll star in some and direct others,'' Gibson says. ``It's all
pretty loose, which is the way I like it.
 &HT;    ``But I won't star in many movies I direct,'' he adds, ``because
doing both literally kills you. It's too hard.''
 &HT;    Gibson's current enthusiasm is a new version of Ray Bradbury's
classic story, ``Fahrenheit 451.''
 &HT;    ``We've adapted it for the '90s, with this really cool
screenwriter Terry Hayes, who did `Road Warrior' (1981),'' he says.
``We get on like ham and eggs. And we departed from the book a long
way and went to the year 2035.''
 &HT;    Filming is expected to begin next year, with Gibson directing
but not starring.
 &HT;    What else is Icon working on? Gibson laughs.
 &HT;    ``My favorite rumor concerning the company is that we're doing
`Braveheart II,''' he says. ``I will say, `Um, I died at the end of
the first one.'
 &HT;    ``Some people in Hollywood have said, `Mel, why don't you just
do a prequel?'''
 &HT;    Gibson shakes his head.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, at this point in my career I just want to do
whatever catches my fancy,'' he says. ``There are no rules. There
are no regulations. There is no map or a blueprint _ I don't do
10-year plans. I just want to do what captures my attention.''
 &HT;    It's an informal approach in keeping with Gibson's reputation as
one of the most down-to-earth Hollywood stars.
 &HT;    ``You just can't take yourself too seriously or buy into all the
hype,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``Fame reminds me of when I got sent to the principal's office
in third grade,'' he adds. ``I sort of liked it. I would walk
through the halls going, `Hey, I'm famous. I'm going to the
principal's office.'
 &HT;    ``Now I have that same feeling about fame,'' he says, laughing.
``It's like you're constantly being sent to the principal's
office.''
 &HT;    And, unlike many movie stars, Gibson doesn't have a riff about
how terrible it is to be a celebrity. He may resent the occasional
ludicrous rumors that circulate _ one had him dead in a plane
crash, another had him losing an arm in a motorcycle accident _ but
he isn't complaining about the whole package.
 &HT;    ``You know what?'' he says. ``Being a movie star is a good
gig.''
 &HT;    Especially when you can get away from it all when you want to _
and a ranch in Australia is a good place to hide.
 &HT;    ``I usually have two or three kids with me,'' he adds. ``We do
simple things like go out and check a fence. We feed the rabbits.
 &HT;    ``It's all about living a normal life.''

SHANIA TWAIN: COUNTRY FINDS A FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of singer Shania Twain. 
 By KATHY HENDERSON  
 c.1998 McCall's  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged among scented candles, Shania Twain looks
like a college student in slim, black-silk pants and a matching
shirt. But at 32, Twain has a lot on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to enjoy my success,'' she says quietly.
``I'm always thinking about my future.''
</P>
<P>
   And when she adds ``I feel as if I've lived three lifetimes,''
she isn't quoting from her new CD, ``Come on Over'' (Mercury
Records, 1998). She's had more than her share of tragedy. After a
poverty-stricken childhood, at 21 she took on the responsibility of
tending to three siblings when her mother and stepfather died in a
car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps her suffering has made her success seem sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to cut this off short,'' she says of her career.
``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain came virtually out of nowhere _ Canada, to be precise _ to
achieve astonishing popularity: Her 1995 CD, ``The Woman in Me,''
sold 12 million copies, and her appearance at the Mall of America
drew 20,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Like other country superstars _ Reba McEntire or Dolly Parton,
say _ Twain owes her success, at least in part, to her ability to
connect with her audience by singing about their everyday concerns.
On ``Come on Over,'' she deals with jealousy, respect, abuse and
romance.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a country fan to hum these songs, and
that's the whole idea for Twain and her producer/husband, Robert
John ``Mutt'' Lange.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to appeal to as many people as I can,'' she says.
``As a child I was influenced by the Carpenters as much as by Dolly
Parton.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain downplays the importance of her looks, though she was
savvy enough to call in the late film director John Derek, noted
for his depictions of beautiful women, and his wife Bo Derek, star
of the sexy hit ``10'' (1979), to photograph the cover of ``The
Woman in Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a very ugly kid,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, she adds, her glamorous image ``doesn't mean
anything. I don't need it to be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The future musical star knew almost from the beginning what she
wanted to do with her life. Childhood photos of Twain reveal a
little girl _ named Eilleen Twain, incidentally _ with a huge
guitar propped on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was the first person to show me a few chords, when I
was about 7,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Home was Timmins, Ontario, 500 miles north of Toronto, where
Twain's stepfather, an Ojibway Indian, and mother were raised. The
Twains married when Shania was 2, and she has had minimal contact
with her biological father since.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing her talent, her parents would awaken the 8-year-old
at midnight and take her to perform at a bar after the liquor
stopped flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's young, isn't it?'' Twain says. ``I was mature for my
age.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl was paid $20 or $25 for her late-night
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gas money _ I never thought of keeping any of it until
I was about 16,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But Twain doesn't feel she was pushed too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if I were a prisoner of my parents' dreams,'' she
says. ``It's something I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Twain supervised a work crew in her
stepfather's reforestation business for several months a year. She
spent the rest of her time on the road with bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were absolutely confident I would make it,'' she
says.
 &UR; A TRAGEDY PRODUCES STRENGTH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Twains were not to see their daughter's success. They
died suddenly in a collision with a logging truck. When Twain was
21, she assumed responsibility for her brothers, then 13 and 14,
and her 9-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't willing to let them be separated,'' she says, ``and
the only way they were going to be able to stay together was if
they lived with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain downplays the sacrifice she made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only for three years,'' she says, ``which actually went
by pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   When her brothers turned 16, she adds, ``They were out of my
control, and I had my life back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain's sister is now a homemaker in Canada. As for her
brothers, the singer says only, ``They're still trying to figure
out what they want to focus on. I think it's going to take a long
time before they get settled in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with her parents' tragic death gave Twain the courage to
move to Nashville in 1990, three years after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being told no in my career,'' she says, ``was nothing compared
to what I had been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the first piece of professional advice Eilleen
Twain received was to get rid of her name. Still grieving for her
parents, she wanted to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, she recalled the first name of an Ojibway
wardrobe mistress she'd once worked with _ Shania, pronounced
``shuh-NY-uh,'' which means ``I'm on my way.'' It seemed fitting.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been on her way, but her debut CD, filled with
songs written by the leading lights of Nashville, flopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mutt hadn't come along,'' she says, ``I don't know what
would have happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange was already a successful music producer who had worked
with such stars as Bryan Adams, Def Leppard and Foreigner. After
listening to Twain's CD, he asked to hear some of her own songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' she recalls, ``he said, `You need to record your
music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, in December 1993, they married. A year after
that, their first collaboration, ``The Woman in Me,'' took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a spontaneous person,'' Twain says with a smile, ``but
there was no hesitation about marrying Mutt. We were both so
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-something Lange, who shies away from publicity, is
credited as Twain's co-writer on her recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love writing together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Given the couple's frequent work-related separations, though,
Twain says she's not surprised that tabloid-television shows have
been claiming that her marriage is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fabricated,'' she says immediately. ``We're very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple will be separated even more later this year, as Twain
gears up for her first international tour. Most of the time she'll
be traveling alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see each other, but he couldn't be with me all the
time,'' she says of her in-demand husband, who's now working with
Michael Bolton and the Backstreet Boys. ``He's busy doing his own
thing, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, after having served as de-facto parent to her
siblings, Twain is in no hurry to experience parenthood itself. And
she's getting no pressure from Lange, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough time as it is,'' the singer says. ``It
wouldn't be fair to the child. Maybe we'll be ready someday, but
not now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment she's happy concentrating on her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remind myself,'' Twain says, ``that if I don't get
everything possible out of my career, I'll look back with regret.
So I'm going to keep on doing what I do until people don't want me
to do it anymore!''

DENNIS QUAID STEPS BEHIND THE CAMERA

 Includes a color slide of Dennis Quaid with Ryan Merriman in a
scene from ``Everything That Rises.'' 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I was up at 7, got the cereal and fruit out, made sure he had
his vitamins, checked the lunch box, took him to school and got in
line,'' actor Dennis Quaid says, ticking off his morning with his
6-year-old son, Jack.
 &HT;    If this seems an unlikely agenda for Dennis Quaid, the Hollywood
wild man who battled cocaine and alcohol addiction during the 1980s
and early 1990s, who earned a reputation for on-set problems and
who vacillated between riveting performances and by-the-numbers
hack work, it still shouldn't surprise anyone.
 &HT;    Since marrying Meg Ryan seven years ago, Quaid has mellowed.
These days, he's taken firm control of a career which was
jump-started by ``Breaking Away'' (1978) and re-energized in 1983
by his role as cocky Gordon Cooper in ``The Right Stuff,'' before
bogging down in a sea of mediocrities spiked only occasionally by
strong performances in such films as ``The Big Easy'' (1987) and
``Wyatt Earp'' (1994).
 &HT;    The actor readily agrees that his career, like his life, had
lost its way.
 &HT;    ``I started to really lose it around the time of `Great Balls of
Fire!' (1989),'' Quaid admits, sipping his morning coffee at a Los
Angeles hotel. ``I lost where I was going.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``I like my life now.''
 &HT;    Credit that to a happy marriage and a beloved son.
 &HT;    ``We're not into all that Hollywood stuff,'' he says.
``Actually, when I'm filming, I miss the ordinary things of being a
parent. We're really into tee-ball right now. Tonight we're having
a first sleepover with one of the kids from school. No sleep
tonight!''
 &HT;    Quaid met Ryan on the set of their first film together,
``Innerspace'' (1987), but they became a couple only during their
second pairing, ``D.O.A.'' (1988). They married in 1991, after a
year's postponement while he went into rehab.
 &HT;    ``She stayed in there and stuck it out with me,'' Quaid says.
``It was a big test in life _ on me and on her and on the
relationship _ but we really loved each other enough to hang in
there.''
 &HT;    So gone forever are his wild-and-crazy days.
 &HT;    ``Thank God I didn't have a kid when I was in my party days,''
he says. ``It would have been impossible. I had all that. That was
another life. This is my life now, and I just embrace it.''
 &HT;    Emblematic of that life is his directorial debut with the TNT
movie ``Everything That Rises.''
 &HT;    At 44, Quaid is now playing fathers offscreen and on, both in
``Everything That Rises'' and in a remake of ``The Parent Trap''
(1961), due later this summer.
 &HT;    The former, premiering July 12 on TNT, offers the challenge of
directing, as well as a meaty role as an emotionally distant
Montana farmer, Jim Clay, struggling to hold onto his family land
while dealing with a crisis that threatens his family _ his wife
(Mare Winningham) and son (Ryan Merriman).
 &HT;    ```Everything That Rises' means everything rises and falls and
comes back up in life,'' Quaid says. ``The Clays can't afford to
live on their land because outsiders have moved into the area and
driven up the price of land. That's going on today in the same
place where we filmed the movie.''
 &HT;    Shot in 31 days _ ``we had 32 to do it in,'' the fledgeling
director says proudly _ the film was more complicated than Quaid
had expected.
 &HT;    ``Location scouting, making sure a shirt looks good against the
palette, casting ... I cast everybody, but I had no idea how to
hire an art director,'' he admits, laughing. ``All of a sudden
these art directors are coming in to have meetings, and I'm sitting
there with my mouth open _ I knew how to talk to actors, but art
directors?''
 &HT;    Originally written in the 1960s and set in Wyoming, the updated
script is set in Montana, a place Quaid knows well. He and Ryan own
a vast spread in Montana, including four sleeping cabins and a main
house, christened Camp Warren Oates, after the actor who sold them
the place.
 &HT;    ``I had been coming there for 20 years,'' Quaid says. ``Our
first location in Paradise Valley was two miles from my house. So I
knew that area really well: When the script called for a ravine, I
knew just the one. When I needed blue skies, fluffy clouds against
miles of nowhere, I knew where to go.''
 &HT;    Quaid also felt he truly knew the people of Montana.
 &HT;    ``That's why I chose this movie for my directorial debut,'' he
says. ``Directing had always been in the back of my mind, but it
was a question of finding material that would touch me deeply
enough to want to spend that much time with it.
 &HT;    ``When you just act, there's a lot of downtime,'' he adds.
``Directing needed all my attention and a lot of stamina. I was
amazed at all the minutia that goes into making a movie that I
really abhor as an actor. I became obsessed by it all.''
 &HT;    Set against Montana's landscape, the film's dramatic fulcrum is
a complex father-son relationship.
 &HT;    ``Certainly one of the themes of the story is this
relationship,'' the actor says. ``It's very central to what's
happening around them.''
 &HT;    Pushing his son to become a man, Clay lacks the skills to be a
skilled, nurturing dad.
 &HT;    ``Jim Clay has feelings,'' Quaid says in his character's
defense. ``All of us as parents _ and I'm in no way like Jim, but I
understand some things about him, like doing the best you can. I
see myself making mistakes, too. We're all sort of stabbing in the
dark as parents, sometimes.
 &HT;    ``Jim had feelings,'' he adds. ``He just didn't know he was
having them. Men of the '60s were shut-down men. They came out of
the era of the Depression, and times were hard _ your feelings and
kids weren't top priority.''
 &HT;    Born in Houston, Quaid had a much different real-life
relationship with his own dad, who died 10 years ago.
 &HT;    ``My father was a very affectionate guy,'' the novice director
recalls. ``Looking back now, I have so much respect for him, and
I'm so proud that he rose above his own relationship with his dad,
who was never around.
 &HT;    ``My dad was like a kid himself,'' he adds. ``Sure, he had his
own issues sometimes about expressing emotions, but he was real big
on the touchy-feely thing. I try to keep that going in my house _
lots of hugs and kisses going on. And my dad had a real sense of
humor.''
 &HT;    Besides instilling a sense of humor in Jack, Quaid also wants to
show him a sense of right and wrong.
 &HT;    ``Also that he can do whatever he wants to do if he applies
himself to it,'' the actor says. ``Feel good about himself _
self-esteem is a big issue. It's a big issue for us as adults,
too.''
 &HT;    Near the end of the movie, Jim Clay, after an emotional scene
with his son, says ``It's important to finish what you start.''
 &HT;    What does Dennis Quaid have to finish?
 &HT;    ``Besides everything?'' he says, flashing his trademark grin.
 &HT;    ``Parenting is an ongoing process,'' he says, turning serious.
``You just don't ever put that project down. There are times I'd
like to have a thought just to myself _ I need my 30 minutes of
privacy. But then I'm ready again.
 &HT;    ``Right now,'' he adds, ``I'm getting ready to star in Jack's
first directorial project, `Space Cases.'''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``Great casting, don't you think?''

KIRSTEN DUNST: GROWING UP TO FACE `SMALL SOLDIERS' 
</HEADLINE>

 Includes a color slide of Kirsten Dunst in a scene from ``Small
Soldiers.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Anyone who saw prepubescent Kirsten Dunst passionately kissing
Brad Pitt in ``Interview with the Vampire'' (1994), or later as a
raunchy hooker frustrating saintly George Clooney on ``ER,''
wouldn't have her pegged as the playing-with-dolls type.
 &HT;    After all, she was tough enough to hold her own with Robert De
Niro and Dustin Hoffman in ``Wag the Dog'' (1997) and handle the
title role in the recent television movie, ``15 and Pregnant''
(1998).
 &HT;    But that's just one side of her.
 &HT;    ``I loved Barbie dolls, and I used to always wear these nice
little Alice in Wonderland costumes my mom bought me one year,''
Dunst recalls. ``I loved My Little Pony, Lady Lovelylocks and
Barbie dolls, and I watched `Full House' all the time when I was
little.''
 &HT;    The young actress's past and present collide in her latest film,
``Small Soldiers,'' opening nationwide on July 10.
 &HT;    A science-fiction action/comedy, ``Soldiers'' casts Dunst as a
kid from suburban Ohio who finds herself enmeshed in a war between
bands of new, high-tech action figures, toy soldiers with minds of
their own.
 &HT;    ```Small Soldiers' is basically a fun family film,'' the
speed-talking, effusive 16-year-old says by telephone during a
break from shooting ``Dick,'' her next film.
 &HT;    ``It's really for everyone,'' she says. ``There are so many good
comedians in it, like Phil Hartman and Jay Mohr and Denis Leary,
and there are jokes for all ages.
 &HT;    ``I'm the heroine, and I save my friend Alan (Gregory Smith) a
few times,'' she adds. ``That's good, the girl saving the guy for a
change. Actually, I save a lot of people.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Dunst spent much of her time on the film by
herself, acting opposite dolls that would later be added by
computer.
 &HT;    ``All of these things were attacking me, and nothing was there
to actually attack me,'' Dunst says. ``It was all up to me to make
it happen, to imagine these dolls crawling all over me, tying me
up, flipping me over.
 &HT;    ``I'd done `Jumanji' (1996), where I acted with nothing, but
this was different because they were supposed to be on me, all over
me,'' Dunst says. ``It was really weird.''
 &HT;    On a sadder note, ``Soldiers'' represents Dunst's third and
final collaboration with Phil Hartman, who died along with his wife
in a murder/suicide in May.
 &HT;    Hartman plays Dunst's father in ``Soldiers,'' after also playing
her dad in ``Greedy'' (1994). They also worked together on ``Kiki's
Delivery Service,'' a direct-to-video animated feature due for
release in the fall.
 &HT;    ``We got along well, and he was so funny,'' Dunst says. ``What
happened was such a tragedy, and I just hope his kids will be OK.''
 &HT;    It may seem odd that so young an actress could have done three
films with Hartman, not to mention movies with Tom Cruise, Kirk
Douglas, Michael J. Fox, Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Susan Sarandon
and Wynona Ryder. Actually, though, the native of Point Pleasant,
N.J., is a grizzled veteran of sorts, having been acting for 13
years _ since she turned 3.
 &HT;    ``From that age to now, I can't think of anything I'd rather
do,'' she says. ``I have such a passion for playing all different
kinds of roles. I just love it so much. I can't think of any other
career I'd want to have.
 &HT;    ``I also want to direct and write and start my own production
company,'' she bubbles. ``I have one book that I want to turn into
a movie, so I already have things clicking in my head for what I
want to do.''
 &HT;    She may seem like a natural, but Dunst insists that she's worked
hard to get where she is.
 &HT;    ``If it were so easy more people would be doing it,'' she says.
``I work so hard to try to make it look easy. I've worked very hard
with my acting coach. I worked especially hard on `Vampire,'
because that was such a hard concept to get at such a young age. I
was only 10.
 &HT;    ``My acting coach helped me understand everything as much as I
could,'' she recalls, ``because you can't act what you don't
understand. That's what I think, anyway.''
 &HT;    At present, she admits, she's caught in an awkward niche, too
old for kiddie roles and too young for adult parts.
 &HT;    ``There aren't a lot of roles for young women my age that are
really meaningful,'' she says. ``Right now, I'd still say that
`Vampire' was my best performance. It was so difficult, and I love
to be challenged.''
 &HT;    The roles may not be as meaty as she'd like, but Dunst is
definitely in demand. Since wrapping ``Small Soldiers,'' she's
already finished ``Strike,'' in which she plays a girl whose father
divorces her mother to marry the mother's sister, and ``Dick,'' a
comedy/drama set during the Watergate era that co-stars Michelle
Williams.
 &HT;    ``The basic story of `Dick' is that these two young girls who
are kind of daffy and airheady end up as secret youth advisers to
President Nixon, and we see all this information that we shouldn't
see about Watergate,'' Dunst says.
 &HT;    ``People were telling me a lot about Watergate, because I didn't
learn about it in school,'' she adds. ``It's not important to my
character, because she's a bit of an airhead _ or to the film,
really, because it's more about my friendship with Michelle.''
 &HT;    Following ``Dick,'' Dunst shot a spoof entitled ``Dairy
Queens,'' and in July she'll be in Toronto to star in ``The Virgin
Suicides.'' A black comedy written and directed by Sofia Coppola,
daughter of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, ``Suicides'' will also
feature James Woods and Kathleen Turner.
 &HT;    Dunst relishes the diversity of her roles and projects to date,
but makes no bones about her eagerness to graduate to more mature
roles.
 &HT;    ``There are so many roles right now that I'd love to do that I'm
way too young for or that I'm just missing,'' she says glumly.
``It's hard to make that transition from teen-ager to adulthood as
an actress.
 &HT;    ``I played a street hooker on `ER' and was pregnant in `15 and
Pregnant,' but it's tough to be too young for something you want so
badly,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``I remember that I went in to read for `Romeo and Juliet' when
I was 13,'' she recalls. ``They just looked at me and said I was
too young. I had to accept that and think, `What's meant to be is
meant to be.'
 &HT;    ``That's how I look at things,'' Dunst says. ``I'll be right for
something one day, and someone else will be too young for it _
that's just how it works.''
 &HT;    Though Dunst aspires to stardom and a career like that of her
heroine, actress/director Jodie Foster, she says she doesn't put
any pressure on herself nor, for that matter, does she let anyone
else pressure her.
 &HT;    ``I'm doing this for myself and not for other people,'' she
says. ``Acting is what I love to do, and I just want to keep
grounded as I go along. It's nice if people compliment you, but you
have to know that's right in your heart.
 &HT;    ``My mom treats me like a normal 16-year-old,'' she says. ``I
have a very normal life at home, and I go to a regular school and
hang out with good friends.
 &HT;    ``So I just try to keep normal. I think it's working so far.''

 c.1998 Family Circle

<TEXT>
<P>
   Patsy Colley had no idea she was having a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old was the first up that Saturday morning. She
began making breakfast for her friends at a North Carolina beach
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nausea hit me when I was separating slices of bacon with a
fork and thought, `I can't stand the smell,''' Colley recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She told her friends that she felt sick, and her back ached the
way it had during labor 23 years earlier, when her daughter was
born. Late that evening she vomited.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends thought she had the flu. One gave her an aspirin,
which may have saved her life by thinning her blood.
</P>
<P>
   Most women, if faced with similar circumstances, wouldn't think
``heart attack.'' According to a recent American Heart Association
survey, only 8 percent of women realize that heart disease and
stroke are their greatest health threat. Almost two-thirds think
it's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But cardiovascular disease _ an umbrella term for heart disease,
stroke and other blood-vessel disorders _ kills nearly twice as
many women as all forms of cancer combined. The toll: More than
500,000 women a year and, since 1984, more women than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that women are reasonably protected against heart
disease until menopause,'' says Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chancellor
emeritus at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ``But then they
catch up with men very rapidly.''
 &UR; TAKING WOMEN SERIOUSLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently most doctors weren't aware of the seriousness of
heart disease in women, says Dr. Nanette Wenger, professor of
medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tody Berls, of Mobile, Ala., says that when she suffered chest
pains 19 years ago, doctors discounted her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it was stress,'' the 51-year-old recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors actually suggested she buy a new dress or ask her
husband to take her out to dinner. It wasn't until she had a heart
attack in 1988 that she got the treatment she needed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that emergency-room staff still don't
evaluate and treat women's chest pain as aggressively as men's.
Women are also less likely to get front-line medications such as
aspirin, which thins the blood, and beta blockers, which reduce the
cardiac workload.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the gender difference may be due to what Wenger calls
``information bias.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done as good a job as we should in community
education,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, women may refuse tests or treatments more often
than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' she adds, ``women typically don't go to the doctor
until pain is severe and has lasted longer'' _ when they're no
longer likely to benefit from these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Women also tend to come to ERs later in life _ a difference that
can change the way doctors handle their cases. On average, women
have heart attacks at 73, while the average male sufferer is 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people's heart attacks are less likely to be treated as
aggressively,'' says Dr. Robert Jesse, co-director of acute cardiac
care at Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of
Virginia Hospitals in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   This timidity results in part from fear of causing serious side
effects such as stroke, he says.
 &UR; FACING FACTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like so many women, Patsy Colley never worried about her heart
health _ nor about her smoking habit, her regular
sausage-egg-and-cheese breakfast or her exercise regimen, which
consisted of walking the dog.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of her getaway weekend, Colley promised her friends
she'd call her doctor. He discovered that she was suffering a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance took her to Virginia Commonwealth, where she
underwent angioplasty. Doctors threaded a thin tube called a
catheter, to which was attached a tiny deflated balloon, through
her artery to the blockage. They then inflated the balloon, pushing
open the artery and restoring normal blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who undergo angioplasty fare about as well as those who
have bypass operations, in which surgeons reroute blood around
blockages with a blood vessel implanted from another part of the
body. But in as many as half of angioplasty patients, swelling at
the blockage site narrows vessels again, sometimes requiring
further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that setback, Colley's doctors implanted three stents _
expandable, coil-like metal tubes _ to maintain the opening.
Research suggests stents provide added insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Over six weeks Colley recovered fully. She stopped smoking and
began eating less fat and taking daily walks, sometimes swimming or
riding a stationary bike as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``During heart attacks portrayed on TV, men grab their chests
and fall over,'' she says. ``It might not happen that way for you.
You've got to learn the signs and give up dangerous health
habits.''
 &UR; REDUCING YOUR RISK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both genders share many of the same heart-disease risk factors:
advancing age, smoking, a high-fat diet, obesity, stress, a
sedentary life style, high blood pressure, diabetes, high
cholesterol and a genetic predisposition.
</P>
<P>
   But women do face special risks. Here's what experts recommend
to counter them:
</P>
<P>
   + Get active.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows women tend to be more sedentary than men, which
is as dangerous as high cholesterol, high blood pressure or
cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription: Get your doctor's OK to start an exercise program,
perhaps walking three times weekly for half an hour each time.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep blood pressure in check.
</P>
<P>
   Men are more likely to have high blood pressure before age 55.
Thereafter, though, women are more at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription: If you're overweight, try to slim down. Exercise,
and limit sodium and alcohol intake.
</P>
<P>
   Getting at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily is still
recommended to keep blood pressure normal, but now Harvard
researchers have found potassium to be even more protective. Other
experts recommend a combination of these two minerals, along with
magnesium.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is particularly dangerous for women who use
birth-control pills or who are on hormone-replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Both can encourage blood clotting, but when either is combined
with smoking, ``the risk goes out of sight,'' says Dr. Gordon A.
Ewy, chief of cardiology at the University of Arizona College of
Medicine in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking also makes the heart beat faster and harder, and can
damage arterial linings.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription: Particularly if you are on the Pill or HRT, quit
smoking. Ask a doctor about medical interventions that can help,
such as a nicotine patch.
</P>
<P>
   + Monitor your cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Women's cholesterol numbers tend to be low when they are young,
but after 45 they may rise. The average woman between 35 and 44 has
a total cholesterol level of 195 milligrams per deciliter _
anything under 200 is healthy. After 45, though, her level can rise
well above 200. After 55, more women than men have high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Further confusing the issue is HDL _ or ``good'' _ cholesterol,
which is beneficial to heart health. The latest research suggests
low levels of HDL are a stronger predictor of heart disease in
women than in men. Smoking and being overweight or sedentary can
reduce HDL.
</P>
<P>
   Elevated triglycerides, another fat in the blood, may also be
especially dangerous to women. And high blood levels of
homocysteine may encourage clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription: To keep cholesterol in check, exercise, lose
weight, quit smoking if you smoke and eat a diet high in fiber and
low in fat, particularly saturated fat. Recent research also
suggests that diets high in vitamins B6, B12 and folate reduce
homocysteine.
</P>
<P>
   + Consider hormone-replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Before menopause, estrogen protects by keeping HDL levels up and
reducing risk of developing plaque _ fatty deposits that interfere
with circulation and lead to heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription: When you're approaching menopause, talk to your
doctor about HRT. The hormones may help protect against heart
disease and osteoporosis, but for some may heighten the risk of
breast or uterine cancer. You and your doctor must weigh all of
your risks.

<P>
   Any parent has heard horror stories about vaccinations _ bad
reactions to shots, unnecessary and expensive treatments, even
vaccinations that caused the diseases they were supposed to cure.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories resonate, says Dr. Mark Sawyer, an
infectious-disease specialist at the School of Medicine at the
University of California at San Diego, but they don't really tell
much about vaccinations. The benefits far outweigh the mild risks,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious vaccine reactions are rare,'' the doctor says.
``Possible mild side effects, such as low fever and slight swelling
of the injection site, have to be weighed against the possible
risks of the diseases themselves, which can be very serious or even
fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, American children are better protected by vaccines than
ever. Since 1992, the immunization rate for children between 19
months and 35 months has increased from 55 percent to an all-time
high of 78 percent, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Still, getting the right shots in the right sequence and at the
optimal time isn't always easy, especially since recommendations
change as new or safer vaccines become available.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, the Food and Drug Administration
approved an improved vaccine against whooping cough that has fewer
side effects than the previous one. FDA approval of a new vaccine
to protect against rotavirus, the leading cause of severe diarrhea,
is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at seven common vaccine myths, along with the
latest scientific information on the shots your kids need: &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; MYTH NO. 1: VACCINES CAN DAMAGE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE ILLNESSES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the whole idea behind vaccines is to prevent disease,
they work to augment _ not damage _ the immune system,'' says Dr.
Celine Hanson, a clinical immunologist and director of the
immunization program at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.
``When your child is given a killed or inactivated bacteria or
virus in a vaccine, his body reacts by producing antibodies that
will prevent the onset of a particular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The myth that vaccines are dangerous originates with a small but
extremely vocal group of opponents, Sawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDC statistics show that 1 percent or less of Americans are so
strongly against immunizations that they ask for an exemption from
the vaccines that are mandatory before children can attend
school,'' he says. ``Some object to shots on religious grounds, or
believe their children have been injured by vaccines.''
 &UR; MYTH NO. 2: VACCINES CAN CAUSE SIDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most often, this claim concerns the DTP shot, until recently
recommended against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping
cough.
</P>
<P>
   But a study conducted in 1991 by the Washington-based Institute
of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, showed
no evidence of any causal relationship between the DTP shot and
sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply by chance, some babies who get the shots may later die
of SIDS, but the events aren't connected,'' Hanson says.
``Similarly, some people who eat bread may subsequently crash their
cars, but the bread they ate is not what caused them to crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall risk of serious injury from vaccines is less than
0.1 percent, estimates Dr. Michael Marcy, professor of pediatrics
at the UCLA School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
 &UR; MYTH NO. 3: BREAST-FEEDING PROVIDES IMMUNITIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast-feeding is good for your baby and gives limited
protection against some diseases,'' says Dr. Jan Drutz, associate
professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Your baby will probably have fewer colds and diarrheal
infections if she nurses, but breast-feeding does not inoculate
children against many serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines, unlike breast-feeding, give your baby systemic or
whole-body immunity to a particular illness, says Dr. Blaise
Congeni, director of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital
Medical Center of Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several classes of immunity,'' he says, ``and by
mimicking a real infection, vaccines may induce all of them. So
there's immunity to the disease in your child's bloodstream, her
lymph system and, in some cases such as the oral polio vaccine, her
gastrointestinal tract.''
 &UR; MYTH NO. 4: THE WHOOPING COUGH VACCINE HAS SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new pertussis vaccine, approved for use by the FDA in 1996, is
a significant improvement over the older DTP vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The improved pertussis vaccine, DTaP, greatly reduces the
incidence of fever, fretfulness, drowsiness, vomiting and local
reactions such as swelling and redness associated with the old
vaccine.
 &UR; MYTH NO. 5: CHICKEN POX ISN'T FATAL, SO DON'T VACCINATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the diseases that there's a vaccine for, chicken pox is
the least severe, but it's not a totally benign illness,'' Sawyer
says.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people a year die of it in the United States, and
thousands more are hospitalized with complications such as bone or
staphylococcal infections, pneumonia or toxic shock. These
infections can result when harmful bacteria enter the body through
the skin lesions that typically result from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   No serious reaction has been linked to a child's receiving the
chicken-pox vaccine since 1995, when it first became available for
kids older than 1 year, Sawyer says. The main side effect,
experienced by only a tiny percentage of children, is a mild rash.
</P>
<P>
   Although some parents worry that the chicken-pox vaccine won't
give long-term immunity, there's no evidence that this is true,
Sawyer adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccine has been in use in Japan for 20 years, and adults
there are not developing chicken pox,'' he says. ``Live-virus
vaccines _ like the one for chicken pox _ tend to induce very
strong, lasting immunity, so it's quite unlikely that the
protection would fade.''
 &UR; MYTH NO. 6: KIDS DON'T NEED A POLIO VACCINE ANYMORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because polio was eliminated from the United States by 1979 _
thanks to vaccines _ and from the entire Western Hemisphere by
1994, the need for a polio vaccine may soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But due to frequent travel between the United States and
countries where polio still exists, such as Russia and India,
Sawyer warns that ``an infected traveler could pass along the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Until polio is stamped out worldwide, he adds, ``it would be a
tragedy to stop immunizations and to put kids at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the polio vaccine does not itself cause the
recipient to contract the disease, in 1997 the CDC advised doctors
to switch from giving an oral polio vaccine, which carries a
1-in-750,000 risk of causing polio, to an inactive or killed polio
shot, which poses no risk. The oral form can safely be given for
boosters.
 &UR; MYTH 7: EVERY CHILD SHOULD GET EVERY VACCINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are a small number of children who shouldn't get
certain vaccines or who should have them later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children with AIDS or other disorders of the immune system
should not receive live vaccines, such as the chicken-pox or oral
polio vaccine,'' Congeni says.
</P>
<P>
   For children with seizures, the pertussis part of the DTP
vaccine should be delayed until the cause of the seizures is known
and the child has been seizure-free for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if there's a poorly understood neurological disorder,
Congeni says, some immunizations should be deferred until the
problem has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   If your child has a serious reaction to any vaccine, including a
fever of 104.9 or higher, seizures, limpness, shock, hives or
difficulty breathing, boosters of that shot should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But, barring any immunological impairments or a history of
convulsions or neurological disorders, Marcy says, ``vaccines are
by far the most beneficial of all medical procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Illnesses such as meningitis, diphtheria and polio used to cause
tens of thousands of cases of brain damage, disability and death in
children each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they've virtually disappeared,'' he says. ``Making sure
that your child receives every recommended vaccine is the single
most important step you can take to get him off to a safe, healthy
start in life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever been on the receiving end of an overly ambitious
vegetable garden, you may have had more than your fill of
boat-sized zucchini and buckets of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But a vegetable garden need not be so excessively productive as
to exhaust its gardener. All you need to do is make a sensible
start with reasonable quantities of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   With a little advance planning, you can anticipate the potential
yields of any crop and prepare the size of the planting
accordingly. New gardeners may want to begin modestly to get a feel
for how much food they can handle. Then you can add extra rows to
freeze, dry or can, or to give to nearby hunger centers.
</P>
<P>
   When estimating yields, think about the nature of the harvest. A
leafy green such as lettuce or Swiss chard can be eaten almost in
its entirety, little lost or wasted. Even in small spaces, a large
number of modest-sized lettuce plants can be grown.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, large plants such as rhubarb that need three
feet of garden space each while providing only modest-sized stems
for kitchen use are by nature inefficient. Squeezing 10 lettuce
plants into the same space is not at all difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lowest-yielding vegetables are peas and lima beans. As
vegetables that need to be shucked from pods, they provide ounces
instead of pounds of food. You will have to grow considerably more
to have enough for occasional enjoyment by a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Another variable to consider is the length of time you can
harvest any particular crop. Radishes provide a one-time harvest,
primarily during the cool weather of spring and fall, but can be
planted at weekly intervals during the appropriate season to
provide an extended harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper plants, on the other hand, may start yielding peppers in
July and continue through October. A couple of plants may be all
that are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Use the tips below as a starting point for your planting
estimates: &QL; 
 &UR; GAUGING YOUR CROP YIELDS: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Tomatoes: Three plants per person.
</P>
<P>
   Tomato plants tend to be big producers, and are particularly
reliable if you start with disease-resistant cultivars.
</P>
<P>
   There is some variation in the yield of different classes of
tomatoes. Beefsteak tomatoes, for instance, bear fewer but larger
fruit _ softball-sized tomatoes of a pound or more each.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry tomatoes are just the opposite: They produce hundreds,
even thousands of little, bite-sized tomatoes all through the
summer and into fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes classified as determinate, compact growers such as
``Celebrity,'' ``Floramerica'' and ``Daybreak,'' reach a modest
height and then produce their tomatoes all at once. Their harvest
season is intense but soon over.
</P>
<P>
   Indeterminate tomatoes, including most beefsteak and cherry
tomatoes, keep growing and fruiting as they grow, bringing in a
bigger harvest over a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   + Eggplant: Two plants per person.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental eggplant such as ``Millionaire'' and ``Japanese
Pickling,'' with long, slim fruit and purple, leaflike calyxes at
the top, may be only a quarter or a fifth of the size of large,
oval eggplants.
</P>
<P>
   But they may outdo classic types such as ``Black Beauty,'' which
typically bear four to six large, oval eggplants per year. In
contrast, Oriental eggplants are ready to cut earlier and keep on
coming to offer dozens of little eggplants in all.
</P>
<P>
   + Peppers: Three plants per person.
</P>
<P>
   Choose early-maturing, smaller-fruited types such as ``Gypsy''
and ``Jalapeno'' for the most reliable and abundant yields in
cold-climate areas.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage maximum production, pick peppers when young and
green, which spurs the plant to produce additional fruit. But for
fruitier flavor, forget about high yields and allow peppers to
ripen until they become red, yellow or orange.
</P>
<P>
   + Onions: A quarter-pound of sets for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to getting a large onion harvest is to grow extra-big
onions. You need to get seedlings or sets into the soil at the
first possible moment in spring. This is when they put on the
vigorous growth that translates into huge bulbs later in summer.
</P>
<P>
   But because young onions can falter in cold early-spring
weather, cover them with a plastic or floating row-cover tunnel to
protect them until the weather becomes mild.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to maximize yields is to plant onion sets extra
thickly. Once the green tops stretch up tall, pull out the smaller
plants to use as scallions and leave extra growing room for the
remaining onions.
</P>
<P>
   + Beans: At least 36 bush-bean plants per person, or 15
pole-bean vines per person.
</P>
<P>
   Snap beans are productive and compact plants which, like
lettuce, can be densely planted in small spaces. However, they bear
the bulk of their beans within several weeks, yielding a
concentrated harvest.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the fresh-bean season, make several different
plantings two or three weeks apart in the early to middle summer.
Or plant pole beans, which need trellises to climb, but grow into
vines many times larger than bush-bean plants and produce beans all
summer.
</P>
<P>
   + Cucumbers: Three plants for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   As long as cucumber vines remain healthy _ if protected from
cucumber beetles and resistant to foliage diseases _ they can be
big yielders. To encourage an extended harvest, pick cucumbers when
young, so vines will continue to bear new fruit.
</P>
<P>
   For an extended fresh-cucumber season, plant cucumber seeds
around Memorial Day and also several weeks afterward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughter isn't ready for kindergarten yet. Which is good,
because neither am I.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question _ public vs. private education _ quickly
breaks into myriad other questions, all crucial and all confusing.
As dissatisfaction with the state of American education grows, the
alternatives also grow, creating a plethora of hard-to-evaluate
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Public education has deep roots in our society. A vast empire
involving almost 50 million young people, 88,000 schools and
trillions of dollars, public schools long have been the social
balancing wheel of society, fostering diverse interests, dreams and
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Americans stood by public education through integration in the
1960s, the burgeoning magnet and alternative schools in the 1970s
and the draconian financial cuts of the 1980s. But attitudes have
shifted in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study titled ``Where Connoisseurs Send Their
Children to School,'' Denis Doyle, educational analyst and senior
fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, reported that urban
public-school teachers are more likely to send their children to
private schools. In Jersey City, N.J., 50.3 percent choose private
schools. In San Francisco, it's 36.7 percent, Cleveland is at 39.7
percent and Chicago at 36.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let's not forget home schooling,'' Doyle says. ``It's the
fastest-growing trend in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda and Tommy Teepell of Baton Rouge, La., have home schooled
their four sons, now ages 23, 22, 17 and 14. The boys were in a
Christian school when the Teepells decided to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted more of our family values to be part of our
children's lives,'' she says. ``The boys participated in plenty of
outside activities, such as sports and the 4-H Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life simply turned into a big classroom,'' she adds. ``If we
went shopping, the boys calculated prices. Traveling was a rich
history lesson. The boys matured faster than their peers, and are
extremely independent young men.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1.2 million children are home schooled, according
to the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic schools, because of their affordability and diversity,
remain a leading private option for middle-class parents. And
parochial schools score high academically. Between 1993 and 1996,
parochial enrollment increased by almost 590,000, according to the
Washington-based National Catholic Educational Association.
</P>
<P>
   Private institutions are flourishing across the country. The
Hudson Institute says there are 28,000 private schools nationwide,
with 5.9 million children enrolled, and that private enrollment has
risen faster than public for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, private education is not everyone's favorite option.
Many parents and educators insist that public education is the
cornerstone of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is not just academics _ it's socialization, real
America with all its glory and depravity,'' says Michael Castleman,
a public-school advocate and an author who specializes in health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous commitment,'' adds Castleman, whose two
children survived a difficult search for a public school in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has 15 alternative sites and 59 regular elementary
schools. Castleman and his wife, Anne, along with several hundred
hopeful families, opted for an alternative program. The couple
investigated a dozen schools, keenly aware that their chance of
obtaining a spot in one of the city's five most sought-after
alternatives was slim.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has open enrollment, a process that offers a
modicum of choice: An application places the child's name in a
lottery. Only a handful of families get into their schools of
choice, but the lottery takes certain ZIP codes, a previously
enrolled sibling and ethnic balance into account.
</P>
<P>
   In their search, the Castlemans uncovered an alternative school
that many of their peers had overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco Community Alternative School sits in the middle
of San Francisco's working-class stew,'' Castleman says. ``It's
ethnically and economically diverse. It's not everybody's first
choice, due to location and no after-school care. We were delighted
to receive our letter of acceptance without having to contend with
the arduous appeal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Gjedsted and her husband, Al, did not fare well in the
open-enrollment lottery. They also were reluctant to gamble on an
appeal, so they enrolled their two daughters in an ecclesiastical
girls' school. Within a year, however, they moved them to a
private, secular, coed school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric and the reality of the prestigious girls'
institution didn't match,'' Gjedsted says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Gjedsteds' third child entered preschool,
tuition for three hovered around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hefty chunk of our salaries, but I can't quibble with
the education,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Educator Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at
the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of
Public Affairs and author of ``Charter Schools: Creating Hope and
Opportunity in American Education'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996),
thinks public schools have failed to help many youngsters reach
their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who also co-founded the charter-school movement, says
the cards are stacked against children's being steered toward their
highest potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achievement and accountability are not emphasized,'' he says.
``Schools receive no extra federal or state monies for parent
participation or high test scores _ many innovative educators feel
stifled.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan cites numerous examples throughout his book of teachers'
successes which have been marginalized, their ideas ignored or
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Nathan helped spearhead the Minnesota charter-school
movement, a reform in public education that has spread to 29
states.
</P>
<P>
   Charters are public schools in which teachers, parents and
community members work together to decide on educational programs
and curricula. As public schools, receiving tax money, they are
accountable to the state, as well as to the parents and the
community, for academic results. But they operate independently of
most district and state regulations, cutting through bureaucratic
red tape that may hinder other public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Not every parent feels the need for such innovations as charter
schools, open enrollment or lotteries. Lloyd and Lori Thacker of
Portland, Ore., sent their elder son, Jacob, to a suburban
neighborhood school. They feel lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a perfect school, but Jacob received a solid
education,'' says Lloyd Thacker, who himself is a counselor at a
Jesuit-run private high school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lori Thacker admits she wonders if 5-year-old Sam will get
the same education as his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel burdened by recent local tax attitudes,'' she says.
``People don't understand the relationship between the polls and
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Portland followed a growing trend: Like one in four
local districts nationwide, its voters rejected higher property
taxes _ a boost for property owners, but a blow for schools, which
are funded by federal money and local property taxes. Fiscal cuts
often mean fewer enrichment programs and more leaky roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The educational schism isn't likely to disappear anytime soon.
More choice, not less, is the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   These dichotomies have taught me to prioritize and become
proactive in my search. I've learned to compare schools and family
needs, to look into after-school programs, computers, art,
libraries, physical education and more. I've become accustomed to
asking questions, talking to principals and networking with other
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, the process isn't simple. Even with the amount of
data I've uncovered, I'm still not sure which route _ public or
private _ my daughter will take when she starts school.

<P>
   But as long these disingenuous dilettantes insist on giving rich
people a worse reputation than they already have, the owners and
players might as well use the down time to get pro basketball
right.
</P>
<P>
   Fellas, don't come back without these things fixed:
</P>
<P>
   MARIJUANA TESTING: As a fan of civil liberties, the business of
drug-testing is usually an unwarranted intrusion into jobs that
don't involve public safety. But as a bigger fan of accountability
in pro sports, a small impingement of rights for a handful of tall,
sweaty guys is worth it, for no other reason than to eliminate my
reporter's dilemma every time I encounter a player whose clothes
reek of herb.
</P>
<P>
   VAN GUNDY RULE: Institute a prohibition against any coach
leaving the bench for the purpose of becoming a player ankleweight.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE CONTRACTS: This nonsense of free agency after three years
in the league was one of the worst ideas since honey-flavored bee
repellant. The three-year minimum works against player development
and breaks apart teams just as fans begin to warm up. Raise the
rookie minimum pay, make contracts a five-year minimum, and
apologize profusely to any citizen who walks near an NBA ticket
window.
</P>
<P>
   EXPANSION: No more until either the Vancouver Grizzlies win a
championship or the sun goes supernova, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   REFEREES: Whatever percentage of the league's gross revenues the
players get, make sure the referees get at least 1 percent. Much of
the fate of the league rests of the judgment of these impoverished
officials, who are so distracted fending off the IRS that they
can't afford to peddle on the street their plane tickets, much less
their traditional pencils in a cup.
</P>
<P>
   FORKED TONGUES: Offer fan instruction on the high level of
disbelief required whenever the league or an owner says money was
lost on a season. Not yet born to this planet is a child so stupid
he cannot make money owning an NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Any claim to losses is strictly a matter of poor management and
not a failure of a system. Any team official claiming otherwise is
assessed a $10 million fine and sentenced to Milli Vanilli School
of Golf for improving one's lie.
</P>
<P>
   IRRESPONSIBLE PATERNITY: Not as big a problem as it would
appear. Think of it this way: Imagine how great the high school
basketball will be in this area in 10 years or so, when all of
Shawn Kemp's kids are sophomores or better.
</P>
<P>
   THE JORDAN RULE: For the next seven years of his NBA playing
career, make it policy to have Michael Jordan threaten to retire at
the end of each season so NBC can milk the artificial drama for all
its playoff ratings value. The empty threat also allows Jordan to
manipulate the trembling league and its various teams into begging
for his returns.
</P>
<P>
   What? Oh, sorry. Policy already implemented.
</P>
<P>
   BEATING ON PEOPLE: Instead of spending millions force-feeding us
a mostly unwanted WNBA, the NBA could do women a real service by
elevating domestic abuse to a suspendable act _ including owners as
well as players.
</P>
<P>
   Even the historically laggard NFL beat the NBA to that
(non)punch by implementing, beginning Wednesday, a league-wide
no-violence policy that can mean suspension for any player
convicted of a violent crime, destruction of property or using a
deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue has the guts to make it
work is another matter. But if NBA commissioner David Stern had
such a tool, Latrell Sprewell would be on the street corner with
the refs scalping plane tickets for food.
</P>
<P>
   DECIBELS: Use of jet engines, jackhammers, autobody compactors,
Saturn booster rockets, leftover World War II ordnance and other
standard NBA arena audio equipment is strictly prohibited.
Violators subject to a Kenny G concert.
</P>
<P>
   USE OF THIRD PERSON: As types like Larry Johnson say, for
example, ``What's best for Larry Johnson isn't always best for the
team, but you know who Larry Johnson is looking out for.''
Desirable as it may be to keep one's name in print _ particularly
since no one will care a lick about Johnson once he's done stealing
the Knicks' money _ elimination of use of the third person will end
the automatic assumption that the speaker's ego is in direct
disproportion to his talent.
</P>
<P>
   INSTITUTE TIE GAMES: It's working so well for soccer's World
Cup, there must be something to it.
</P>
<P>
   VERDICT OF HISTORY: Vow never again to engage in any public
behavior that by comparison makes Don King look like a paragon of
integrity, restraint and common sense.

ANGELS RISE ABOVE INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It occurred to Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins
during an eight-game suspension that his team didn't need him much.
During his hiatus, the result of a bench-clearing brawl against the
Kansas City Royals, the Angels won six of eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the eight games before that. We won all eight of
them and I didn't do much then, either,'' Collins said. ``I just
sat there, watching, trying not to screw things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Collins, the second-year manager of the Angels,
didn't mess up a thing. In fact, the only ones who have tilted the
Angels' halo lately are the San Diego Padres. They won two out
three during the weekend, the first time in a month the Angels have
lost a series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Angels have won 21 of 27 games this month and have a
2{-game lead in the American League West. It's the best month in
the club's 38-year history. And it's not over yet. Tonight, back
home in Anaheim, they'll finish off June against the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not that they are winning, it's that they are winning
despite a rash of injuries. The catcher is on the disabled list. So
is the second baseman. The right fielder is hurting and so are most
of the starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new there, of course. All teams experience injuries. But
this? ``The DL is totally out of our control,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The team brought in rookie Justin Baughman _ he was in the
California League last year at this time _ to play second base. He
has responded with a .274 average, including four hits Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also brought in inexperienced pitcher Jarrod Washburn
from the minors. The left-hander has responded with a 4-0 record
and a 3.38 ERA. The Angels have won all six of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they're good enough or they're not,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when the blissful month of June passes, in July,
and August, and September...?
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're going to be in the race,'' Angels general
manager Bill Bavasi said. ``We don't expect to run away with it and
we don't think anyone's going to run away from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the makeup of this team and because of some of our
starting pitching, that'll keep us out of any long losing
streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to 1995:
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were humming along with a 10{-game lead in
mid-August. Then poof! _ two nine-game losing streaks in the final
47 games knocked them into second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of our four outfielders, our shortstop, some of our
pitchers... they were here then, they remember,'' Bavasi said.
``The word is `experience.' I sense our guys are very realistic.
They don't sugarcoat anything. They know it's a daily grind. If we
win, they enjoy it for a time, then come back the next day. If they
lose, they brood for a while, then forget it and come back the next
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were nearly no-hit Saturday _ the Padres' Sterling
Hitchcock beat them 5-1 with a two-hitter _ but Sunday, the Angels
battered the National League-best Padres 11-3, only the ninth time
in 39 games the Padres lost at home.
</P>
<P>
   Call it realism or maturity, but after Saturday's loss, Phil
Nevin, who broke up Hitchcock's no-hitter with a leadoff homer in
the eighth inning, said, ``For a month now the ball's been bouncing
our way. That isn't going to go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but there's no denying the Angels are a force in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started putting everything together,'' Collins said. ``We
pitched, we hit, we fielded. We got the whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't have the whole package.
</P>
<P>
   A major part, right fielder Tim Salmon (.270, 15 home runs, 41
RBI), has been bothered by an injury to his left foot. He was able
to pinch hit on Sunday, his first appearance in six games, and will
probably be able for designated-hitter duties tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three-fifths of the starting rotation is on the
disabled list, although that, too, will change. Allen Watson, who
was placed on the DL on May 24 (tendinitis, left flexor muscle) is
set to return, likely tonight. But, Collins said, don't assume
Watson will immediately return to the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   All part of not messing with a good thing.

MARINER MESS: BIG BATS NO LONGER MAKE UP FOR SHORTCOMINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners have tumbled from the top to the bottom
in the American League West this season because for too long they
defied a baseball bromide _ that superior pitching and defense win
pennants.
</P>
<P>
   The M's won two division championships the previous three
seasons while bucking the maxim, but their inconsistent pitching
and horrible defense have caught up with them _ translation: 34-48
_ this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say that,'' right fielder Jay Buhner said. ``I've
always been a believer that pitching and defense wins games, but
over the past couple of years the mental aspect (of having to score
so many runs to win) kind of wears on you.''
</P>
<P>
   After 82 games this season, the Mariners are last in fielding
with a league-high 75 errors, and 10th in pitching with a 5.15
earned-run average. Such shortcomings were overlooked in 1995, when
the Mariners came within two wins of the AL championship despite
having the 12th-worst defense in the league; in '96, when Seattle
challenged for the division title with the ninth-worst defense and
11th-ranked pitching staff; and in '97, when they won the West with
a 12th-ranked defense and 11th-ranked pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   While other postseason teams relied on pitching and defense,
offense was the name of the Mariners' game. And it worked for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   They sent baseballs over fences (setting an AL record last
season with 264 homers), scored more runs than anyone and captured
the fans' fancy, luring nearly 3.2 million spectators to the
Kingdome and another 2-plus million on the road. They were a
popular and productive team and fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite having their weaknesses exposed by the Baltimore
Orioles in the AL Division Series last October, the idea was to
allow the star-studded lineup _ five position players have All-Star
experience _ another opportunity to reach the World Series. Those
slick Mariner ads say you have to love these guys, but the win
column does not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan was to keep the team intact and then try to add
to the bullpen,'' said Woody Woodward, the team's vice president of
baseball operations. ``We felt we had solid starting pitching. When
we took the field with any of those three guys (Randy Johnson, Jeff
Fassero and Jamie Moyer), we were always in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As the M's approach the All-Star break this season, they still
are hitting a lot of home runs (127) and the bullpen is
inconsistent (14 blown saves). Johnson (7-6) only recently has
demonstrated the enthusiasm and stuff that made him the game's most
dominating pitcher this decade. Fielding miscues are almost a daily
occurrence, clutch hitting has been sporadic and home attendance
has declined 9 percent, from a 37,987 average a year ago to 34,540
now.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lead the league in homers and runners left on base.
They also share the role of most-disappointing team with the
underachieving Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some great players,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``A
great shortstop (Alex Rodriguez). A great center fielder (Ken
Griffey Jr.). We've got some really good players, like Edgar
Martinez, David Segui, Dan Wilson ... and what we don't do around
them is a damn shame. I'd hate for this team's legacy to be, `a
damn shame.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are several factors for the Mariners' surprising demise
this season:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Management telling Johnson in November that his contract
would not be extended beyond this season _ and then failing to
trade him _ which backfired big-time. Johnson predictably went into
a mental funk that has damaged his performance and hurt team
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The failure to address the obvious need of bolstering team
speed, especially in the leadoff spot. Second baseman Joey Cora is
a fan favorite, but he is not a prototype leadoff batter and is
making far too many errors.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Salary constraints prevented the M's from re-signing left
fielder Roberto Kelly, who made $750,000 last season and batted
.298 after being acquired from Minnesota (.308 in the playoffs). He
eventually signed with the Texas Rangers for $1.65 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Signing free agent Glenallen Hill as Kelly's replacement
was a good bargain ($300,000) but didn't solve the team's speed
shortcomings and added a third defensive liability to go with Cora
and third baseman Russ Davis.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The failure to upgrade the bullpen. The M's did not make
an offer to Randy Myers _ a Vancouver, Wash., native who saved 45
games for the Orioles last season and wanted to play for the
Mariners _ or Rod Beck, both available on the free-agent market. By
the time $3 million was added to the payroll, Myers already had
signed with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The M's then re-signed erratic Bobby Ayala to a two-year, $1.5
million contract and Heathcliff Slocumb to a one-year, $3 million
deal, giving Seattle the highest-paid bullpen in the majors. They
both have ERAs over 7.00 and have combined for just 11 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocks me that they are in last place,'' said Peter
Gammons, ESPN's top baseball analyst. ``I never thought the
pitching could fall that far, and one of my criticisms is they
didn't change the bullpen during the offseason. If they had signed
another closer, it would have given the team hope that things were
differing. Some new blood would have taken some attention off the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, it's almost like the team has been worn down by what
they knew what was coming in the first place: a questionable
bullpen and defense. Even when they are leading in the late
innings, you get a feeling that the other team is going to win
because of the bullpen. Teams get worn out when they have the same
weaknesses cropping up all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing free-agent first baseman Segui has turned out to be a
brilliant move _ he has provided superb offense, Gold Glove-caliber
defense and intensity _ but overall the lineup has not produced as
expected. Where has all the clutch hitting gone?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the men on base, but haven't done nearly as good
of a job getting them in as in other years,'' Piniella sad.
``Offensively, that is where we have struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Orioles eliminated his team, the most
successful manager in franchise history said the team needed some
offseason changes because the offense was too one-dimensional. He
said more speed and better situational hitting was necessary, even
at the expense of home runs. But small-ball never materialized. One
reason, as Buhner said, is that it is tough to think just one run
at a time when pitchers too often give them back in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   The batting order has remained practically intact _ except for
Segui at first and Hill in left _ but the production has plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't manufactured runs the way good teams find a way to
do it,'' Pinella said. ``We have been a power team for the past
three or four years, but in prior years, we did a better job of
getting people in when they were in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three-run homer is a thing of beauty, but when it doesn't
come, you need to get two-out hitting and situational hitting to
sustain your offense, and that is where we have struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The M's are batting .160 with the bases loaded and fewer
than two outs, compared to .477 last season.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The M's are batting .216 with runners in scoring position
with two outs, compared to .257 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is when you are getting base hits and keeping
runners on base, it puts more stress on the (opposing) pitcher,''
Piniella said. ``There is nothing wrong with home runs, but they
usually end innings. If you can keep an inning going, it forces the
pitcher to throw more stress pitches, and two-out hitting is very
deflating to the other team. The pitcher has almost worked his way
out of the inning, and all of a sudden, he has given up two or
three runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite has happened this season. An inadequate
defense has led to extra outs, extra runs and more wins for the
opposition. The bobbles have prolonged innings, forcing Seattle
pitchers to throw more ``stress'' pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Davis (19 errors) and Cora (13) are the main culprits. Piniella
says it is remarkable that a team that plays more than half its
games on artificial turf leads the league in errors. ``We're right
at the bottom, this year, last year, every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Big Three pitchers _ Johnson, Fassero and Moyer _ were
right at the top of the big-league rotations last season, combining
for a 53-18 record. They are 16-17 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching-wise, we probably are not closing the door early in
the games like we did last year,'' Moyer said. ``It seemed like
last year, when (the top three) starters would go five or six
innings and give up one or two runs, we would score five or six
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to make excuses and don't believe in them, but
the way things have gone this year, it's almost as though if we
don't have bad luck, we wouldn't have any luck at all. I'm not
whining or complaining because you can bang your head against the
wall and throw things all you want and it won't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is frustrated, especially since there are such high
expectations. We're supposed to be winning, are trying our darndest
and still not (winning). Something is going to click. When, how and
why, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain: the pitching and defense must improve
for the defending division champions to have any chance at all of
spending September in a pennant race. But, aside from Johnson's
past two starts, there have been very few signs of a turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have good pitching and defense, you are going to be
in every game,'' said Rodriguez, who has combined with Griffey to
hit 59 home runs and drive in 137 runs for a team 14 games under
.500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior and A-Rod are having MVP seasons,'' Gammons said, ``but
it's going to be overlooked because of the team's performance.''

ARGUING ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, STARR AND WHITE HOUSE CHANGE
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st and 2nd grafs for re-editing) (ps) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A discussion of the possible impeachment of
President Clinton served as the backdrop Monday to a historic legal
fight over the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the Whitewater independent counsel, the White
House argued that the potential impeachment of the president made
the privilege a crucial matter, while while the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, argued that the possibility of impeachment
was too remote to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the competing views put forward by the two sides in a
federal appeals court hearing Monday on the immediacy of
impeachment appeared at first-blush to be counter-intuitive, they
made sense in the framework of the legal fight that has arisen in
the Lewinsky inquiry over the parameters of the lawyer-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House maintained that because Starr had recently told
the Supreme Court that he might file an impeachment report to
Congress, President Clinton was entitled to receive confidential
advice from his government lawyers in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual twist, Starr walked away from what he had said
about an impeachment report, telling the three-judge panel that the
president was not entitled to keep the advice confidential because
impeachment was too remote an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on the issue of whether Clinton can receive
confidential advice from government lawyers in a criminal inquiry.
Since both the White House and the independent counsel maintained
Monday that Clinton could use such lawyers to defend himself in an
impeachment inquiry in Congress, the argument focused in part on
the likelihood and timing of such a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyer, W. Neil Eggleston, contended that since
Starr had raised the prospect of an impeachment proceeding, the
president had every right to rely on government lawyers to defend
himself, as a matter of the constitutional principle of separation
of powers.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear in the argument that the president stood on
firmer legal ground in a congressional inquiry, rather than in
grand jury proceeding, Starr told the appeals court there was no
need to consider impeachment issues. Instead, Starr urged the
judges to focus on whether they really wanted to put their
endorsement on the White House's position, establishing a rule that
every federal government lawyer would have a legal obligation to
forward evidence of a crime to investigators, except for White
House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose when the president appealed a lower court
decision ordering one of his closest aides, deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, to answer questions before a federal grand
jury about conversations that he had with Clinton and other
witnesses, including Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky to find
a job in New York. Clinton, Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky are involved in
the independent counsel's investigation trying to determine if
there was an attempt to cover up the President's relationship with
the former White House intern when her deposition was sought in the
sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the public phase of Monday's hearing, the judges sharply
questioned both sides, invoking lessons from the Watergate and
Iran-Contra scandals but giving few hints about their positions.
The panel, which also held a closed hearing on the more sensitive
grand jury aspects of the appeal, consisted of A. Raymond Randolph,
Judith W. Rogers and David S. Tatel. To each lawyer, Tatel asked
whether the President had any special rights to confidential advice
from White House lawyers in impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston, the president's top lawyer for privilege issues,
replied that ``in a run-up to possible impeachment,'' it was beyond
question as a matter of Constitutional law that the president
should be able to rely on the confidential advice of government
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel has said in his Supreme Court brief
that a referral of impeachment is certainly under consideration,''
Eggleston said. ``Impeachment involves an official function. It
would be incumbent on the President to defend himself if he
believes it appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr replied that the prospect of impeachment was too
remote a possibility to be considered by the court, and that the
judges should only focus on the fact that the White House was
seeking to limit grand jury testimony, not testimony in a
congressional proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession that surprised some White House lawyers, Starr
told the judges that government lawyers ``could actually represent
the president in an impeachment setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not where we are,'' Starr hastened to add. ``It is
premature for this court to look down the road and look at
impeachment. It is beyond the compass of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the office of the president misunderstands the
vision of what it means to be a government lawyer,'' Starr told the
three-judge panel, citing a federal law that requires federal
employees to report any evidence of a crime to the attorney
general. ``If there is wrongdoing, it must be exposed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr first raised the prospect of an impeachment proceeding
four weeks ago. In a brief asking the Supreme Court to bypass the
appeals court and take the case on an expedited basis, Starr wrote
of the urgency of a final decision so that he could quickly proceed
with possible indictments and possibly send an impeachment report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down Starr's request and suggested that the
appeals court consider the matter quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel law, Starr must report any
``substantial and credible information'' that ``may constitute
grounds for impeachment'' to the House. The Constitution then gives
the House the authority to decide whether to recommend an
impeachment trial, which would be held in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over impeachment and the attorney-client privilege
were unusual in part because the Justice Department has broken
ranks with the White House, and in a friend of the court brief,
taken an intermediate position between that of the president and
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has argued there is no privilege for government lawyers to
withhold evidence from a federal grand jury. The White House argued
that there is an absolute privilege. The Justice Department, in a
brief signed by Attorney General Janet Reno, asserts that there
should be a qualified privilege which a federal judge should
balance against the needs of investigators.

NBA DECREES LOCKOUT A NECESSITY WITHOUT A HARD SALARY CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE Sonic center and dedicated Midwesterner Jim McIlvaine
undoubtedly will spend a good portion of his summer riding a
tractor mower in his hometown of Racine, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But as secretary/treasurer for the National Basketball Players
Association, McIlvaine also will be wrapped up in the league's
labor strife. He and nearly 400 other union members have the money
and are ready to take on NBA commissioner David Stern with every
dribble and dunk in what promises to be a summer of hardball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, both sides consider how important the fans are in
this,'' McIlvaine said before last season ended.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Monday that the NBA is locking out its players
until a new collective bargaining agreement can be reached, Stern
sounded anything but optimistic. The NBA is the only major pro
sports league that has not missed a regular-season game because of
a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   During a lockout, teams are not permitted to have contact with
players. Clubs are not allowed to conduct player negotiations or
hold summer camps. Players cannot use team practice facilities.
Athletes do not receive regular paychecks from their teams,
although players can hold scheduled charity games.
</P>
<P>
   The owners and players have almost three months before training
camps are scheduled to open. But both sides are so far apart on the
economic issues that the season is in jeopardy. The crux of the
labor dispute deals with revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are a number of clubs that will do better
not operating than operating. That's something the players don't
yet understand,'' Stern said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the lockout was inevitable considering neither side
has met since an abrupt, 30-minute gathering last week.
</P>
<P>
   The owners voted 27-2 in March to reopen the collective
bargaining agreement because player salaries exceeded the agreed to
48 percent of basketball-related income. The league says players
earned roughly 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are afraid that huge contracts for some players
threaten the league's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to play the season under the current system.
That's just the reality,'' Stern said. ``Since the primary
beneficiaries of the current system are the players, the risk (of
not having a season) is the players', although there is a mutual
risk with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout will begin at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this labor battle and the one that took
place in 1995 is the players are unified. There are no signs of
union decertification, and the players are primed for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Players went into last season knowing the collective bargaining
agreement was going to be reopened in March, so the union asked
members to save part of their income to cover potential
unemployment. The 12-member Dream Team also was ready to pull out
of the World Championships next month as a protest against a
lockout. But USA Basketball replaced the NBA players with other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, including agents, thought there would be a
divergence, but it appears everyone is on the same page,'' said
agent Steve Kauffman, a member of the agents' advisory committee to
the players association. ``Everyone feels they can't give back what
they already have.''
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly too early to determine which side has more to
lose. But the NBA, which has been a public-relations model for
other sports leagues, is gambling with its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides face fan reaction,'' Kauffman said. ``We saw what
happened in baseball. Who would have thought baseball would have
such problems and take so long to recover?''
</P>
<P>
   The Larry Bird exception has emerged as the key issue in the
labor war. That is the clause in the collective bargaining
agreement that allows a team to re-sign its free agents without
regard to a cap on salaries for the entire team. It is the primary
reason for the escalation in salaries, which owners say are
increasing at a faster rate than league revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Bird exception, 24 of the league's 29 teams are
over the salary cap of $26.9 million. The Chicago Bulls were
already over the cap when they signed Michael Jordan to a $33.1
million contract. Last season, the Bulls' payroll exceeded $61
million.
</P>
<P>
   Miami used the Bird exception to sign Alonzo Mourning to a
seven-year, $105 million deal. Minnesota is paying Kevin Garnett
$126 million over six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Owners want a hard cap without loopholes or clauses that allow
salaries to escalate. A team attempting to re-sign its free agents
would have to fit that player under the salary cap as it would
another team's free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had to be the ones to protect owners from
themselves,'' Houston Rockets free agent Eddie Johnson said. ``We
can't just keep giving back to help protect them from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's stance is that the Bird exception is affecting the
league more than individual teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to negotiate the percentage,'' Stern said.
``We'd like to agree to pay a higher percentage than the old one
that was promised. But then we'd like to pay no more or no less.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the league wants:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Marijuana added to the list of banned substances, and
mandatory testing for players, league and team personal.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The duration of rookie contracts, currently three years,
increased to five or six.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Tougher penalties for player misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)To reduce Stern's power to discipline players.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Licensing rights to the players association logo.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Teams to include revenue from naming rights for arenas in
basketball-related income, which would raise the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other things we could have solved without reopening
the agreement,'' said Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner. ``We
try not to focus on the Bird exception, but we need an agreement
that's not as open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made four different proposals. All of them involve player
salaries going up, just hopefully not as fast. The players made a
proposal April 1 and have not moved off that proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and its union met nine times since the collective
bargaining agreement was reopened. The sessions ranged from three
to five hours. The league contends that since the 1992-93 season _
the year of its highest profits _ there has been a steady decline
in profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Stern claims 15 teams did not make money this season. The
players believe that number is more like five. (The Sonics made
money, but NBA owners historically do not reveal financial
records.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams are losing money, but I don't think the league in
general is losing money,'' Jordan said. ``I won't accept that until
they open up the books.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no arguing that the league's revenue growth has been
strong. NBC and Turner Sports will pay more than double for the
next four years than what they paid for past rights to broadcast
NBA games. The league garnered $2.64 billion _ $1.75 billion from
NBC and Turner's $890 million _ over four years.
</P>
<P>
   If the lockout continues through the beginning of next season,
the contracts provide that both networks will keep paying the NBA
for up to a year. NBC and Turner would be reimbursed later by the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing we look forward to and it's something we have
managed thus far to avoid in the ultimate losing of games,'' Stern
said. ``But if you don't face up to reality, then you can't have an
intelligent negotiation. ... We're not trying to run away from the
payment, but we need to slow the growth.''

NEWS CORP. UNVEILS PLANS FOR STOCK OFFERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rupert Murdoch asked has investors to pony up $4
billion in exchange for owning a stake in the Dodgers, ``The
X-Files'' and the rest of his U.S. sports and entertainment
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's News Corp. announced Monday it would sell up to 20
percent of its American assets _ including the Dodgers baseball
team, 20th Century Fox and the Fox Networks _ to the public in a
stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing of the offering was not disclosed but News Corp. plans
to complete it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move makes sense for the acquisition-minded
Murdoch, who controls 31 percent of News Corp., because he can gain
access to additional funds without surrendering significant control
over his conglomerate. News Corp.'s other key assets are in
publishing, including the London Times, the New York Post and
HarperCollins books, and a wide array of television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that these
assets are worth more if they're separated out,'' said Bishop
Cheen, an analyst with First Union Capital Markets. ``There's a lot
of value that's lost by being part of the huge umbrella. At the end
of the day, the value of the assets is in the eye of the
beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, U.S. investors can invest in Australia-based News
Corp. by purchasing American Depository Receipts. But those shares
have long traded at much lower price-earnings comparisons than
rivals such as The Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc. and Viacom
Inc. because of uncertainty over how to value News Corp. The
conglomerate uses Australian accounting standards, which are far
looser than American rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult to figure out what's going on at News
Corp.,'' said Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz Nussbaum and King. ``It's
been a mishmash of assets, but with this offering, there will be a
clear understanding of what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street immediately endorsed the deal, with News Corp.'s
ADRs rising 3 9/16 to 33 1/16. Those ADRs are now up 72 percent
over the past year, lifted by speculation in recent weeks that
Murdoch would create a separate stock by splitting entertainment
and publishing. It has also been helped by the bull market,
positive reaction to the company's $2 billion sale of TV Guide,
optimism about Murdoch's strategy and strong performance by the
Paramount-Fox blockbuster ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the gains, the stock has not been fairly valued,
according to Steve Cesinger, an analyst with Greit &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles. ``This is an excellent time to raise financing with the
market at an all-time high,'' he added. ``Who knows what the
markets will look like nine months from now?''
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. said the funds would be used for general corporate
purposes, including stock buybacks and debt reduction, but most
analysts expect the funds will be employed in yet more deals.
``Having the stock makes it much easier to do more transactions
rather than using debt or cash,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest in the ongoing evolution of News Corp.,
which has transformed itself in four decades from being largely a
purveyor of low-brow tabloids to an entity with a chance to become
the dominant player in global media programming and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's involvement in the U.S. media business dates back to
1985, when he bought 20th Century Fox from Marvin Davis in two
deals for $575 million. He launched the Fox network in 1987 with
``Married ... With Children'' and ``The Tracy Ullman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's empire nearly collapsed in 1990 due to his massive
debt load but survived following a refinancing and moratorium on
acquisitions. He made his first move into U.S. sports in 1993 when
he outbid CBS for pro football broadcast rights, launched a sports
network in 1996 to take on ESPN, then bought the Dodgers in March.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of Murdoch's bottom-line mentality, the Dodgers
are nearly unrecognizable from last season with the team's best
player, manager and top operations executive all gone, and
advertising expanding throughout the park. Cesinger said there is
little chance that Dodger fans will wind up owning much of the new
stock, noting, ``The investors will be mostly institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said they were surprised by the move since it
will open Murdoch's operations to a much higher degree of scrutiny.
``I think he's opening a window that he'd just as soon stayed
closed,'' said Denver sports consultant Dean Bonham.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Dodgers and the Los Angeles-based Fox Network
and movie studio, Fox Group will also own 22 TV stations, interests
in five pay-cable TV networks and parts of the New York Rangers
hockey and Knicks basketball teams. It has agreed to buy 40 percent
of the new Staples Center arena in downtown Los Angeles and has
options to buy 40 percent of the Los Angeles Kings hockey and 10
percent of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball teams. &QL;

BAD BLOOD CONTINUES BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR STATE SENATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Escalating tensions in the 20th state Senate
District, City Councilman Richard Alarcon has issued a ``formal
apology'' for a controversial last-minute campaign mailer but
former Assemblyman Richard Katz flatly has rejected it as
insincere.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the June 2 Democratic primary by 29 votes over
Katz, Alarcon has been trying to put the issue of the mailer _
widely criticized as false and racially inflammatory _ behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-paragraph letter to Katz on Monday, Alarcon
continued to insist he had not seen or authorized the mailer and
complained that Katz's campaign literature was unfair and contained
false statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am writing to offer my formal apology,'' Alarcon's letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I did not see or authorize the piece prior to it
being sent, I take full responsibility for it since it emerged
relating to my campaign. I realize the piece could have been taken
to imply you were somehow involved in the poll guard incident and I
know that you were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz refused to accept the apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in this letter or in any statements has Mr. Alarcon
condemned the contents of the mailer nor has he called to task
those individuals responsible for it,'' Katz said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Alarcon's letter is neither genuine nor sincere and I
cannot settle for anything less than an unconditional apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon has been under increasing pressure since the election to
disavow the mailing _ signed by state Sen. Richard Polanco, a
powerful Eastside Democrat _ in which Katz was portrayed as being
linked to a 1988 election effort by Orange County Republicans to
exclude Latinos from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing arrived in the days leading up to the election and
prompted criticism from Jewish groups, such as the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alarcon had sought to distance himself from the
mailing, the Daily News reported last week that his campaign
consultant Richie Ross prepared the piece, which was paid for by
Polanco's Latino Political Action Committee but reported as an
Alarcon campaign expenditure because of Ross's role.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Alarcon acknowledged that his campaign was
involved, but he continued to maintain he was unaware of the
mailing prior to its distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said it was only because of public pressure that Alarcon
issued his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four weeks after the election, following four weeks of
community outrage and one day after editorials in the Daily News
and Los Angeles Times calling upon him to apologize, Richard
Alarcon has written ... to offer his formal apology,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Alarcon never acknowledges what the mailer was intended to
accomplish. Mr. Alarcon has made conflicting statements about what
he knew and when he knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon indicated he believes Katz should understand how
elective politics work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are tough,'' Alarcon wrote. ``With your 16 years in
office, you know that better than anyone. I think most candidates
try to abide by clean and fair tactics. I know I did in all of the
communications that were authorized and paid for (by) my
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon has said he did not know until after the election that
the mailing was an in-kind contribution from Polanco instead of an
independent expenditure from Polanco's PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that campaigns for candidates are not to have
any direct involvement with independent expenditure committees.
Using Ross to prepare the mailing made it a direct contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said he remained upset over Katz's mailers, including
one that used the phrase ```dirty' hands'' to refer to the loan the
councilman and his wife got from a developer-lobbyist firm for
their home. The mailer contained Alarcon's Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say though I was deeply offended and disappointed by
several of the pieces your campaign sent to voters, during the
course of this campaign,'' Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most notably, the `dirty' hands piece which has personal
attacks on my wife and me falsely stating that we do not pay our
taxes and also unfairly linking me to (Councilman) Richard
Alatorre.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said he was not requesting a personal apology from Katz,
but believed one should be given to his wife, Corina.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Alarcon said he and Katz should be proud of
the voter turnout in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 100,000 voters came to the polls, over 40,000 more
than in any similar election in the history of the San Fernando
Valley,'' Alarcon said. ``We should also not diminish the work that
is ahead of us, that is unifying the Democratic Party and our
community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Monday, Katz appeared on a radio program during which
he insisted his own mailings did not have racist overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used the term `dirty hands,' that is an old political
term referring to someone who got their hands caught in the cookie
jar,'' Katz said. ``The difference with the Polanco mailing is it
was an attempt to use race as a way to excite a voting electorate.
It was race-baiting.'' &QL;

NO CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS FOUND IN WENATCHEE SEX CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The jury in the first civil trial prompted by the
Wenatchee sex cases decided Monday that police, city officials and
state social workers did not violate the civil rights of eight
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Lord's will,'' Pastor Robert Roberson said to his
daughter, Rebekah, as the verdict was read. His wife, Connie
Roberson, hugged the 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:40 p.m. on the fifth day of deliberations, a buzzer linking
the jury room to the chamber of Superior Court Judge Michael
Donohue blared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a verdict,'' the jury forewoman told bailiff Mary
McGarry.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 minutes, the courtroom was packed, and reporters,
photographers, lawyers and court watchers filled the outside
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety was thick inside. Thirteen weeks of trial and
deliberation had honed tensions to needle sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether police and state Child Protective Services
caseworkers encouraged children to falsely accuse the plaintiffs,
including Roberson, of sexual improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs argued that their civil rights and rights to fair
trials were violated and sought $30 million to $60 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, everyone wanted it over, but it appeared that
no one really wanted to hear the words spoken. As jurors weaved
their way to their all-too-familiar seats, the only sound was their
footsteps on the dirty tan carpet. Spectators perched on the edge
of their seats. Lawyers on both sides looked pale. The only ones in
the room who seemed at ease were the Robersons, who were
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   As Donohue read the verdict forms that the jury had completed,
Roberson checked off a sheaf of photocopies and everyone else
followed along.
</P>
<P>
   Were the plaintiffs' civil rights violated?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' read the judge, in a firm but low voice.
</P>
<P>
   Was there malicious interference with a parent-child
relationship?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   False arrest?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   False imprisonment?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Negligence?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   As the litany continued, each answer was the same.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers asked the judge to poll the jury, to see how
they voted.
</P>
<P>
   To each question, at least 10 jurors raised their hands. For
three of the charges, all 12 hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to determine whether Robert Van Siclen, who
headed the plaintiffs' team, was more stunned than the three
defense lawyers, who showed no expression.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the only frustration Roberson expressed was his
concern that the verdict might diminish the legal chances of others
swept up in the community-wide arrests in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this verdict doesn't hurt Mark and Carol or the
Everetts. And what will it do to the 14 people still in prison? And
the other civil trials?'' Roberson asked of no one in particular as
he was surrounded by television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Mark and Carol Doggett and Idella and Harold
Everett, two couples whose criminal conviction is now being
reviewed by the state appeals court; and to at least seven civil
suits that are winding their way through the system.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the first lawsuit were: the Robersons; Honnah
and Jonathan Sims and their son, Daniel; and Donna Rodriguez and
her daughter, Kim Allbee.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Robersons were in court to hear the verdict. They were
accused of molesting and raping children in their East Wenatchee
Pentecostal Church of God House of Prayer in central Washington,
and were acquitted in 1995 on multiple counts of child rape and
molestation.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Rodriguez were dropped after four of her five
accusers recanted.
</P>
<P>
   All these cases were spawned during a two-year period in
Wenatchee and East Wenatchee when 43 adults were arrested for the
rape and molestation of 60 children. Fourteen of those charged
remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators initially talked about a circle of adult
predators, they later admitted that a ``sex ring'' never existed.
</P>
<P>
   The label first surfaced in early 1995 in police reports by
Wenatchee Detective Bob Perez and in CPS episode reports and in
correspondence to and from Department of Social and Health Services
headquarters. However, they deny using the sex ring tag, and
instead blame it on the news media.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, soon after accusing her parents, the Everetts,
of nearly 10,000 counts of sex abuse, a 10-year-old girl named
Donna, who was a foster child in the Perez household, made
additional accusations to the detective.
</P>
<P>
   Donna said she had been raped or molested by almost every adult
she knew and the same had happened to every child she'd played
with, met at school or prayed with at Roberson's church. Three
months later, her 12-year-old sister, Melinda, parroted the
accusations and added more names to Perez's already long list of
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' legal team spent nine weeks challenging the
evidence that led to the Robersons' convictions, including the
testimony of both young girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the verdict we anticipated, and I don't believe it's
the verdict the evidence justified,'' said Ken LeMaster, a lawyer
on Van Siclen's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the jury's opinion. We have to live with that. It seems
to me to be pretty clear that the evidence was there that there was
a lack of professional police discipline to the investigation
process _ a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Defendants were the city of Wenatchee; its police chief, Kenneth
Badgley; and Detective Bob Perez; Douglas County and its sheriff,
Dan LaRoche, and two of his deputies, Robin Wagg and David Helvey;
the state's Department of Social and Health Services and its
employee, Tim Abbey, who is the CPS supervisor in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defendants was in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, the number of lawyers crammed around an
L-shaped table often outnumbered the jurors, but those standing to
do battle were usually Van Siclen for the plaintiffs and a trio for
the defense _ Patrick McMahon for Wenatchee, Stan Bastian for
Douglas County and Jeff Freimund for the DSHS.
</P>
<P>
   Did Van Siclen think that being outnumbered three to one made
the difference? No.
</P>
<P>
   The defense strategy that may have persuaded the jury centered
on the concept of probable cause _ that prosecutors and judges in
Wenatchee had been given evidence showing there had been adequate
grounds for the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probable cause, in the context of this case, means facts that
would cause a reasonably cautious officer to believe that the
person had committed the crime for which the arrest was being
made,'' said the instructions given to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions told the jurors that if they found there had
been probable cause for the arrest and prosecution of the
plaintiffs ``then your verdict should be for the defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides are interested in finding out what
arguments influenced the jury. But they must wait for jurors to
contact them voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the jury agrees to talk to us, we should be able to
determine how much the probable-cause defense impacted the verdict,
if at all,'' Van Siclen said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had their own interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the jury believed what Officer Perez did was
appropriate under the law,'' said Robert Sealby, who was one of the
team representing Wenatchee's defendants. ``This decision should
renew the public's confidence in the law and in Wenatchee's police
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defense laywer, Freimund, said: ``The jury saw the facts
as we believe them to be. That the people involved were doing their
best to find out what happened and did what they were obligated to
do under state law.''
</P>
<P>
   As he bounded down the stairs to leave the courthouse, Freimund
added, ``Vindication is a strong word. We are very pleased with the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastian, who defended Douglas County, admitted he was surprised
at the verdict but said it was important because ``the reputations
and the very careers of people were on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, at least at this point, I'm just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if we don't appeal,'' said Van
Siclen. ``There are a variety of issues that must be explored, but
first I've got to discuss it with my clients, my co-counsels and,
hopefully, we'll get a chance to talk to members of the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without the appeal, another round is already scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   For participants in this trial _ judge, jury, defendants,
plaintiffs and their lawyers _ the past three months or more may
have seemed like a play that would never end. In reality, it has
just been the first of two acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This portion of the trial has only presented half the case
against the state and Cindy Andrews,'' said Van Siclen, referring
to a DSHS therapist who treated several of the Wenatchee children.
``What they did to the Robersons and the Sims will be tried at a
later time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the mostly the same witnesses, many of the same
questions and I'll probably get different answers, because they've
got a good idea of what I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason this trial and the suit against DSHS were split apart
was a simple mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow in the rush to comply with Judge Donohue's request to
join the multiple actions, we dropped a paragraph, two short lines,
listing the actions against the state and Cindy Andrews, so we get
to do it all again.''
</P>

U.S. TEAM WAS OUT OF CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ This is the way things work in the world
of international soccer: You win or you resign. And if you refuse
to resign, you're fired.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson learned that lesson Monday morning, when he was
relieved of his duties as U.S. national team coach during a Paris
breakfast with U.S. Soccer president Alan Rothenberg. They are
calling it a ``resignation,'' but unless Sampson had a complete
change of heart sometime in the past week, that's just semantics.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as little surprise. Bora Milutinovic, Sampson's
successor, was fired _ officially, he ``resigned'' _ after the
success of a World Cup, although that was clouded by the
federation's stated desire for the U.S. coach doubling as technical
director, an idea that was abandoned once Sampson was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Far different circumstances govern Sampson's departure and
that's a pity. In his three-plus years with the national team,
Sampson enjoyed greater success than any previous coach. He's
directed the team through a period of unprecedented on-field
growth, he _ like Bora before him _ successfully introduced a new
generation of talent to America's top team, and he opened a door
that had previously been closed to U.S.-born coaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad that there was no choice but to dismiss him following
the Americans' horrid World Cup experience, one in which they
looked like amateurs in losses to Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia. He
lost the support of veteran players such as Eric Wynalda, Alexi
Lalas, Tab Ramos and Jeff Agoos _ they claimed the coach sought
credit for everything his squad had done.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you believe the disgruntled players were upset in their
diminished roles or that the players were perceptive to realize
that Sampson had gone too far, there's a bit of truth in both.
</P>
<P>
   But what was obvious was Sampson lost control of his team during
the most important event of his tenure. For that alone, he had to
be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that is likely what he will be remembered for.
And it would be wrong to forget the positives, the wins of 1995
over Argentina and Nigeria and Mexico that forced U.S. Soccer to
make him coach; the successful (if difficult) qualification run for
this World Cup, in which the Yanks lost just twice, both times in
Costa Rica; and the phenomenal win over Brazil during the CONCACAF
Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's teams were 26-22-14, the best record a U.S. coach has
ever posted, and he leaves it better equipped to compete at the top
level than it was when he took charge, no matter what occurred in
France.
</P>
<P>
   The job was never meant to be his. When Bora was dumped, U.S.
Soccer wanted a big-name foreigner, and Portugal's Carlos Queiroz
and Brazil's Carlos Alberto Parreira were offered the post. When
they turned it down and Sampson started winning, the federation had
to remove the ``interim'' portion of his title.
</P>
<P>
   No other American-born coach had held the post, a fact Sampson
took great pride in. He said, many times, that he was carrying the
banner for American coaches into the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean an American won't take his place. D.C. United
coach Bruce Arena, although his arrogance has won him few friends
at U.S. Soccer, is a favorite. Rothenberg, whose tenure as U.S.
Soccer president ends in August, still could seek out a top foreign
coach. There's a lot of Nike and TV money in the federation's
coffers, and perhaps it will be put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   Queiroz, who was U.S. Soccer's technical director until a couple
weeks ago, would have been a superb choice. He won two under-20
World Cups with Portugal and is considered one of the world's great
tacticians. But he's now in charge of United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Parreira is available _ Saudi Arabia cut him loose after its
first two World Cup losses _ and so are several others with Cup
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shortcomings and the team's failure in the World
Cup, Sampson has value. The perfect position might be the director
of Project 2010. Project 2010 was designed to help the United
States become a world soccer power within 12 years. It's a post in
which Sampson, who helped the U.S. take major steps toward that
goal, could succeed.

<P>
   Q The company where I work brought in a consulting firm to
determine ways for us to operate more effectively. As a result of
their findings, the company is implementing numerous changes, many
of which do not seem to be effective at all. There has been minimal
communication with us throughout this process. Is there anything we
can do now? D.E.
</P>
<P>
   A It would be sadly ironic if your company retained a consulting
firm in order to operate more effectively, while overlooking the
fact that one of the best ways to do so is by supporting employee
ideas, inputs and communication. In this type of situation, the
best first step is for you to discuss your specific concerns with
your manager.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned that you may be initially perceived as resistant
to change, insecure and something other than a team player. Hence,
before your meeting, be sure that you and your associates review
the changes in a businesslike way and approach the meeting with
questions rather than answers.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the consultants applied a technology to your
organization that does not fit its needs, culture or objectives. At
the same time, it is equally possible that your company needs these
precise changes in order to survive over the next several years,
and you should give them some time before passing judgment. At this
point, the best approach is for open communication and
open-mindedness on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Q I just attended a company-sponsored training program on time
management, and one of the major points was that as a general rule
it is better to turn in a project on time if it is 80 percent
complete, as opposed to turning it in late but 100 percent
complete. How does that sound to you? D.N.
</P>
<P>
   A As a general rule, that sounds 100 percent wrong. Time
management does not mean turning in substandard work on time. In
fact, it is difficult to argue that any project should be 80
percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   A better guideline for time management is to have a clear
understanding of the priorities of your various projects and to
know which ones can be temporarily set aside in order to complete a
higher-priority project on time. And if you still find that a
higher-priority project is running late, rather than turning it in
at that 80 percent level, go to management and discuss the
situation, the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   An 80 percent figure is often mentioned in discussions of time
management, but differently from the way that your training program
approached it. There is a so-called ``80-20 rule'' postulating that
this ratio is found in many work situations. For example, 80
percent of the problems come from 20 percent of the employees, 80
percent of the complaints come from 20 percent of the customers,
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   From the time-management standpoint, this ratio can help you in
the planning process, but it does not mean to turn in work at that
80 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the bigger picture, the message from your seminar is
that quality, accuracy and excellence are less important than
timeliness. Although timeliness is important, it does not do anyone
much good to arrive at the wrong destination on time.
</P>
<P>
   Q I am being given the worst assignments. They are the most
tedious and boring, and they offer the least opportunity for
growth. When I discuss this with my manager, he brushes off my
comments and says that all of the work in his department is
important, and he tries to match skills with assignments. How
should I deal with this? A.F.
</P>
<P>
   A The managerial brushoff is never a good sign. You are
approaching your manager with a serious question, and he is
responding with platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   However, your first step is to look at yourself to see if you
may be the source of the problem. For example, have you developed
the skills necessary to complete the assignments that you seek? Or,
could it be that the assignments are challenging enough, but you
have been through the drill so many times that you are bored with
them?
</P>
<P>
   If you are truly the recipient of the less than desirable
assignments, and you honestly believe that you have the skills and
abilities to carry out more challenging work, you should meet again
with your manager. Rather than expressing dissatisfaction with a
particular assignment, ask your manager what you specifically need
to do to receive a different type of assignment. The next step is
to follow his recommendations and let him know that you are doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to hand you marginal assignments and platitudes,
perhaps it is time to seek out a work situation that truly matches
assignments with your skills. &QL;

POLITICS LARGELY OVER, CLINTON IN SHANGHAI TO SEE CHINA'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (See also: CHINA-DAY, CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TV-COVERAGE,
CHINA-PEONY) 
(sw) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ With the heavily political, issue-laden leg of his
China trip now behind him, President Clinton and his entourage came
to the country's largest and most cosmopolitan city Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   To put his finger on the vibrant pulse of modern China, his
aides said, Clinton will spend two days and three nights here
talking to regular people.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down the winding avenues of neon that advertise a
distinctly commercial sensibility in Shanghai, his motorcade went
from the airport to Shanghai's thriving waterfront, the visual
centerpiece of any tour of this mega-city of 14 million.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting on Tuesday morning with entreprenuers, community
leaders and homeowners in Shanghai was meant to accent the dynamic,
fast-growing economic side of China, though it veered off into
other topics from the law to religion. Clinton assembled seven
``agents of change'' for a roundtable discussion at the Shanghai
Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands there is a new China that is more
prosperous, more open and more dynamic,'' Clinton said. ``The
purpose here is to help me and my wife and the American people
understand the changes that are going on in modern China and the
challenges that are out there and what all of your are doing in
your lives to deal with those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The group included a law professor, a consumer advocate, a
physicist, an economist and a cleric who spent years in prison.
Unlike two earlier addresses by Clinton in China, this event was
not carried live on Chinese television.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, Bishop Jin Luxian, who is attached to a Chinese
Catholic church that is independent of the Vatican, appeared to
surprise the president with the declaration that he did not think
``belief in religion'' was ``restricted in any way'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   Jin also said his church cooperated with the government. ``Why
should church believers do something against our government?'' he
asked. ``Here we adopted the policy of dialogue instead of
contending with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who gave lengthy responses to many of the questions and
comments from the group, had no reply to Jin.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Lanye, vice dean of the international department at the East
China University of Politics and Law, told the president that the
state of the legal profession in China remained primitive but had
improved in recent years. Mrs. Zhu, who is in her 40s, said China
needed to train thousands more lawyers and persuade people to seek
legal remedies to their grievances with the government or in the
private economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xiaoying, 51, a novelist, said she had little trouble
getting her novels about family life published. ``Personally, I
have signed a contract to publish with three publishing houses,''
she said. ``The problem is not getting novels published but coming
up with good ideas each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wang asked the president whether literature played an
important role in American life, and in his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very much,'' the president replied, ``and I think not only for
enjoyment, but also for enlightenment. We have many books of
literature, all kinds of prose and poetry published in America
every year, and it is heavily taught in our schools and, at least
in our case, widely discussed in our home with our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   To address ordinary Chinese, Clinton will also be the host on a
live radio call-in program.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped out of his limousine at the Portman Ritz-Carlton
Hotel late Monday, on a busy street lined with crowds of people
craning their necks for a glimpse, Clinton waved to acknowledge the
roar of cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went inside for the evening, passing up the chance to
peek at Shanghai's boisterous night life at any of the bars and
supper clubs that self-consciously fashion themselves after the
styles set in the 1920s and 30s, when Shanghai was the most
cosmopolitan city in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's daytime itinerary are three landmarks that have
opened in just the last two years: a stock exchange that is a
leader technologically; a world-class museum with inventive display
techniques, and the country's most modern public library.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have portrayed his itinerary as one that traces
China's history. In Xian, the first stop, one sees relics of
ancient China; in Beijing, the largest icons of Communist China are
on view; Shanghai is clearly the most forward-looking city in the
country. Of course, that neat description does not account for
Guilin, the pleasure spot, or Hong Kong, which both lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China,'' said Mike
McCurry, the White House spokesman. ``The changes that are taking
place in China are reflected in the very dynamic growth,
economically, and the changes taking place in South China.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To Shanghai residents, actually, the rate of economic growth is
palpably slowing. The real estate boom of the mid-1990s has now
created a bubble of supply that seems poised to burst but has not
done so yet.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with much of the rest of Asia, however, Shanghai
looks healthy. Round-the-clock construction continues on
skyscrapers throughout the city, if on fewer than before. The
unemployment rate is rising steadily, as state-owned factories
downsize, yet average family income is still climbing marginally.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few formal events planned during Clinton's
stay here, and officials doing advance work say that offers the
Clinton family the flexibility for shopping and walks, or quiet
time away from their 1,000-member entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's itinerary includes only three events, leaving almost
the entire afternoon free for something unscripted. Wednesday's
plans are almost as relaxed. On Monday, after speaking at Beijing
University, the Clintons took it easy. They stayed in, at Diaoyutai
Guest House, playing cards and board games, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton also has a handful of nonofficial visits
planned in Shanghai. To combine her interest in health care and
children's welfare, she is to visit the Shanghai Children's Medical
Center, a new hospital built by Project Hope, an American-based
foundation, and Shanghai's Second Medical University. It is the
first hospital in China devoted to treating children, and it was
created by nongovernmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not in any five-year plan,'' said William Walsh,
president and chief executive of Project Hope, which has been
active in China since 1983, training and advising medical workers
in public health. ``It reflects the kind of volunteerism that is
starting to grow in China today.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also helped, Walsh said, that two of Shanghai's former
leaders who welcomed Project Hope here were later promoted to the
nation's top posts: President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is also planning to visit a women's education and
training center, and the Shanghai No. 3 Girls' School. On Wednesday
she will visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue, a place of worship
originally built for Jews who lived in Shanghai before the
Communist-led army arrived in 1949.

EDITORIAL: THE THREAT OF POLICE PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   Now that a former New York City police officer, Francis Livoti,
has been convicted in federal court of violating the civil rights
of Anthony Baez, the focus of investigation should move to the
officers accused of lying on the witness stand to protect Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of policy perjury made by federal prosecutors and a
state judge are devastating challenges to the integrity of the
Police Department that must be answered with utmost speed. The U.S.
attorney's office is looking into possible perjury and cover-up
charges. But the department must not wait for the federal
authorities to take the lead. It should begin an aggressive
investigation into the perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Baez died of asphyxiation during a confrontation with Livoti in
1994. Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in 1996
by a State Supreme Court justice, who nonetheless called the
testimony of the other officers a ``nest of perjury.'' Livoti was
dismissed from the department in 1997 after an administrative trial
found that he had used an illegal chokehold against Baez. None of
the officers accused of lying under oath, however, ever faced
administrative punishment or criminal charges, despite the
statement of the Bronx judge.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring inconsistencies in testimony in the federal case are
now too numerous for the department to brush aside. Three officers
testified that they saw Baez struggle and stagger, suggesting that
he was not rendered unconscious by the chokehold that the city's
medical examiner says was the cause of death. Yet other witnesses
contradict that account. The medical evidence suggests that the
story given by Livoti's defenders simply is not plausible. The
department must account for police testimony that was not believed
in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of the police is at the heart of two other
prominent brutality cases. The Daily News has reported that
accounts filed by detectives on the shooting of Antoine Reid, an
unarmed squeegee man, by officer Michael Meyer seem calculated to
protect Meyer by suggesting that the shooting occurred during a
robbery attempt. No such attempt was described by witnesses
interviewed by the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, which is
now investigating the discrepancy. Similar charges of a cover-up
are central to the inquiry into the attack against Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The department cannot protect the community if there is reason
to question the veracity of officers on the beat and on the witness
stand. A system in which officers who brutalize and kill civilians
are protected by other officers destroys the public trust and
erodes the ability of the force to do its job. Rooting out any
officer who gives false testimony must be made a top priority by
the department, the Mayor and prosecutors.

SPORTS COLUMN: NUMBERS SHOW INTEREST IN INTERLEAGUE GAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Never have so many making so much lost to so many making so
little. It is, without question, the highlight of this season's
interleague schedule, the Montreal Expos' sweep of a three-game
series from the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend series was an encounter between a team with the
tiniest 1998 payroll, $9.2 million, against a team with a record
payroll of $69.2 million. In another venue, it might have been
called David against Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   The series and the outcome were hardly noticed around here, what
with all of the excitement generated by the confrontations between
the Yankees and the Mets at Shea Stadium. Who in New York, after
all, cared about a series between teams with losing records, clubs
that are no threats to the post-season plans of the teams that
lured 160,740 fans to Shea?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Mets and the Yankees drew 168,719 to Yankee
Stadium, meaning 329,459 fans have seen the Mets and the Yankees
play six games the past two seasons. That number, then, will be the
barometer for the 1999 season because the Mets and the Yankees will
play three games at each team's home.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is still in the discussion stages, but when it
becomes official, it will have the Mets at Yankee Stadium on June
4, 5 and 6 and the Yankees at Shea Stadium on July 9, 10 and 11. If
one series has been terrific, will two be twice as terrific?
</P>
<P>
   The home-and-home series are part of a a slightly altered format
for interleague play. When the interleague interlude in this
season's schedule ends on Thursday, each American League East and
National League East team will have played 16 interleague games.
Four of the five series were three games each, and one was a
two-game home-and-home pairing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 1999 schedule has 18 games for East Division teams:
the same four three-game series plus a three-game home-and-home
series. Thus, the Yankees and the Mets will play six games, as will
the other two pairs of natural rivals, Toronto and Montreal, and
Tampa Bay and Florida. Of the other teams in the East divisions,
Baltimore and Philadelphia will play six games, and so will Boston
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the designated date for management to submit a
schedule to the Players Association for its approval, but Monday,
management asked for and received a two-week extension. No matter.
The discussions that have been held indicate that the two sides
should have little trouble agreeing on an official schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement will also mean that the two sides agree to extend
inter-league play. It has been an experiment the last two years,
and the owners and players must approve its continuation. The two
sides also will agree to continue the use of the designated hitter.
The owners had been muttering about eliminating the d.h., the most
expensive position they have, but they have made no serious attempt
to do it. They know the players would not agree to extend
interleague play if they were forced to give up the d.h.
</P>
<P>
   No overwhelming reasons have been presented to end the
interleague experiment; on the contrary, fan interest is generally
high, with even some so-called purists succumbing to the
attractiveness of some series. But not every matchup has fans
racing to the ticket lines. When Kansas City played a two-game
series in Cincinnati last week, the total attendance of 36,750
produced a lower average than the Reds had attracted for their
other games.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox had a slightly higher average than their season
average for their three-game series with Milwaukee, but the total
attendance of 56,342 lagged well behind the 91,985 who saw a
three-game series between the Brewers and the Cubs at Wrigley Field
10 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the schedule is _ interleague, intraleague;
interdivision, intradivision; East vs. East, East vs. Central _
some series simply will not attract fans. It is the upside, not the
downside, that management and union officials are looking at.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And they can't get more ``up'' than the Mets and the Yankees,
with this year's series averaging 53,000 a game, last year's
56,000. So next season, they will try to duplicate both of those
numbers. The Yankees also will play three-game series at home
against Atlanta and Montreal; Toronto and Boston will visit the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos will play in Baltimore next season, where more fans
will see them play one game than the teams drew in Montreal
(36,817) for three games last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Brochu, the Expos' managing partner, was resigned to
seeing small crowds no matter who the opponent is. ``Our fans are
discouraged,'' he said Monday. ``It's going to be a tough year. We
just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny crowds did not detract from the pleasure the Expos
derived from the series sweep over their wealthier partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Brochu said. ``Whenever something like that
happens, I feel wonderful.''

BRUNNER FACES CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kenny Brunner, who led Dominguez High to
back-to-back state basketball championships, will be in L.A.
Municipal Court this morning for a preliminary hearing to determine
whether he will stand trial on charges of attempted murder and
robbery of Los Angeles City College basketball coach Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a rash of events that threaten to ruin
Brunner's once-promising career.
</P>
<P>
   He quit Georgetown's team in January, midway through his
freshman season, and later transferred to Fresno State, where he
was arrested in March along with former Artesia star Avondre Jones
on charges they robbed and assaulted a student with a samurai
sword. Brunner was suspended indefinitely from Fresno State's team
and then declared himself eligible for the NBA draft, a decision he
later reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on May 22, Brunner was arrested for allegedly pointing a
semi-automatic handgun at Miller and pulling the trigger, but the
gun did not fire. Brunner, police say, then grabbed $1,500 from
Miller and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner was arrested shortly after and is in L.A. County jail,
unable to post $550,000 bail. He has been charged with attempted
first-degree premeditated murder with a special allegation that he
used a firearm, and second-degree robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested was Ladale Lunnie, a LACC player, who was charged
with second-degree robbery and is free on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, though his attorney Jerome Bradford, declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez coach Russell Otis, for whom Brunner played under for
four years, says he talks with his former player daily. (Inmates
are allowed collect phone calls.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to stay strong,'' Otis said. ``He reads the Bible,
plays some basketball and watches TV. Kenny's been catered to all
his life through basketball and then to be in this situation. It's
got to be traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis says Brunner has had contact with few others mainly his
family, attorney and Laker forward Mario Bennett, a longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many people have turned their back on Kenny
and assumed he's guilty,'' said Otis. ``But that's the way our
society is you're guilty until proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing will determine if the District Attorney's office
has enough evidence to warrant a trial of Brunner or Lunnie. If so,
the matter will be transferred to Superior Court, where in two
weeks a trial date would be set. If the case goes to trial, it
would likely be 60 days beyond that, said both Bradford and
prosecutor Andrew Bassis.

AMERICANS SEE LIVE ACCESS TO CHINESE TV AS HIGHLIGHT OF SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs 1st and 5th grafs for re-editing) (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TV-COVERAGE,
CHINA-PEONY) 
(ps) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ It was not until minutes before the Saturday
news conference by President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin that
Clinton was told that the event was to be broadcast live on
television.
</P>
<P>
   And Jiang did not inform the United States that he would permit
the broadcast of Clinton's Beijing University speech on Monday
until less than an hour before the address was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that they were elated at both
decisions, which had been a central demand of the United States and
gave an American President unfiltered access to the Chinese people
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also said that progress at the summit on the
spread of weapons technology and the joint agreement not to aim
nuclear weapons at each other's cities were important, though
largely symbolic. It was the live television access to the Chinese
audience that made the summit meeting a breakthrough, according to
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials are still not clear why Jiang allowed the
wide dissemination of Clinton's statements.
</P>
<P>
   One theory they put forward to reporters as Clinton flew from
the Chinese capital to Shanghai was that Jiang used Clinton as a
sort of ventriloquist's dummy to raise the most sensitive topics in
Chinese society and then to defend his position to the Chinese
people and to reactionaries in his own government.
</P>
<P>
   Another school of thought was that Jiang knew how much the
American side valued access to the Chinese audience, and was not
willing to risk harming the relationship by denying that access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that these decisions were made at the
highest level, by Jiang himself,'' said a senior American official.
``One can only speculate about his motivation. They recognized that
the price of engagement with us was giving us access to their
people. Jiang knew he needed to do that to make this a successful
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained uncertain how deep or lasting an impact these events
would have on Chinese politics and society. Nor was it likely that
Clinton had silenced his critics at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real answer is going to come not from American officials,
but, of course, from the people of China,'' said Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of state for East Asia. ``And we've seen
repeated quotes in the press from people indicating that it will
have profound reverberations from here. I think this will be
percolating within China for quite some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides were unreservedly crowing Monday about the
``extraordinary,'' and ``historic'' summit meeting, and they
arranged a briefing for reporters by a senior official to talk ``on
background'' about all the 18 months of preparation Clinton and his
staff had made to pull off the event.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting in Beijing was the fruit of a risky decision
in November 1996 to conduct reciprocal summit meetings in
Washington and Beijing without any conditions, and thus no
guarantee of success, the official said, giving this account of
what happened:
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two summit meetings, in Washington in October,
was judged a success by both sides. The meeting produced a handful
of substantive agreements, including China's pledge to stop sending
missiles to Iran and aiding Pakistan's nuclear program, and a
deepening of the personal relationship between Clinton and Jiang.
The two countries set up a bug-proof hotline between their
capitals, a link that was used for the first time in May after the
Indian nuclear tests. It was the first time that an American
President and a Chinese leader had spoken by telephone, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere for the meeting in Beijing was more difficult,
the official said, with controversies swirling in the United States
over allegations of Chinese meddling in the 1996 Presidential
election and the suspected pilfering of sensitive American
technology through the launch of American satellites on Chinese
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials turned the difficult domestic
climate to their advantage, according to an account by a
high-ranking participant. The crescendo of criticism and a series
of congressional hearings on Chinese missiles and money put Clinton
in a quandary. He could cancel the summit meeting _ as 151 members
of Congress demanded _ or he could travel to Beijing without any
assurance that the meeting would bring results.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, went to
Beijing the first week of June with two messages for Jiang. He told
the Chinese leader that Clinton was ``unshakable'' in his
determination to make the summit meeting. But, he added, the
meeting had to produce a positive outcome or risk giving Clinton's
critics new ammunition and setting back United States-China
relations for months, or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was not a summit that moved the relationship forward,
it would feed the critics back home,'' a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions boiled down to one central concern on the
American side, which they believed would nurture the relationship
while quieting domestic critics: Clinton must have access to the
Chinese people, through television, radio and public appearances
that were not unduly restricted by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership was noncommittal on the access question,
as well as the substantive matters still under discussion _ the
targeting of nuclear missiles, the spread of weapons technology and
human rights. Berger returned to Washington uneasy about the
meeting, then less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always with the Chinese, nothing much happens before the
end game,'' a senior White House aide said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Berger's deputy, James Steinberg, flew to Beijing on June 22,
four days before Clinton was to arrive in China, to try to nail
down progress on the nuclear targeting plan and China's membership
in an international non-proliferation agreement known as the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of word-by-word negotiation of the statement on the
missile agreement, Steinberg and his Cambridge-educated Chinese
counterpart, Yang Jiechi, agreed that the two nations would
announce that China would ``actively consider joining'' the missile
accord. American officials consider that a significant step that
will ultimately lead to China's acceptance of international rules
governing sales of medium- and long-range missiles capable of
carrying nuclear, biological and chemical warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on the targeting of nuclear missiles went down to the
wire. On Friday, American officials expressed doubt that a deal
could be reached, because the Chinese insisted that the United
States renounce any first use of nuclear weapons, a policy change
the United States was unwilling to make. Agreement was finally
reached late Friday night, and was announced Saturday morning at
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One large question remained: Would Jiang permit the live
broadcast? Although American officials did not indicate in advance
that Clinton intended to criticize the Chinese crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Jiang
appeared prepared for the rhetorical broadside. And he in fact
invited Clinton to respond to his comments on Tibet and other human
rights issues, rather than curtailing the news conference, as he
easily could have.

MEXICO FALLS TO GERMANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France In the end, Mexico didn't achieve what it
wanted most, couldn't accomplish what had been thought impossible,
hadn't quite enough to turn this World Cup on its side.
</P>
<P>
   But in a heartbreaking loss to Germany in a second-round war on
a hot Monday afternoon at Stade de La Mosson, the Tricolor
demonstrating the spirit that has made it the surprise of France
this summer finally gained the respect it has sought, and that has
eluded it, for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   A superb Luis Hernandez strike and the prospect of another
almost had the Mexicans through to the quarterfinals before the
Germans, on goals by Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff, the
last in the 86th minute, pulled out a 2-1 triumph that left both
sides physically and emotionally spent.
</P>
<P>
   It was akin to a tussle between heavyweight champions, except
that only one of the combatants has ever won the championship. The
other, the Mexicans, has dreamed about the scenario, certainly, but
only in the last two weeks or so has it shown a semblance of the
fight, of the character, needed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pride and the character of every player,'' said
forward Francisco Palencia, the Mexicans' best player until
departing in the 53rd minute. ``We weren't given a chance, but give
us the ball and we'll play against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came here with big plans,'' said Manuel Lapuente,
the Tricolor coach. ``We played very inspired, attacked a lot,
scored a lot of goals ... it was quite fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never more agreeable than after Hernandez, with his
fourth goal of the tournament, fired the Mexicans ahead just two
minutes into the second half. It was a lead that held until the
75th minute, long enough for the Tri to smell an upset, long enough
so that when the Germans, playing to their strengths, rallied for
the victory, the Mexicans thought it an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we might (win),'' admitted goalkeeper Jorge Campos,
whose extraordinary performance his best of the Cup prevented
Germany from a romp. ``We had two chances to score the second goal,
but we lost them. If we had scored it is had been 2-0 it's a
different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who caused the Germans havoc all day on the
left wing, set up Hernandez's goal, bringing the ball across the
top of the box, then sliding it to his teammate. Hernandez, about
16 yards from the net, turned as he received the pass, stepped past
a sliding Michael Tarnat, and took off for the right post. He
eluded Markus Babbel at his heels, then fired across the goal and
past goalkeeper Andreas Koepke.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 2-0 a quarter of an hour later, after an insipid
Babbel pass in midfield left substitute Jesus Arellano with the
ball and an empty field in front of him. He raced to the box,
crossing paths with Hernandez along the way, then tried to shoot.
Lothar Matthaeus beat him to the punch, firing at his own goal in a
desperate attempt to clear the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Koepke got a hand on it, enough so to redirect it into the left
post, but Blanco tracked it down on the left side of the box and
fed Hernandez in the goalmouth. Koepke came up big again,
smothering the close-range shot.
</P>
<P>
   That, it turned out, spelled the end for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was a shock, a real shock ...,'' said Klinsmann.
``But we play according to our strengths, our fighting spirit. We
keep going and going and fighting and fighting for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be tough, we must be physically prepared for the heat
in all the stadiums. We're not a Latin American team. We're not the
Brazilian team. That's not our mentality. We try to fight to
instill fear in the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans weren't afraid, but an error cost them one goal,
Klinsmann's, and Bierhoff scored on an extraordinary header to
finish them off.
</P>
<P>
   The first came after several strong German chances had failed,
the best a Bierhoff header that struck the underside of the
crossbar late in the first half, and occurred only after a crucial
mistake by defender Raul Lara.
</P>
<P>
   Dietmar Hamann sent a cross from deep on the right wing into the
box, where it cleared Bierhoff and landed at Lara's feet. His touch
deceived him, leaving the ball on the doorstep; Klinsmann dove at
it, knocking it past Campos.
</P>
<P>
   Lara was again the defender in the middle of the action on
Bierhoff's goal, which followed a nice sequence from Matthaeus to
Tarnat to Ulf Kirsten on the right wing. Kirsten then sent in a
fine cross, and Bierhoff with Lara marking him from behind soared
to nod the ball into the upper-right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Mexicans, Lara was most disconsolate when the final
whistle blew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gutted,'' he said. ``We were so close to qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, who will face Croatia or Romania on Saturday night
in Lyon their 11th quarterfinal appearance in the past 12 World
Cups were happy just to have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult game today,'' Berti Vogts, the Germans'
weary coach said. ``I don't want to go through another day like
today.''

DAVIDSON LOVES LIFE IN BOWLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEVIN BARICH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She bowled her first 300 game at age 16. But for
Dede Davidson, a greater challenge loomed: trying to convince her
mother that it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember. It was April Fools Day,'' said Davidson, now a
31-year-old professional bowler from Woodland Hills. ``Every year
on that day, I would tweak my Mom out, telling her something that
wasn't true, just to get a reaction. So when I called her after I
bowled the 300, she didn't believe me. She just said, `Yeah right.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Davidson convinced her mother and since then she's
been convincing the rest of the bowling world that she's one of the
best at what she does, currently ranking 15th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is true,'' said Davidson, who was ranked as high as 11th
in 1989 or 1991. ``It's a great feeling. When I have bad days,
sometimes I ask myself, `What am I doing out here?' But then I look
out there at the crowd and I realize how lucky I am. Only a handful
of people make a living at this. I'm thankful for my gift. I thank
God for it. I'm proud of what I do and I try to be the best I can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Davidson competed in the U.S. Open in Milford, Conn.
_ considered by many to be the most prestigious bowling event on
the tour. At first, it looked as if Davidson would wrap up the
event and its $42,000 in prize money, in dominating fashion as she
tallied a 241 average over the first two days, tops for both the
men and the women.
</P>
<P>
   Though she tapered off a bit toward the end of the tournament,
Davidson finished strongly, placing 15th among 150 women bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good all week. I had been practicing simply for that
tournament, all by itself,'' said Davidson who won the U.S. Open in
1993. ``I practiced really hard because I wanted to do well again.
I had the lead for two days on both sides and I guess that's quite
an accomplishment. But I should've been able to keep it going, to
keep the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Davidson, who started bowling at age 8,
to make an impact on the game. When she was 11, she became the
youngest girl ever to bowl a 299.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure did,'' said Davidson, reminiscing about her feat. ``It
was at the McKeebowl Bowling Alley in San Jose. I had never worn an
arm brace (a bowling glove extending to the wrist and part of the
forearm) before, but I found one (at the ball return). It was
pretty, so I put it on. Then I went out and bowled a 299. At first,
I thought it was because of the arm brace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, my mom was working across the street and my Dad
kept calling her and giving her updates frame by frame,'' she
added, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson bowled in junior tournaments throughout California
before having to compete in the adult leagues against 20- and
21-year-olds when she was just 16 because ``the program was kind of
fading.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while bowling in the adult leagues that Davidson realized
she might just have a future in bowling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competing in the adult leagues, I really began to think that I
could do this for a living,'' said Davidson, who has won 18
Professional Regional titles.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where some don't embark upon the professional ranks
until they're in their 30s, Davidson turned pro in 1985 at the
tender age of 17. She made waves her first year, being named Rookie
of the Year by both the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour and the Worldwide
Women's Pro Bowlers (WWPB).
</P>
<P>
   But in her second year on the tour, Davidson went through a bit
of a rough spot, struggling to regain the form that made her the
top rookie just one year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a stage in my second year. I guess you can call
it the sophomore jinx,'' Davidson said. ``My parents had been there
with me, really been there for me, my first year and so in my
second year I decided to try and be on my own. It was the worst
year I ever had. I think I made $5,000 that whole year. I started
to wonder if I was good enough. I began second-guessing myself. So
I went home and tried to straighten out my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson eventually got her game back on track and brought it to
higher levels of excellence throughout the rest of the 1980's. But
it wasn't until the '90s that Davidson would have some of her best
bowling triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of that decade, Davidson was named the WWPB
Player of the Year two years in a now. Also, in 1991, Davidson was
named to the U.S. team which defeated Japan in team competition in
Tokyo. That same year, she won the Women's International Bowling
Congress National Title.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably one of the stronger, more powerful left-handers
on the tour,'' said Gip Lentine, Davidson's coach since 1991. ``She
has the ability to hook it more, even overpower it a little bit
more, than other bowlers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Davidson won the U.S. Open, a victory that led to her
becoming one of the few women bowlers ever to be written about by
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the final (of the U.S. Open) I told Kelly (the
reporter from Sports Illustrated) that I would speak to her
tomorrow,'' said Davidson who has been endorsing tournaments for
Continental Amateur Bowlers Incorporated since 1996. ``She said,
`Well, I'm only writing about the winner.' And I said, `Yeah, I'll
be speaking to you tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   What happened after that was a series of injuries, the most
notable one being in 1996 when Davidson threw out her back three
days before the start of the summer pro tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to practice every day, every weekend, between
tournaments,'' said Davidson who has been sponsored by Dan Duett,
of Kinco Ltd., and his wife Wanda for the past three years. ``But
then I hurt my back and I realized that there were going to be
times when I needed to rest, when I needed my body to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Davidson won the St. Clair Classic in Fairview, Ill.; it
was her first tournament victory in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been too long,'' Davidson said. ``I earned this victory.
I deserved it. It's been a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's perseverance was recently awarded when she was named
the Bowler of the Month for May by the Women's Pro Bowlers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Despite already being on the tour for 14 years, retirement has
not even entered Davidson's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep playing as long as my body holds up,''
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   She's 15th in the nation right now, but will Dede Davidson ever
be No.1?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. The competition's real tough,'' Davidson said.
``But I got as good a chance as anybody.''

<P>
   Nancy Wheeler was home in her trailer by a trickle of a creek in
Elkview, W.Va., when the weather hit on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear it or see it or nothing,'' Ms. Wheeler said.
``The water just came all at once. I got out of my trailer five to
10 minutes before it floated off. It just went right down the
stream and then busted apart.''
</P>
<P>
   But the storm that savaged the middle and eastern parts of the
country over the weekend and on Monday had worse in store for Ms.
Wheeler, 50, who has lived her entire life in this small town just
northwest of Charleston. As she rushed over to the trailer where
her son and daughter-in-law lived, the predatory current swept the
couple's four-month-old son out of his mother's arms. The baby,
Dakota Chyan Taylor, still has not been found and is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up over my neck and I went under twice, and I was
looking for my grandson,'' Ms. Wheeler said on Monday from a school
where she and other families were being sheltered and fed. ``I
pulled myself up by some weeds and I lost him. I tried to look for
him and I just couldn't find him.''
</P>
<P>
   A maelstrom of wet and violent weather has lashed across the
Midwest, Northeast and Appalachian states in the last few days,
leaving at least 23 dead or missing. Floods wrought devastation
from Wisconsin to West Virginia, Indiana to Vermont. A tornado and
heavy rains battered Ohio. And lightning strikes over the weekend
killed a Maryland girl, a camper in upstate New York and a
56-year-old farmer in Meire Grove, Minn., who had been turning over
matted hay with a pitchfork.
</P>
<P>
   Rain also fell in parts of Florida, where Vice President Al Gore
was visiting areas affected by drought-induced wildfires that have
charred 237,000 acres since Memorial Day, and more rain was
predicted in coming days. But officials said that it did not appear
sufficient to offset the danger of further fires.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, including Ohio and West Virginia on Monday,
people braced for pounding from another storm predicted to pass
through Monday night or Tuesday. Meanwhile, across the region, the
National Guard and state transportation and emergency management
teams were searching for the missing, clearing out fallen trees and
houses, and trying to restore electricity and water to tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real toad-choker of a storm,'' said D.R. Smith, the
emergency services director in Wood County, W.Va., near the Ohio
border, where about two dozen homes remained completely surrounded
by water on Monday. ``It rained pretty doggone hard up until this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Floods dislodged about 35 mobile homes from a trailer park near
Parkersburg on Sunday, which floated away with about 80 people
inside them, Smith said. The volunteer fire department chased after
them on boats and jet skis, plucking people out while the homes
were sailing by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most devastation that this area has ever had, as
far as I can remember,'' said Capt. Larry Sims of the Muskingum
County Sheriff's Department in southeastern Ohio, part of an area
that got up to nine inches of rain Sunday and overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest death toll from the storms so far has been in Ohio,
with 11 people killed by floods or tornadoes. On Monday, Gov.
George Voinovich increased to 24 the number of central and
southeastern Ohio counties placed under a state of emergency.
Weather conditions were so bad that the governor could not even
visit some of the damaged areas on Monday, where 9,000 people have
been put out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just recovered the last body five minutes ago,'' said
Sheriff Landon Smith of Noble County, Ohio, where six people died,
``five drowning victims and one from a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly couple from Caldwell, Frank and Marie Hardesty, 90
and 89 years old, were killed when their home was ``washed away
with them in it,'' the sheriff said. ``The home was totally
destroyed. There were just pieces laying everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A 71-year-old man, Edward Granger of Caldwell, drowned in his
car. And on Monday afternoon, authorities found the body of
31-year-old Michael Clark, whom they had been searching for since
Saturday night, when his wife, Brenda, and 6-year-old daughter,
Brittany, were rescued, after they were found clinging to trees.
</P>
<P>
   In four Ohio counties, public water systems were crippled and
the National Guard was hauling in water in tankers and bottles. In
the town of Cambridge, more than 200 residents of a nursing home
were being moved to a hospital for safety and the state mental
hospital there was being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where seething floods had pummeled mobile homes,
ripped through bridges and roads, and trapped people in trees and
on rooftops, Gov. Howard Dean declared a state of emergency in nine
communities in four counties and said on Monday that he would seek
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' the governor said Sunday as he flew over
his state's midsection. ``The personal losses in these homes is
just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were towns in the Mad River Valley, where a large
music festival at the Sugarbush ski resort were called off, with
hundreds of concert-goers turned back by police at barricarded
roads. About a dozen roads were closed, including parts of Route
100, a major north-south artery.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a man died after being sucked into a culvert
he was trying to clear of debris. In Wisconsin, a 35-year-old man
was missing after his boat stalled an plunged over a dam on Lake
Arbutus. In Minnesota, two were dead and one was missing. And three
people were dead as a result of weekend storms in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana on Monday, eight bridges in Owen County were
uprooted, causing an estimated $5 million dollars in damage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Ohio and West Virginia communities along either side of
the swollen Ohio River seemed to suffer the most. In West Virginia,
floods and mudslides were so severe that the American Red Cross
opened seven emergency shelters in Wood, Jackson and Kanawha
counties for storm evacuees. Gov. Cecil Underwood toured the worst
areas and named 24 counties state disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Clendenin, one of the hardest hit towns where nearly eight
inches of rain fell in two days, rescue crews in boats were
floating door to door on Monday, assisting or evacuating residents.
Kent Carper, a county commissioner in Kanawha County, said that 50
homes were destroyed, about 25 were severely damaged and about 15
bridges were submerged. On Sunday, a congressman, Rep. Bob Wise, a
Democrat, was trapped in his home for eight hours until the water
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground is already saturated and the little tributaries
have nowhere to dump their water so they become rivers,'' Carper
said. ``It just wiped out houses.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in Kanawha County that Ms. Wheeler's grandson was pulled
into the vicious water. And a blind man in his wheelchair was
whisked off his front porch, where relatives had placed him while
they gathered his belongings and prepared to evacuate the house.
Another man suffered a heart attack in Clendenin and died because
an ambulance could not get to his house for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just horrible,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ``I lost
everything I had.''

LIBERTY BACK FROM DEAD  
 MERCURY'S HAGIWARA MISSES LATE TRY FOR TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ File the obituary for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Liberty, conquerors of the Mercury in the 1997 WNBA
playoff semifinals, slowed the Mercury express on Monday night,
71-68.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Liberty officially established that a 1-4
road start was a fluke and that at 5-4, it remains a force in the
10-team league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three games, we were not ourselves,'' Liberty Coach
Nancy Darsch said. ``We had a lot of players who needed to remember
what a 40-minute game is like, what it feels like to compete that
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (6-2) saw its three-game win streak end before a
celebrity-dotted crowd of 12,683 at Madison Square Garden and a
national cable audience. The Mercury dropped a game behind Houston
in the Western Conference, but not to the chagrin of its coach.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming broadly, as if she knew a secret about the loss that
made it OK, Cheryl Miller gathered her team on the court for a pep
talk after Mikiko Hagiwara's try for a tying three-pointer just
before the buzzer missed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy,'' Miller said. ``We had some points where we let
down with our intensity, and like any good team, they made a run at
home. I don't think it was lack of execution on our part or
anything like that. I just think they made made a run, and we
didn't. . . . We executed well down the stretch and got the shots
we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury put together a 9-0 run to pull even at 64 with 4:35
remaining, taking the steam out of a 10-0 Liberty run. That made
model Tyra Banks and actor Gregory Hines, sitting two seats apart
directly across from the Mercury bench, and billionaire developer
Donald Trump and TV host Rosie O'Donnell squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Witherspoon, one of two 23-point scorers for New York,
canned a 7-footer off an inbounds pass. Then during a timeout,
Miller called a play for Bridget Pettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our plan, to go one-on-one and kind of suck them
in,'' said Pettis, who put a between-the-legs, dazzling display on
WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Teresa Weatherspoon but missed a
short jumper.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute later, Witherspoon intercepted a Jennifer Gillom
pass intended for Michele Timms and took it for a layup and a 68-64
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Miller called on Pettis, who had three 20-point games in
the past four but was slowed Monday after picking up her fourth
foul with 16:15 left. Her 15-footer against Weatherspoon rimmed
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty pushed its lead to six when Umeki Webb slipped
trying to cover Vickie Johnson, and Sue Wicks hit the streaking
Johnson with an inbounds pass for an easy layup at the 1:08 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added a free throw, her 23rd point, for a 71-66 with 49
seconds left, then Miller and her staff almost worked coaching
magic.
</P>
<P>
   Going away from Pettis and to leading scorer Gillom inside, the
Mercury got two free throws with 35 seconds left. Weatherspoon ran
down the shot clock before whipping a pass on the wing to Johnson,
who traveled under Webb's defensive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pettis forced a shot just inside the three-point line with 2.8
seconds on the clock and drew a foul from Weatherspoon. Miller
already was substituting 6-8 Maria Stepanova to rebound an
intentional miss of the second free throw when Pettis, the WNBA's
best free throw shooter last season, bounced the first high off the
rim.
</P>
<P>
   Two Liberty timeouts later, Pettis purposely missed. Stepanova
rebounded and found Hagiwara on the right wing. The Japanese
three-point specialist had a good look but overshot the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw the defense coming at her, so she did ponder on either
faking or not,'' said Hagiwara's interpreter, Kyoko Takahashi.
``She wasn't sure if she had enough time to fake and shoot, so she
decided to shoot because she was bumped. She thinks she should have
faked it. She regrets that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury has a day off in New York, then travels to
Cleveland, where it resumes a five-game trip Thursday. &QL;

STREAK OF NOT LOSING GAMES TO LABOR WOES AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA imposed a long-expected lockout Monday, setting the
stage for a labor dispute that threatens the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   As of 9 tonight Phoenix time, the league will cease business
with its players.
</P>
<P>
   Trades and free-agent signings will be put on hold. Players will
not be allowed into arenas or practice facilities owned by league
clubs to work out or even to get medical treatment. No summer
leagues, no informal workouts.
</P>
<P>
   It will remain that way until a new collective bargaining
agreement is reached between the league and the National Basketball
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the next several months will determine whether
the NBA can maintain its distinction of being the only one of the
four major professional sports leagues never to lose a game to a
work stoppage. Training camps are scheduled to open in October,
followed by the regular season in the first week of November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current system does not work,'' Commissioner David Stern
said in a conference call with the media Monday. ``We can't afford
to play next season under the current system. That's just the
reality. That's why the owners elected to lock out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is the so-called Larry Bird
exception, which allows a free agent who has spent a minimum number
of years with the same team to re-sign with that club without
regard to the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Chicago Bulls paid Michael Jordan $33 million
last season. That's $7 million more than the cap for an entire
team.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the league maintains, players were paid about 57
percent of league revenue last season, while the collective
bargaining agreement was supposed to limit their share to 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last negotiating session between the league and the
union two weeks ago, the players association refused to go forward
unless the Bird exception remains. That session broke off after 30
minutes, and no further talks are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to note that just because we have a
lockout and that puts a stop to everyone doing business, that
doesn't prevent anyone from beginning to talk the next day,'' said
Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who is on the league's labor
relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's in the hands of the negotiators. The most important
thing, in my opinion, is that somehow, some way, people understand
the severity of the issue and the problem. And at some point, these
people will get together and try to resolve these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you break the logjam? That's the $64 question.''
</P>
<P>
   The logjam is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The players don't want a hard salary cap and believe that the
owners have only themselves to blame for escalating salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA never has lost a game to a labor dispute, but that could
change this time. The players union was divided into two factions
three years ago, when the last contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   A group of players, led by Jordan, New York's Patrick Ewing and
their agent, David Falk, did not support what eventually was agreed
upon. The owners didn't like it much either, and it included a
clause that allowed the owners to reopen negotiations this summer
if the players' share of revenue went above 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said in a conference call
Monday that the league isn't focusing entirely on the Bird
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last bargaining meeting, the union said that unless the
owners were prepared to agree to maintain the Larry Bird exception
as is, they had nothing further to talk about,'' Granik said. ``We
need an agreement that is not totally open-ended, and if there's a
way to do so that keeps the exception, or some elements of it,
we're prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue are the rookie salary scale, which allows a new
player to become a free agent in three years, and the league's drug
policy, which does not include marijuana as a banned substance and
does not allow for random testing.
</P>
<P>
   Already lost in the dispute is a team of 12 NBA players set to
represent the United States at the World Championships. They will
be replaced by a team of Continental Basketball Association and
college players. Last week, union Executive Director Billy Hunter
said, ``I think we're in for a long summer.''
</P>
<P>
   After Stern and Granik made their announcement Monday, Hunter
said he hopes for a negotiating session in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he's aware of predictions that it will be a long
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate what I think will happen,'' he
said. ``I've already been wrong once on this one. I thought there
was a good chance we could head it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the owners prepared to take the disagreement into the
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the owners are prepared to do what's
necessary to correct the system because the system doesn't work,''
Colangelo said. ``I wouldn't go any further than that.'' &QL;

DIA MONDBACKS WEATHER VISIT TO SOUTH BEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CURT RALLO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Groundskeepers at Coveleski Stadium put in a
path from the pitcher's mound to home plate, just like the one at
Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad South Bend also didn't copy the retractable roof.
Adverse weather forced officials to call the exhibition game
between the Diamondbacks and their Class A affiliate, the South
Bend Silver Hawks, after the Diamondbacks batted in the sixth
inning. The game ended in a tie at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning caused a 31-minute delay, and the game was played
despite occasional rain and a tornado watch listed for nearby St.
Joseph County. Tornadoes were reportedly sighted in two adjacent
counties. Attendance for the game was 6,275, the 14th-largest crowd
in South Bend history. South Bend's all-time attendance record is
7,827, set on July 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad we didn't get the whole game in,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``We'd love to come back here. To me,
it's an honor to play in these games. It's very convenient for us
since we're going to take the bus over to Chicago (for a game today
against the Cubs). What more could you ask than to play to a tie
with your farm team? Did you notice we didn't let them bat in the
bottom of the sixth, though?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Osborne supplied thunder of a different kind in the first
inning for South Bend against Arizona starting pitcher Stephen
Randolph, who was called in from High Desert to pitch for the
parent team. Osborne crushed a three-run homer to center field as
the Silver Hawks jumped to a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Sykes, who helped lead Valparaiso University on its
magical NCAA basketball run in March, opened South Bend's first
inning with a double. He scored on a single by Brian Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you get an opportunity to play against the
big league team,'' Osborne said. ``Everybody was real excited. The
home run was an extra. It was just a fun day for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, a catcher drafted in the third round in 1996, said he
hopes the home run signals a return to full strength after battling
thumb and elbow injuries this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good swinging the bat,'' Osborne said. ``I'll be glad
to start catching every day. I feel like I've let the team down
when I just DH. I want to contribute behind the plate, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona answered South Bend's outburst with three runs in the
second inning, two on Karim Garcia's towering home run to right
field. The Diamondbacks knotted the score at 4 in the fifth inning
when Damian Miller scored on a double by former South Bend star
Mike Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   South Bend right fielder Brian Gordon turned in the defensive
gem of the game, hauling in a rocket hit by Tony Batista as he
crashed into the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the South Bend players were impressive,'' Showalter
said. ``I was especially impressed with (pitcher) Jeff Andrews. He
has a real nice sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews worked six innings and gave up four runs on 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the adrenaline was flowing,'' Andrews said. ``It
takes a lot for me to control it. Sometimes it can work against
you. I just tried to do what I've done all season, throw it down in
the zone. It was a great opportunity for me to face big league
hitters. It was a learning experience and an opportunity to gauge
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   South Bend Manager Roly de Armas said the game was a success as
far as he was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we got it in,'' De Armas said. ``Everybody got an
at-bat. Our kids went right after them. They weren't
intimidated.'' &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ With the issue-laden leg of his China trip now
behind him, President Clinton and his entourage came to the
country's most cosmopolitan city Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   To put his finger on the vibrant pulse of modern China, his
aides said, Clinton will spend two days and three nights here
talking to regular people.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down the winding avenues of neon that advertise a
distinctly commercial sensibility in Shanghai, his motorcade went
from the airport to the thriving waterfront, the visual centerpiece
of any tour of this mega-city of 14 million, China's largest.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting on Tuesday morning with entreprenuers, community
leaders and homeowners in Shanghai was meant to accent the dynamic,
fast-growing economic side of China, though it veered off into
other topics from the law to religion. President Clinton also
assembled seven ``agents of change'' for a roundtable discussion at
the Shanghai Library and then appeared on a call-in radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands there is a new China that is more
prosperous, more open and more dynamic,'' Clinton said. ``The
purpose here is to help me and my wife and the American people
understand the changes that are going on in modern China and the
challenges that are out there and what all of your are doing in
your lives to deal with those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The group included a law professor, a consumer advocate, a
physicist, an economist and a bishop who spent years in prison.
Unlike two earlier addresses by Clinton in China, this event was
not carried live on Chinese television.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, Jin Luxian, who is attached to a Chinese Catholic
church that is independent of the Vatican, appeared to surprise the
president with the declaration that he did not think ``belief in
religion'' was ``restricted in any way'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   Jin also said his church cooperated with the government. ``Why
should church believers do something against our government?'' he
asked. ``Here we adopted the policy of dialogue instead of
contending with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who gave lengthy responses to many of the questions,
had no reply to Jin.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Lanye, deputy dean of the international department at the
East China University of Politics and Law, told the president that
the state of the legal profession in China remained primitive but
had improved. Mrs. Zhu, who is in her 40s, said China needed to
train thousands more lawyers and persuade people to seek legal
remedies to their grievances with the Government or in the private
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xiaoying, 51, a novelist, said she had little trouble
getting her novels about family life published. ``The problem is
not getting novels published,'' she said. ``but coming up with good
ideas each day.''
</P>
<P>
   To address ordinary Chinese, Clinton also appeared on an
hourlong live call-in program on Shanghai Radio 990, the most
widely heard show in China, with a potential audience of 30
million.
</P>
<P>
   The government had resisted allowing Clinton to appear on the
program, American officials said. But last week the government
agreed to the appearance, considered by the White House to be an
important event because it allowed Clinton to speak directly to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Like talk-radio in the United States, conversations are
broadcast with a seven-second delay, but American officials said
the calls were not going to be screened for content.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were indeed wideranging, from the economy (``I
believe that China has done a very good job in holding its currency
stable and trying to be a force of stability during the Southeast
Asian crisis,'' Clinton said), to the World Cup soccer tournament
(``It's hard for me to predict, but I think the Brazilians are
pretty hard to beat.''), to his health (the president keeps in
shape on a mechanical stairclimber ``because it's quicker than
running'').
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed air of the radio show was reflected on Monday
evening as the president stepped out of his limousine at the
Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, on a busy street lined with crowds of
people craning their necks for a glimpse. Clinton waved to
acknowledge the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went inside for the evening, passing up the chance to
peek at Shanghai's boisterous night life at the bars and supper
clubs that self-consciously fashion themselves after the styles set
in the 1920s and 30s, when Shanghai was the most cosmopolitan city
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's daytime itinerary on Tuesday and Wednesday are
three landmarks that have opened in just the last two years: a
stock exchange that is a leader technologically, a world-class
museum with inventive display techniques and the Shanghai library,
China's most modern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have portrayed his itinerary as one that traces
China's history. In Xian, the first stop, one sees relics of
ancient China; in Beijing, the largest icons of Communist China are
on view; Shanghai is clearly the most forward-looking city in the
country. Of course, that neat description does not account for
Guilin, the pleasure spot, or Hong Kong, which lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China,'' said Mike
McCurry, the White House spokesman. ``The changes that are taking
place in China are reflected in the very dynamic growth,
economically, and the changes taking place in South China.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To Shanghai residents, actually, the rate of economic growth is
palpably slowing. The real estate boom of the mid-1990s has created
a bubble of supply that seems poised to burst.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with much of the rest of Asia, however, Shanghai
looks healthy. Round-the-clock construction continues on
skyscrapers throughout the city, if on fewer than before. The
unemployment rate is rising steadily, as state-owned factories
downsize, yet average family income is still climbing marginally.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few formal events planned during Clinton's
stay here, and officials doing advance work say that offers the
Clinton family the flexibility for shopping and walks, or quiet
time away from their 1,000-member entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's itinerary includes only three events, leaving almost
the entire afternoon free for something unscripted. Wednesday's
plans are almost as relaxed. On Monday, after speaking at Beijing
University, the Clintons took it easy. They stayed in, at Diaoyutai
Guest House, playing cards and board games, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton also has a handful of nonofficial visits
planned in Shanghai. To combine her interest in health care and
children's welfare, she is to visit the Shanghai Children's Medical
Center, a new hospital built by Project Hope, an American-based
foundation, and Shanghai's Second Medical University. It is the
first hospital in China devoted to treating children, and it was
created by nongovernmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not in any five-year plan,'' said William Walsh,
president and chief executive of Project Hope, which has been
active in China since 1983, training and advising medical workers
in public health. ``It reflects the kind of volunteerism that is
starting to grow in China today.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also helped, Walsh said, that two of Shanghai's former
leaders who welcomed Project Hope here were later promoted to the
nation's top posts: President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also plans to visit a women's education and
training center and the Shanghai No. 3 Girls' School. On Wednesday
she will visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue, originally built for Jews
who lived in Shanghai before the Communist-led army arrived in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also joined her husband at the roundtable
discussion on Tuesday at the Shanghai Library. &QL;

U.N. MOVES TO PREVENT AIDS BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Leaders of the major U.N. health agencies began the
most powerful assault ever Monday on one of the global AIDS
epidemic's most devastating problems _ the needless deaths of
hundreds of thousands of infants born each year to mothers infected
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was among the highlights Monday during the 12th
World AIDS Congress, the largest conference on AIDS to be held
since the epidemic began.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. program is aimed at narrowing the gap between the
developed world, where infection rates and deaths have been slowed
through the use of expensive combination-drug regimens, and poorer
countries where AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes the disease,
remain largely unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the effort has been pledged by the World Bank and
the European Community. A few drug companies are promising to slash
prices for the anti-viral drug AZT and other medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, the United Nations'
semi-independent AIDS-battling agency, disclosed that health
workers in 11 Third World countries are about to offer confidential
AIDS testing to 30,000 pregnant women, together with speeded access
to AZT for every woman infected with the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said at least 600,000 HIV-infected infants were born to
infected mothers last year. Ninety percent of them were in Africa,
and most of the mothers were unaware that they carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials have shown since 1994 that AZT _ administered to
women during their last four weeks of pregnancy _ can cut newborn
infection rates in half.
</P>
<P>
   More recent tests of varying ways to apply the drug have
achieved even more dramatic results _ saving as many as 97 percent
of at-risk babies from becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS supports trial programs of all kinds. Efforts focus
mainly on Third World countries, where 95 percent of the epidemic's
victims have been stricken, and where poverty, medical resources,
clean water, decent nutrition and even stable governments are
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Kouchner, France's secretary of state for health,
has beaten the drums around the world to scare up enough resources
to cope with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Piot and Kouchner's economic experts have calculated that it
will cost about $50 to test and counsel each woman for the presence
of HIV, another $50 to provide her with substitutes for
breast-feeding, which can contaminate babies with the virus, and
perhaps $20 for the AZT dosages each infected woman will need.
</P>
<P>
   That means the first phase of the effort in the first 11 Third
World countries would cost at least $3.6 million. As the effort
spreads to protect hundreds of thousands of newborns every year in
countless more countries, the cost could skyrocket from millions
into the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kouchner said, his quest for support has been
successful: ``When I tell the president of the World Bank,'' he
said, ``that for $50 he can save a child's life, he can hardly
refuse, and so far he has not.''
</P>
<P>
   AZT in pill form cannot do the job alone, and HIV-infected
mothers who breast-feed their babies can transmit the virus in the
milk. Another risk factor is breast lesions that afflict many young
mothers in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   In high-risk parts of the world, at least 30 percent of pregnant
women receive no prenatal care. Forty percent must undergo unsafe
deliveries and get little or no follow-up care after delivering,
according to Dr. Awa-Marie Coll-Seck, an infectious-disease
specialist from Senegal who is UNAID's director of policy, strategy
and research.
</P>
<P>
   Ways must be found to block such routes of infection, she said,
and much of that job will fall to UNICEF, the U.N. children's
welfare organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our efforts at providing safe water and other protections
for children have been undermined, undone, by the AIDS epidemic,''
said Dr. David Alnwick, UNICEF's health chief. ``But we are now
committed to supporting every possible practical action that will
prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to their infants.''
</P>
<P>
   Alnwick's agency will help provide access to voluntary,
confidential counseling and AIDS testing for pregnant women, he
said, and will help develop alternatives to breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge marks a significant policy reversal for UNICEF. The
agency has always strongly encouraged mothers throughout the world
to breast-feed their babies rather than use commercial infant
formulas, citing risks from polluted water and nutritional
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Breast milk, however, can be heat-treated to minimize the
infection risk, Alnwick suggested. Or ``milk banks'' could be
created under UNICEF auspices, using supplies from uninfected
volunteers backed up by thoroughly screened wet nurses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the encouraging prospects for saving infant lives, however,
came a note of warning from a young woman who identified herself
only as a Paris member of ACT UP, the militant organization that
has played an important, if often provocative, role in pushing for
faster scientific progress in the AIDS fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may save the babies,'' she said, ``but what about the
mothers after you've protected their newborns with your `short
courses' of AZT? You are going to create an orphan factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner shrugged at that challenge, then replied: ``This
epidemic has gotten ahead of us completely. We cannot have a
perfect strategy against it. But we must move as swiftly as we can
wherever we can, and of course that means we must move into the
battle of providing access to real and continuing care for the
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let us also start now with what we can realistically do,
and save the babies now that we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other successful efforts in HIV-prevention in newborns through
surgical delivery were reported during the Geneva conference by
researchers from several advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
   In one trial, Dr. Laurent Mandelbrot of France's National Center
for Health and Medical Research and his colleagues were able to cut
the infection rate among newborns to less than 1 percent using a
combination of drugs and early delivery by cesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   AZT was administered to more than 900 HIV-infected pregnant
women during their last four weeks of pregnancy. The babies were
then delivered by C-section before their virus-infected membranes
broke and labor began. AZT was also given to the babies for several
weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
   In one series of 133 cesarean deliveries, for example, AZT
protection plus the elective surgery resulted in only a single baby
born with HIV, Mandelbrot said. Full results will be published this
week in the Journal of the American Medical Association
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbrot conceded that although the procedure could be
recommended in every country where access to safe operations is
widespread, most poor nations can barely afford skilled surgery for
their sickest people _ let alone to protect babies from AIDS. &LR;

THE CLINTONS HOPE PERSONAL GLIMPSES OVERCOME CHINESE SUSPICIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ President Clinton and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton treated a radio talk show Tuesday with details about
their personal lives in an effort the White House spokesman said
was designed to overcome any distrust by the Chinese public.
</P>
<P>
   The president talked basketball, workouts, golf and World Cup
favorites during a call-in radio program that is routinely heard by
10 million of China's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first non-Chinese guest to appear on ``Citizens
and Society,'' a daily call-in radio broadcast hosted by Zuo
Anlong.
</P>
<P>
   ``People everywhere want to engage their leaders in dialogue,''
Clinton told the radio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The president took listeners on a tour of his personal
recreational preferences in response to a telephone call from a
university student who expressed admiration for the 51-year-old
chief executive's health, ``very nice figure,'' and ability to
maintain ``your energy in your work.''
</P>
<P>
   The student asked what sports Clinton likes to play; how he
maintains his energy and his prediction on the winner of the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled playing basketball in college and jogging for
almost 30 years for exercise before suffering a knee injury and
switching to a stair-stepping machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do that quite a lot now because it's quicker than running,''
Clinton explained. ``And I play golf. I like golf very much. It's
my favorite sport. Even though it doesn't burn a lot of calories,
it makes my mind calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said after the program concluded, he realized that he
had forgotten to tell the student how he maintains his energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to exercise whenever I can and get enough sleep and
keep my mind occupied,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, conceding that he as ``not an expert'' in soccer, said
that the ``Brazilians are always hard to beat,'' adding: ``I've
watched them play a lot and they're very good.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said the Clintons'
decision to offer the Chinese glimpses into their personal lives
was an effort to allay Chinese fears that the Clintons' nine-day
visit to China and Clinton administration overtures to China mask
some hidden, sinister motive.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens ``are so used to leaders who have ulterior
motives that I think that both Clintons felt like if they could be
as personal as they could be, they would be able to breakdown some
barriers,'' McCurry said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons decided to launch their personal charm offensive at
previously scheduled events after the president was questioned
about his sincerity by a student at Bejing University on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The student, expressing concern about possible U.S. efforts to
``contain China,'' asked the president if he had a ``hidden''
agenda ``behind this smile'' during his five-city tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The president replied: ``The answer is no. I want partnership.
I'm not hiding another design behind a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton mentioned the question several times in
subsequent conversations with aides.
</P>
<P>
   The student's inquiry ``really went to the heart of some of the
insecurities that Chinese people have,'' McCurry said. ``The
question was about what's behind your face and the Clintons felt it
had to be a very personal answer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry conceded that the gestures by the Clintons are ``unusual
for a Chinese audience because they're not used to hearing
discussions like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said White House officials are hopeful that the
Clintons' efforts will help magnify the impact of the newly
jocular, confident relationship between Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin that the pair showcased at a 70-minute
nationally televised news conference in Beijing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we're talking about fundamental differences, it's
not being done by us because we're trying to subvert their
government or produce some change or trying to throttle back
China's aspirations on the world stage,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, participating in a round-table discussion with her
husband, expressed frustration at the constant public scrutiny and
criticism of her activities.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was a ``very unusual experience'' to serve as First
Lady, a role that draws so ``much attention for things that you
have no real conscious awareness or purpose for.''
</P>
<P>
   In another event that offered the family-oriented Chinese an
insight into the Clintons, the president took his daughter Chelsea
on an afternoon stroll through the picturesque old quarter of
Shanghai filled with Chinese shoppers and workers making their way
through a maze of streets lined with pagoda-style buildings.

COLUMNISTS AND TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 2)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that a scandal involving a newspaper columnist in
Boston would hit as a national association of newspaper columnists
was meeting in San Diego is a small example of why you don't have
to make up coincidences in this business.
</P>
<P>
   Before coffee and even before name tags, word spread that a
Boston Globe columnist, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, Patricia Smith,
had been forced to resign for fabricating characters and quotes in
her columns.
</P>
<P>
   This was not only a story that fell right into our laps but
threatened to splatter all over us.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't at our conference. More of us are writers from
medium- and small-sized papers. But waiting in the wings to be
first-up keynote speaker was Smith's colleague, Eileen McNamara,
also a Boston Globe columnist and last year's winner of the
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   There were actually three Pulitzer winners at this conference,
brought in as speakers, exemplifying the top of the craft. But
their job is no different from the rest of ours. The role and
responsibility of any newspaper person have nothing to do with
paycheck and name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen McNamara talked about the thrill of writing for the paper
she'd grown up reading, about creating a column in a hospital
waiting room while her mother was in surgery and going after a
baseball owner who hired a convicted wife beater. Sister Eileen
made you glad to be in her club and ended her talk with a back-away
grin, saying, ``I don't suppose anyone has any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   We had, of course, lots of them. But just as many for ourselves
as for her.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper people know that we are not beloved. People are always
getting mad at the mass media and while we often jump in to
separate ourselves from that mass, protesting, ``We're print,
that's TV'' or ``You're thinking of the grocery store tabloids,''
we know we're often regarded with the same sneer.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago a friend and I were having a compatible lunch
until she brought up Clinton's shame, narrowing her eyes and saying
``it's all because of you people.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her I didn't start it and she asked if I'd written about
it and I said, ``Of course,'' and she said, ``See.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnists, who get to write with an edge and a passion, are
accused of being everything from male bashers to bleeding hearts,
often both, or Clinton-lovers to Clinton-haters, often both, of
being unpleasant, tasteless, too soft, too hard, PC and pithy.
</P>
<P>
   We get to play with the language and even contribute to it. Herb
Caen gave the world ``beatnik,'' Alice Kahn coined ``yuppie.''
Molly Ivins gets to call Texas politicians ``runts with attitude''
and Mike Royko snipped that Rupert Murdoch was an ``alien.''
</P>
<P>
   But we cannot make up subjects and give them our words to drive
home a point, any more than a cop reporter can put accusations in
the mouth of the chief of police to call the mayor a crook.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes columnists give subjects anonymity, as in ``A man
we'll call Harold...'' because that way Harold, who is really
Ronnie, gets to tell his story without repercussions from his boss
or ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   We protect people but we don't invent them. Her name is false
but the homeless woman is as real as the sons she has in college
and the blue eyeliner she puts on every morning.
</P>
<P>
   When someone who has won prizes and been heralded as a bright
light in journalism gets hauled in for Oliver Stoning the truth, we
all wince.
</P>
<P>
   All that McNamara told us in San Diego about her former
colleague was that ``she is an extraordinary writer.'' Then she
noted, ``Great writing and great journalism aren't the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the Smith case and a similar discovery that New
Republic magazine reporter Steven Glass' sizzling scoops were full
of hot air ``brings home the need for all of us to be
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Credibility is all we have.'' It is, she said, ``the
currency we exchange with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something else going for the truth. It really is better
than anything you could make up. Even if you don't believe in the
ethics of truth-telling, any newsie knows that true stories are
wiser, goofier and more outrageous than fiction. Real human beings
are more colorful and naturally quotable than the creations of a
mere journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Our gift is that we know what to ask, when to listen and how to
recognize a gem of truth when it comes tumbling out. In a
reporter's notebook there is often a big asterisk next to certain
scribbled words. When the writer caught that quote she said a
silent ``thank you.'' Then she rushed it to print to preserve it,
so that someone else would read it and gulp or cry or smile or even
pick up the phone and say kill the messenger because it was so
amazingly true.

<P>
   President Clinton lost one and won one at the U.S. Supreme Court
on Thursday. The Line Item Veto Act was struck down. And the court
upheld the principle that death does not unravel the
confidentiality of communication between attorney and client. The
American people won in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court
divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case (Clinton vs. City of New
York). Stevens focuses solely on the Presentment Clause _ Article
I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution: ``Every bill which shall
have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall,
before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the
United States; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall
return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have
originated ....'' Returning a bill is a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can only override a presidential veto by a two-thirds
majority vote in each house.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend
laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws. He
writes: ``There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes
the president to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is deferential to Congress and the president in the
opinion: ``... we express no opinion about the wisdom of the
procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The text of the act was itself the product of much debate and
deliberation in both Houses of Congress and that precise text was
signed into law by the President. We do not lightly conclude that
their action was unauthorized by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue
raised by the lower federal court when it found the act
unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of
powers between the legislative and executive branch. Stevens
writes: ``... our decision rests on the narrow ground that the
procedure authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are not authorized
by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent in which he was
joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and in part by Justice
Stephen Breyer. In short, Scalia doesn't think that the Line Item
Veto Act violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia is a master sophist; he plays word games. Under the act,
after both houses of Congress have passed a bill, the president can
sign it and then cancel portions. To Scalia the chronology of
events is pivotal, not the central meaning of the clause. He writes
in his dissent: ``It was only after the requirements of the
Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the president exercised
his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel the spending
item.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Scalia is in the minority on this issue. Under any
reading of the Constitution, the act is unconstitutional. A
president's authority to amend or repeal a law is neither
enumerated nor implied by the Constitution. Quite simply, such
presidential powers do not exist _ unless Congress chooses to amend
the Constitution to give presidents that power, and three-fourths
of the state legislatures agree.
</P>
<P>
   The current problem, however, is that the 82 spending items that
Clinton cancelled using the unconstitutional law are no longer
cancelled. New York City can now expect $2.5 billion in federal
funds for its Medicaid program. And what was once a balanced budget
with a surplus is no longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the attorney-client confidentiality case, Clinton won. Back
in July 1993, White House aide Vincent Foster Jr. met with his
attorney James Hamilton for two hours regarding the controversy
concerning the White House travel office and firing employees
there. Hamilton took handwritten notes during the meeting. Nine
days later Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr wanted those notes to further
his investigation into allegations that White House aides or first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had lied under oath. Starr claimed that
when Hamilton's client died, the confidentiality of the
attorney-client privilege died with it. Fortunately for everyone,
Starr lost.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the 6-to-3
majority (Swidler &AMP; Berlin and Hamilton vs. United States):
``Knowing that communication will remain confidential even after
death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with
counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent
withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if
disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal
context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had argued that the attorney-client privilege should not
prevent disclosure of confidential communications if the client has
died and the information is relevant to a criminal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to Rehnquist. Only two lower court decisions
support Starr's argument. Most assume the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice concludes, ``... the independent counsel has
simply not made a sufficient showing to overturn the common law
rule embodied in the prevailing caselaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was looking only at his target and not the implications
for society. This privilege is too significant to be eroded by the
independent counsel's suspicions of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the high court's decision gone the other way, think of the
ambitious prosecuting attorneys who might feel free to rifle
through communications between dead defendants and their attorneys
fishing for accomplices and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what the erosion of this privilege might do to the
weaker privilege of confidentiality between doctor and patient, or
to the necessary confidentiality between priest and confessional.
Then consider the likely impact on our society.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beatrice Snyder, a co-founder and former executive of
Biocraft Laboratories, a maker of generic pharmaceuticals, died
June 21 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Cliffside
Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from emphysema, said Harold
Snyder, her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Snyders started Biocraft Laboratories, which specialized in
generic antibiotics, in Fair Lawn, N.J., in 1964. Ms. Snyder, who
headed the financial operations of the company and was responsible
for developing the inventory system, held the titles of senior vice
president and secretary. Snyder was chairman and chief executive.
Eventually, all three of the couple's children worked in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Biocraft, which Ms. Snyder said became the first generic
pharmaceutical company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
in 1985, had annual sales of $150 million when it was bought by
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1996. Ms. Snyder was elected to
the Teva board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snyder graduated from Hunter College in 1945 with a
bachelor's degree in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Beryl
Snyder Trost, and two sons, Brian and Jay, all of New York, and
five grandchildren.

DR. CHARLES RYCROFT, 83, POST-FREUDIAN REINTERPRETER OF DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Rycroft, a British psychoanalyst who offered a
generation of therapists new ways to interpret not just dreams but
Freud's entire legacy, died May 24 in London, where he lived. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades or more, Rycroft was the leading intellectual
force in British psychoanalytic circles, said Dr. Paul Roazen, a
retired professor of social and political science at York
University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Rycroft's colleague and most famous patient was the
psychoanalyst R.D. Laing, and Rycroft was every bit as
independent-minded. Like Laing, Rycroft both acknowledged and
departed from Freud.
</P>
<P>
   Rycroft saw the subconscious not as a force that brings out the
worst in people, but as a potential source of energy and
creativity. The imagination, he often said, was a vital link
between the subconscious mind and the perception of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rycroft wrote in The New York Review of Books that
``average, alienated, well-adjusted, but unimaginative'' Westerners
needed the therapist's help to listen to their dreams, get in touch
with their true selves and come to understand the messages sent by
the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Rycroft's editor at the New York Review, Robert Silvers, said
that in his books and 160 or so articles, all of them lucid and
free of jargon, Rycroft ``had a calm way of explaining rather
charged psychoanalytic controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote on dreams, on Jung, on the bearing of psychoanalysis
on literature, and always there was something solid and
distinguished,'' Silvers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Rycroft became a leader in the British
Psychoanalytic Society, then detached himself from the mainstream
of psychoanalysis, saying he was bored by the factional feuding
over who were the true followers of Freud. He turned to writing
books interpreting psychoanalysis for the general reader.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Innocence of Dreams'' (Pantheon, 1979), Rycroft parted
company with Freud, contending that dreams were extensions of the
normal imagination, rather than merely expressions of unconscious
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming, he said, ``is a universally occurring neurotic
symptom,'' neurotic in the sense that artists and writers are
neurotic. The dream, he argued, is ``the sleeping form of creative
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   His methods of interpreting dreams _ which held that dreams
should be viewed in light of the individual's life experiences
rather than through the filter of Freudian concepts _ are still
widely used by therapists, Dr. Roazen said.
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``Psychoanalysis Observed,`` (Coward,
1967), ``Anxiety and Neurosis'' (Penguin, 1968), ``Imagination and
Reality'' (Hogarth, 1968), ``A Critical Dictionary of
Psychoanalysis'' (Basic Books, 1969), ``Reich'' (Viking, 1971),
``Sources of Hope'' (1979) and ``Psychoanalysis and Beyond''
(1985).
</P>
<P>
   Charles Frederick Rycroft was born in Basingstoke, England, and
received his bachelor's degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, in
1936. He was born into the aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, alarmed by the rise of Nazism in Germany, he
briefly joined the Communist Party and visited the Soviet Union.
Later he said that being a Communist in those years was simply a
fashionable thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   His rebellious spirit moved him to seek training in
psychoanalysis at a time when that academic field was often viewed
with suspicion. He obtained degrees in medicine and psychoanalysis
at University College Hospital in 1945 and began his private
practice in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage to Chloe Majolier ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jenny Pearson of London, and three
children from his first marriage: a son, Francis, and two
daughters, Julia and Catherine.

FRANK SCOTT, 80, BASEBALL'S FIRST PLAYER AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Scott, a former Yankee official who became baseball's
first player agent and helped such stars as Mickey Mantle, Roger
Maris and Yogi Berra earn more money off the field than on it, died
Sunday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Stacey Fishman of New York, said he had suffer
stroke last year and died of a blood clot on his brain caused by a
fall in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Today's agents negotiate player contracts, but Scott, a short,
feisty, impeccably dressed man, seldom did, devoting full time
instead to endorsements and appearances. He put Berra in Yoo-Hoo
commercials and countless players in the audience of ``The Ed
Sullivan Show,'' where they were often acknowledged from the stage
by the show's host.
</P>
<P>
   As Scott told Gay Talese for a 1961 article in The New York
Times Magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never guarantee them a dime. I tell them only that I will
represent their interest in negotiating off-field deals and that
they must sell themselves on the playing field if we're going to
make any money off of it. I tell them, `If you don't win, you get
nothing, and I get 10 percent of nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's career as an agent started almost by accident. He and
his wife, the former Bette Sheppard, were visiting Berra and his
wife, Carmen, when Carmen noticed that Scott was not wearing a
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She excused herself,'' Scott recalled, ``and reappeared with a
whole tray of wristwatches, at least 20, and told me to take my
pick. That's how those scoundrels had been paying off Yogi for
personal appearances. He didn't know any better. We didn't know any
better. It's different now.''
</P>
<P>
   It became different when Scott started working for the players.
His first clients were Berra, Mantle and Maris. Later baseball
clients included Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Henry Aaron, Whitey
Ford, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, Larry Doby, Walter Alston, Ralph
Branca, Bob Feller and Roy Campanella. He also represented Vince
Lombardi, Frank Gifford and Y.A. Tittle from football and Oscar
Robertson and Bob Cousy from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was born Oct. 17, 1917, in Pittsburgh and grew up there.
At the University of Pittsburgh, he was a student manager for the
1937 football team, which won the Rose Bowl. When Pittsburgh's
coach, Jock Sutherland, became coach of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the
National Football League, the Dodgers' owner, Dan Topping, at
Sutherland's urging, hired Scott as traveling secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Scott held the job from 1940 to 1942, then served in the Navy.
After World War II, when Topping owned the Yankees, Scott became
their traveling secretary from 1947 to 1950. In 1948, Scott and his
wife-to-be eloped in DiMaggio's car.
</P>
<P>
   When George Weiss, the Yankee general manager, thought Scott had
become too close to the players, Weiss forced him out of his job.
Scott started representing players, and as Shirley Povich wrote in
1957 in The Saturday Evening Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott knew an agent's place. He was too smart to meddle in the
players' salary debates with the ball club. He knew, too, that
there had to be rigid respect for the rule that the players' first
obligation was to the ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Scott was an executive with the Major League
Baseball Players Association. From 1967 to 1987, he was associated
with the American Airlines Golf Classic, and in 1976 he created and
started serving as executive director of the annual All Sports Hall
of Fame dinner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There had been sports agents before Scott, notably C.C. ``Cash
and Carry'' Pyle, who masterminded Red Grange's professional
football debut in the 1920s. But no one had concentrated on
athletes' off-the-field earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-Michael Jordan era when even superstars earned only
five-figure salaries, Scott made extra money for his clients. In
1956, when Mantle's salary was $30,000, Scott got him $70,000 in
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   That year, in the month after Don Larsen pitched a perfect game
in the World Series, the pitcher (salary: $12,000) earned $22,000
from television and other appearances arranged by Scott. In 1961,
when Maris broke Babe Ruth's record by hitting 61 home runs in a
season, Scott produced $200,000 in endorsements for Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur Murray television show once wanted Mantle to do a
mambo for $1,000. Scott rejected the dance as undignified. Mantle
did a more sedate dance for the same amount, $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Mantle was embarrassed by a photo of him blowing bubble
gum in center field. He felt it made him look irresponsible. Scott
got the gum manufacturer to pay Mantle $1,500 to endorse the gum.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, who lives in West Orange, N.J., and
daughter, Scott is survived by a son, John, of Chatham, N.J.; two
sisters, Sylvia Peris of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Phyllis Shapiro
of Pittsburgh, and four grandsons.  &QL;

JOHN MALCOLM BRINNIN, POET AND BIOGRAPHER, DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Malcolm Brinnin, a poet and literary biographer who
witnessed and chronicled the alcoholic deterioration and death of
Dylan Thomas, died on Friday at his home in Key West, Fla. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
   He came to know many famous poets during the 1950s, when he was
director of the Poetry Society of the Young Men's and Young Women's
Hebrew Association, and invited them to come and read. For one,
Dylan Thomas, he set up a series of readings across the country, a
tour that turned into a four-year nightmare that ended with the
Welsh poet's death in Manhattan and Brinnin's resignation from the
YMHA/YWHA Poetry Society and withdrawal from talks and readings.
</P>
<P>
   As a close friend, unpaid lecture agent and ignored financial
adviser for Thomas, Brinnin watched helplessly he drank, brawled,
publicly insulted his audiences and disintegrated mentally and
physically. His detailed account, ``Dylan Thomas in America,''
published in 1955, two years after the poet's death, was made into
a Broadway play, ``Dylan,'' in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Brinnin moved away from writing poetry, publishing
his last book of verse, ``Skin Diving in the Virgins and Other
Poems,'' in 1970. He had turned to travel and memoir writing
because ``he had become interested in life,'' wrote Richard Wilbur,
a friend, Key West neighbor and fellow poet, in this week's issue
of Solares Hill, a newspaper in the Florida Keys
</P>
<P>
   Brinnin wrote a well-received biography, ``The Third Rose:
Gertrude Stein and Her World'' (1959) and nonfiction books and
magazine articles about the history and decline of luxury liners,
``The Sway of the Grand Saloon: A Social History of the North
Atlantic'' (1971) and ``Beau Voyage: Life Aboard the Last Great
Ships'' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   Brinnin loved to travel, crossing the Atlantic more than 60
times, preferably on a luxury liner and carrying Louis Vuitton
luggage, Wilbur wrote. But he made a point of exposing his own
foibles: his classy suits came from Filene's, he told Wilbur; the
most embarrassing anecdotes in his memoirs of encounters with
famous writers were about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something embarrassing happens, some stupid thing, it
happens to John Malcolm,'' said David Ethridge, the editor of
Solares Hill. ``He's the one who gets soup spilled on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In subtropical Florida, residents called Brinnin the dean of Key
West's literati. When the board members of a writers' festival on
the island argued about whom to invite, Brinnin advocated artists
who published sophisticated verse in obscure literary journals
instead of authors of paperbacks sold in airport bookstores. ``He
would hold out for good art even if no one had ever heard of
them,'' Ethridge said. ``He wasn't on the side of the market,''
although he did manage to sign up the popular Mexican man of
letters, Octavio Paz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sextet: T.S. Eliot &AMP; Truman Capote &AMP; Others,'' Brinnin's
memoir published in 1981, recounts, for example, how Eliot walked
around for hours, newsstand to newsstand, to peek at himself on the
cover of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nova Scotia, Brinnin moved to Detroit when he was young
and graduated from the University of Michigan. A year later, while
he was a graduate student at Harvard University, he published his
first book of poems, ``The Garden Is Political'' (1942), which
received enthusiastic reviews. For the next 30 years, while
teaching at the University of Connecticut, Vassar College and the
University of Boston, he published five more poetry collections.
</P>
<P>
   As a poet with a ``very formalist streak,'' as he described
himself, Brinnin was awarded the Poetry Society of America's
highest medal.
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, where he retired, he could be found playing poker
under a beach umbrella with Wilbur and John Hersey, or presiding
over the weekly anagram game, deciding who would be invited and
where it would be held. He continued to wear stylish clothes even
in a place as casual as Key West.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Bill Read, of Key West.
</P>
<P>
   During his last decade or so in Key West, Brinnin was working on
his further memoirs, probably focusing on writers and artists that
he had known rather than on himself. As he once told an
interviewer, ``I think I'm as well known as I deserve to be.''

 &HT;    Dryness a good thing for Everglades, scientists say
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While the rest of us swelter, watch our
gardens wilt and ask when the rain will return, scientists are
calling the dry spell a blessing for the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was just a few months ago that El Nino-driven rain
was drowning marsh-dwelling trees and making life miserable for
wading birds. The dry skies offer a chance to breathe _ and breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know with the lower water, the healing will begin,'' said
Herb Zebuth, a coordinator for the state Department of
Environmental Protection's West Palm Beach office. ``And for that,
we're grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Anderson, a wildlife biologist for the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission, added: ``We needed something like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the Everglades still is not exactly bone-dry. Lake
Okeechobee, the heart of South Florida's water system, is a foot
higher than average for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   But they're both drier than they were this winter, when the
lake's overflow was fouling the St. Lucie and Indian rivers while
water managers fretted that protective dikes might burst.
</P>
<P>
   The drying helps in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Receding water creates smaller and smaller pools for the
Everglades' fish, frogs and other tiny creatures _ producing a
concentrated smorgasbord for wading birds.
</P>
<P>
   The handy food supply lets many birds continue nesting past the
beginning of June, when the rainy season normally makes them
abandon their nests. The birds must make up for lost time this year
because the winter rains kept many from nesting earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The dry period may have saved a colony of wood storks in
Everglades National Park, said John Ogden, a biologist for the
South Florida Water Management District. He said they didn't even
start forming nests until late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no chance at all of survival, except that it hasn't
rained,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, willows that grow on teardrop-shaped islands in the
Everglades have wilted from too much water in recent years. Now
they might have a chance to revive, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lake Okeechobee, water is dropping enough to help the lake's
fringe marshes, which filter pollution and offer crucial habitat to
birds and fish, Zebuth said. He said years of high lake levels have
drowned those marshes, spread pollution and helped noxious hydrilla
weeds to migrate.
</P>
<P>
   The lake was at 14.69 feet above sea level Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dry spell is proving far less benign elsewhere in the state,
where it's contributing to a spree of wildfires. Even in the
Everglades, a severe drought could lead to catastrophic fires that
would hurt plants and animals by burning away the muck soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the drought was extended to next year or March, then we
could possibly have a problem with muck fires,'' Anderson said. For
now, ``we're not too concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists around the state don't know yet whether the fires
have caused lasting environmental harm, said Nick Wiley, the game
commission's wildlife management bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is part of nature's cycle, and native plants and animals
are adapted to it. Animals seek water or burrow in the ground.
Native slash pines and longleaf pines have bark that can withstand
the heat, and they grow their limbs above most fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fire-tolerant habitats, fire is beneficial,'' Wiley said.
``In a few weeks you see fresh, green growth. Everything renews.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of Florida is far from natural.
</P>
<P>
   Some places have gone too long without fire, which means
underbrush and other kindling have built up. So when a fire finally
strikes _ boom! Then it can be hot enough to penetrate the bark and
kill the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the worst fires are in areas that haven't been burned
recently,'' Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the danger, he said, the state tries to conduct
controlled burns on all of its lands an average of every two to
three years. But not all landowners follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, fire also helps the spread of some noxious pest
plants, such as the melaleuca tree. Another exotic pest, the Old
World climbing fern, makes fires more damaging by helping them
spread to treetops.

 &HT;    Dream cruise became a Caribbean nightmare
 &HT;    (In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    By D.L. Stewart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio _ If they had to die, Penny and Jim Fletcher
resolved, it would not be at the end of a hangman's rope.
</P>
<P>
   They would go by their own hands, using the prison-issued Valium
they had been hiding ``anywhere we could.'' Pills hoarded as a
death-insurance policy in the event a judge on the Caribbean island
sentenced them to be executed for the murder of a water-taxi
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to kill ourselves that day had we been
convicted,'' Penny Fletcher says. ``We talked about it. I would die
at my own hand before I would let these people put me in a noose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington, W.Va., couple knew that the sentences would be
appealed. But the appeal process, their lawyers told them, could
take as long as four years on St. Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either one of us would have lived that long,''
Penny Fletcher says now.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, they spent 283 days in Her Majesty's aged prisons.
Nine months of sharing cells with killers and drug dealers, rats
and roaches and scorpions. Nine months of living on bread and water
and rice. Nine months of not knowing if they would ever again see
their homes, their families or even the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months of what Jim Fletcher would call ``our season in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare over and over
</P>
<P>
   The island's prime minister branded them ``classic ugly
Americans.'' Their home-state newspaper described them as ``rich,
loud and boorish.'' Most of the stories written about them included
accounts of boozing and brawling, with innuendos of drugs and
promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher listens to these indictments without visible
reaction. She has heard them before and her response is
unhesitating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' she says. ``We knew exactly what we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanned and slender now, 36-year-old Penny Fletcher bears faint
resemblance to the pale, puffy woman who spent nine months in a
Caribbean prison. The physical reminders of her season in hell are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Midwestern sunshine and a healthful diet have not driven
away the nightmare that comes every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sleep,'' she says, pausing to light one of the dozen
cigarettes she smokes during a two-hour interview. ``I can't sleep.
I can't even put my head down because I know it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She declines to describe it, but the nightmare is ``the same
one, over and over.'' The same one that followed her from a dank
prison cell in St. Vincent to her comfortable home in Huntington.
And now it is her nightly visitor in Xenia.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher is there for an extended visit with her sister,
hoping that time in the peaceful Ohio setting will help exorcise
the tropical demons that already have taken away a year of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Setting sail with hope
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Penny Fletcher's real
life ends and the movie of the week begins.
</P>
<P>
   She is the second of three children born to an Olive Hill, Ky.,
retired naval officer and his wife. She married for the first time
at 21, a marriage that took her to Huntington, produced a daughter
and a son, and ended after five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Huntington she was politically active, eventually becoming
president of West Virginians for Life. It's also where she met
James Fletcher, the scion of a wealthy family. He was a Republican
who had twice run unsuccessfully for the state's House of Delegates
and a father of three with two past marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fletcher attended Choate Hall, a New England prep school,
and DePauw University in Indiana. The family money comes from J.H.
Fletcher and Co., which manufactures customized equipment used in
coal, salt, diamond and copper mines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Penny were married in Bermuda in 1994. Two years later,
their marriage already beginning to fray, they decided to see if
they could patch it by going on an extended cruise. At the age of
48, Jim took early retirement. In May 1996, aboard the $250,000
sailboat he had purchased from his father, they set off with plans
to circumnavigate the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Wild times in Bequia
</P>
<P>
   By August they had reached St. Vincent, an independent monarchy
within the British Commonwealth of Nations. They were 1,600 miles
south of Miami and 210 miles northeast of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Its official name is St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It is a
string of 600 small islands, islets and reefs ranging from the
island of St. Vincent in the north to Grenada in the south.
Kingstown, the capital city, is on the island of St. Vincent. The
land is agricultural and its primary export is bananas. Its second
most important crop is marijuana. It also has a reputation as a
major gateway for cocaine trafficking from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism also is an important part of the economy on small
islands such as Bequia (BECK-we), nine miles south of the island of
St. Vincent, where a permanent population of 5,000 reaps rewards
from a harbor filled with the boats of well-heeled tourists. Jim
and Penny Fletcher's boat was among 100 or so floating in the clear
waters off Bequia. Their 50-foot craft was named, with future
irony, Carefree.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, life was carefree for the Fletchers. They spent
their days on the boat and their evenings on the islands, dining at
restaurants called The Plantation House or the Gingerbread House,
drinking at Buddy's Bar. They partied often and they partied hard.
Penny, especially, built a reputation for drinking a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing is different from anything else you do,'' she says.
``When you port-in, you're going to drink. That's what you do. It's
part of the life.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories start
</P>
<P>
   But confrontations also became part of her life and stories of
her barroom hassles spread quickly. Penny doesn't deny the stories.
Just the details.
</P>
<P>
   The one about throwing beer bottles at another customer, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a glass,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And the one about biting a man in Buddy's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was way off, that situation was,'' she says. ``I didn't
bite him. I hit him. Sure, I hit him. Three men were attacking me
and I was fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also widely circulated was a story about how she had been thrown
out of a restaurant owned by the former wife of James ``Son''
Michell, the prime minister of St. Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thrown out,'' Penny says. ``I just had words with her
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher doesn't dispute, or apologize for, the stories.
She just asks for some balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good things we did were never pointed out,'' she insists.
``We were not always bad and drinking all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the times they tried to be good turned out bad.
</P>
<P>
   When they learned that the St. Vincent government was low on
funds, they established a $25,000 trust to buy children's school
supplies. They also announced they would give 10 percent of the
income from chartered trips on their yacht to the school system.
That announcement, a defense attorney would later note, may have
served mostly to embarrass the prime minister in a country already
sensitive to hints of American meddling.
</P>
<P>
   What Penny calls an attempt to feed hungry kids from the island
of St. Lucia led to three broken ribs and a story in the Bequia
Herald that accused them of trying to kidnap the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough children between us,'' Penny scoffs. ``We have
five already. Why would we want more?
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that we were in a restaurant and there were
these three children, all under the age of 10, going around and
begging for food. We ordered them all dinner. Then they asked if
they could spend the night on our boat. Their mother said it was
all right, even though she didn't know us from Adam. We agreed to
meet her back on the dock the next morning at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning she didn't show up, so we kept them on the
boat and fed them breakfast. At lunchtime we took them to a
restaurant and fed them, then took them back to the boat for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a man that we don't know comes along in a banana boat and
says, 'I want the children.' I said, 'I don't know you. I'm not
going to hand over the children to you.' So he starts to come
aboard the boat, which is the equivalent of breaking and entering.
I grabbed a big stick of sugar cane and swung it and connected with
his neck. He got back down in his boat and took a seven-foot wooden
oar and broke three of my ribs with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then Jim runs down from the bow and the man swung at him
and hit him in the knee. I went and got my gun, which had no clip
in it, and threatened him to get him off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turned out, it was a boyfriend of the mother's.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the details, the stories surrounding the Fletchers
helped set them up for what would happen in their season of hell.
</P>
<P>
   `We set ourselves up'
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 6 was a Sunday. The day, Penny remembers, was uneventful.
The evening was quiet and calm.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:15 p.m., the Fletchers used channel 68 on their VHF radio
to call water-taxi driver Jerome ``Jolly'' Joseph, whose services
they previously had used several times. They told him they needed a
ride from their boat to the island, where they planned to have
dinner at the Plantation House.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Joseph was widely regarded as the most popular
water-taxi driver on the island. One news story described him as
``a friendly chap eking out a living shuttling tourists to and from
yachts he could never afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher would write that story differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he ran drugs,'' she says. ``We know he had a large
bank account. Our investigators found those things out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph and the Fletchers reached the island in Joseph's
taxi, The Jolly Joseph, the restaurant was closed. He took them
back to the Carefree and collected his $6.20 (U.S.) fare. Before he
dropped them off, Penny says, he received another call on his
hand-held radio to pick up a fare at the dock.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph was not seen again until three days later, when his
body was found floating off Bequia in an area known as Moon Hole.
He had been killed by a .22-caliber bullet to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Penny Fletcher were the last persons known to have seen
him. Penny had registered a .22-caliber handgun and 200 rounds of
ammunition when they arrived in Bequia. And they had that
reputation. That hard-drinking, quick-tempered reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were an easy target, we really were,'' Penny Fletcher
acknowledges. ``We set ourselves up perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when they were arrested Oct. 30 and charged in the murder
of Jolly Joseph, Penny says she was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just about fainted. Everything just went black. I don't
think I ever felt so numb.''

 &HT;    Dream cruise became a Caribbean nightmare
 &HT;    (In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    By D.L. Stewart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio: ... felt so numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail brings rats, fear
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fletcher was taken to Her Majesty's Prison in Kingstown,
which had a population of 400 inmates in a facility designed for
150. From his cell, which he shared with as many as 19 other
prisoners, he could not see the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Penny went to Fort Charlotte, built on a hill above the city in
1806 by the British to defend the island against French invaders.
Today the upper levels of the fort are open to tourists. But they
are not allowed to go down the stone steps to the level that
includes the three cells that constitute her Majesty's Prison for
Women.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher's cell contained three bunk beds and one single
bed _ wooden pallets without mattresses, pillows or blankets. In
the corner was a 5-gallon bucket for the prisoners to use as a
communal toilet. It was emptied once a day.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after their release, in an interview on ABC's
``Nightline,'' she described the living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had roach bites on my legs and then the rats would come up
out of the floorboards. And we stuffed paper down the spaces
between the boards and the rats, you could actually see their
heads, you know, come up while we were awake, you know, before we'd
go to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jim and Penny Fletcher, the only good news was the belief
that their confinement would be over by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our attorneys was approached (for a bribe),'' Penny
says. ``We gave him permission to go up to $100,000. Would we have
paid that much? To get out of prison? Sure. In a heartbeat.
Whatever we paid would have been cheaper than the six-attorney
'dream team' we had.''
</P>
<P>
   She declines to reveal what the final legal bill was, but says
it was more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal could be concluded, though, a South African man
named Alan Heath was arrested in St. Vincent and charged with the
machete slaying of his wife aboard their yacht. He was released, he
publicly claimed, because he paid a $25,000 bribe to St. Vincent
officials. That claim, the Fletchers are sure, kept them
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my belief all along that the only reason Jim and
Penny were arrested was for a bribe,'' Jim's sister, Sally Duncan,
told the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette . ``But because of the Heath
case, that wasn't an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mitchell called the stories of bribery
solicitations ``rubbish'' and challenged the Fletchers' attorneys
to name names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say who it was. But, oh yeah, we know,'' Penny
Fletcher insists. The reason they won't go public with the names,
she explains, is because there may be a need for similar deals in
the future and the attorneys ``don't want to lose their
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   A sensational inquiry
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish or not, the publicity surrounding Heath's claim
apparently made any bribe from the Fletchers too hot to handle and
they remained in Her Majesty's prisons. Four months after their
arrest, the preliminary inquiry was held.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven days of lurid testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution called Benedict Redhead, a Grenadian-born
deckhand who claimed he witnessed Penny Fletcher kissing Jolly
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The defense denied the story and countered that Redhead was a
disgruntled former employee who had been fired by the Fletchers for
attempting to rape Penny. After he was fired, they said, crack
cocaine was found in his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution noted that the Fletchers had brought a
.22-caliber handgun and 200 rounds of ammunition to the islands.
</P>
<P>
   The defense claimed that the ammunition did not match the slug
found in Joseph's chest and that the gun had been stolen by
Benedict Redhead a month before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution countered that witnesses heard Penny
``bragging'' about firing the gun at the small dinghy on their
yacht on her 35th birthday in October, just four days before the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The defense dismissed it as an untruthful boast.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never said I shot the dinghy,'' she insists now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penny likes to say things, sensationalize things,'' Sally
Duncan said in an interview with the Charleston Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hearing, a magistrate declared that there was
sufficient cause to proceed to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Ralph Gonsalves called it ``a travesty of
justice.'' According to ``Nightline,'' Sandra Ingram, a
representative of the U.S. Embassy who monitored the hearing, wrote
a scathing confidential memorandum to the U.S. ambassador. She
wrote, ``There was not one scintilla of physical evidence'' and
said the case looked to her like a ``witch hunt.'' A fair trial,
she wrote, ``was unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   A troublesome inmate
</P>
<P>
   While they waited for the wheels of Vincentian justice to grind,
Jim and Penny handled their confinement in ways that were as
different as their backgrounds. Jim worked crossword puzzles,
taught other inmates to read and lost weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any room to exercise, and exercising certainly
wasn't encouraged,'' he said a week after his release in an
interview with Cox News Service. ``I did pushups against the wall,
although people looked at me like I was crazy.'' A diet of rice,
bread and hot sugar-water known locally as ``tea'' left just 125
pounds on his 6-foot-1 frame.
</P>
<P>
   Penny, meanwhile, read ``whatever I could get my hands on. ... I
read 197 books in 283 days.'' She also received supportive letters
from strangers who were following the story in the media. She says
she is grateful for them, as well as for the phone calls to
lawmakers that were made on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Penny admits she was not a model prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   She says she fought off a matron who tried to confiscate her
engagement ring and wedding band. She protested when inmates were
taken to an exercise area next to the gallows. A Roman Catholic,
she refused to attend the prison's daily Anglican or Seventh-day
Adventist services, even though it would have meant getting out of
her cell for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'I'm not listening to this (the services).' So they
locked me down during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   After four months, she also refused to work for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our jobs every Tuesday was to clean the rice,'' she
says. ``They'd bring it in in a bag and dump it out and you had to
go through it and pick out the stones and the black pieces. After
four months I finally said, 'I'm not doing this anymore.' They
said, `If you're gonna eat it, you're gonna clean it.' So for the
last five months I lived on bread and tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Fletcher concedes she could have made things easier on
herself by being more cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the consequences and I did it anyway,'' she agrees. ``I
had the attitude in there that I've already been `bent' by being
there. I refused to have their way of thinking imposed on me. Their
rules. Their laws. What are you going to do, arrest me? What else
can you do to me? I can't go any lower.''
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Horror at the hospital
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spartan diet, Penny did not get thinner. Instead,
she grew bloated and puffy as the result of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could press m finger against my flesh and the indentation
would be there two days later,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In June she was taken to a hospital that, she says, had roaches
on the floor and dried blood on the examination table. A doctor
operated on her for a precancerous cervical condition. She says the
surgery was performed without an anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed a whole lot,'' she admits. ``Fifteen minutes after
the surgery they transported me back to the prison and I fainted,
so they took me back to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny says she still doesn't understand why no anesthetic was
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even pretend to know what these people think,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fletchers coped with life in prison, attorneys,
politicians and the news media turned the case into an
international squall.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Son'' Mitchell referred to the Fletchers as ``classic
ugly Americans,'' West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller called on the
State Department to take measures to assure a fair trial for the
couple. At an international conference, President Clinton pulled
Mitchell aside and also sought assurances that the trial would be
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that media coverage had an impact. But they
differ as to what the impact was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it not been for the efforts of the American media and of
our families to ensure that we were given a fair trial, I am quite
certain that the outcome would have been death,'' Jim Fletcher said
on ``Nightline'' after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mitchell saw it differently. In a radio broadcast
the week the trial ended, he charged that his country had been the
butt of ``racist U.S. media attacks'' and said, ``We have all
suffered from the vicious sledgehammer of the United States
media.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial begins
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the trial of James and Penelia Fletcher
for the murder of Jerome ``Jolly'' Joseph finally opened in
Kingstown on July 28, 1997. When the trial began, they had been in
prison just two days short of nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Although most observers agreed the state's case was weak, Penny
Fletcher feared ``with every fiber'' that they would be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The island is 98 percent black and we are white. The
illiteracy rate is at least 70 percent. That's not what we would
term `a jury of our peers.' Our cultures are so very different. You
can't be in a situation like that and not be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the judge nor the jury saw merit in the
prosecution's case. On Aug. 8, a dozen days after the trial began,
Judge Dunbar Cenac recommended to the jury that it dismiss the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question remains, who shot Jolly Joseph?'' Cenac declared.
``There is no evidence before me, direct or indirect, that the
accused committed this act.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started crying,'' Penny told ``Nightline.'' ``I just
started crying and I had to hold Jim's hand. I was afraid I was
going to break his fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Jim and Penny Fletcher flew away from St. Vincent,
bound for his parents' home in Key Largo, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was not finished.
</P>
<P>
   No happily ever after
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 17, in Cabell (W.Va.) County court, citing
``irreconcilable differences,'' Jim Fletcher filed for divorce.
Penny Fletcher has countersued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when something like that happens, it either makes you
closer or drives a wedge between you,'' Penny told The Associated
Press. ``In this case, it drove a wedge between us.''
</P>
<P>
   But they still are, she says, ``best friends'' and have frequent
phone conversations. They talk about the kids and about the
Carefree. They talk, too, about their season in hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one I can talk to about it,'' she says. ``He's
the only one who can really understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the discussion turns to a proposed movie of the
week based on their experience. And about the book, which is in
progress but does not yet have a name.
</P>
<P>
   The working title is ``Nightmare in Paradise.''

passing laws against stuff that isn't crooked. Congress is off on

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fire season puts summer under a cloud
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ The weather report calls for scattered
ashes this afternoon through, oh, September. And the sun will be
the color of blood rising through a haze of black followed by
partial late-morning clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of natural-disaster stories, the fires sweeping
northern and central Florida are better understood as a weather
story gone bad. However huge and devastating, forest fires are part
of the rhythm of the Florida seasons. Always will be. And as we
have grown better at forgetting this, the fires mysteriously have
gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   However expected fires may be in a time of unrelenting heat
without rain, their scale and effects have been dramatic this past
week.
</P>
<P>
   And not just for those who have lost homes or fear for their
property. The smoke and smell have drifted far from outskirting
highways and forest-hugging housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, the sky has been about the same color as
in the Mars Sojourner photographs of another sky far from town.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the state smells like a barbecue gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Town dwellers walk out to their cars in the morning and find
them sprinkled with slivers of white ashes the size and shape of
baby fingernail clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Walking on the beach at dusk, I watched the dark outlines of
surf kids catching a few desultory wavelets through a dreamlike
haze. The smoke combined with the evening mist to create a salty
sea-smog. It's visually striking but makes you rub your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   These are small things, but they leave nobody unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The cycles of water and fire that make up the Florida year are
easy enough to ignore in mild times. So easy, that people move here
and live unaware of them. They buy nice houses in the pine woods
and expensive condos on the barrier islands. In storm years, tides
threaten the shore. In dry years, fires threaten the pine-forest
homes. Everyone is surprised by these things. Every year, every
time.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the people living in these places complain to their
appropriate government agencies that the beaches need to be built
up and that something should be done about the smoke from
controlled burns because it's annoying and outrageous and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   People can accept summer hurricanes and autumn windstorms as
pranks of nature in an otherwise sweet climate. Fire, though,
demands culprits _ arsonists, kids fooling around, deep-woods trash
burners. And though fire starters are out there, they are harmful
only because they're working within a larger cycle of things.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle is on the floor of any pine forest. Needles and
underbrush and scrub that build over time. They ignite, go up fast
and make way for the next round of trees. Then it all grows around
again.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida real estate is getting too valuable for the burn
cycle. Little fires are put out before they can do their work. The
idea

 &HT;    Air Force One: A small piece of history
 &HT;    By Tom Hopkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the movie Air Force One , Russian terrorists
run amok on the president's Boeing 747 and take the chief executive
and his family hostage.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Hollywood soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who attempts to run amok on the Air Force One now
displayed at the U.S. Air Force Museum may run headlong into a
plexiglass wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 707 is tiny compared to that 747, and the airplane
seems even more cramped now that technicians have walled off all
the rooms, seats and equipment with clear plastic windows to keep
them safe from visitors' inquisitive hands.
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, a walk down the aisle of the retired Air Force One
is a step back into history that is both glorious and grim.
</P>
<P>
   Emblazoned with the words UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, the blue and
white airplane may be the world's most famous aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The flying command center has been restored to look as it did in
the era of John F. Kennedy_an era that ended in November 1963, when
the plane that had flown the President and his family to Dallas
later took his body back to Washington, D.C., in a casket.
</P>
<P>
   Public tours opened Monday in the museum annex, a hanger
familiar to motorists on Springfield Street in Dayton because of
the gigantic painting of Orville and Wilbur Wright adorning its
front wall.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors must get a pass in the museum lobby and drive their
cars down Springfield Street to the annex to see Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   If you're overweight, you may be denied access: Each person must
squeeze through a narrow framework at the bottom of the stairway
where a sign reads: ``Caution: Interior passageway narrows to 17
inches.''
</P>
<P>
   After a peek into the cockpit and a look at the communications
console, you come to the kitchenette that served the pilots and
crew. The small, cramped and antiseptic-looking room is covered by
plastic and stainless steel and has a refrigerator, electric range
and microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   Leather-covered seats on both sides of the hallway were for
dignitaries, but there was nothing dignified about the comfort
level, museum historian Dean Kallander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extremely uncomfortable seats,'' he said. ``I have
not a clue why, but before they put the plastic up, we had a chance
to sit in them, and it's like sitting on a board.''
</P>
<P>
   We come to a stateroom equipped with a conference table, lounge
chairs and a TV set, followed by a family lounge.
</P>
<P>
   A placard announces our arrival at the staff room where Lyndon
B. Johnson took the oath of office in Dallas. It may be the most
memorable photo ever taken on an airplane: Johnson is holding up
his right hand beside a Jacqueline Kennedy who is still in shock
and still wearing a blood-splattered dress.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the infamous press section, with 16 seats on both
sides of the aisle for reporters. If you think this was a place of
honor, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual had written unkindly of President Nixon, he
would require them to ride on this plane instead of the press
plane, which was a much more fun airplane,'' Kallander said. ``On
the press plane, they could get up and walk around and enjoy
themselves. Here, they weren't allowed to get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another kitchenette is near the rear door. Across the aisle is
the area where Kennedy's casket was placed. The bulkhead was cut
away and four seats were removed to make room for the casket. The
partition has been replaced, and you can clearly see the cut made
in it.
</P>
<P>
   The two tiny restrooms in the rear seem almost forlorn,
considering the size of the 707.
</P>
<P>
   Kallander recalls that when Air Force One took Presidents Nixon,
Ford and Carter and national security adviser Henry Kissinger to
Anwar Sadat's funeral in 1981, ``There were so many people lined up
that Kissinger wondered if he should take a number to use the
restroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One, commissioned in 1962, arrived at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base on May 19 to be added to the museum's collection of
eight presidential aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential plane is crammed into the hanger with several
smaller planes that once carried U.S. chief executives. There's
Dwight D. Eisenhower's Columbine, Franklin D. Roosevelt's Sacred
Cow and Harry S. Truman's Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside the 707 is an Air Force Beech C-45H Expediter, a
taildragger; a twin-engine Aero Commander used by President
Eisenhower; and a North American L-17A, a small single engine
reconnaissance plane with a 33-foot wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One at a glance
</P>
<P>
   _ President Kennedy broke with tradition and didn't give his
aircraft a personal name, so the news media popularized the call
sign Air Force One. The airplane is known officially as SAM 26000
(for Special Air Mission).
</P>
<P>
   _ Air Force One has served every U.S. president since John F.
Kennedy. It was the first jet designed exclusively for presidential
use, acquiring the title Air Force One only whenever the president
was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lyndon Johnson, who liked to keep an eye on his passengers,
ordered the seats reversed to face the rear of the aircraft_toward
the President's compartment. And he installed a chair and desk that
could rise or lower at the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   _ The plane flew Johnson to visit the troops during the Vietnam
War, Richard Nixon to China for a historic meeting in 1972 and
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to Paris for secret negotiations
to end the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the airplane broke 30
speed records, including the fastest nonstop flight between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air Force One was used as a backup plane to the current Air
Force One from 1972 to 1991, when it was removed from the primary
presidential fleet. The decision was made to retire the aging plane
because of its high maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ In January of this year, the plane went to pick up President
Clinton when the current Air Force One, a Boeing 747, got stuck in
the mud in Champaign, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   How to go
</P>
<P>
   WHAT:Tour of Air Force One.

   WHERE: U.S. Air Force Museum annex, Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, Dayton, Ohio.

   SODERBERGH-CLOONEY01 _ LOS ANGELES _ George Clooney employed his
patented head-down, eyes-up acting style in a string of films that
included The Peacemaker, Batman &AMP; Robin and One Fine Day , with
marginal box-office success. For his latest feature, Out of Sight,
director Steven Soderbergh stripped down what he called Clooney's
mercurial approach, forcing him to be still. ``That's hard for an
actor,'' Soderbergh said. ``It's hard to believe that you can stand
there and not do a lot and still have people want to watch you, but
he can. He's compelling.'' (Larsen, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Welcome to Professor Pyro's fireworks appreciation class
 &HT;    By Sarah Franquet
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oooooo! Aaahhhh!
</P>
<P>
   If that's the extent of your fireworks commentary, help has
arrived. Pay attention as Professor Pyro teaches us Fireworks
Appreciation. Then use your newfound knowledge to wow your wife,
show off for your kids, impress your friends. They'll ooooo and
aaahhhh at your brilliant bursts of intellect.
</P>
<P>
   The professor went straight to Marcy Zambelli, of the famous
Zambelli Internationale Fireworks. Here's a closer look at a few of
the bursts you're likely to see at ...add info about your own
fireworks show here....
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysanthemum
</P>
<P>
   This symmetrical burst lives up to its floral namesake. A
Chrysanthemum (as with all shells) can come in almost any size, but
the one that makes the most lasting impression is the 12-inch
shell. It bursts up to 1,200 feet high, has a radius of 996 feet
(that's more than three football fields) and can last nine seconds
before it fades away. The Chrysanthemum has a high ``wow'' factor
because it overwhelms the sky with its size. It comes in many
colors, but usually the two-color combo is employed. The one
pictured here is called a Brocade Chrysanthemum because of its rich
texture and the tips you see at the ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Silver-Crested Wave
</P>
<P>
   One of the most distinctive displays, the Wave's streaking
silver bullets explode upward and then drift gently down, creating
a glittery mid-air waterfall. The ``fancy star'' shells are usually
3 to 6 inches around and shoot up to 600 feet high before bursting.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanium Salutes
</P>
<P>
   A salute is the loud boom you hear, usually during a finale.
This Titanium Salute has ``royal flourishes,'' a frenzy of sparkles
that explode like popcorn, and ``rising tails,'' the trails of
light you see along its flight path. Most salutes come from 3-inch
shells and travel up to 300 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Peonies
</P>
<P>
   These brilliant bursts billow from a center core. When several
of these shells are tied together, they go off in succession to
create a `flight of Peonies,' as shown here. They come in a variety
of colors, and usually create large bursts, up to 800 feet high
with a radius of more than 600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Palm Tree
</P>
<P>
   When this one breaks, you know how it got its name. A stunning
display of golden strokes arch from a center point to resemble palm
leaves. It is sometimes accented by vivid green tails. This shell
comes in a variety of sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Glossary:
</P>
<P>
   Salutes: The ear-splitting booms you hear, most often at the end
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Battle in the clouds: A number of salutes that explode in
succession, sounding like rapid gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Hummers: A small tube that spins and creates a screaming or
humming sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tourbillons: An ignited shell that spins like a top when it
rises.
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Chemical pellets packaged in a shell that provide
patterns and effects.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping Willows: The slow-burning after-effects of a shell, that
look like drooping branches of a willow as they fall to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Dud: A shell that fails to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Star mine: A glittery effect that rises right from the mortar
with a loud ``THUMP,'' emitting sprays of sparkling color.
</P>
<P>
   How get the best fireworks photographs:
</P>
<P>
   Point-and-shoot cameras are usually not worth the effort at
fireworks shows, professional photographers say. But if you're a
more advanced shutterbug _ and have a camera that can switch to
manual, allowing you to set the aperture and shutter speed _ you,
too, can take stunning photos of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post photographer Greg Lovett, who's had a lot of
experience photographing fireworks, shares these tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carry a small tripod and a few lenses (24mm, 50mm and maybe a
70-200 zoom). Take a small flashlight, so you can see what you're
doing in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrive early to find a good spot and give yourself ample time
to set up. If you're close to the water, you will need a wide angle
lens, such as a 24 or 35mm. A 50mm will also work, depending on how
much of the bursts you want in your picture. For the Flagler show,
one of my favorite spots is the Flagler Memorial Bridge sidewalk
about halfway across. The fireworks illuminate the sky and reflect
in the water, which is filled with boats. If you stand behind the
sea wall, or just a few steps back, you can have people silhouetted
in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   _ I like to use 100 speed negative film. It has beautiful color
reproduction and nice tight grain. The negative film allows you
some latitude in exposure and allows you to make a few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ I put my camera on a tripod and set my aperture at f/8. You
can set your camera shutter on ``bulb'' or ``B'' and open the
shutter using a cable release when you see a burst. I usually open
the shutter for about 8 seconds, a little less (4 seconds) for the
bright grand finale. For the first couple of bursts, I look through
the camera to get my composition the way I want it and to decide
which lens to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember to relax and take your time. You will have at least
20 minutes of shooting time. Try a few lenses in the beginning if
you want, but then have your special shot planned for the finale
when the biggest most beautiful bursts usually occur. And take
plenty of pictures. I normally shoot about two rolls on a 20-minute
show.

 &HT;    EasyPhoto scanner offers more colors and detail
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The EasyPhoto SmartPage Pro is a high-performance scanner from
Storm Technology that combines the best features of flatbed and
hand-held scanners. Its 30-bit technology promises more colors and
detail than 24-bit rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Versatility is the strength of this image-transfer device. It
boasts a straight paper path that won't bend, shred or mutilate
hard-to-replace photos and documents, and it has a detachable head,
which, like a hand-held scanner, can be used to scan books,
magazines or other bound materials. The removable head also makes
it easy to clean. EasyPhoto's ClearScan II technology is designed
to automatically brighten, sharpen and color correct dull images.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $149, the EasyPhoto scanner can be seen at
http://www.easyphoto.com.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking in comfort
</P>
<P>
   Users of the TrackMan Marble FX input device may have less
reason to fear the effects of repetitive-strain injury. The
point-and-click tool from Logitech combines comfort and
functionality in a futuristic design that eliminates the
multiclicking death grip sometimes required to operate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with four programmable buttons, the Marble FX is easily
customized via the Mouse Properties dialog box. The bundled
MouseWare software provides a host of commands, which can be
assigned to any of the buttons _ from double-clicking to closing an
application.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of its competitors, the TrackMan can scroll through
any Windows application.
</P>
<P>
   The Marble FX has a suggested price of $99.95 and can be seen at
http://www.logitech.com.
</P>
<P>
   Versatile videocamera
</P>
<P>
   Digital videocameras were once exotic toys for the well-heeled,
but like many things digital, cost and technology have put them in
the hands of the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Kodak Digital Science DVC323, for example. At $169,
this videocamera is within the budget of many computer users. It
has a wealth of fun and practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   Its two main functions are capturing still and video images for
transfer to computer files and for real-time videoconferencing.
Small enough to fit atop a monitor, the DVC323 will let you chat
face-to-face with friends from around the world. (Provided, of
course, you have friends around the world and they, too, have
videoconferencing capability.) It can be used to send still image
and video clips downline, as e-mail messages. Bundled with loads of
image-editing software, video quality is good, but installation is
reported to be a little challenging.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Web site http://www.kodak.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you never learned to type
</P>
<P>
   For anyone wanting to learn typing without going back to middle
school, there's Typing Instructor from Individual Software.
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning CD program uses a fun travel theme, plus
videos, photos, animations and music to add enjoyment and eliminate
the drudgery of mastering the letters, numbers and symbols of the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for ages 7 to adult, Version 9 of this deluxe edition
suggests the right lesson for each user, after a short test to
determine the user's skill level. The program promises to improve
accuracy and wpm scores of beginners and advanced typists.
</P>
<P>
   Easy-to-follow lessons help users master a few keys at a time or
users can build their own custom lesson plan.
</P>
<P>
   The $29.95 software is widely available and can be seen at
http://www.individualsoftware.com.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Perfect phone: square, clunky, wired to the past
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I see them everywhere. The baseball game. The grocery store.
Even the dressing room at Loehmann's. They're stashed in purses and
slung on hips. Ring. Ring. Ring, they go, usually at the oddest of
moments. And on the days when I'm sitting here, dreaming instead of
writing, I think:
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great if I could divulge to the world that no one
out there is using cell phones to do important things like trade
Sunbeam stock or order more Viagra. Indeed, people are simply doing
in public what everybody used to do in private. That is, telling
their mothers they're too busy to talk and yelling at their kids.
</P>
<P>
   I am perhaps one of the few ambulatory Americans who does not
own a cellular telephone in 1998, and I guess that's because I have
enough to remember each morning when I walk out of the house. But I
did, just the other day, have occasion to go phone shopping for _
now pardon my squareness on this _ a regular old desk telephone for
my office at home. You know, the kind with a clunky base,
push-button dialing pad and a receiver you can actually hold in the
crink of your neck.
</P>
<P>
   You want WHAT? the first salesman said, eyes big, eyebrows
arched, tone reproachful. And suddenly I felt as though I was 13
with a round little middle and had just asked my mother, for the
50th time, to please get me a pink Trimline. (They had a lighted,
push-button dial, ya know.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, before the mail starts pouring in accusing me of being a
romantic, live-in-the-past, head-in-the-sand person, allow me to
assure everyone out there that I am a liberal, forward-thinking
woman. I shudder when people say things like ``I wish we could go
back to the good old days'' because who wants no blacks and no
women in newsrooms. I think gays should be allowed to marry. My son
prefers art over karate.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that some people don't see the world through my
particular shade of rose lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Man at Office Depot: I haven't seen one of those kind of phones
in a long time, Ma'am.
</P>
<P>
   Man at Circuit City: Oh. Oh. I know exactly what kind of phone
you want. (At this point, he walks me to his cash register where
there sits a gorgeous, gray desk telephone, just like the one I
want.) Gosh, he says, I don't know where you can buy this kind of
phone. Mike, he hollers, do you know where she can buy one of
these?
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point, forward-thinking be damned, that a tiny _
OK, huge _ part of me wanted to go back to that comfortable period
in my life when the Ohio Bell man brought the phone we wanted right
to our family's door. I even began to crave Campbell's tomato soup
and grilled cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told this whole phone-choice thing started with a little
something called deregulation, which I am certain was a good idea
30 years ago. Why should one big company have all the business?
Except to say that back then I had the kind of phone I wanted and
there was no one calling during dinner trying to sell me 30 minutes
of free Saturday long distance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I persevered and won because, after all, it is 1998
and forward-thinking women get what they want. I'm looking at the
fruit of my labor right now.
</P>
<P>
   It's brown. It's clunky.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as beautiful as that pink Trimline I never had.

 &HT;    Smart homes good for the smart owner
 &HT;    By Cheryl Crabb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Owning a smart house can be great, especially once you
figure out how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Lora and Chip Gonzalez moved into their high-tech house at Creek
Ridge Point in Alpharetta, Ga. last December, and they're still
learning about all the things it can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who doesn't know it, it can be fairly complicated,
'' said Chip Gonzalez, a 33-year-old salesman for a mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has yet to master home entertainment. Although they
have the capability to play the same movie on all the televisions
in the house, right now, they are using standard cable like almost
everybody else. With only one computer hooked up, the Gonzalezes
also have yet to make use of wiring that enables home computers to
share information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gonzalez said, having a smart house is starting to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   A state-of-the-art security system with video cameras hooked up
to the home's television sets is one of the couple's favorite
features. A ``baby cam'' in the nursery allows them to keep an eye
on their 3-month-old son, Alexander. A similar video monitor on the
front porch allows the couple to see who is at the door by using
their TV's remote control to click on a designated home channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was here by herself one night when a salesman came to
the door,'' Gonzalez said. ``She was able to click on the TV
instead of going to look at him through the lead glass door.''
</P>
<P>
   The house's intercom system, which allows the couple to talk to
each other over any phone in the five-bedroom, five-bath house, is
also starting to come in handy, Gonzalez said. ``It's not a huge
house, but you can be in the far corners and not hear anybody,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family paid about $2,000 extra to wire the house
with the Lucent Homestar system, a joint project of BellSouth
Corp., Lucent Technologies and Trademark Homes. Alpharetta-based
Digital Interiors Inc., an authorized Smart House Inc. dealer, was
recently hired to help install the system and to teach homeowners
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez's subdivision is among a few metro Atlanta
neighborhoods being wired with smart-house technology. But that
number is rapidly increasing. The wiring will enable tech-savvy
homeowners to create the ultimate home office; choose from endless
channels of music and entertainment; automate heating, air and
lighting systems; and control state-of-the-art security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although most smart houses in metro Atlanta are priced at
$300,000 and up, they aren't only for the super rich in
neighborhoods surrounding high-tech business hubs. In nearby
Cherokee County, developer Hutson Homes is including high-tech
wiring in the cost of houses priced in the $150,000 and $200,000
ranges in his new subdivision Walnut Creek. For houses smaller than
2,500 square feet, upgraded wiring can be added for a few hundred
dollars extra, said George Ide, a home system designer with Digital
Interiors.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walnut Creek's first buyers, 25-year-old software writer
Josh Nunez, can't wait to get rid of the wires now strewn
throughout his Vinings, Ga. apartment. His wife Nicole, a speech
pathologist, also hopes the system will speed up research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Central cable and phone connections inside the home form the
backbone of a smart house. Communications lines branch out like
spokes on a wheel. Numerous hardware and software systems use that
wiring to bring smart houses to life. Currently, the upgraded,
reconfigured wiring can provide services such as high-speed
Internet access. In the future, it will enable homeowners to take
advantage of a wide range of technology, such as high-definition
television or interactive cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone company is beginning to offer video over
telephone lines, and homes need to be wired to handle that,'' Ide
said. ``The TV will become like the computer. You'll be able to
order movies from a Web site on the TV using a remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Green in Alpharetta provides a glimpse into that future.
The buyer of Chatham Holdings' model smart house there will be able
to control a multiroom, multisound audio system from a keypad on
the kitchen wall. The system includes a compact disc player and a
radio, and is tied into music channels from an 18-inch satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The owner will be able to program ``lifestyle preferences'' into
the home's central control panel tucked away in a small hallway
between the main foyer and the kitchen. The main control panel is
the base for the house's security, lighting, and heating and
air-conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to smart keys on a computer, the system gives homeowners
the ability to program their heating, air, security and lighting
systems for frequently used settings. When away, homeowners can
change preferences by calling their house on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your 'good night' button you can arm your security
system, turn off the lights and set your heating and air at the
preferred temperature,'' Ide said. ``'Vacation' does things like
set heating and air at a minimum and program lights to come on at
night so it appears you're home.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart-house technology has been around for at least a decade,
but builders have steered clear of it until now because of
additional costs to upgrade the interior wiring, said builder Jim
Bankes, who plans to build 80 high-tech houses at Rivermoore Park,
a 530-house neighborhood in Suwanee. The wiring adds about $1,200
to the cost of a 3,600-square-foot house. House prices at
Rivermoore Park start at nearly $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiber-optic cabling being rolled out in metro Atlanta,
and increasing reliance on home offices, is making the technology a
necessity rather than a ``little toy,'' Bankes said. Home computers
are now in 40 percent of American homes. But they are a fixture in
65 percent of metro Atlanta homes, according to a new Horizon Metro
Poll released by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Industry experts
estimate Americans will spend as much as $5 billion this year on
networks and other home-automation products.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded wiring was ``definitely a selling point'' for Richard
Woyce, a 34-year-old computer software product manager. He works
from his house up to 40 percent of the time. Woyce and his wife,
Debra, moved into Rivermoore Park in March. High-speed Internet
access and more reliable online service are key benefits of owning
a smart house, he said. The couple also forked out $3,000 to hook
up a state-of-the-art security system. Eventually, Woyce envisions
installing a home theater. The house is wired for surround sound,
but building a home entertainment center costs $5,000 to $30,000,
said Ide, the home system designer.
</P>
<P>
   Families with busy lifestyles are the biggest market for
smart-house technology, but some senior citizens also are looking
for automated houses to make their lives easier, said Lisa
Montgomery, editor of Wayland, Mass.-based Electronic House
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes things easier for seniors because of instead of
running all over the house switching off every light, you do that
automatically with one command on your key pad,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people don't want a smart house now, it might pay to put
in wiring when building, redecorating or adding space. The idea is
to create the capability for a wide range of future services. It
can cost 50 percent more to rewire an existing house.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should do their homework before investing in home
technology products offered by builders and sold off the shelves at
the local computer super store, Montgomery warns.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-controlled systems are still in the development stage, as
some homeowners in Florida discovered. The sound of one couple's
pet parrot regularly activated their system, turning on the lights
and stereo while they were away. A barking dog led another
homeowner's system to place repeated long-distance calls to her
parents. And one homeowner, whose system was programmed to call
police at the mention of ``911,'' got visits from the police
whenever the TV program ``Rescue 911'' came on.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, upgraded wiring is one of the most popular
features being built in new houses. But for most Atlantans, owning
a smart house is probably at least five years away, said Joe
Padilla, an Atlanta Home Builders Association spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or 10 years ago, we were talking about Corian countertops
and two-car garages; this (home technology) is taking us to the
next level,'' Padilla said. ``Five or 10 years from now, this will
be commonplace in every home.''

 &HT;    Recipes for great hair
 &HT;    By Lynda Edwards
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This is a jungle heat wave. It's just
too hot and humid to trek out to a salon and get beautiful. But
local colorist Melissa Peverini (whose clients include Marla
Maples, Roxanne Pulitzer and _ on her annual LA junkets _ Heather
Locklear and Gillian Anderson) swears all the ingredients for great
hair are in your kitchen. Here, some beauty secrets and homemade
concoctions:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Florida water is full of chlorine and iron; it gives hair
the color of a dirty penny,'' says Peverini, who works at Cosmo &AMP;
Co. in West Palm Beach, Fla. Sprinkle baking soda into shampoo to
strip the chemical buildup off your hair, she says.
</P>
<P>
   2. Glacial blond and ebony brunette look fine amid canyons of
gray concrete, steel and icy glass, i.e. New York City. But women
in the tropics _ surrounded by sun blaze, blue ocean and green
palms _ need lusher tones.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Blondes can rinse their hair with a cup of chamomile tea
for golden highlights,'' Peverini says. ``Redheads should use
raspberry tea and brunettes should use coffee or even espresso to
enrich and deepen their color. Leave it on for 15 minutes for the
best results.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Rub drops of olive oil through wet or dry hair to tame
frizzes.
</P>
<P>
   5. That old 1970s teen product Sun-In really worked. The
lightener can be duplicated by mixing half a cup of water with half
a cup of lemon juice, pouring it onto the hair and then strolling
under the sun for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Kool Aid hair dye was invented by punk rockers during the
'80s and is still a club-hopper's staple. (For God's sake, be 25 or
under for this look). Follow regular instructions to make the drink
and then add a pinch of cornstarch. ``Orange gives a coppery
sheen,'' Peverini explained. ``Paint it on with your fingers. Grape
and cherry make pretty streaks on blondes. Brunettes can pour it
all over their hair for an iridescent, opal-ine glimmer.'' Die-hard
rockers let the drink dry on their hair; the more demure should
rinse after 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. To add body to limp tresses, massage a cup of milk into
shampooed hair then rinse it out with cool water.
</P>
<P>
   8. Drink twice as much water as you normally do. ``It helps
prevent hair, nails and skin from drying,'' Peverini says.
</P>
<P>
   9. Repair sun-damage by spreading avocado pulp over hair and
wrapping it in plastic wrap for 15 minutes. It's the same deep
conditioning you get at a salon and costs $50 less.
</P>
<P>
   10. Men find vanilla one of the most erotic of scents, according
to the Smell and Taste Research Foundation in Chicago. Mix 2 drops
of olive oil with 3 drops of vanilla and run through wet hair.
``The scent lingers; it won't evaporate from hair the way it does
from perspiring skin,'' Peverini said. (And it's a far more fun way
to study romantic chemistry than having guys sniff test tubes in a
lab.)

 &HT;    40 ways to savor a mango
 &HT;    (With MANGO-RECIPES)
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mango smoothies, mango bread, mango
wine, mango chutney, mango pie, mango cobbler, mango liqueur, mango
chips . . . enough already!
</P>
<P>
   For the first few weeks, mangoes are great, eaten right over the
sink, juice just dripping all over you and the floor. Then you
realize you're sick of them altogether. Trouble is, so is everyone
else on your list _ and you can't give 'em away.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Here are 40 mango-related ideas. Take 'em _ or leave them for
someone else to pick.
</P>
<P>
   1) Gild your mangoes Martha Stewart-style. Then artfully arrange
them in a piece of pottery you've thrown yourself.
</P>
<P>
   2) Find all streets with ``mango'' in their name. (There are at
least 13 in Palm Beach County alone.)
</P>
<P>
   3) Bob for mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   4) Make a mango daiquiri. Per drink: 1 part mango puree, 1 part
good rum, 1 teaspoon of superfine sugar.
</P>
<P>
   5) Play ``Pass the Mango'': Everyone stands in a line. The first
person puts the mango under his/her chin and passes it to the next
person's chin, but no hands are allowed. Hint: Find people who
aren't allergic to mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   6) Donate mangoes to the Daily Bread Food Bank. Call (561)
659-5070 for details.
</P>
<P>
   7) String one up on a pole for the dog to chase.
</P>
<P>
   8) Stuff your bra.
</P>
<P>
   9) Organize a mango baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   10. Start a Take-Your-Mango-To-Work Day.
</P>
<P>
   11) Get on the Internet and find all the mango-related Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   12) Grow a Chia-Mango. Pare the skin off one side of the mango.
Sprinkle it with alfalfa seeds. Keep wet. Trim as needed.
</P>
<P>
   13) Stage the first worldwide Mango Summer Games, and have
events such as mango-relay, mango-toss and mango-lifting.
</P>
<P>
   14) Wear a Carmen Miranda-style mango hat.
</P>
<P>
   15) Throw a mango margarita party. Play Jimmy Buffett's Last
Mango in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   16) Walk into the local allergy clinic and hold up a mango.
Shout, ``This is a stick-up! I have a ripe mango, and I'm not
afraid to use it!''
</P>
<P>
   17) Next time you're in the mall, make trouble by insisting on a
Mango Julius.
</P>
<P>
   18) Make your own Mr. Mango Head.
</P>
<P>
   19) Perfect the art of peeling a mango. There is a flat side to
every mango _ find it and slice vertically down that side. Turn the
mango 180 degrees and slice down the other side of the pit. Pull
out the pit _ you now have two juicy halves. Make cross-hatches
through the fruit flesh just to the skin on both sides, and flip
the skin inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   20) Take your mangoes to a road-building site and drop a few
under a steamroller.
</P>
<P>
   21) String dried mango pits for your next Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   22) Mang-O-War! Buy big slingshots and fire away.
</P>
<P>
   23) Make a fruity baby. Dress up a big mango in a baby hat and
glue booties to its bottom. Swaddle it in a blanket, pop it in the
stroller, and see if anyone notices.
</P>
<P>
   24) Count all the mango trees in Mangonia Park.
</P>
<P>
   25) Make mango leather: Dry very thin mango slices on a wire
rack for at least 8 hours in a 200 oven till leathery.
</P>
<P>
   26) Mango lawn bowling.
</P>
<P>
   27) Slice up a bunch of mangoes and serve them on little
toothpicks in your grocery store. Hand out coupons for free
mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   28) Mango croquet.
</P>
<P>
   29) Make up a mango tongue-twister and say it 10 times fast: My
mellow mother makes mango mustard mighty merrily.
</P>
<P>
   30) Launch a campaign to change the Orange Bowl to the Mango
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   31) Fling mangoes at a canvas while friends beat on drums. Call
it performance art.
</P>
<P>
   32) Save water! Put mangoes in your toilet tank.
</P>
<P>
   33) Are your kids getting bored? Smash rotten mangoes on the
lawn for an instant run-and-slide.
</P>
<P>
   34) Have a ``My Mango's Bigger Than Yours'' contest.
</P>
<P>
   35) Make mango smoothies: Mangoes and frozen yogurt, or mangoes,
ice and plain yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   36) Hunt down that famous Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue with
the mango-eating model in it.
</P>
<P>
   37) Do the mango-tango! Put the mangoes all over the floor.
Learn to dance the tango by avoiding the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   38) Spray paint mangoes in a terra-cotta color. Use them to edge
your flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   39) Lobby the legislature for a mango license plate.
</P>
<P>
   40) Save the mangoes! Plant your own tree.

 &HT;    Make a meal of a mango
 &HT;    (With MANGOS-IDEAS.)
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some recipes for cooking with your mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   These two recipes are easily made and transported for your next
grill outing.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled mango kebabs
</P>
<P>
   1 large mango, cubed
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pineapple chunks, drained
</P>
<P>
   2 oranges, sectioned, sections cut in half if large
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Wooden skewers, soaked in water
</P>
<P>
   For dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Alternate cubes of pineapple, mango and orange on wooden
skewers. Brush with honey-lime juice mixture. Grill over medium
heat until pineapple is glazed brown.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and serve hot with dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10-12 skewers.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is a take-off on the famous Australian dessert. The
nonfat dessert makes a stunning presentation when served on a
solid-color plate. Quick grilled mango dessert
</P>
<P>
   1 angel food cake, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 large mangoes, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey mixed with 2 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Flaked coconut for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Toast angel food cake on grill; remove to cool. Grill mango
slices, brushed with honey mixture, on foil over medium heat until
lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate layers of cake and mango slices for each dessert,
drizzle with small amount of honey and garnish with flaked coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Mango Pavlova
</P>
<P>
   3 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup superfine (or regular sugar)
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup nonfat plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup raspberries, fresh or frozen, pureed
</P>
<P>
   1 large mango, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely diced mango for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Make meringues: Grease and flour two baking sheets. Trace 6
4-inch circles on the sheets with the tip of a knife. (Note:
Measurement doesn't have to be exact.)
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, with mixer on high speed, whip egg whites until
they hold soft peaks. Add sugar, a little at a time, until all is
incorporated. Add salt and blend well.
</P>
<P>
   Fill pastry bag fitted with large star tip with meringue. Pipe
spirals of meringue beginning in center of marked circles on pastry
sheet, and continuing to edge of circles. (Or, gently spread
meringue with spatula to cover circles; smooth tops for even
baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake meringues in 200-degree oven for 2 hours, or until just
lightly browned and dry. Remove and let cool completely before
removing with thin-bladed spatula. Note: Handle carefully, as they
are very fragile. They can be stored in an airtight container
between waxed paper if not using right away, but keep away from all
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mix yogurt and all but 2 tablespoons of the raspberry
puree in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, plate the dessert: Place one meringue on
plate, layering with 1/4 of yogurt-raspberry mixture, and 1/4 of
mango slices. Repeat. End with meringue, set at an angle.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with second plate. Drizzle both plates with reserved
raspberry puree, and garnish with finely diced mangoes. Serve
immediately as the meringues become soggy quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 servings.
</P>

   The wonderful world of mangoes
</P>
<P>
   PEELING MANGOES: Before you work with mangoes, perfect the art
of peeling one. There is a flat side to every mango - hold the
fruit at eye level, stem end up, and turn it till you see the
thinnest view; slice down both sides of mango next to the pit. You
now have two juicy halves to peel. To remove the mango flesh from
each half of the mango, make cross-hatches through the fruit flesh
down to the skin (but not through skin), and flip the skin
inside-out. Now, slice off the diced mango chunks. Do this over a
bowl for best results.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSTITUTING MANGOES: You can substitute mangoes for any recipe
that calls for peaches, or combine the two for a unique flavor.
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING MANGOES: Mangoes don't last fresh. Once they begin
getting sugar spots - those black dots on the skin which indicate
ripeness - it's time to eat them or freeze them.
</P>
<P>
   FREEZE MANGO SLICES on a cookie sheet until hard, then bag up
the slices and use as desired. Mango puree and mango pulp also can
be frozen in bags for up to a year with good results.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK RECIPE TIP: Freeze mango puree in an ice cube tray with a
mint leaf in each compartment, then use those cubes for your iced
raspberry tea for a pretty and delicious drink.

 &HT;    Dell helps wire Irish city
 &HT;    (EDS: Part of CoxNet's Dell/Ireland package)
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Ireland _ Ireland, in a furious pace to transform its
agrarian economy to a technological marvel in just over one
generation, hopes to have the world's first fully wired city.
</P>
<P>
   The project is called the Information Age Town. It's a joint
effort between Ireland's national telecommunications company, Dell
Computer Corp. and Ennis, a prosperous city of 20,000 whose origins
date to the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, each of Ennis' 12 schools was wired with a powerful
Dell server and Dell Optiplex personal computers for every
classroom _ 750 computers in all.
</P>
<P>
   Next, every school will be connected to the Internet by Telecom
Eireann, and the city's 7,500 students and teachers will get
personal e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But the most ambitious part of the project is just getting under
way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Internet access, each of Ennis' 5,800 households
will get a computer from Dell, which manufactures them 20 miles
south in Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Dell will discount the price of the computers and Telecom
Eireann will provide a subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the computers, each household will be asked to
contribute the equivalent of $360, which will be used for future
community projects, said Kyran Kennedy, director of the Clare
(County) Education Centre in Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, already the No. 1 personal computer company in Ireland,
outbid Gateway and other PC makers to supply the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to understand that market, which is on
our doorstep,'' said Tim McCarthy, sales director for Dell in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The close tie-in with Ennis schools _ including specific uses
for special-education classes _ may have swayed Telecom Eireann's
judges, said Kennedy, who oversees the project for Ennis schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do is make everybody Internet-wise,
e-mail-wise and computer literate,'' he said. ``I would be happy if
the initial response was that all teachers saw the computer as a
friendly teaching aid.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that many of Ennis' 400 teachers are leagues
behind their pupils in their computer abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater challenge is, what are we going to do in six
months' time when the novelty wears off?'' Kennedy said. ``And the
only solution is to get the curriculum totally integrated on the
PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned Telecom Eireann is a former monopoly now facing
competition for international business because of the opening of
markets associated with Ireland's membership in the European Union.
Competition for local business will begin in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company also worries about customers who may bypass any
local call provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heavily dependent on local call revenue,'' said Colm
O'Toole, who is managing the Ennis project for Dublin-based Telecom
Eireann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see voice telephony over the Internet as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Irish government recently began IT2000.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, the $70 million project will put 60,000
computers in schools throughout the country, train 20,000 teachers
in the uses of information technology and wire every school to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for every teacher and student in Ireland to have
an e-mail address, according to the national Ministry of Education.

 &HT;    Dell to exec sees Ireland as doorway to Europe
 &HT;    (EDS: Part of CoxNet's Dell/Ireland package)
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Thefollowing is an interview with Michael
Dell conducted by Austin American-Statesman business writer Jerry
Mahoney on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time do you spend in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's a little harder because they're further away. I'd
say, certainly when I'm there, it's a big portion of the time. I'll
probably go over about four times this year to Europe. We tend to
rotate different countries, different operations, reviews.
</P>
<P>
   I was over in April, and I was there in January-February time
... and I went back in October. But it's important to get over and
understand the differences in the markets and what customers are
doing and understanding their requirements better. The other great
thing is the market, Europe is just booming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that a lot of these companies are waking up
to the old idea of productivity and that they have to be
competitive in a world market. For example, I went to Italy and you
talk to the Italians, and what just about every Italian
businessperson will tell you is 'Well, the Euro is coming, and
because of the Euro we have to catch up with the Germans.'
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a banker or a construction company or any kind of
business you pretty much realize that you're going to have
competition from European competitors and you're no longer in this
island market that's protected and sold under one country. You talk
to the Germans and they think about the Americans and the Japanese,
they think about their competition on a global scale. Real Audio

</P>
<P>
   More Real Audio excerpts from Michael Dell's interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of the Germans see this as a real kind of
pinnacle time for their economy and their all excited about the
Daimler-Chrysler merger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are either of those companies customers of Dell?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're both customers, both very good customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do they buy from other vendors too?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh yeah, it's pretty rare that you can get all the business.
It's kind of like the Chicago Bulls, they don't win every game, but
they win a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Dell in Ireland with manufacturing and later with the
call center?
</P>
<P>
   A: This goes back to 1990 when the business was growing quite a
bit across Europe, and it came time to have a manufacturing center
for all of Europe. The things we considered included the work force
availability, infrastructure, education level, the political
environment, the receptivity toward new businesses, the incentive
structure, labor availability.
</P>
<P>
   You consider all these things and Ireland came out number one in
all categories. The only category they didn't come out number one
in was, which was a question at the time and now I think it's not
an issue, is the question of if you put you're plant in France or
Germany or the UK, you probably have some enhanced business in
those countries, which is true, but all the other things
dramatically offset that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think there's a stronger, bigger corporate structure
that would maybe spinoff from that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the idea that you would be able to get more business. If
you look in Malaysia where we have a plant, we're the number one PC
supplier. It's kind of like in the Austin area, who do people buy
their PCs from? You kind of have the home town advantage.
</P>
<P>
   So you could make the argument, if you're going to have the home
team advantage, you should put it in a big city or a big town or a
big country. Ireland has just exceeded all of our expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the business in Europe grow very quickly, but the
operations there have kept pace, we've expanded it and we've
continued to make commitment after commitment and investment after
investment because the operation and the people there keep
delivering. The results are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the employees I met over there said Michael has been
unequivocal about Ireland's role in Dell's plans. What is that
role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's really the backbone of our European
infrastructure. If you look at Europe, we have more employees in
Ireland than we do anywhere in Europe. In fact, outside of Austin,
there's no place in the world where we have more people than
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   There are some real good reasons for this. In our business, if
you think back to the computer companies of the past, they had this
idea that you stuck plants everywhere around the world, kind of one
in every town. The problem with that is you don't get any critical
mass and the key part of Dell's business models is inventory
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   If you took our plant on Metric Lane and you said OK here's this
plant that's producing a couple million computers a year, and we're
going to divide this plant into 10 plants and spread them all out
over the United States. Would you get higher inventory velocity or
lower velocity? Much lower, no question. Real Audio Listen to this
portion of Michael Dell's interview in Real Audio.
</P>
<P>
   You have more places to have stuff and more forecast inaccuracy
so the same applies: Austin is to United States as Ireland is to
Europe for Dell. It pays for us to concentrate our resources in a
particular geographic area. I'll put a little disclaimer on the end
here.
</P>
<P>
   At some point it gets to be too much in one place. And that's
true of anywhere in the world whether it's Austin or Ireland or
Malaysia because you could run into other kinds of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Workers, for example?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the availability of work force, the availability of
infrastructure. I think we're a ways away from that but we keep
making commitments to the same places so I think we're away from
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you look at the European market two years, five years,
10 years down the road, and it's importance to Dell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dell's business in Europe this year will be approximately the
same size as all of Dell was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wow. What is that $3 billion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last year it was $3 billion, this year according to the
analysts' estimates, close to $5 billion. I mean this is really
neat stuff. I think a lot of people look at Dell and they go, 'Gee
this is an incredible story.' But actually it's a lot of incredible
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Europe in itself is an incredible story. If you just had
Dell Europe as a company, it'd be an amazing company. The thing's
11 years old, it's growing like wild. It's a very profitable,
successful business for us.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in Europe is about the same size as the economy in
the U.S., but there's half the number of PCs in Europe as there are
in the U.S. And what I think is going to happen is over time, that
gap will be narrowed considerably. Think about it this way.
</P>
<P>
   If the average employee in the average company in Western Europe
costs the company about $140 a day. I'm including salary, benefits,
labor, overhead, everything, which, by the way, is not that
different than the rate in the U.S. A PC costs $2 a day. What
people figure out is instead of giving people slates and chisels,
you give them PCs.
</P>
<P>
   These are the weapons of capitalism, the tools of modern
productivity. The growth rates in Europe are tremendous. The growth
in the U.S. for Dell continues to be very strong, and even Asia is
growing pretty nicely for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Europeans been just a little slower to realize that
efficiency?
</P>
<P>
   A: They've been slower to adopt in an aggregate market, but you
would see companies in Europe ... into computing as any company in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   You see companies in the Nordic region doing the same thing, but
then you see other companies that were more regional competitors
and didn't feel compelled to engage in computing as much.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the use of PCs in the home has not been as popular,
although that's one of the fastest growing areas of our business,
not only in Europe, but in the U.S. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Our consumer growth right now in Europe is about 100 percent.
So, as income levels increase, as the cost of telecom comes down in
Europe, you'll see more and more PCs in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you project that the European market at some point is
going to become more important to Dell's overall revenues than the
U.S. as this market matures?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so. I think, like the movie Godzilla, size
matters. I mean, the U.S. market is still the biggest market in the
world. The way you ought to think about is, think about the top
markets in the world. It's U.S., Japan, Germany, UK, France.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those markets are in Europe, but even those three
together and the rest of Europe aren't as big as the U.S. So the
U.S. is still a huge, huge market, and I believe a market that will
continue to grow. If you look at the education market, the home
market, small business, medium-size businesses, and even large
businesses who are on a replacement calysts continue to speculate
that this enterprise market is going to be a problem for Dell. Do
you get tired of hearing that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I'm used to hearing analysts repeat themselves. There
is another thing that goes on here. And that is that the analysts
will quickly recoil and come up with a different approach when they
see Dell delivering results.
</P>
<P>
   We've had now seven quarters in a row of server growth in excess
of 150 percent. That keeps happening, and people say, 'Well, gee,
maybe we did miss something here.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems to me that's a Compaq and Pfieffer's strategy of
punishing Dell.
</P>
<P>
   A: Doesn't seem to be working very well.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the facts, OK. Two and half years ago, if you
said, let's look at the server market, you know, You needed a
microscope to find our server business. Now in the U.S. market,
we've got 14 percent share, Compaq has 30.
</P>
<P>
   HP has 12 and IBM has 10. So we're 40 percent larger than IBM in
the server business in the U.S. And we're almost half the size of
Compaq. And by the way, all this has occurred, this unprecedented
growth and share gain, with what I would consider to be our first
round of server products, which were pretty good but not awesome.
</P>
<P>
   And now, enter the new generation of products, which comes out
starting with the PowerEdge 2300, which has already come out. And
then the end of this month with Intel's Xeon introduction, we have
a whole new range of server and storage products.
</P>
<P>
   I think the game gets really interesting here because Dell goes
from fast-follower in the server market to product leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And if these guys think they're going to maintain 40 percent
gross margins as we're zooming ahead of them in technology, and the
customer everyday realizes that there's no reason to pay these
proprietary margins ... I hope they believe that. Because they're
going to be in for a very unpleasant surprise and it's called Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the delay of new Intel chip going to affect your plans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not measurably. This is Heywoods. No '70s collection would be
complete without them.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bertha Butt Boogie''? ``The Morning After''? Gimme a
break. Why would anyone consider singing about a woman's ample
backside or a romance aboard a doomed luxury ocean liner? How
utterly '70s. That would never happen today.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Wait. I forgot about ``Baby Got Back'' and ``My Heart Will
Go On.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Were there songs that Rhino missed? Sure. The roadkill called
``Muskrat Love'' by The Captain and Tenille. ``Margaritaville'' is
missing in action. There's nothing to hint that rap music broke out
of its crib with Sugarhill Gang's huge hit, ``Rapper's Delight.''
There's neither a Bee nor a Gee in sight, and there's nary a whiff
of Manilow.
</P>
<P>
   But the general mix is great. One minute you're enduring the
``Godspell'' reject, ``One Tin Soldier.'' The next moment you're
ready to skip class after hearing ``School's Out'' by Alice Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   So here now is a condensed, disc-by-disc review of the box's
outta sight highlights _ and lowlights. Right on!
</P>
<P>
   DISC ONE
</P>
<P>
   The first of the disc's 24 songs to smack you in the face is
``American Woman,'' by The Guess Who. Sure, it's got great
screaming vocals and chugging drums and guitar. But the lyrics?
Let's just say it's odd for a man to scream ``American woman, get
away from me,'' during the height of the sexual revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicle'' by the Ides of March quickly redeems this disc. When
Jim Peterik belts out ``I'm your vehicle baby/I'll take you
anywhere you want to go/Great God in heaven/You know I love you,''
you feel like you're listening to the commencement address at the
Tom Jones School of Macho Vocals.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end, ``Band Of Gold'' is covertly snide. Freda
Payne tells the tale of an unfulfilled bride who hopes her man will
``walk back through that door and love me like you tried before.''
Nothing like an impotent wedding night to send a song rocketing
Viagra-like up the charts, eh?
</P>
<P>
   DISC TWO
</P>
<P>
   Now we're cooking. It's the ``Theme From Shmetimes When We
Touch'' _ Dan Hill
</P>
<P>
   ``The Streak'' _ Ray Stevens
</P>
<P>
   ``Disco Duck'' _ Rick Dees &AMP; His Cast Of Idiots
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bertha Butt Boogie'' - Part 1 _ Jimmy Castor Bunch
</P>
<P>
   ``The Entertainer'' _ Marvin Hamlisch
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS THAT?
</P>
<P>
   What you heard might not have been what they meant to say . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Not In Love,'' 10cc
</P>
<P>
   What you thought you heard: ``Big boys, stay quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual lyric: ``Big boys don't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirit In The Sky,'' Norman Greenbaum
</P>
<P>
   What you thought you heard: ``I got a friend in cheeses.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual lyric: ``I got a friend in Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Radar Love,'' Golden EarringWhat you thought you heard: ``Been
driving all night/My aunt's sweat on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual lyric: ``Been driving all night/My hand's wet on the
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   NAME THAT '70s TUNE
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    EasyPhoto scanner offers more colors and detail
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The EasyPhoto SmartPage Pro is a high-performance scanner from
Storm Technology that combines the best features of flatbed and
hand-held scanners. Its 30-bit technology promises more colors and
detail than 24-bit rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Versatility is the strength of this image-transfer device. It
boasts a straight paper path that won't bend, shred or mutilate
hard-to-replace photos and documents, and it has a detachable head,
which, like a hand-held scanner, can be used to scan books,
magazines or other bound materials. The removable head also makes
it easy to clean. EasyPhoto's ClearScan II technology is designed
to automatically brighten, sharpen and color correct dull images.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $149, the EasyPhoto scanner can be seen at
http://www.easyphoto.com.

</P>
<P>
   Users of the TrackMan Marble FX input device may have less
reason to fear the effects of repetitive-strain injury. The
point-and-click tool from Logitech combines comfort and
functionality in a futuristic design that eliminates the
multiclicking death grip sometimes required to operate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with four programmable buttons, the Marble FX is easily
customized via the Mouse Properties dialog box. The bundled
MouseWare software provides a host of commands, which can be
assigned to any of the buttons _ from double-clicking to closing an

<P>
   Unlike some of its competitors, the TrackMan can scroll through
any Windows application.
</P>
<P>
   The Marble FX has a suggested price of $99.95 and can be seen at
http://www.logitech.com.
</P>
<P>
   Versatile videocamera
</P>
<P>
   Digital videocameras were once exotic toys for the well-heeled,
but like many things digital, cost and technology have put them in
the hands of the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Kodak Digital Science DVC323, for example. At $169,
this videocamera is within the budget of many computer users. It
has a wealth of fun and practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   Its two main functions are capturing still and video images for
transfer to computer files and for real-time videoconferencing.
Small enough to fit atop a monitor, the DVC323 will let you chat
face-to-face with friends from around the world. (Provided, of
course, you have friends around the world and they, too, have
videoconferencing capability.) It can be used to send still image
and video clips downline, as e-mail messages. Bundled with loads of
image-editing software, video quality is good, but installation is
reported to be a little challenging.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated 30 years ago, Congress
reacted by passing an act that banned most interstate sales of guns
and outlawed ownership by felons, minors and the mentally ill.
Today, Time ($2.95) reports, America is still under the gun. A
haunting photo essay by British photographer Zed Nelson portrays
born-again Christians, female executives, housewives and doctors,
all armed and ready to defend themselves. The most troubling
photograph shows a young Dallas father holding his infant daughter
in one hand and a pistol in the other. In a companion article,
writer Margot Hornblower interviews Charlton Heston about his plans
to revive the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Life ($3.95) addresses the same subject with a twist. The
magazine visits nine heroic teenagers who helped disarm Kipland
Kinkel when he opened fire at Thurston High School in Springfield,
Ore. Says Josh Ryker: ``I don't feel like a hero _ it still hasn't
hit me that I saved a lot of people.'' Now the people of
Springfield are trying to figure out how to make such heroism
unnecessary ever again. On a lighter note, Life presents exclusive
photos of Maya Angelou's 70th birthday bash on a Caribbean cruise
with Oprah Winfrey, Coretta Scott King and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ALL IN THE FAMILY: Violence can occur even when no guns are
involved. In a compelling cover story, Mother Jones ($3.95)
explores domestic violence and its toll on children. Kids act out
what they see, writes Claudia Glenn Dowling, a senior editor at
Life magazine who spent a year following a Vermont family in a
study of violence. ``Opposite-sex siblings tend to be at more risk
to act out exactly what their parents do,'' psychologist Carla
Garrity says. ``Girls align with the victim, boys align with the
aggressor.'' And, in a terrifying statistic, Garrity predicts that
half the 3 million children who live in violent homes will become
violent adults.
</P>
<P>
   SEX AT THE TOP: Some say that if President Clinton were the head
of a corporation, he would have been fired because of alleged
sexual misconduct. That's not necessarily so, says U.S. News &AMP;
World Report ($2.95) in an article on Milan Panic. As CEO of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Panic (pronounced PAH-neesh) has tripled the
company's value in the past year. The 68-year-old father of five
also has been involved in four sexual harassment cases. The women
claim Panic repeatedly propositioned them or groped them and
rewarded or punished female employees based on their responses. The
ICN board of directors responded not by kicking him out, but by
sweetening his $644,680 salary with a $1.8 million bonus. And, in
its continuing coverage of the Monica Lewinsky case, the magazine
explains why race may be a hidden factor. Lewinsky's attorneys seem
to be betting that she could win a jury trial in the largely
African-American and Democratic District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   WAR STORIES: Steven Spielberg's war epic ``Saving Private Ryan''
is so realistic that during a screening, historian Stephen E.
Ambrose asked the projectionist to stop the film until he could
compose himself after seeing the combat scenes at Omaha Beach. One
of the reasons the film is so moving, reports US ($3), is that it
is inspired by real people and their sacrifices. Spielberg based
his film on the story of the four Niland brothers of Tonawanda,
N.Y. Two of the sons had died on D-Day, Edward was missing in
action in the Pacific and Frederick was fighting somewhere in
northern France. Aware of the outcry that had occurred when all
five Sullivan brothers had been killed two years earlier, the Army
organized a successful search for Frederick. A year later, the
family received word that Edward was alive in a Japanese POW camp.
</P>
<P>
   CIRCLING THE WAGONS: When Harry Thomason watched Clinton make
his first public statement about Lewinsky on Jan. 21, he knew his
old friend was in trouble. So, according to Jeffrey Toobin in a
juicy New Yorker ($3) article, Thomason and his wife, Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason (creator of TV's ``Designing Women''), offered
their help. Clinton's subsequent _ and more forceful _ denial is
credited to Thomason's advice. ``Harry is like a throat lozenge,''
says Clinton adviser James Carville. ``There's something very
soothing about him.''

 &HT;    Smart homes good for the smart owner
 &HT;    By Cheryl Crabb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Owning a smart house can be great, especially once you
figure out how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Lora and Chip Gonzalez moved into their high-tech house at Creek
Ridge Point in Alpharetta, Ga. last December, and they're still
learning about all the things it can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who doesn't know it, it can be fairly complicated,
'' said Chip Gonzalez, a 33-year-old salesman for a mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has yet to master home entertainment. Although they
have the capability to play the same movie on all the televisions
in the house, right now, they are using standard cable like almost
everybody else. With only one computer hooked up, the Gonzalezes
also have yet to make use of wiring that enables home computers to
share information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gonzalez said, having a smart house is starting to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   A state-of-the-art security system with video cameras hooked up
to the home's television sets is one of the couple's favorite
features. A ``baby cam'' in the nursery allows them to keep an eye
on their 3-month-old son, Alexander. A similar video monitor on the
front porch allows the couple to see who is at the door by using
their TV's remote bontrol to click on a designated home channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was here by herself one night when a salesman came to
the door,'' Gonzalez said. ``She was able to click on the TV
instead of going to look at him through the lead glass door.''
</P>
<P>
   The house's intercom system, which allows the couple to talk to
each other over any phone in the five-bedroom, five-rath house, is
also starting to come in handy, Gonzalez said. ``It's not a huge
house, but you can be in the far corners and not hear anybody,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family paid about $2,000 extra to wire the house
with the Lucent Homestar system, a joint project of BellSouth
Corp., Lucent Technologies and Trademark Homes. Alpharetta-based
Digital Interiors Inc., an authorized Smart House Inc. dealer, was
recently hired to help install the system and to teach homeowners
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez's subdivision is among a few metro Atlanta
neighborhoods being wired with smart-house technology. But that
number is rapidly increasing. The wiring will enable tech-savvy
homeowners to create the ultimate home kffice; choose from endless
channels of music and entertainment; automate heating, air and
lighting systems; and control state-of-the-art security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although most smart houses in metro Atlanta are priced at
$300,000 and up, they aren't only for the super rich in
neighborhoods surrounding high-tech business hubs. In nearby
Cherokee County, developer Hutson Homes is including high-tech
wiring in the cost of houses priced in the $150,000 and $200,000
ranges in his new subdivision Walnut Creek. For houses smaller than
2,500 square feet, upgraded wiring can be added for a few hundred
dollars extra, said George Ide, a home system designer with Digital
Interiors.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walnut Creek's first buyers, 25-year-old software writer
Josh Nunez, can't wait to get rid of the wires now strewn
throughout his Vinings, Ga. apartment. His wife Nicole, a speech
pathologist, also hopes the system will speed up research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Central cable and phone connections inside the home form the
backbone of a smart house. Communications lines branch out like
spokes on a wheel. Numerous hardware and software systems use that
wiring to bring smart houses to life. Currently, the upgraded,
reconfigured wiring can provide services such as high-speed
Internet access. In the future, it will enable homeowners to take
advantage of a wide range of technology, such as high-definition
television or interactive cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone company is beginning to offer video over
telephone lines, and homes need to be wired to handle that,'' Ide
said. ``The TV will become like the computer. You'll be able to
order movies from a Web site on the TV using a remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Green in Alpharetta provides a glimpse into that future.
The buyer of Chatham Holdings' model smart house there will be able
to control a multiroom, multisound audio system from a keypad on
the kitchen wall. The system includes a compact disc player and a
radio, and is tied into music channels from an 18-inch satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The owner will be able to program ``lifestyle preferences'' into
the home's central control panel tucked away in a small hallway
between the main foyer and the kitchen. The main control panel is
the base for the house's security, lighting, and heating and
air-conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to smart keys on a computer, the system gives homeowners
the ability to program their heating, air, security and lighting
systems for frequently used settings. When away, homeowners can
change preferences by calling their house on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your 'good night' button you can arm your security
system, turn off the lights and set your heating and air at the
preferred temperatwre,'' Ide said. ``'Vacation' does things like
set heating and air at a minimum and program lights to come on at
night so it appears you're home.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart-house technology has been around for at least a decade,
but builders have steered clear of it until now because of
additional costs to upgrade the interior wiring, said builder Jim
Bankes, who plans to build 80 high-tech houses at Rivermoore Park,
a 530-house neighborhood in Suwanee. The wiring adds about $1,200
to the cost of a 3,600-square-foot house. House prices at
Rivermoore Park start at nearly $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiber-optic cabling being rolled out in metro Atlanta,
and increasing reliance on home offices, is making the technology a
necessity rather than a ``little toy,'' Bankes said. Home computers
are now in 40 percent of American homes. But they are a fixture in
65 percent of metro Atlanta homes, according to a new Horizon Metro
Poll released by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Industry experts
estimate Americans will spend as much as $5 billion this year on
networks and other home-automation products.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded wiring was ``definitely a selling point'' for Richard
Woyce, a 34-year-old computer software product manager. He works
from his house up to 40 percent of the time. Woyce and his wife,
Debra, moved into Rivermoore Park in March. High-speed Internet
access and more reliable online service are key benefits of owning
a smart house, he said. The couple also forked out $3,000 to hook
up a state-of-the-art security system. Eventually, Woyce envisions
installing a home theater. The house is wired for surround sound,
but building a home entertainment center costs $5,000 to $30,000,
said Ide, the home system designer.
</P>
<P>
   Families with busy lifestyles are the biggest market for
smart-house technology, but some senior citizens also are looking
for automated houses to make their lives easier, said Lisa
Montgomery, editor of Wayland, Mass.-based Electronic House
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes things easier for seniors because of instead of
running all over the house switching off every light, you do that
automatically with one command on your key pad,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people don't want a smart house now, it might pay to put
in wiring when building, redecorating or adding space. The idea is
to create the capability for a wide range of future services. It
can cost 50 percent more to rewire an existing house.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should do their homework before investing in home
technology products offered by builders and sold off the shelves at
the local computer super store, Montgomery warns.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-controlled systems are still in the development stage, as
some homeowners in Florida discovered. The sound of one couple's
pet parrot regularly activated their system, turning on the lights
and stereo while they were away. A barking dog led another
homeowner's system to place repeated long-distance calls to her
parents. And one homeowner, whose system was programmed to call
police at the mention of ``911,'' got visits from the police
whenever the TV program ``Rescue 911'' came on.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, upgraded wiring is one of the most popular
features being built in new houses. But for most Atlantans, owning
a smart house is probably at least five years away, said Joe
Padilla, an Atlanta Home Builders Association spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or 10 years ago, we were talking about Corian countertops
and two-car garages; this (home technology) is taking us to the
next level,'' Padilla said. ``Five or 10 years from now, this will
be commonplace in every home.''

 &HT;    Clooney may finally have a hit with ``Out of Sight''
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Soderbergh wiped the smirk off George
Clooney's face.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-area native and star of television's ER employed
his patented head-down, eyes-up acting style in a string of films
that included The Peacemaker , Batman &AMP; Robin and One Fine Day ,
with marginal box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   For his latest feature, Out of Sight , director Soderbergh
stripped down what he called Clooney's mercurial approach, forcing
him to be still. ``That's hard for an actor,'' Soderbergh said.
``It's hard to believe that you can stand there and not do a lot
and still have people want to watch you, but he can. He's
compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is Clooney's most impressive performance, in the best
film of his career. Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel of the
same name, Out of Sight opened Friday to strongly favorable
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, more than anyone, knew that he needed a hit _ ``stat!''
as his television alter-ego, Dr. Douglas Ross, might say.
Especially since next season will be his last on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first project that wasn't about, `OK, listen,
this is a great opportunity,' or `This is a great break,' ''
Clooney said, discussing the film earlier this month at a Beverly
Hills hotel. ``This is the first project that I read, after nine
months of looking for a script, and went, `This is the project I
want to do,' and went after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight was executive produced by Barry Sonnenfeld, who
produced and directed the acclaimed adaptation of Leonard's Get
Shorty . Scott Frank, who earned a Golden Globe nomination for that
film's script, again adapted the screenplay. Soderbergh, best known
for independent films such as sex, lies and videotape , brings what
Clooney calls a filmmaker's sensibility to his first mainstream
feature.
</P>
<P>
   The actor _ an avid Leonard fan _ plays Jack Foley, a hard-luck
bank robber serving his third prison term, after his latest getaway
attempt was halted by a dead car battery. Foley escapes with plans
to steal $5 million in diamonds from a Wall Street billionaire who
served time for insider trading, but his jailbreak is nearly foiled
by a beautiful deputy federal marshal named Karen Sisco.
</P>
<P>
   Karen, played by Jennifer Lopez, winds up locked in the trunk of
a car with Jack. The two form an unexpected bond, leaving them both
wondering about what might have happened had they met under
different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read four pages of the screenplay and called up my buddy and
said, `I found it,' ' Clooney recalled, looking characteristically
suave in blue shirt and charcoal suit. ``I hadn't even read the end
of the movie yet, and was like, `OK, I got the script.'
</P>
<P>
   Clooney was just coming off of Batman , which he described as a
tough year of work. ``Not just because physically it was kind of
demanding doing seven days a week for a year (shooting Batman and
ER ), but it was also that the project wasn't great,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just about the box-office being disappointing, which
it was. It was that the film itself was disappointing. And if I'm
going to play the role of Batman in Batman &AMP; Robin , then I have to
take some responsibility for that, which means that the next
project I do, I have to have more responsibility in the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney would don the rubber Batsuit again if the movie focused
on the Dark Knight character, rather than cartoonish villains, but
knows that's unlikely. ``I think I buried that franchise,'' he said
with a self-effacing grin. ``I don't think I'll have to do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old actor was born in Lexington, Ky., and raised in
nearby Augusta. As a child, he pitched in on his father Nick
Clooney's Cincinnati talk show, but it wasn't until he was 20 _
when his late uncle, actor Jose Ferrer, came to Kentucky to make a
movie _ that George was bitten by the acting bug. His aunt,
Ferrer's third wife, is jazz singer and occasional ER guest star
Rosemary Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ferrer and his son Miguel, who provides the voice of the
villainous Shan-Yu in Disney's Mulan , who convinced him to move to
Los Angeles in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first play I ever did, (Jose) came to see me _ it was this
little Equity waiver play in downtown Los Angeles _ and I thought I
was brilliant in it,'' Clooney recalled. ``I was crying and yelling
and doing everything I thought was brilliant, and then at the end
of it, he's sitting there and I walk over and say, `What did you
think, Uncle Joe?' And he goes, `I would say to you to keep the
scenery out of your mouth, you don't know where it's been.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney laughs at the memory. ``He was a great teacher for all
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's fondest recollections of growing up in this area
involve his beloved Cincinnati Reds, for whom he tried out after
playing college baseball at Northern Kentucky University. ``That's
what I was going to do,'' he quipped. ``I was only lacking skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney attended the last game played at Crosley Field, and said
the 1970s, when the Reds were one of the best teams to ever play
the game, ``was the greatest time to be a kid, ever.'' His hero is
Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   He returns home four or five times a year to visit his parents.
His father is a host on the American Movie Classics cable channel,
and his mother, Nina, is on the Augusta city council. ``I always
spend time in Cincinnati because I happen to think that Cincinnati
is a great town,'' Clooney said. ``It's one of the few towns you go
into and the downtown is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When in Cincinnati, Clooney frequents the Blue Wisp, a downtown
jazz club, for Big Band night on Wednesdays. ``It's just the
greatest place to hang,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Out of Sight , Clooney also has a cameo role in
Terence Malick's highly anticipated war drama, The Thin Red Line ,
which stars John Travolta, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack
and Nick Nolte. He's considering another film with Soderbergh
called Leatherheads , about the birth of the NFL in the 1920s.
(Clooney is also a devoted Bengals fan.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he's focusing on his final season of ER . He
credits the phenomenally popular medical drama with everything
that's come his way, but said that after five years, he will have
run the gamut with Dr. Ross.
</P>
<P>
   `` ER wasn't a stepping stone for me,'' Clooney said. ``It was a
landing area.''

 &HT;    Tech companies help spur Irish economy
 &HT;    (EDS: Part of CoxNet's Dell/Ireland package)
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney

<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ In the alley behind Gerry Walsh's
148-year-old business, a 50-foot-tall crane swings across the gray
sky. The racket of a concrete truck backing up to one of several
downtown apartment projects makes it impossible for Walsh to have a
conversation with an employee.
</P>
<P>
   The dapper, silver-bearded merchant doesn't mind. The
construction, as much as the parade of consumers that crowds the
sidewalk in front of his Newsom's department store on a blustery
afternoon, signals unprecedented prosperity for him and this city
of 80,000 on the River Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   The boom is not just in Limerick, where Dell Computer Corp. and
other large U.S. and European technology companies are hiring
furiously, but also in Dublin, Cork and most of the rest of the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Just three decades ago, Ireland was a poor nation of small
villages and farms that had more in common with some Third World
countries than with the industrialized West. For more than 150
years, its best and most dependable export had been its people.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ireland has become Europe's top-performing economy. Last
year, the gross domestic product grew by 8.3 percent, compared to
2.2 percent growth in Germany, 3.5 percent in the United Kingdom
and 3.8 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Record job growth and surging exports have been fueled by low
corporate taxes _ the corporate income tax is 10 percent _ and a
national policy that pays foreign companies to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly can't think of any time that has been comparable
in Ireland, or even in Europe. It's really quite astonishing,''
said Terry Baker, an economist with the Economic and Social
Research Institute, a consulting company in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Irish, imbued with their country's history of
poverty, famine and often brutal domination by England, worry that
the good times will disappear, like the elusive leprechauns of
Irish folklore hiding their pots of gold.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that this pot of gold is no fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of jobs
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp.'s expansion plans symbolize Ireland's
growing industrial clout.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is increasing its manufacturing capability in Limerick,
people and adding to its sales and support center in the Dublin
suburb of Bray. Overall, the expansion is expected to add 3,000
jobs to Dell's Irish operations over the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Other American companies are expanding as well. Motorola Inc.
plans to hire more than 100 workers at an electronics plant in the
southern city of Cork, where it also is starting an advanced
semiconductor design facility.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. last month opened a second Pentium chip
manufacturing plant near Dublin. The entire complex, Ireland's
largest manufacturing site, is expected to employ 4,000 workers by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., even as it is cutting jobs in other countries,
recently announced it will create 2,200 jobs in Dublin and in
Dundalk, near the Northern Ireland border.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people in Ireland, the jobs are opening doors to
new worlds.
</P>
<P>
   James Keays, 27, and his wife, Tracey, 26, bought a house in
Limerick two years ago. This spring, they took up skiing, jetting
off to the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain for a weeklong vacation on
the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Dell, Keays was a waiter at a Limerick coffee
shop. Tracey, his then-girlfriend, worked at Dell and urged him to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said the money was good,'' said Keays, who installs
software on Dell computers for large customers. ``Before that, I
wouldn't have seen myself buying a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, technology companies, global pharmaceutical and
banking firms and thriving Irish-owned businesses, which have
piggybacked on the business of the multinationals, created 10,000
jobs. That is a record for this nation of 3.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other factor, credit for the boom goes to
government policies, dating to the 1970s, that entice foreign
companies with generous cash incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish also get high marks for their higher-education system,
which turns out graduates with skills geared toward key industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, they're coming out with just the right degrees,'' said
Intel spokesman Howard High. ``When we rated them out, they came
out comparable to a University of California-Berkeley or a Stanford
University over here.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the good times, the government is pouring money into
schools and computer networks _ the equivalent of $450 million over
the next several years _ to prepare the country for the time when
the global companies move manufacturing sites to lower-cost
countries in Asia or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Ireland is unique is it offers a high-skill environment
at a moderate cost,'' said Martin Cronin, who directs the
government's effort to lure multinationals from his office in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The average manufacturing wage in Ireland is about $19,200 a
year. In the Austin area, it is $21,400.
</P>
<P>
   Global concerns such as Dell, Intel and Citibank are providing
more than jobs. They are introducing modern management practices
that had been foreign to Irish workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   They are teaching their Irish managers skills whose benefits are
beginning to ripple across the economy, said Ed Walsh, a visionary
educator who founded Limerick University in the 1970s and built it
into a model for cooperation between higher education and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish manufacturing was poor before, very inefficient,'' Walsh
said, sitting in a red overstuffed chair with his morning cup of
tea. ``We have a new generation of Irish people who are
well-educated and experienced in the best management practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are not used to good economic times, the Irish
have been quick to capitalize on them.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Walsh, the merchant, heads a Cork-based company that
recently purchased small department stores, including Newsom's, in
four cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at the Limerick hardware and housewares store have
increased 35 percent in three years, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Several nearby merchants who are enjoying the vibrant trade are
remodeling stores and refurbishing dated facades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of money in Limerick and the surrounds,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work in the computer industry in Limerick,
and the workers make good incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of ``Angela's Ashes'' might be amazed at the bustle, not
to mention the optimism. But reminders linger of the gritty city
described so poignantly in Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning
book about his poverty-wracked Limerick family a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny but cool morning this spring, a young homeless couple
and their two dogs slept near a boarded-up storefront on the fringe
of Limerick's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Business and government leaders chafe at the nickname, ``Stab
City,'' that the Dublin newspapers gave Limerick a few years ago
after an outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets in both cities where unemployment runs as high
as 60 percent, said Jan O'Sullivan, a member of the Irish
Parliament and former mayor of Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   The problem persists despite hundreds of openings at Dell and
other employers, and O'Sullivan said the government must attack it
with training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a cycle,'' she said. ``The father and
grandfather were without jobs. A lot of people can't just go out
and get jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those benefiting from the new prosperity have complaints.
The most serious is the rising cost of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for housing in the Dublin area, where the average cost of
a home is $132,000, will push prices up 25 percent this year,
according to a recent study by NCB Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors keen to take advantage of rising prices are buying new
apartment buildings before they're completed.
</P>
<P>
   Older buildings are snapped up and longtime residents are forced
out by rising rents.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government said earlier this year that affordable
housing would be a national priority in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic growth, many mom-and-pop businesses
languish while the government pays companies such as Dell to create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little money available for the guy who has a
small business and will only hire three or four people,'' said Doug
McLernon of Trinity University's economics department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, young and old alike are brimming with pride about the
country's economic health and membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   There also is intense hope that the historic Northern Ireland
peace agreement, which voters overwhelmingly approved in May, will
finally put an end to the killings in the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
   While this may be Ireland's finest moment, the country's sad
history always clouds the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put everything together,'' said Baker, the Dublin
economist, ``things have never been this positive for Ireland,
which, of course, makes everyone wonder what can go wrong and when
it will go wrong.''

 &HT;    Dell Computer attempts to build up service in Ireland
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Dell Computer Corp. called last summer,
Mike Riley said, ``No thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old manager had just opened a state-of-the-art call
center for Halifax plc, the British bank where he had built a
rewarding career over 35 years. Content, proud of the center and
confident in his understanding of banking, Riley brushed off the
overture from Dell. ``Technology is often a young man's game,''
Riley said he worried at the time.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Dell wanted to move him from his home in Yorkshire,
England, to the Dublin suburb of Bray, to run the company's sales
and customer-support center for Ireland and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's operation in Bray handles more than 3,000 calls a day
from Irish and British customers seeking technical help.
</P>
<P>
   Such facilities have become corporate nerve centers that can
play a key role in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading direct seller of computers, Dell has developed
its close contact with customers into an asset. For example, orders
received by phone, in which customers select the components they
want, may foretell shifts in buyer preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing emphasis on providing good service that is
rippling across the computer industry adds pressure on PC makers to
quickly and accurately help customers who phone in with problems.
What's more, because the labor-intensive call centers are expensive
to operate, companies seek ways to make them as efficient as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set up some of the best call centers in Europe, period,''
said chief executive Michael Dell. ``So he got on our radar screen
in the search process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, having spent most of his life in northern England,
did not relish the idea of moving his wife and two daughters across
the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
   That was last summer, and much has happened since, beginning
with a flight to Austin and a 90-minute conversation with Dell at
the company's Round Rock headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years with the bank in the U.K., and I gave up
everything after talking to Michael,'' Riley recalled,
half-sitting, half-leaning, with arms folded, against a table in
the burgeoning Bray facility that he has run since last fall. ``It
was a leap of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men talked about Dell's opportunities and challenges and
the role Ireland would play in the company's plans, said Dell, who
meets with most candidates for senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) got very intrigued with the opportunity to do something
different and be a part of something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom is the oldest of Dell's overseas operations
and is its No. 2 market after North America. Dell's U.K. sales grew
by more than 50 percent last year, to more than $1 billion. While
Dell relies on large corporate accounts for more than half of its
sales, its consumer business more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   On the job only eight months, Riley is making plans to hire 400
more workers and to double the size of the 106,000-square-foot
building in Bray, a Dublin suburb between the sea and green Wicklow
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to push U.K. sales to $2 billion this year.
Riley finds Dell's rapid growth unsettling at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned is, if you don't manage growth, it
manages you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite any concerns he may have about Dell's industry-leading
pace of growth, Riley has started a friendly competition with the
home office.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by strong fourth-quarter sales of the popular
Dimension desktop computer, which resulted in a higher average
price than it brought in North America, Riley challenged the Texas
headquarters to beat the U.K. on average price this year.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Larson, Dell's vice president and general manager for the
United Kingdom and Ireland, learned of the challenge in a meeting
with Riley and other supervisors two days after she arrived from
Austin in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, 'Uh oh ... I haven't even had a chance to review
these numbers yet','' she said. `` 'What is this guy talking
about?' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Come on, Susan,' `` Larson recalled, laughing. ``
'Let's not be a wimp. You're over here now. You're one of us. We've
got to go challenge those guys.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The competition is now formal, with updates posted for employees
on Dell's internal network.
</P>
<P>
   Another Riley goal, when he finds the time, is to establish a
paperless workplace at the Bray center. That means that every
letter, report and memo from a multitude of sources is properly
dealt with immediately -- scanned in and filed in the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to come up with something so good that the
Americans have to swallow deeply and say, 'We're going to do that.'
``

 &HT;    Dell Computer bases assault on Europe from Ireland
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Shortly after boarding a plane in Chicago
for a flight to Austin in 1989, Desmond O'Malley pulled out notes
on his next appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's minister of industry and commerce couldn't believe his
eyes. His staff was sending him to drum up investment from a $17
million computer company called PC's Limited, whose founder and
chief executive was only 24.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley couldn't imagine someone so young would be worth his
time, and he let his staff know he was displeased. ``But they told
me this was a very special 24-year-old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley's skepticism dissipated shortly into his two-hour
meeting with Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell already had a sales operation in London, and the CEO was
``in a great hurry'' to go after the European market. O'Malley knew
of a vacant Atari plant in Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   By early fall 1990, only 10 months later the meeting, several
hundred workers in Dell's new Limerick plant were rolling out
desktops and notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the story grows every time O'Malley, now a member
of the Irish Parliament, tells it. Dell Computer Corp. is now the
third-biggest PC maker in the world. And Ireland has become the
staging area for Dell's assault on the ready-to-boom European
market, the next big battleground in the PC wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dell now has a sales and support call center in suburban Dublin
and two plants in Limerick that make computers for customers
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. A planned third
Limerick plant will increase Dell's Irish work force to 4,500, its
largest outside of Central Texas, where it has 12,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland ``is really the backbone of Dell's infrastructure in
Europe,'' Michael Dell said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   And Europe is crucial to Dell's ambitions to become the No. 1
computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   Europe provides nearly 25 percent of Dell's revenues _ $3
billion in the last fiscal year. Analysts' projections for this
year are as high as $5 billion. Many European countries are coming
out of a recession, and the European Union is knocking down trade
barriers, forcing companies to modernize their operations to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, from government agencies in Dublin to Dell employees
in Limerick and the Dublin suburb of Bray, are well aware of their
country's role in Dell's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from Michael Dell is so clear and unequivocal
about Ireland's importance for Dell in Europe,'' said Fiona
Hopkins, a technical support supervisor in the Bray call center.
Ireland's strength
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, known for its lush scenery and rich literary tradition,
may seem an unlikely place for a company like Dell. But Ireland has
emerged in the last decade as one of the strongest economies in
Europe. It has lured scores of foreign companies, many of them
high-tech firms, with low taxes, job-creating incentives and a
well-educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is both a foundation of the new Irish economy and an engine
of change, exporting from the U.S. its lean build-to-order
manufacturing approach and modern management practices.
</P>
<P>
   Its employees recite the benefits of the Dell approach but have
had to adapt to the rapid, sometimes frenetic pace that the system
demands. Dell doesn't build a computer until it's been ordered and
paid for, and some PCs are shipped within hours of the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't tend to have the kind of red tape where you have to
go through the correct chain of command,'' said Aine O'Dwyer, who
works at the Bray call center, which handles orders from Irish and
British customers. ``Decisions are made so quickly that you just
don't have time for that kind of bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the island in the original Limerick plant, Denis Kelly,
42, a manufacturing manager, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who solves the problem,'' he said. ``I just want
it solved.
</P>
<P>
   At the brightly lit Limerick factory, the employees, aware that
competitors are adopting Dell's approach, are under constant
pressure to shave even pennies and seconds from operations. The
loudest sound in the factory is the occasional hum from a power
tool. On average, the plant produces more than 4,000 computers a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only thing that differentiates my process is
automation, they (competitors) can buy it as quick as I can,'' said
Kelly. ``So there has to be something different for us to stay
ahead of them. They can't instill the Dell philosophy as fast as I
can here.''
</P>
<P>
   The factory moves so quickly that employees returning from even
brief vacations are required to meet with training instructors to
see whether the system they learned is still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is growing so fast in Ireland that new jobs are always
available, offering employees bigger paychecks and training in new
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm measured on how successfully I move people into other
operations,'' said Kelly, who by mid-morning one recent day had
interviewed eight employees for a new post on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Dell five years ago as an assembly-line operator
at Limerick, James Keays, 27, has graduated to three other
positions, including repair technician and training instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Higgins, 27, leads an area known as Dell Plus, where large
orders of computers are diverted briefly so software specific to
corporate customers can be installed. He's putting in 50 hours a
week and plans to advance up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look toward a manager role,'' Higgins said. ``It's a policy
of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dell culture challenges traditional Irish assumptions
and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are not accustomed to working weekends, particularly
Sundays. Contract workers help keep the Limerick plants and the
Bray call center going seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dell doesn't allow smoking at work, a problem in a country of
heavy smokers. But employees have no complaints about the chance to
share in Dell's success by owning stock. ``The growth is beneficial
for everybody. It means there are always new opportunities
coming,'' O'Dwyer said. ``We're all very keen to see the stock
price rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has had to make some adaptations of its own. Because many
Irish don't drive, Dell buses employees back and forth every day.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the polished factory floor, Kelly reflected on the
clash between modernization and Irish culture that surfaces when he
has to correct an employee's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ireland, the family is still very strong,'' he said. ``Most
of us (supervisors) will see these boys and girls as adopted sons
and daughters. If 'twas my daughter, I'd put my arm around her and
say, 'Look, honey, you ain't doin' what you're supposed to do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously can't do that in a corporate environment,''
Kelly said, adding. ``Unfortunately, in my opinion.'' The Irish
deliver
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell praises the performance of his company's Irish
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland has just exceeded all of our expectations,'' he said.
``And we've continued to make commitment after commitment,
investment after investment there, because the operation and the
people there keep delivering.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell will need its Irish work force to keep delivering.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for Europe, the second-largest market behind the
United States, Dell faces archrivals Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Co. as well as ambitious smaller European companies
such as Vobis Microcomputers of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, Dell may be the most feared of the big PC
makers. With its efficient manufacturing system, it can fill orders
and upgrade technology faster than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I describe 1997 as the year of Dell paranoia,'' said Simon
Pearce, an analyst with International Data Corp. in London who
studies the European market. ``When I went to the vendors, all they
could talk about was Dell.'' Changes in Europe
</P>
<P>
   Three looming changes in Europe offer PC companies a market with
staggering opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   First, Europe is emerging from a recession that stifled spending
and may have created pent-up demand for computers as well as other
goods. Second, companies may go on a spree of computer buying as a
way to avoid potentially massive computer confusion when the
calendar switches to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The most important change begins Jan. 1, when 11 European
nations become a single market that will phase in a single
currency, the euro. Trade barriers between them also will fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is a lot of these companies are waking up to
the old idea of productivity,'' Dell said in an interview earlier
this month, two days after returning from visiting customers and
operations in Italy, Switzerland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a banker or a construction company or any kind of
business, you pretty much realize that you're going to have
competition from European competitors and you're no longer in this
island market that's protected under one country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe's Europe's economy is roughly the same size as
the U.S. economy but has half as many computers. Europeans bought
only 23 percent of 80.6 million computers sold worldwide last year.
The United States accounted for nearly 48 percent, according to
Dataquest, an industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a common currency and lowered trade barriers,
pan-European trade will have little resemblance to commerce in the
United States, where companies easily cross state lines. Each
market will require a tailored marketing strategy, said Chris Jones
of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Through 18 subsidiaries in Europe, Dell is tailoring its
approach to individual markets. Selling computers in Germany will
require a different approach than selling them in Italy. The
Internet is increasingly important to Dell's direct-sales models,
and it has Web sites in more than a dozen European languages.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's European customers include such blue bloods as British
Petroleum and the German automaker Daimler-Benz. Dell's desktops
and servers help run operations throughout the government
bureaucracies of England and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But at Trinity University in Dublin, the economics department
recently replaced a half-dozen or so Dell computers with Gateway
machines because of complaints among faculty and staff about
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government's Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Employment has nearly 400 Dell computers out of 660 throughout the
department.
</P>
<P>
   While they're ``very reliable,'' Dell's slowness to send help
when a problem does arise is annoying, said Richard Barry, who
helps maintain the department's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have to remind them that we have a three-year
warranty,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about these complaints, sales director Tim McCarthy in
Bray acknowledged that some customers have legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can give you names of many happy customers,'' he said. A
crowded field
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of global computer makers that control the $80
billion industry, Dell had the best financial performance in 1997.
Revenue soared 58 percent and profit rose 82 percent. While working
with a larger base, Compaq's revenues rose 22.8 percent and profits
were up 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell maintained its momentum in the first quarter of this year,
earning $357 million on $4.3 billion, while IBM, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard disappointed investors because of price cuts. The
quest to become No. 1 requires Dell to elbow aside an aggressive
Hewlett-Packard, which passed Dell as the fastest-growing PC maker
in the first quarter and leads Dell in France and Germany. Dell has
a much bigger challenge catching Compaq, which not only leads Dell
in the major European markets but overtook Dell as Ireland's No. 1
PC vendor in the first quarter, according to estimates by
International Data Corp. Compaq got a third of its $25 billion in
sales last year from European customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently opened a second European plant in
Holland, and Compaq acquired an up-to-date manufacturing site in
Scotland when it bought Digital Equipment Corp. this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives hope to take market share from Compaq while it's
busy combining its operations with those of Digital. ``Compaq is
looking more like a sumo wrestler now,'' said Ashok Kumar, an
analyst with the Piper Jaffray investment firm. ``With the DEC
acquisition, they've put on some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq officials declined to comment about the coming battle in
Europe. Several European companies have formed a coalition across
borders to reduce the prices they pay for components. Vobis and
Siemens Nixdorf lead the American-based PC companies in the German
market, but analysts expect that, in time, Dell and the other U.S.
companies will dominate Germany as well as the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The PC business has always been fiercely competitive, and that
will continue as key battlegrounds shift around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The coming battle is in Europe, but Dell also is planting its
stake in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building a small manufacturing and sales facility
in China, another country with huge potential. Later this year
comes a factory in South America, probably Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I think about it is, look, there's 300 million PCs in
the world today,'' Dell said. ``About 30 percent get replaced every
year. Ten years from now there will be 1.4 billion machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean this is the beginning of an industry.''

INITIATIVE TO ASK CALIFORNIANS THIS FALL TO `JUST SAY NEIGH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Here's a secret that won't be whispered to
many horses: California every year supplies the world's restaurants
with thousands of pounds of horse meat for cold cuts, sausages,
steaks and stews.
</P>
<P>
   It's something Barbara Clarke of Carmel doesn't like to tell the
38 equine tenants of the sprawling Redwings Horse Sanctuary. Clarke
regularly attends ``killer-buyer'' auctions to rescue horses from
becoming dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke once bought a sad-looking pony at auction for $28.40,
about the same price that two servings of the tiny white-haired
pony, now called Angel, might have fetched in a Japanese or
European restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a popular way to dispose of unwanted race horses
and family ponies _ selling them for pennies a pound to
slaughterhouses _ could become a felony in California, punishable
by up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative slated for the ballot would outlaw the export of
California horses for human consumption, the first such outright
ban in the country. The ``Save the Horses'' initiative also makes
selling horse meat a misdemeanor, although no restaurants are known
to serve the meat in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's slogan: ``Just Say Neigh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's going to put a stop to this favorite dumping
ground for horse owners,'' said Clarke, who became a vegetarian
after attending horse auctions and who strongly supports the
initiative. ``It's going to make people take a second look at their
responsibilities as owners of sentient beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has brought out officials at horse
slaughterhouses in Texas and elsewhere, who defend their killing
methods as humane despite gruesome tales from activists.
</P>
<P>
   Even some horse lovers have a few reservations about the
initiative. Grace Belcuore, president of California Equine
Retirement Foundation, which rescues and rehabilitates discarded
race horses, said she supported the movement but worried about
where the horses would end up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crowded right now,'' said Belcuore, who takes care of
about 40 horses at her Riverside County ranch. ``I won't put 100
horses in the field. ... This is a wonderful thing that is
happening, but where are they going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Non-Muslim and non-Jewish Europeans and Asians have been eating
horse meat for centuries. The Celts and Mongols ate horse, and the
citizens of Venice developed a taste for it in the early Middle
Ages during a famine.
</P>
<P>
   In modern Japan, diners pay huge amounts to eat raw, thinly
sliced horse sashimi with soy sauce, wasabi and ground ginger. A
restaurant in rural Belgium, De Kuiper's, serves horse meat and
proudly displays a sign outside: ``Major specialists in horse meat
since 1859.''
</P>
<P>
   Although frontier explorers, including Louis and Clark, ate
horse for survival, most Americans take a more romantic view of the
equine family. It's a folklore that stretches from the Wild West to
the New Age's ``The Horse Whisperer'' book and movie.
</P>
<P>
   There are no bovine equivalents to Black Beauty and Trigger, and
the initiative backers believe that, like cats and dogs, horses are
different from other food animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our heritage,'' said Cathleen Doyle, founder of the
California Equine Council and chief sponsor of the November
initiative. ``Certainly today, the horse is a companion animal, and
we would no more allow our dogs and cats to be secretly bought up
and slaughtered and sent off to other countries than we would our
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans can easily buy horse meat through mail-order companies
in Canada, Japan and Denmark. Two years ago, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, which inspects horse slaughterhouses, even advised
Americans about the proper ways to store and cook horse flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail cuts of horse are similar to those of beef,'' a USDA
advisory from February 1997 reads. ``The meat is leaner, slightly
sweeter in taste, with a flavor somewhat between that of beef and
venison.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting stonewalled in Congress and the California state
legislature, partly because of the powerful farm lobby, Doyle
teamed up with activists Sherry DeBoer and Sidne J. Long, heiresses
to the Long's Drug Store fortune and founders of Political Animals.
The trio has so far raised $700,000 and produced a 30-second TV ad
for the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   They have enlisted the support of numerous celebrities,
including ``The Horse Whisperer'' star Robert Redford and Diane
Keaton. They have secured endorsements from the U.S. Equestrian
Team, the Thoroughbred Owners of California and race tracks
including Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The group's biggest concern is how the horses are treated on
their way to slaughter and after they arrive. A hidden-camera video
taken by farm animal rights activists shows some horses writhing
after being shot through the skull with a four-inch bolt, the
standard killing method.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA says 113,499 horses were slaughtered last year in the
country. Doyle estimates as many as 10,000 California horses are
slaughtered every year. California is home to 750,000 horses, about
20 percent of all horses in America.

BE CAREFUL HOW YOU WEAR YOUR FLAG

   Commentary

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thanks partly to California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, we should be seeing a lot more flag burnings. That is to
say, more than almost none. There's nothing like making something
illegal to make it fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely noted in the press, but last week Feinstein helped
a constitutional amendment against flag desecration get through the
Senate Judiciary Committee, of which she is a member. Other
Democrats fought hard against it.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was passed by the House two weeks ago, and now
it goes to the full Senate, where it is only a few senators short
of the two-thirds vote needed for passage, according to the
American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the
states (which is likely, given the prevalence of political
pandering), you can kiss your old Abbie Hoffman flag shirt and your
old First Amendment goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag burning is a form of
speech warranting First Amendment protection. I don't like people
who burn the American flag, but why write them into the
Constitution when a punch in the nose will do?
</P>
<P>
   The court also has ruled that money donated to politicians is a
form of free speech. You don't see a rush by Congress to pass an
amendment banning that form of speech, which has proven much more
destructive to democracy than imaginary flaming flags.
</P>
<P>
   No, Congress is wrapping itself in the flag and bravely
attacking a problem that doesn't exist. Even the Citizens Flag
Alliance, which lobbies for the amendment, can count only six flag
burnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the amendment doesn't mention flag burning, but
says Congress can outlaw flag ``desecration,'' which means to
profane, or treat as not sacred.
</P>
<P>
   This could be extended to flag bikinis, flag running shorts, or
Jasper Johns paintings of the flag, if they're deemed unpatriotic
by the likes of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it might be nice to outlaw photos of Monica Lewinsky
hanging all over Old Glory in Vanity Fair, but the cost to liberty
isn't worth it.

<P>
   Two and a half years ago China and the United States stumbled
into a military confrontation that neither had sought or
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in retrospect, the March 1996 face-off between U.S.
aircraft carriers and Chinese warships and land-based missiles may
have had a salutary effect. The crisis reminded both countries of
the stake each has in positive relations with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two governments have worked hard to establish a
respectful dialogue about a range of bilateral and international
issues. Summits and other high-level meetings are once again a
regular feature of Sino-American diplomacy, and there have been no
further military confrontations in the Taiwan area.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
June 1995, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland had been moving toward
mutual accommodation through informal economic and cultural
exchanges and dialogue. On both sides of the strait there was a
consensus on the ideal of ``one China'' and the imperative of
realizing it through some form of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   This consensus, endorsed by the United States, kept the peace
and fostered an atmosphere conducive to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But again the consensus has collapsed. Taiwan seems convinced it
can campaign for independence with the military backing of the
United States. If war is to be prevented, Washington must convince
Taipei as well as Beijing that it is time for them to work out a
mutually acceptable relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has underscored the U.S. interest in resolving
the Taiwan question by peaceful rather than violent means. Yet most
American observers, including most members of Congress, have drawn
a lesson that the prospect of U.S. military intervention can deter
a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have always said they would go to war to prevent
the permanent division of China. They now believe that they are
likely to have to do so. China's armed forces have begun a
decade-long effort to acquire the capabilities to overwhelm
Taiwan's formidable defenses.
</P>
<P>
   If a demonstrated ability to do this proves insufficient to
dissuade Taiwan from separation, China's armed forces expect to
receive an order to invade the island, notwithstanding the risk of
conflict with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) displays
of force that followed Lee's visit to the United States stimulated
fear and dislike of the mainland and accelerated the demise of
popular support for reunification. The sudden arrival of U.S.
aircraft carriers halted any conciliatory moves toward Beijing. It
convinced the leaders of Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties
that they could count on U.S. intervention to shield them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has attempted to shake this
conviction through quiet dialogue with Taiwan. But its leaders put
much more credence in the unqualified public statements of support
they hear from majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leaders make no secret of their belief that, whatever
the cause of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, U.S. congressional
pressure would quickly overwhelm a reluctant Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And so Taiwanese politicians have concluded that they have wide
latitude to reject reunification and to maneuver the island toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's Kuomintang (KMT) still pays lip service to reunification,
saying that it might be considered when and if the Chinese mainland
democratizes. Hsu Hsin-liang's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party flatly opposes reunification under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
embraced the concept of ``one China'' _ although they disagreed, of
course, on which was the legitimate regime.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, cross-strait trade was worth about $26.5 billion a
year. About 35,000 Taiwanese companies had invested $30 billion in
the PRC. Nearly 1.5 million visits _ the vast majority of them from
Taiwan to the Chinese mainland _ were being made each year. The
steady relaxation of tensions included minor steps to facilitate
the exchange of mail and trade across the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing and Taipei also established a regular channel of
communication between citizens' groups, or ``nongovernmental''
organizations, to handle discussions with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Lee now asserts that the Republic of China, first established in
1912 by Sun Yat-sen, is still a sovereign independent nation whose
territory is limited to Taiwan and its offshore islands, and
entitled to international recognition as such.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's efforts to redefine itself as a sovereign nation-state
distinct from the PRC have been backed by well-financed ``pragmatic
diplomacy'' aimed at changing the global context of the Taiwan
question and raising the island's profile. Taipei has used economic
grants to persuade developing countries to recognize it as a state
separate from the PRC and to support its campaign to gain a seat at
the United Nations and other world groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Taipei cannot join international
organizations unless Beijing agrees. Beijing was willing to
compromise on this issue when Taipei's membership was consistent
with the principle of ``one China.'' Taipei's new insistence on
independence has made additional compromises unacceptable to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a flag and other symbols of nationhood, it is difficult
to see what Taiwan would gain from formal separation from China.
Nor, truth be told, would Beijing gain much from reunification.
Mainland China is already benefiting from Taiwan's economic
know-how and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Taiwan accept Lee's redefinition of the status quo and
see no reason to return to a view of the status quo as ``one China,
even if not now.'' In short, Taiwan's domestic politics now makes
it difficult for its leaders to address Beijing's reunification
agenda, even if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political establishment does not want to appear to be
against talks across the strait because that would not sit well
with the United States or Japan. The problem is that Taiwanese
public opinion will only permit talks with Beijing about how to
preserve and enhance Taiwan's separation from China. Taiwan's
leaders know that Beijing cannot accept such a premise for talks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 1950s, there is a real danger that
decisions in Taipei, not just Beijing, could ignite a conflict in
the Taiwan Strait. The United States, as well as both Chinese
parties, would be a loser in any such conflict, whether American
forces joined it or not.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy can no longer hope to deter war exclusively by
keeping Beijing at bay. The United States must also discourage
decisions and actions by Taipei that could leave Beijing with
little choice but to react militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy cannot be implemented if Congress and the
administration remain at odds. A serious effort to forge a national
consensus on policy toward China, including Taiwan, is overdue. The
United States should state unequivocally that it will not support
or endorse any unilateral change in Taiwan's status by either
Beijing or Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait also call for
a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan. In the 1982 Sino-American
communique, China pledged ``to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question.'' In return the United States promised to cap
the quantity and sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan,
``leading to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot hold Beijing to its word if Americans
do not keep theirs. The sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992
and some subsequent deals do not square with the 1982 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to U.S. noncompliance with the 1982
communique and how much to Taipei's new opposition to reunification
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work
to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences
with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its
own way, regardless of history, geography and the views of Chinese
across the strait. This is not the message the United States should
be sending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That is why at a minimum the United States should return to
strict compliance with Ronald Reagan's 1982 understanding with Deng
Xiaoping and insist that Beijing do likewise. And as the United
States considers further arms sales to Taiwan, it should weigh
their impact on Taipei's intentions and behavior as well as
Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest strengths of Taiwan's 22 million people are their
superior political and economic systems, not their capacity to
outspend, outarm or outfight the nearly 1.3 billion Chinese across
the strait _ with or without backing from U.S. forces. Taiwan's
security depends, in the end, on its ability to work out a mutually
satisfactory relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is no longer the central actor in cross-strait
relations, but its words and actions continue to shape their
context.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should return to a focus on the most important
interest of the Taiwan question _ ensuring that it is resolved
peacefully, by mutual accommodation, rather than in war.
</P>
<P>
   The regular summit meetings on which China and the United States
have now embarked offers ample opportunity to do so.

<P>
   Two and a half years ago China and the United States stumbled
into a military confrontation that neither had sought or
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in retrospect, the March 1996 face-off between U.S.
aircraft carriers and Chinese warships and land-based missiles may
have had a salutary effect. The crisis reminded both countries of
the stake each has in positive relations with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two governments have worked hard to establish a
respectful dialogue about a range of bilateral and international
issues. Summits and other high-level meetings are once again a
regular feature of Sino-American diplomacy, and there have been no
further military confrontations in the Taiwan area.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
June 1995, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland had been moving toward
mutual accommodation through informal economic and cultural
exchanges and dialogue. On both sides of the strait there was a
consensus on the ideal of ``one China'' and the imperative of
realizing it through some form of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   This consensus, endorsed by the United States, kept the peace
and fostered an atmosphere conducive to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But again the consensus has collapsed. Taiwan seems convinced it
can campaign for independence with the military backing of the
United States. If war is to be prevented, Washington must convince
Taipei as well as Beijing that it is time for them to work out a
mutually acceptable relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has underscored the U.S. interest in resolving
the Taiwan question by peaceful rather than violent means. Yet most
American observers, including most members of Congress, have drawn
a lesson that the prospect of U.S. military intervention can deter
a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have always said they would go to war to prevent
the permanent division of China. They now believe that they are
likely to have to do so. China's armed forces have begun a
decade-long effort to acquire the capabilities to overwhelm
Taiwan's formidable defenses.

AT WOODSTOCK SITE, IT'S STARDUST VS. CAPITALISM

 _____   ``We are stardust we are golden and we've got to get
ourselves back to the garden.'' _ from ``Woodstock,'' by Joni
Mitchell, ``Ladies of the Canyon,'' 1970

<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ Neither stardust nor gold will get pilgrims to
the garden this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only with a $69.98 ticket and proper credentials will outsiders
get near the natural amphitheater on Max Yasgur's farm, the site of
the original Woodstock Music and Art Fair in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the town of Bethel, the New York State Police and
private promoters are readying to seal off the concert site and at
least part of the surrounding area in order to stage ``A Day in the
Garden,'' featuring some of the legendary music festival's original
acts. The event is set for Aug. 14-15, the 29th anniversary of the
first Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales are limited to 30,000 for each day of the event,
modest against the estimated 1969 turnout of 400,000 to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But before the hoped-for yuppies arrive with the BMWs and credit
cards, Bethel may get a little crowded with lawyers. And one of the
potential cases could bring to a head a long-simmering question
that is at once a legal issue and, for many past and present flower
children, a matter of the heart: Who owns Woodstock? And they mean,
who really owns it.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire Allan Gerry, whose not-for-profit Gerry
Foundation holds the deed to the property and is sponsoring the
concert with the Bethel Local Development Corp., calls this year's
recently announced concert ``the beginning of a renaissance'' for
the property.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially dubbed ``Boomstock,'' the concert is aimed at
well-heeled baby boomers, the ``Beemers and Benzes'' crowd looking
for a piece of nostalgia and willing to pay for it, according to
Michael DiTullo, vice president of the Gerry Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry's organization depicts the concert as the first step in
creating an international music theme park on the site and some
1,500 surrounding acres the organization owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be thrilled,'' DiTullo says of critics. ``What
we're doing there is bringing the site back to life.'' But this
corporate approach to managing a mecca of the anti-establishment of
the 1960s has at least one group of Woodstock purists fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Storm of the Woodstock Nation Foundation Inc. says the
question of ownership is not simply one of paper deeds and title.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock nation is a self-appointed guardian organization
that ``preserves the historic Woodstock site in Bethel, N.Y., as a
Planetary Sanctuary,'' according to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Storm and her husband, Daniel Eggink, argue that because the
public used the property for years, the amphitheater has
effectively fallen into the public domain. They note that the
thousands of human feet that have trod there annually created a
dirt road _ and a public easement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to put up a toll booth on a well-traveled highway,''
Storm says.
</P>
<P>
   DiTullo declined to publicly debate Storm's assertion, stating
only that the title to the property is clear. ``It's private
property, and it is owned by the Gerry Foundation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea the public might have some inherent right to
Woodstock isn't just a fanciful notion of a few flower children.
``Easement by adverse possession'' is a legal argument, one that
Storm and Eggink's attorney, Richard Newberg, tried to use last
year to stop Gerry from barring people from the site on Woodstock's
28th anniversary. Gerry allowed visitors, but barred overnight
camping.
</P>
<P>
   Newberg says he sought a temporary restraining order last summer
in state Supreme Court in Monticello to allow his clients to use
the site, based partly on the easement issue. The motion was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   But Newberg says he thinks it's worth pursuing, provided the
foundation can muster the money to wage such a complex case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a chance,'' Newberg says. ``That, of course,
would be quite an involved action and take considerable funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Storm is advertising for attorneys and support and says she is
talking with several lawyers now about taking on the case. With
Newberg acknowledging the easement issue would take years to fight,
it's unlikely it will have any impact on ``A Day in the Garden.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away on Yasgur Road, meanwhile, yet another legal
issue is brewing, for which the question is not who owns the site,
but who can be there.
</P>
<P>
   Roy and Jeryl Howard, who own Max Yasgur's house, barns and 103
acres of his original farm, have sought for two years to open their
land to people chased off Gerry's property. After hosting a modest
crowd in 1996, the Howards last year arranged a free concert
featuring bands from around the region and South Africa. They fixed
up the barn and obtained state Health Department permits, only to
be told by the town they needed a mass gathering permit, too.
</P>
<P>
   After trying unsuccessfully to fight the permit requirement in
court, the Howards say they canceled their plans and posted their
land with no trespassing signs, but to no avail. Bands and
thousands of people showed up. The Howards are now under court
order not to host any large affairs on their property without
obtaining a permit.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't applying for one, arguing the town's requirements
are onerous and that Bethel wouldn't give them a permit even if
they applied. They say officials want the kind of well-heeled
customers Gerry is attracting, not live-off-the-land hippies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Mississippi of the North,'' Roy Howard says.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Howards plan to talk with their attorney, Michael
Sussman, about bringing a property rights case against the town.
``Our case is pretty cut-and-dried,'' he says. ``We own property.
We're being prevented from using that property.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has also gone to the U.S. attorney's office in
White Plains, asking it to investigate alleged civil rights issues
at the Woodstock site. A spokeswoman said the U.S. attorney's
office could not comment on potential cases.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Woodstock, storm says, could inflame passions
enough to prompt people to come in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are offended by that,'' she says. ``This is spiritual.
People think of the Woodstock site as holy ground.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Western business in China stopped after the 1949
communist revolution, and not until top leader Deng Xiaoping opened
his economic reforms did the Chinese market become accessible
again. Here are some high points of the comeback:
</P>
<P>
   June 1978 - Henry Ford II and other Ford executives meet Chinese
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, as a prelude to Ford Motor Co.

   Forget about that American Film Institute list of the 100
greatest American films of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, forget about great movies altogether. On this
Independence Day weekend, I salute ``Independence Day'' _ and 49
other turkeys _ as the worst movies I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``ID4'' was a monster hit, but try to sit through that
piece of drek again if you consider yourself a fan. It's riddled
with more sappy cliches than a boxed-set video of the Jerry Lewis
Telethon.
</P>
<P>
   After perusing countless film guides and soliciting suggestions
from dozens of film-loving friends, I've compiled a list of 50
movies so bad they make your teeth hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Why 50? Because a list of 100 would make your head hurt, and
besides, it wouldn't fit in this space.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria: No cheapie slasher flicks, no low-budget bombs, no
straight-to-video duds. When these movies were released, they were
not thought of as camp classics or interesting failures; they were
supposed to be mainstream hits, but they missed.
</P>
<P>
   By a mile.
</P>
<P>
   In alphabetical order _ there's no way you can say ``North'' is
worse than ``Heaven's Gate,'' awful is awful _ here are the 50
lousiest movies I've ever seen.

REPORTER ASSIGNED TO COWBOY REUNION IN '36 TO LEAD ITS PARADE 62
YEARS LATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ When 84-year-old Harry Holt first saw the Texas
Cowboy Reunion in Stamford, it was 1936 and the Dust Bowl days
still hung over the vastness of West Texas. Holt was a pup reporter
then, running behind the chutes in the sweltering heat, trying
desperately to get a story.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he will be comfortably up front in the 68th reunion,
serving as grand marshal of the parade that kicks off four days of
celebration on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is more than just a rodeo,'' explained Gary Mathis,
manager of the Swenson Ranches and organizer of the event. ``This
is a Texas cowboy reunion, and Harry has been in this part of the
country a long time. It is an honor for us to have him be a part of
this year's event.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt worked for 15 years as a reporter and columnist for the
Abilene Reporter News. He left the paper in 1953 and began a weekly
TV program called ``West Texas This Week'' and a daily ag report on
Abilene radio. They continue today.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the heyday of the reunion, which began in 1931; he
has seen the difficult times as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year before I started covering it was 1935, the year that
Will Rogers was there,'' he said. ``Rogers came to Abilene with his
pilot, Wiley Post. Post once lived just outside Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, Rogers got a taxi and went to Stamford, unannounced,
and sat up in the bleachers in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt remembered that John Selman was manager of the Swenson
ranches back then and that when Selman recognized Rogers, he called
him down to the arena, gave him a horse and turned him loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogers did his rope tricks and put on a show for the crowd,''
Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Post and Rogers were killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Holt had the painful job of informing Post's wife of her
husband's death. It was, he said, the hardest thing he ever had to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that Will Rogers touch, his presence, that put the
Cowboy Reunion over the top,'' Holt said. ``That, and the fact that
it was a pet project of Amon Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's first publisher, and
Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers made his appearance at
Stamford, 40 miles north of Abilene, Carter began dispatching
reporters to West Texas to cover the Fourth of July weekend event.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Mabel Gouldy, C.L. Richhart and Frank Reeves blanketed
the Cowboy Reunion, Holt said. The Abilene and Wichita Falls papers
then boosted their coverage, and the media attention made the event
irresistible to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last governor I remember coming was Preston Smith,'' Holt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Cowboy Reunion has always been a ranch rodeo. Although
the neighboring ranches didn't enter as teams, the cowboys would
travel to Stamford together and camp together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reunion was unique in that way,'' Holt said. ``The
contestants were real working cowboys. They would enter the wild
cow milking contest because they were used to roping cows out in
the pasture. Some of the cowboys today have never seen a wild
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who participated were ranch hands, too, Holt said.
Riders like Ardeth Copeland, Fern Sawyer and Christine Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   The first approved and sanctioned American Quarter Horse
Association show was held at the Cowboy Reunion. ``The King Ranch
was big then. Mr. Bob Kleberg came himself,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also a lot of good cutting horse competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Money was never really the object at Stamford, Holt said. It was
an amateur rodeo. First prize was only $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they gave away saddles and people would spend a lifetime
trying to win one of those saddles,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the reunion dwindled. The crowds and entries
shrank. It was, Holt said, simply a sign of the times. Every small
town now has its own rodeo and the competition for competitors is
tough.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathis said the Texas Cowboy Reunion is holding on. ``The
last four to five years we've really been coming back,'' he said.
``We've brought back some of the old activities like the wild cow
milking and a ranch horse competition. There has been interest in
the bit and spur show, the trade show and the chuck wagon cook-off
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now give six trophy saddles, 13 buckles and last year we
handed out $53,000 in prize money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the tradition, he said. No one wants to lose the tradition.
</P>

Reunion is available at (915) 773-3614 or (915) 773-2411.

RESEARCHERS SAY HIV REBOUND IS NOT SO DIRE A SIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although drug treatments suppress the level of
the AIDS virus in patients, most of them will experience a
resurgence of HIV within a year, according to a group of California
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at the University of California at San Francisco
say illness has struck surprisingly few of those whose viral levels
have risen again.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests many patients can stay healthy even if their
bodies contain measurable levels of the human immunodeficiency
virus, said Dr. John Nienow, who conducted the study with seven
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, therapists should not prematurely alter the drug regimens
of patients by thinking that the resurgence of HIV to ``very low''
levels of detectability is a sign of treatment failure, Nienow
said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were to be reported Tuesday by Nienow's colleague,
Dr. Donald Abrams, at the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The finding shows it is too early to suggest that new drug
treatments for AIDS have been over-promoted, Abrams said in a
telephone interview from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are still benefiting from these treatments,'' Abrams
said. ``They are feeling better; their weight is up. ... Anybody
who takes care of HIV patients or knows an HIV patient on these
drugs knows that people are benefiting from the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how long will they (benefit), and what are
the delayed side effects?'' That remains uncertain, Abrams added.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on 233 patients who had been treated with
combination anti-retroviral therapy at 10 clinics in the San
Francisco area. Most were men, and 36 percent were ethnic
minorities. Five of the 233 were injection drug users; 55 percent
of the group had been diagnosed with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The drug treatments, including protease inhibitors, suppressed
their HIV levels to undetectable amounts, below 500 copies of the
AIDS virus per milliliter of blood. Ten months later, the study
found, the average patient's viral load had risen back to 2,932
copies of the virus per milliliter of blood.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relatively low amount of HIV, Nienow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my experience that patients on therapy who break
through at low levels remain at low levels and stay well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news that the vast majority of patients are doing
well clinically, though over one-half had a resurgence in their
viral load,'' Nienow said. ``What is surprising is that, so far,
many of the viral load breakthroughs have not been very high, and
we have seen very little progression of HIV disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings suggest that maintaining undetectable viral
load levels may not be necessary to sustain wellness,'' he said.
``Loss of viral suppression doesn't appear to lead automatically to
clinical progression of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was a combined effort of the university and the
Community Consortium, an association of 200 health care providers
that cares for HIV and AIDS patients in the San Francisco area.

I'M SO GLAD WE HAD THIS NEWSPAPERING TIME TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAT TRULY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fisk Rubber Co. used to employ an advertising logo featuring
a sleepy little boy in one-piece pajamas, yawning, holding a candle
in one hand and carrying an old-fashioned automobile tire over his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The copy with the illustration asked simply, ``Time to
Re-tire?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. It is. And I am. So this is by way of a valedictory
message.
</P>
<P>
   An early photograph of me (I was about 2 1/2) shows me posed at
an upright Underwood typewriter in a cluttered newspaper office.
That long-ago snapshot was taken by my father, Tom Truly, and that
newspaper office was where he was city editor, in Wichita Falls.
His father, whom I never knew, also was a newspaperman. Before the
turn of the century, Grandad cruised Runnels County in a buggy,
jotting down news items in a little notebook. My mother was in this
business, too.
</P>
<P>
   You will notice that I called my father, who died in 1959, a
newspaperman. He would have been amused to have been called a
journalist. ``Journalist'' is a high-toned word that leads people
to attend professional journalism conferences and drink wine
instead of beer. Everything considered, I would rather be recalled
as a newspaperman. Anyway, the best ``journalists'' I have known
over a semi-pro and professional print career of 40-odd years have
been newspapermen. And, to be politically incorrect, some of those
excellent newspapermen were women.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unforgettable moments. As when Cope Routh, an
old-school police reporter, came into the office in Midland years
ago with the verdict from a trial he was covering. ``The jury,'' he
announced, ``said it wasn't rape because when he and she went
through the hotel lobby and upstairs to their room, she was the one
carrying the case of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Now I will be an ex-newspaperman instead of an old
newspaperman. I remember a joke about an old newspaperman who had
to get a second job because there wasn't much money in old
newspapers. It's true _ there wasn't. I suppose the big advantage
about being called journalists instead of newspapermen is that the
pay gradually improved, even if the spelling didn't.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know when it's time to retire? I could say it's when
you realize you have shoes older than most of your co-workers. But
that's not really true.
</P>
<P>
   I'm retiring because it's a good time to go. Because there are
other things I want to do, even though I have enjoyed most of what
I've been doing. Because I look forward to not waking to an alarm
clock. Because it gets discouraging interviewing aspiring
politicians. And even more discouraging interviewing established
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am fascinated with what American antiques tell us
about our heritage. Because I enjoy the hunt through Pennsylvania
or Maine for the wily pewter cupboard or the elusive Windsor
settee. Because I like to explore America and there isn't enough
time if your editorial-writing job means you are spending 48 weeks
a year thinking high-minded thoughts about great issues. There are
a jillion reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it's because there are other things I want to do
before I admit that my get-up-and-go has gotten up and went. I've
already spent two lifetimes in this business _ one as a
sportswriter and one over here on the opinion pages. That's plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as I sit here in my rocker watching my co-workers, I
wish I had those younger journalists' feel for technology. I also
wish they had the experience of editing with soft-lead pencils and
glue pots and venturing into an inky composing room filled with
turtles, chases, Linotypes and hungover printers. See, when I
started working on newspapers in the 1950s, the technology _ and
the printers _ had barely changed since the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   In most ways, newspapers are better now than when I started.
Certainly most papers (including this one) are now more reflective
of the entire communities they endeavor to serve. In other ways,
they may be less good than they used to be. I take neither the
credit nor the blame for any of that.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left is to say, ``Thirty,'' which is pre-computer,
``gimme rewrite,'' cigarette-butts-mashed-on-wooden-floors
newspaper talk for that's all there is, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Everything considered, it's been fun.

   TAKE-BOS  
 HONG KONG: ... Chinese businesses.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is so cynical. Peter Churchhouse, managing director
of Morgan Stanley's Hong Kong office, gives China high marks for
its conduct. He argues that Beijing has not interfered in Hong Kong
and has been supportive of its right to run its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries
and a member of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's Cabinet, says
Beijing never has tried to influence any meeting he attended. ``If
anything, we have more protests and more freedoms today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Beijing has scored fairly high marks across the political
spectrum for leaving Hong Kong alone, the local government has been
given failing grades.
</P>
<P>
   David Zweig, a politics professor at Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology, says it is difficult to rate Hong Kong
leaders when they have had to cope with a spate of disasters _ from
the economic crash to a mysterious bird flu, from poisoned ice
cream to poisoned fish, from a mad cow scare to an arsenic spill on
the street. ``It's like trying to give a report card to a student
when the school walls have collapsed, his computer is
malfunctioning, and his pencils are breaking,'' Zweig said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to keep track of all the demonstrations in front of
Government House these days, and citizens are demanding that the
Hong Kong government be accountable even for things it cannot
control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors whose brokers went bankrupt want compensation.
Homebuyers who put their life savings in down payments now cannot
get mortgages because of the collapsed real estate market. Chicken
vendors and fishermen want reimbursement for their financial losses
from the bird flu and the red tide disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The government and big business ``don't care about us _ the
common people, the poor _ and they are unable to come up with any
solution to ease the crisis,'' complained C. Cheung, a 45-year-old
hawker protesting his lost down payment one recent afternoon.
``They are just corrupt and impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how did a civil service so highly esteemed before the
transfer sink so low?
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Lo, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong,
suggests that locals and colonial officials ``exaggerated the
competence of the civil service'' to reassure people that
everything would be the same after the handover. ``But now they
cannot turn to expatriate officers for crisis decision-making, and
they themselves seem to be quite indecisive,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped that the government has been caught napping,
flip-flopping, or simply clueless during numerous crises this year.
</P>
<P>
   The health secretary was on vacation at the height of the bird
flu. When the territory's chickens were slaughtered, at least
hundreds escaped the ax or were disposed of unhygienically. The
financial secretary gave the economy an A+ when it was the weakest
it has been in years. He declared that Hong Kong would enjoy 3.5
percent growth, and then revealed the next week it would contract 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month (June), after vowing to proceed with government land
sales despite pressure to restrict them, officials canceled the
auction a day before it was to happen.
</P>
<P>
   After the handover ``the civil service was supposed to take
front and center and political parties were supposed to fade away.
But just the opposite has happened,'' said Michael DeGolyer,
director of the transition project. ``The civil service went to its
offices and fell asleep ... while politicians who campaigned on
populist issues won big in the May elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling has been the seven-party coalition of
democratic and pro-Beijing parties formed to pressure the Hong Kong
government to improve its performance with the economy. The
coalition controls 48 of 60 legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that if you just shut up and make money, there's
no need for democracy,'' DeGolyer said. But the plummeting economy
brought together former legislative rivals and helped push voter
turnout an astonishing 50 percent higher than it was for the last
elections under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a retooled electoral system that favors small parties
and business groups, the territory's popular Democratic Party
managed to secure the same percentage of votes it did in 1995. Yet
even after winning two-thirds of the votes cast for directly
elected posts, pro-democracy candidates were rewarded with only
one-third of the seats under the redesigned system.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Beijing Liberal Party won nine seats with just 1,300
votes for seats held by special interest groups. The Democrats,
meanwhile, elected nine people with 633,000 direct, geographic
votes.
</P>
<P>
   And so what do those who warned of the worst say now? A year
ago, Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most famous democrat, said he didn't
think he would be jailed after the handover, but he couldn't be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today my answer is exactly the same,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I can say things to you and not be put in jail because
of the law. But the law can be changed. ... The system works when
the pendulum swings to the left in China, and they still allow us
freedoms when they tighten up on the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many people like Mary Chan, 55, a retired office
clerk, who believe that ``China is more free now'' and who hope
that Hong Kong will over time influence mainland China, rather than
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is time. ``We still have 588 months to go for the
50-year pledge'' by China, said Liu, the editor. ``Please let's
keep a long horizon.''

A YEAR LATER, HONG KONG'S WORST FEARS GO UNREALIZED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ One year since doomsayers predicted the fall of Hong
Kong after its return to Chinese rule last July 1, David Chu wanted
fearmongers to eat their words _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   At his ``I Told You So'' party two days ago, the pro-Beijing
legislator triumphantly carved a cake decorated to ape the Fortune
magazine cover that prophesied ``The Death of Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics here has turned out better than anybody's
predictions,'' said Chu, 54, a Shanghai native who moved to
Bedford, Mass., as a teenager and spent 15 years in the Boston area
before settling in Hong Kong. ``The transition was peaceful. There
is freedom of expression. The press was recently rated one of the
freest in Asia. For once, we're proud of everything being the same
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is breaking out the champagne for the one-year
anniversary Wednesday. Albert Chan, a pro-democracy politician,
expects to be picketing somewhere _ although he admits it may be
over the economy, not politics. Even so, he added, ``There's no
reason to celebrate ... there's still no democracy here.''
</P>
<P>
   One year into the experiment in ``one country, two systems'' _
the vow by China to let free-wheeling Hong Kong rule itself and
keep its capitalist system for at least 50 years _ Beijing
generally appears to have honored its promise.
</P>
<P>
   No Chinese troops have marched through the streets. No local
politicians or dissidents have been imprisoned. No presses have
been shut down. No limits have been put on the free flow of
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing did, however, dissolve Hong Kong's elected legislature
and limit the voting franchise before allowing new elections. And
questions have arisen over judicial fairness following a few
controversial decisions, such as exempting the Chinese government
from Hong Kong laws, as Britain &UR;  &LR; had been exempted under colonial
law.
</P>
<P>
   But even China's critics admit that the worst evil to strike has
not been any move by the Beijing government, but the unexpected
blow of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, a former legislator, says that if he had been asked a year
ago what he would be demonstrating about today, he would have
replied, ``Human rights and political repression, no question.''
Instead, he was marching through downtown during a recent lunch
break with a megaphone, banners, and 100 placard-bearing followers
furious over the collapse of the economy and the Hong Kong
government's perceived incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Many pre-handover predictions, both good and bad, have been
proved wrong. A Cantonese expression often heard these days _ ``dai
deed ngan gang,'' or ``we dropped our spectacles'' _ refers to the
shock among Hong Kong people over the surprises of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout in recent elections was huge despite a supposedly
apathetic populace. Democrats dominated the polls despite a system
rigged against them. Demonstrations against China's 1989 crackdown
in Tiananmen Square proceeded without interference.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is suffering the worst unemployment in 15 years and
negative growth for the first time in more than a decade. And the
once-esteemed, British-trained civil service has floundered in the
face of innumerable crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be `Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,'
but now it's Hong Kong people ruining Hong Kong,'' quipped Liu
Kin-ming, opinion page editor of the Hong Kong Economic Times.
These days, his letters-to-the-editor page overflows with rockets
aimed at the local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been slaves so many years and all of a sudden we have
freedom to run ourselves,'' Liu said. ``But it seems we're not so
capable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Hong Kong government's latest opinion survey,
only 32 percent of residents are satisfied with its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking, the Hong Kong Transition Project, a
long-term, multiuniversity study, recently found that 67 percent of
those surveyed are satisfied with the Chinese government, up 22
points since the handover. Only 48 percent are happy with Hong Kong
leaders, down 18 points since a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should not be surprising that Beijing has left Hong
Kong alone. It knew the rest of the world was watching its every
move _ particularly Taiwan, which Beijing wants to regain under the
rubric of ``one country, two systems.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, said David Newman, a politics professor at Lingnan
College and coauthor of ``Red Flag over Hong Kong,'' the Basic Law,
Hong Kong's constitution, enables China ``to keep its hands off
while still achieving its goals.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``You have rigged elections where the Democratic Party
is ensured not to get a majority. You have a chief executive who is
handpicked, not elected'' and who knows what Beijing wants without
having to be told. Newman asserts that China has not interfered
economically _ by buying Hong Kong assets cheaply in exchange for
promises of mainland business favors _ because the financial crisis
has made raising capital difficult for Chinese businesses.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Personal-care products like Rogaine or Retin A are aimed
specifically at a maturing populace, but age is not a big issue
when it comes to marketing fashion to baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the strategy they employ to lure
middle-aged Americans into buying apparel transcends age.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion firms target the baby-boom generation by portraying
their products as fitting a certain lifestyle or state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty once was considered over the hill, but now it is widely
regarded as an age when people are at the peak of their
professional and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   This new attitude is especially appealing to female consumers of
this era, who have broken the stereotype that maturity means a
woman is no longer attractive or desirable.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of fresh self-esteem among the middle-aged is the
target of many fashion firms: They're marketing their products as
part of an aspirational goal _ looking and feeling great,
regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   A brand _ whether it's as generic as Coca-Cola or has the
distinct cachet of Calvin Klein _ is often what compels consumers
to buy a bra, dress, suit or pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the power of a brand, targeting baby boomers _
generally defined as people born between 1946 and 1964 _ can be a
complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
   While the post-World War II generation can be characterized by
distinct demographic, social and economic traits, baby boomers have
a broad range of lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fashion marketers said they are just as hard to peg as
their junior counterparts, who can range from 13 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   The segment includes boomers still living the disco lifestyle of
the '70s, those who prefer a quiet evening watching ``Seinfeld''
reruns, people dedicated to careers above all else, health
enthusiasts and those who ``shop till they drop'' at
Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   So while baby boomers may be an affluent and appealing target
segment, they also present a challenge to marketers because of the
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some top executives _ a majority of whom are baby
boomers _ had to say about mid-life marketing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Linda J. Wachner, &LR;  president, chairman and chief executive
officer of The Warnaco Group, said, ``I really don't think it's the
consumer as much as it is a state of mind when it comes to baby
boomers. As a matter of fact, I think consumers are sick of being
called baby boomers. It's really about an attitude and a look.
Staying sexy and pretty _ that's what the consumer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wachner's estimation, the image of the glamorous, buffed
supermodel Christy Turlington is a main ingredient of the success
of Warnaco's ads for Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of women out there who don't look like Christy
Turlington, but many certainly want to look like her _ even though
they might not necessarily be young,'' Wachner said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Albert Shapiro, &LR;  vice president of corporate marketing at Liz
Claiborne Inc., stated, ``It's really all about a brand, not an
age. Fashion is all about lifestyle and attitude. I think in order
for fashion products to be successful, they need to have a
lifestyle appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that mature and glamour are relatively
exclusive. In fact, they are very clearly aligned. In part, the
more mature the woman, the more glamorous she is because she has a
sense of style, self-confidence and sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro noted that the ad campaigns for Liz Claiborne are
``distinguished to have universal appeal,'' and do not target
younger or older consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we selected Niki Taylor for our campaign,'' he
said. ``She's very appealing and approachable. We did consumer
focus groups with our ads, and compared her with other
possibilities. She does not turn people away. She represents the
Liz Claiborne attitude and lifestyle, regardless of age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kenneth Zimmerman, &LR;  chairman and ceo of Kenar Enterprises,
said, ``We merchandise for a modern mind _ whether it's career or
casual. We use Linda Evangelista in our ads because she's a woman
in her 30s, not a girl. Kenar is addressing the real world. In our
ads, we show clothes for the woman with a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenar is about lifestyle and looking good. If you walk into my
Madison Avenue or East Hampton shops, my customers include three
generations, ranging from 21-year-olds to 40 and 70-year-olds,''
Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48. I have a son who's 20, and I feel as young as him. He
borrows my clothes and I sometimes borrow his jeans. I think a lot
of people in America think like that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said he has taken the message of fashion one step
further by addressing two hot-button issues: breast-cancer
awareness and pediatric AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign for early detection of breast cancer is targeted at
the baby boomer who buys Kenar; the other ad for pediatric AIDS is
aimed at a younger woman who most likely has young children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers _ young and old _ are concerned about these
issues,'' Zimmerman said. ``We want them to know we are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barry Boyd, &LR;  executive vice president of the Hanes and Hanes
Her Way megabrands at Sara Lee Knits, noted, ``Our strategy
definitely is about brand, not age. Our brands are as generic as
Coca-Cola. And they have very broad, public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have customers who are older, younger and people
in-between. We are very aware of demographics and age trends.
However, a lot of ad agencies today tend to think very young _ too
young. I try to discourage that. The 50-year-old of today is very
different from the 50-year-old of yesterday. She's far more
confident and she doesn't think like her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nancy Friedman, &LR;  vice president of marketing for Slackers, a
men's pants brand at Levi Strauss Co., noted, ``We introduced the
Slackers brand two years ago specifically to meet the needs of male
baby boomers, who are trying to adjust to the casualization and new
dress codes in corporate America. They felt they needed more
options between khakis and suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch has been very successful. The newest ad campaign
will be all about a competitive edge, doing well at work and home,
wanting to be noticed. We chose models in their late 30s _ men who
were not too modely, but nice looking; looks a consumer can relate
to,'' Friedman said. ``We've heard a lot of feedback from women
about doing a line for female baby boomers. That's on the
horizon.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As a worldwide product manager for Chiron Diagnostics Corp.,
Stephanie Wilson travels twice a month from her home in
Massachusetts to cities throughout Europe, Asia, and the United
States. When the chemist actually sits in her East Walpole, Mass.
office, she works 12-hour days and sacrifices her lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Still the career-minded divorcee _ who left her grown son behind
in Cincinnati to take the Chiron job three years ago _ is adamant
about one thing: that she find some time in her busy life to serve
her community _ the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Wilson joined The Links Inc., a community service
group of 10,000 black women from across the United States, Germany,
and the Bahamas whose members include Secretary of Labor Alexis
Herman, Harvard University &UR;  &LR; associate dean for faculty development
in the School of Public Health Deborah Prothrow-Stith, and
BankBoston's First Community Bank president Gail Snowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come live in a community and not give back,'' says
Wilson, who manages to dedicate 20 hours a month to the Links, even
if it means dropping off mailings at the post office at 7 a.m. ``I
got that from my parents. Just because you're successful doesn't
mean you can sit on your laurels. ... We have to help those who
didn't have the benefit of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson isn't alone in her thinking. This week, more than 3,000
Links and their families have joined her for a biennial national
assembly _ the first one in Boston since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these women aren't just talking about community
service. As professional black women in a sometimes isolating white
society, the Links have come together for a few days to experience
feelings of sisterhood and cultural commonality, affirmation, and
belonging. After a four-day networking frenzy where personal
achievements are being shared and phone numbers exchanged, they
hope to return home rejuvenated by what will essentially be a
massive group hug from women like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us work in environments where we don't get an
opportunity to interact with women of color on a daily basis,''
says Colette Phillips, a Link who owns the public relations firm
Colette Phillips Communications in Needham. ``As a businesswoman,
it can be a very lonely existence. A lot of Links are professional
women who understand the stresses and the challenges of being a
black professional in the workplace. We can be supportive of each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Patricia Hardiman Long, a lawyer and Link who is running
for Congress against Edward Markey, ``This is a form of networking
in the black community that has become very important to people
like us who live in the suburbs. African-Americans are in need of
forums in which to express their ideas and celebrate their
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   For the out-of-towners staying here this week at five downtown
Boston hotels it's doubtful the conference will disappoint.
Wednesday the famous Boys Choir of Harlem is scheduled to entertain
at the Marriott, and Thursday has been billed as the ``night with
the stars.'' Singer Melba Moore and Harvard religion and philosophy
professor Cornel West are a few of the high-profile types expected
to arrive for a black-tie dinner at the Marriott. Friday night is
the White Rose Banquet where all 3,000 Links will wear white
evening gowns in ballrooms at two hotels.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all over, the Links say a slew of unofficial
post-convention parties will kick off on Martha's Vineyard,
starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It took three years to plan this lineup, and more than 100 Links
from three Massachusetts chapters were involved. Audrey Coleman,
the convention general chairwoman, sometimes worked eight hours in
the evening after her job as director of comprehensive school
planning for the Boston Public Schools. She hosted committee
meetings at her house and attended planning sessions. ``We're one
of the smallest clusters in the history of Linkdom to host a
convention,'' she explains. ``We were limited as far as woman
power.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Links, who define themselves as a service organization,
weren't focused only on the conference these last few years. The
Middlesex, Mass. chapter recently gave $10,000 in college
scholarships and $8,000 to a women's shelter. The Boston chapter
gave $15,000 in college scholarships and provided ongoing mentoring
at a Boston elementary school. Both chapters also hosted a joint
walk for hunger.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of projects translate into about 12 hours of work a
month for Links such as Long, who sometimes wonders ``Why do I do
these things? How do I get myself involved?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, she believes, stems from her childhood. ``My
grandfather was a minister, my father a college professor, and my
mother a homemaker who did a lot of volunteer work. ... That was
the life of my parents, and it was the model given to me as a
child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When Long moved to Lexington, Mass. from Kansas City, Mo., in
1970, she met four other black women in the area who were restless
and feeling isolated. ``Several of us were in graduate school. We
had families and we were looking for an outlet outside of the
family,'' she says. ``We were looking for a connection and a
closeness among women, black women in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   After the women organized the Middlesex chapter in 1976, they
started hosting events like book signings and receptions. That led
to aggressive fund raising. In the chapter's 22-year history, its
members _ now 38 strong _ have raised about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing about Linkdom _ as its members like to call it _
is how it permeates lives. Long says six out of eight members of
her bridge club are Links. Ruth Fitch, a Link and partner at Palmer
&AMP; Dodge LLP in Boston, remembers hearing stories about the Links as
a child after her aunt joined in the 1950s. Coleman says 12 out of
50 members of her local sorority are Links.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Links are also touched by the group. Husbands
are called Connecting Links and children Heir-O-Links. A number of
Boston Connecting Links are playing host to visiting men this week,
taking them to area golf courses, tennis courts, and tourist areas
while their wives meet during the day. Heir-O-Links are being
entertained at various tourist sites such as Plimoth Plantation and
the JFK Library.
</P>
<P>
   In the black community, the Links is considered an exclusive
organization, partly because its membership includes judges,
doctors, TV personalities, and high-profile entrepreneurs. Most
members are well established in their careers or in their
communities and they typically range in age from about 35 to over
70. Often, entire families are members. Bennie Wiley, the president
and chief executive of The Partnership (a networking and support
organization for black professionals) is a Boston Link. Her sister,
Sharon Pratt Kelly _ the former mayor of Washington _ is a Link in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Links were founded in 1946 by two Philadelphia women _
Margaret Hawkins and Sarah Scott _ who felt that in the aftermath
of World War II, the black community was in need of support via
services for youth, exposure to the arts, and fund-raising for
health care and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have criticized the group, based in Washington, for
being downright snooty: you don't join, you're invited to join.
Donna Levy Wray, a Link spokeswoman, says, ``We were organized at a
time when that's the way things were done. ... Fifty-two years ago,
we didn't have the Internet.'' The Links haven't changed their
policy because ``we haven't found a need,'' says Wray. ``We're
growing, reaching out to African-American women all over this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that the group is getting things done. Even
during the event-packed convention this week, the Links are finding
time for community service. Monday, Judge Joyce London Alexander, a
Boston Link, taught some Boston-area kids about the importance of
responsible citizenship. Harvard's Stith talked to them about
controlling anger, and another Link stressed to the kids the
importance of reading books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a child being driven to Mississippi to hear a
concert by Leontyne Price,'' says Wilson, who grew up in a
segregated community in Mobile, Ala. ``We (the Links) feel as
adults we have to give back just as much. ... I'm a very busy
person. I travel a lot. But I never say no. You make a way. You can
do something. There's always something you can do.''

 &HT;    ``I WILL NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT,'' HILLARY CLINTON TELLS CHINESE
SCHOOLGIRL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Students at a Chinese girls high school threw frank
questions at Hillary Rodham Clinton Tuesday, and the first lady
opened up with candor she seldom allows back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton, we are all very interested to know if you will
run for president,'' said one student at the elite Shanghai No. 3
Girls School. ``And do you think the American people will have a
woman president in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I will not run for president,'' said Mrs. Clinton, a
smile spreading across her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do hope that a woman will run and be elected president
sometime in the early part of the next century....If I agree with
her politically, I will vote for her. If I do not agree with her
politically, I will not vote for her, but I will be very proud that
she is running for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps one of you will be in that position,'' she said. ``I
will be happy to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student asked Mrs. Clinton if she feels there is a
``generation gap'' between her and her daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially hard to see daughters grow up and leave,''
answered Mrs. Clinton. ``When my daughter left to go to Stanford,
it was all the way across the country from Washington _ she
couldn't have gone any further without falling into the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard on her father and me, but at the same time,
we were so proud that she was so independent and able to take care
of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Mrs. Clinton think about single-sex education, another
teenager asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Wellesley College, outside Boston, Mass., and I am
very happy I did that,'' the first lady answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think girls schools are a very good opportunity for many
young women, if that is what they choose. Now my daughter did not
want to go to a girls college....She made a different choice.
Despite my encouragement of her to look at my own college, so I
think it is an individual matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And then a question about whether Mrs. Clinton knew how to use
chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as a student, I used to eat a lot of Chinese food,'' Mrs.
Clinton said. ``I am not expert in using chopsticks, but I can get
most of the food into my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, the last six days in China have proved an
engaging, animated interlude where she could talk about her
favorite big issues, from childrens health to women's rights,
without risking questions about Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With the American media being kept at a safe distance, the first
lady has seemed to relish opening herself to the kind of polite,
yet highly personal queries that she has received from many of her
Chinese questioners.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was typical of her China itinerary. The first lady began
her day by joining the president in a round-table discussion at the
new Shanghai Library.
</P>
<P>
   What does Mrs. Clinton really feel, asked Chinese novelist Wang
Xiaoying, about having her every ``gesture or word'' become the
object of media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel some kind of restriction on your movement or
impact on your personal life?'' pressed Mrs. Wang. ``Is there any
difference when you were not the first lady, for example, as a
wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton answered: ``I often refer to my life before the
White House as when I was a real person, because when you are in a
position like this, people, particularly all those people with
their pencils and their cameras, try to record everything you do
and then they try to put meaning into it _ whether you intend the
meaning or not. So it is a very unusual experience . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the president headed off to a Shanghai radio call-in
show, the first lady led her own 25-car motorcade to Shanghai's
Pudong district.
</P>
<P>
   First she opened a new high-tech Shanghai children's hospital,
then she visited a women's job retraining center.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, she joined the president and daughter Chelsea for lunch
at a Chinese restaurant. Later, Chelsea stayed with her father for
some downtown sightseeing while Mrs. Clinton's motorcade sped off
to her Q and A session at the Shanghai No. 3 Girls School.
</P>
<P>
   The school's 2,000 students are admitted through competitive
tests. Many of those in the audience were conversant enough with
English that they could react to the first lady's responses even
before they were translated.

   CORRECTION TO WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding
this transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The following is a correction to last week's
vote chart regarding the ``IRSREFORM'' bill. The chart shows how
house representatives voted on the IRS reform bill. A ``Y'' means
the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRSREFORM
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 402-8, to pass an IRS overhaul and tax
bill. The measure would establish a citizens' oversight panel and
increase taxpayer rights in collection disputes with the IRS.
Supporters said the bill would protect taxpayers from any abuse
from the tax agency. Opponents objected to a measure that shortens
the capital gains holding period from 18 months to 12 months to
escape financial penalties, calling it a tax break for the wealthy.
A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

RENO ERRED BIGTIME IN HANDLING THE LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- To arange the scenery properly for Linda Tripp
Week, it helps to know a few things about Attorney General Janet
Reno's slipshod handling of this entire mess in January, confirmed
by past and present associates:
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general made no effort to inquire into the content
of the Tripp-Monica Lewinsky tape recordings made in the months
before Tripp was wired by the independent counsel's office for one
last recording on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general, moreover, made no serious effort to
inquire into that final, roughly 90-minute tape _ neither its
content nor circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   _She also did nothing to check Kenneth Starr's claim in his
request for jurisdiction in the Lewinsky matter that there was an
overlap between people caught up in it and in other subjects he was
investigating that involved (Reno's words) ``possible efforts to
influence witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general was (pick one) bullied, intimidated, or
threatened by Starr and his people into making a snap decision. By
telling her that Newsweek was preparing an article on the Tripp
tapes, they were telling Reno that if she did not give them the
case, Newsweek would be reporting a sensational sex and coverup
story along with her refusal to let an independent counsel
investigate it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Starr and Reno had a private meeting. No details
available, but one hopes she is finally getting serious about
Starr's having played her like a violin.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, an issue that goes to the heart of the case,
or to its official origin. The one refrain always heard from
Starr's office and its Republican and journalistic amen corner as
the rookie prosecutor's credibility and behavioral problems mount,
is that his investigation was based upon the determination of the
attorney general herself.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. It was not a determination by a fact-finding
gatekeeper, it was paper shuffling along an automated transmission
belt. The stupid law under which independent counsels operate has
many, much-discussed flaws, but it has no chance at all of ever
working properly unless the attorney general performs the tasks
assigned that office with far more diligence than Reno has shown.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, one of the least accurate sentences in the
entire Lewinsky so-called investigation was made by the AG at the
top of her jurisdiction-expanding petition to the allegedly
supervising US Court of Appeal panel here on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In accordance with the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act
of 1994, I hereby notify in writing the special division of the
court that I have commenced a preliminary investigation ... into
whether violations of federal criminal law were committed by Monica
Lewinsky or any other individual, as described below.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``preliminary investigation'' consists in Reno's petition
of nothing beyond the Jan. 14 tape of Tripp, wearing the FBIs wire,
and Lewinsky. And, in fact, it did consist of nothing beyond that,
which means there was no such investigation at all.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been, she might have learned that the tapes Tripp
herself made of Lewinsky consist of a variety of conflicting tales,
none of them bearing directly on obstruction of justice, and all of
them raising questions about just who was suborning whose perjury;
she might also have learned, had she inquired, more about how the
final tape came about, particularly how Tripp was scripted by
Starr's office to elicit alleged obstruction comments regarding
Vernon Jordan that have yet to receive an ounce of direct
corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, Reno associates note that she was at least
exposed to Monica Lewinsky's words that she intended to lie when
deposed in the Paula Jones case, that she was urging Tripp to lie,
and that Reno had an obvious conflict there because the Jones case
involved President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No sale. The whole idea of the independent counsel law is that
its trigger must be credible evidence, which is subverted if there
no serious effort to assess credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, perfunctory or no examination makes an attorney general
vulnerable to the presentation of a slanted or edited case. At this
point, given what he knew and didn't know in January, Starr's
presentation to Reno resembled the cut and paste job Representative
Dan Burton's slimy aide, David Bossie, did on Webster Hubbell's
prison tapes this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Reno's response didn't ask for what Starr didn't tell.

MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN RECALLED AS MOTHER, FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY MARTINEAU  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Maureen O'Sullivan played many roles during her
acting career. But it was her role as a mother that mourners
remembered as family members carried her coffin down the steps of
the St. Mary of the Angels Chapel at Siena College here.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, who played Tarzan's Jane three generations ago, died
last week in Scottsdale, Ariz., at age 87. Her six children,
including actress Mia Farrow, and two dozen grandchildren and
great-grandchildren were among the 80 family members and close
friends who attended Monday's funeral service. Following the solemn
90-minute ceremony, O'Sullivan was buried at Most Holy Redeemer
Cemetery in nearby Niskayuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my mother and my best friend,'' Farrow said in her
eulogy. The actress tearfully left the chapel holding a child on
each arm. O'Sullivan's son John Farrow also spoke. He recalled the
time as a little boy, when he bought his mother a flower in Spain
for her birthday. He said he was amazed when 15 years later his
mother pulled the same flower from her Bible where she had
preserved the gift all those years.
</P>
<P>
   One of O'Sullivan's friends lingered on the chapel steps long
after the hearse and nine-car funeral procession had pulled away.
``She was able to have a career and a very large family at the same
time,'' said Judy Lynch of Schenectady, N.Y., who became friendly
with O'Sullivan in 1983, when O'Sullivan married her second
husband, James Cushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the children came she just bowed out of acting. When the
children grew up she went back to acting, in New York City, on the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hugh Hines delivered the funeral homily. Hines awarded
O'Sullivan an honorary fine arts degree from Siena College in 1983
and performed the ceremony when O'Sullivan married Cushing that
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, a movie buff, said he became fascinated with O'Sullivan
in the 1950s, thanks to the many afternoons he spent watching the
``Tarzan'' movies, among others. Decades later, he met the actress
through Cushing, then her fiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out for breakfast and I sat there agog,'' he recalled.
``I couldn't believe it was her.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hines and O'Sullivan became friends. One night,
he said, he arrived at her house with plans to go to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to the door and said, `We've decided to stay home.
I'm cooking.' I said, `I didn't know you could cook.' She said,
`Father, I've had seven children.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those children, and especially their children, cried
uncontrollably during the funeral service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the glue that held the family together,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, O'Sullivan's son Michael Farrow died in a plane crash.
Her husband, screenwriter and director John Farrow, died in 1963.
Hines attributed her strength in overcoming those obstacles to her
``Irish faith.''

   In addition to dozens of family members, O'Sullivan leaves a
legacy of films: ``Anna Karenina'' and ``Cardinal Richelieu'' from
1935; ``Pride and Prejudice,'' 1940; and 1948's ``The Big Clock,''
directed by her husband, John Farrow.

THE PAST, THE FUTURE AND TEXAS DEMOCRATS

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ So I'm walking out of the Alamodome the other day,
and I run into former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' Wright inquires.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say it in a hostile way. He was genuinely curious as
to why an inveterate Democrat-baiting, liberal-bashing character
like me would be hanging around a convention of the Texas
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, would you believe I just wanted to spend a few days in San
Antonio to get away from the relentless heat in North Texas? Going
into the weekend, the local prognosticators here weren't even
expecting the temperature to hit 100 during the Democrats' two-day
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say, of course: It isn't the heat _ it's the
humidity. They use the word ``muggy'' in the weather reports around
these parts, which is a concise way of saying that if you plan to
do much walking in San Antonio, be sure to take along a canteen and
a towel.
</P>
<P>
   A person can get soaked just soaking up the history in the Alamo
City. If Democrats wanted to spend the weekend reveling in bygone
days of glory, they came to the right place. The little
mission/fort on Alamo Plaza stands as the Lone Star State's
proudest memorial to Texas courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat ironic that the Democrats should convene in this
bastion of state history, for it was the state's Republican Party
that vowed earlier this month to ``change the course of Texas
history'' with its conservative political and social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   During their convention in Fort Worth, the Republicans predicted
that they would sweep to victory in the November elections,
capturing every statewide office on the ballot and seizing control
of the state House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meeting within walking distance of the Alamo,
seemed less intent on changing the course of Texas history than on
preserving some small place in that history for their party and
their ideology.
</P>
<P>
   They came to town touting their ``1998 Strong Families Agenda,''
a Clintonesque platform emphasizing education, health care and
child care. Sure, it worked for Bill Clinton in '92 and '96, but
don't forget: Clinton lost Texas in both those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Wright pointed out that more Democrats than Republicans voted in
this year's party primaries. That proves, he said, that there are
still plenty of Democrats in Texas, notwithstanding the GOP's
astounding growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can win elections, Wright said, if ``we can get people
excited, get them out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the rub, especially in a year when the election for
governor shapes up as a mismatch _ a mismatch so monumental that
Democrat Garry Mauro must feel a bit like the 180-plus defenders of
the Alamo felt when they peeked across the walls and saw Santa Anna
and his thousands of soldiers bearing down on them.
</P>
<P>
   Travis and Crockett and the rest put up a gallant fight back in
1836, but they never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The coming months will tell us how gallant Mauro might be, but
last weekend's optimistic rhetoric couldn't change reality: Mauro
trails incumbent Republican Gov. George W. Bush in some polls by
more than 50 points. And the challenger is showing no signs of
closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with Mauro as a candidate. He's dynamic,
energetic and as personable as you could ask a politician to be.
But Mauro is trying to sell a new car to voters who are pleased as
punch with the car they have.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro would like us to believe that Bush's first term was a
train wreck of misdirection and broken promises, but the truth is
exactly the opposite. Bush kept virtually every promise he made
when he ran four years ago. Most Texans consider him a terrific
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the whole problem with Democrats in 1998 is that they are
trying to sell something that voters don't want and don't need. The
Democrats' best ideas these days are the ones they steal from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Here in San Antonio, the Democrats were immersed in Texas
history. But the state's future seems to be slipping away from
them.

TECHNOLOGY BOOMLET ENERGIZING MAINE'S ECONOMY

<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ It's not just about paper, shoes, and lobsters
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is undergoing one of the most profound changes in its
economic history. Long dependent on textiles, logging, and fishing,
Maine is enjoying a boomlet driven by the sorts of things that
people ``from away'' associate more with Route 128 than
Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   A major computer-chip manufacturer recently expanded its
operations in South Portland. Statewide, 5,000 telephone jockeys
sell everything from Red Sox credit cards to European rental cars.
Biotechnology is now worth more than the lobstering and potato
industries combined. And Maine's top international export last year
was not lobsters, Bass shoes, or paper products _ it was electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Moody's is questioning if we have a diversified economy.
Ha!'' state treasurer Dale McCormick says of the bond-rating
company that recently reviewed Maine's financial situation for
money borrowing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maine suffered with the rest of New England during the recession
of the late 1980s. But by the spring of 1997, state officials said,
it had regained all of the 35,000 jobs it lost, and since then, has
added 5,000 more. Since January 1990, the state's nonagricultural
employment has grown by 6.7 percent, according to the US Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's resurgence, impressive as it is, has been outpaced by
New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts, whose nonagricultural
jobs this decade have grown by 12.8 percent, 8.4 percent, and 7.7
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But emerging in Maine, perhaps more than elsewhere in New
England, are economic shifts that could neutralize the state's
geographic isolation, long seen as an impediment to economic
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer at the end of the line,'' says Governor Angus
S. King Jr., the popular Independent who has preached the gospel of
economic development from Kittery to Calais.
</P>
<P>
   That optimism seems to ring true outside the state as well.
Despite any questions Moody's may have had, Maine's bond rating was
upgraded recently for the first time since 1982, enabling it to get
a favorable interest rate on money it borrows.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Maine has prospered so neatly from the recent
economic upswing. Although the unemployment rate in Cumberland
County, the hub of Maine's economy, is a statewide-low 2.1 percent,
Washington County on the Canadian border lags with 9.1 percent of
its population out of work.
</P>
<P>
   And while Maine as a whole has recovered from the recession, job
growth in most of the state's 16 counties has not nearly kept pace
with Cumberland and York in the south. Between 1990 and 1996,
according to state economist Laurie Lachance, more than 10,000 jobs
were created in Maine _ and 8,000 of those were in Cumberland
County, which includes the city of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   King does not like to use the term, ``the two Maines,'' but he
acknowledges the division exists. And how to narrow the gap between
rural and suburban Maine is as difficult a question as it has ever
been. &UR;  &LR; ``It's the most serious economic issue we have,'' King says
of the imbalance in wealth and jobs. ``It's why I decided to run
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aroostook County, for example, more than 10,000 people have
moved away this decade; unemployment is 7.2 percent, or nearly
twice the state average; and longtime residents wonder how they can
persuade their children to stay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While low-paying jobs such as laborers and store clerks are a
hard fact of life for many in remote Maine, the state's coast and
Interstate 95 corridor are bustling. And the jewel of the crown,
the sea-girt city of Portland, fairly glistens.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Port section has been a hot attraction for tourists for
20 years _ and is even hotter now. Its cobblestone streets are
lined with boutiques. Its bars evoke a nostalgic, inviting feel of
maritime New England. And its restaurants rise significantly above
the provincial.
</P>
<P>
   Theater, arts, and sports contribute to the feel of a hip city
on the move. Add to that a jetport, soon-to-be-revived rail service
to Boston, proximity to beaches and mountains, and the city seems
to have it made.
</P>
<P>
   Says Scott Bonney, 36, the former manager of the Old Port
Tavern: ``I've been around the world three times. And from April to
October, there's no better place to be than here. You don't find
these places in America anymore.'' He said many Maine-raised
engineers who fled in search of work are coming back to take
advantage of new opportunities here.
</P>
<P>
   Morten Asbjornsen would agree. Asbjornsen edits Interface
Monthly magazine and directs the Old Port Technology Center, a
recently opened collection of high-tech businesses operating under
one roof in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks who are doing technology can do it anywhere,''
Asbjornsen says. ``And there's no reason to go to Boston or New
York City or California when you can do it in Portland, Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-chip manufacturer National Semiconductor recently
invested $830 million in a new facility in South
Portland. &UR;  &LR; National and its spinoff, Fairchild Semiconductor,
employ more than 2,000 people here. Other major employers include
insurance companies, paper and shoe manufacturers, supermarket
chains, hospitals, and retailers. Bath Iron Works, a defense
contractor, remains the state's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for high-tech workers in Maine now outpaces supply, as it
does in the other New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Griffith runs the Great Moose Lake Corp. in Scarborough, a
recruiting company for high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be: `Come back to Maine! Work twice as hard for
half the pay!''' Griffith said. ``That doesn't happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine has 50,000 miles of fiberoptic cables and sophisticated
switching systems that make its telecommunications infrastructure a
major selling point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can say, with a pretty high level of assurance, that
we have the best telecommunications infrastructure in all of New
England,'' King boasts.
</P>
<P>
   That advantage helps explain why Maine has approximately 5,000
jobs in call centers _ offices where operators handle a company's
telephone work, such telemarketing, catalog sales, technical
support or billing questions _ and recently announced the addition
of 750 more. &UR;  &LR; Another factor may be that wages generally are less
than they are in places like metropolitan Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' King says, ``the call center is the factory of
the '90s.''

BIOGRAPHY FAILS AT GETTING TO KNOW RODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
RICHARD RODGERS 
By William G. Hyland. 
Yale University Press, 362 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hopes that William Hyland did a better job unmasking
espionage operatives than he does in discovering the real Richard
Rodgers. This may seem like an odd subject for Hyland, who worked
for the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council,
and the State Department from 1954 to 1977 _ though readers of le
Carre or of Norman Mailer's ``Harlot's Ghost'' may enjoy concocting
a perverse image of an American spy humming ``Getting to Know You''
as he overthrows a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyland is already the author of a survey history of American
songwriting and has now written a biography of America's great
composer of Broadway melodies that any Rodgers aficionado should
have on hand. It is loaded with good, interesting information about
the tunesmith's progress over the years with Lorenz Hart and Oscar
Hammerstein 2d and does a good, if not unique, job of explaining
why he and his partners were so important to the history of musical
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers himself, however, remains as elusive as ever. Hyland
can't be fully blamed for that. Shortly before he died, Hammerstein
said, ``We've worked together all these years and I don't really
know him.'' Rodgers was apparently a rather ill-formed personality:
The book has many quotes from people who didn't particularly like
him. Stephen Sondheim said Rodgers had ``infinite talent _ but
limited soul.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Hyland is clearly taken with his subject. He is honest
about Rodgers's flaws but enamored of his virtues, particularly his
musical ones. Listening to and reading through the scores has
clearly been an enjoyable task for the author. He seems most turned
on by Rodgers's unapologetic romanticism. At times Hyland is
articulate on the matter: ``Rodgers displayed an affinity for the
traditional centrality of the tonic chord, pure and simple. He once
said that he was suspicious of a songwriter who was afraid of a
strong tonic chord. He risked banality with this traditional
approach, but it imparted a pristine clarity to his melodies. In
Rodgers's hands it was always fresh and compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Hyland writes too dispassionately on
a subject he so obviously feels passionate about. There's an ``And
then he wrote'' quality about the book, which fills in the gaps _
as when ``Allegro'' broke the great R&AMP;H run between ``Oklahoma!''
and ``Carousel'' on the one hand and ``South Pacific'' and ``The
King and I'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But for those not as infatuated with Rodgers as Hyland, the
biography merely bogs down when it should be charging ahead. It's
more difficult to write about what made Rodgers's music unique than
to talk about the lyrics of Hart and Hammerstein, but Hyland's
writing on music made me wish that this had been a CD-ROM with
auditory accompaniment to go along with the sometimes academic
discourses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Richard Rodgers'' is worth the read. People tend to
think of him as a pretty melodist and naive sentimentalist. Hyland
establishes once again that Rodgers, whether working with Hart on
``Pal Joey'' or with Hammerstein on ``Oklahoma!,'' was also one of
the Broadway musical's great innovators.

   ``We got the lights, the darks, the caramels,'' Miranda adds.
</P>
<P>
   Around the table, it's clearly the youth and myriad shades of
color that give life to the participants' faces, music to their
laughter. MYTOWN seeks applicants of various ethnicities, incomes,
schools, and locales. &UR;  &LR;  The push for diversity is fueled by the
need to learn from others, the talk-story that can unite
cultures. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hoang, for example, came to the United States from Vietnam in
the early 1980s when her parents, ethnic Chinese, fled from
persecution. ``I hear stories about me coming here on a boat, I
hear stories of me coming here on a plane,'' recalls Hoang, of
Allston. ``It's hard for my parents to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Through MYTOWN, Hoang can get paid for listening and retelling
those familiar tales of the silenced, the oppressed, and the
triumphant. ``We deal with stories of immigrants, the working
class, people of color, people who don't have a voice,'' she says.
``Their stories are in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the table, the teenagers guard MYTOWN's admission
gates. They hold the keys during the interview process, too. How do
they make the final selection? Says Miranda: ``Oh, we ask the
finalists to bark or sing _''  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Or how they want to die,'' Hoang says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One girl sang, and I just felt it, you know?'' Miranda says.
``It's just flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her distinct, determined flavor that last year secured
Miranda a job at MYTOWN. A lifelong resident of Boston's Roxbury
neighborhood, Miranda started volunteering at 13 for the Dudley
Street Neighborhood Initiative, an &UR;  &LR; example of community action and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Early on she witnessed the struggles often associated with
working-class urban neighborhoods: ``If you grew up in my
community, you would see the drugs and violence. It's just there.
You can't really bypass it. So you can get involved or stand in a
corner and see other people get involved. The more you know, the
farther you'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MYTOWN tours are available by appointment year-round Tuesdays
through Saturdays. Individuals may also attend already scheduled
Saturday tours from noon to 2 p.m. today, July 11, July 18, and
Aug. 8. Sliding fee, from $2.50 to $15 per person. Call (617)
357-TOWN.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEATURED MYTOWN TOUR SITES &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. A. Philip Randolph statue, inside Back Bay station on the Orange
Line. From 1911 to 1963, Randolph helped desegregate the armed
forces, organize the march on Washington and establish a trade
union for Pullman porters _ one of the first black labor
unions. &UR;  &LR; One of few statues in Massachusetts commemorating and
depicting an African American.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. Tent City, corner of Columbus Avenue and Dartmouth Street. In
1968, activist Mel King and nearly 100 others pitched tents on a
vacant lot to protest the need for affordable housing during urban
renewal. &UR;  &LR; The Tent City &UR;  &LR; developers completed building this
affordable apartment complex in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Southwest Corridor Park. This area, a 19th-century railroad
corridor, was designated in the mid-1960s as the site of the
multilane Inner Belt highway and became the focal point of a
decade-long protest by South End residents. After the highway was
scrapped, neighorhood residents ended up with some 50 acres of
parkland, which stretches over and alongside the Orange Line, some
5 miles from the Back Bay subway station through Roxbury and
Jamaica Plain to the Forest Hill station.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Harriet Tubman House, 25 Holyoke St. Julia O. Henson, a friend
of Underground Railroad organizer &UR;  &LR; Harriet Tubman, founded this
residential settlement to accommodate new women migrants from the
South.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe, 429 Columbus Ave. &UR;  &LR; When jazz clubs
burgeoned along this block, it was one of the few places where
black musicians could eat here after their shows. Owner Charlie
Poulos, a Greek immigrant, also allowed Pullman porters to convene
on the second floor of the shop as they began unionizing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Union United Methodist Church, 485 Columbus Ave. This church was
founded in 1818 on Beacon Hill and moved several times before
settling in the South End. It was also a stop on the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. Sparrow Park, off West Newton Street between Columbus Avenue and
Southwest Corridor Park. During construction of this park during
the 1970s, former semi-pro tennis player Titus Sparrow offered to
teach free tennis lessons here once it was finished. Sparrow died
of a heart attack before the park was completed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. Academy of Musical Arts, 547 Columbus Ave. &UR;  &LR; Anna Bobitt-Gardner
founded this studio to provide working-class families with
affordable dance and piano classes. It survived nearly 75 years
before closing this year due to low enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. Wally's Cafe, 427 Massachusetts Ave. Joseph ``Wally'' Walcott
opened this jazz club &UR;  &LR; in 1947. It is Boston's longest
consecutively black-owned business and was a stop on the ``Chitlin'
Circuit,'' a gig tour frequented by Billie Holiday and Erroll
Garner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
10. Former home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 397 Massachusetts
Avenue, two houses next to the Mass. Ave. T stop on the Orange
Line. &UR;  &LR;  King lived in this row house apartment as a theology
graduate student at Boston University. King led 10,000 people in a
march from the Carter Playground to the Boston Commons in 1965,
protesting the racial imbalance in the public schools.

NO X'S AND O'S _ JUST X

<TEXT>
<P>
   At least ESPN has a sense of humor about its X Games.
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman plans to run a spoof later this week. All of the
details are not known. X Game anchor and former Boston sportscaster
Jack Edwards flew to New York to provide voice-over for four skits,
three of which include a laundry mat, a used car, and a rusty razor
blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X Games are perfect for Letterman,'' Edwards said. ``He
probably looks at them as if they were mainstream. Wasn't he the
one dropping bowling balls from four-story buildings?''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is relative. Four years ago, ESPN created the Xtreme
Games, a collection of cutting-edge sports popular among Generation
X. Bungee jumping was one of the sports, but last year, ESPN
eliminated it from the X Games because it had become passe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool'' events remain, including downhill skateboarding,
bicycle tricks, mountain climbing, air surfing, and, of course,
snowboarding. Last weekend, for example, ESPN paid for 360 tons of
snow for its snowboarding competition in, of all places, San Diego.
The events were held early in the morning before the smow melted.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a bit whacky. But the event attracted 225,000 zany
fans over the weekend, and more important, advertisers. Mountain
Dew, Adidas, Taco Bell, and AT&AMP;T were among the corporations that
put up $2 million for on-air spots.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. The X Games attract one of the most
isolated demographics in the country _ teenagers and
twentysomethings. Ratings are still small, but unlike covering the
NFL, where ABC-/ESPN had to pay $900 million to broadcast the
games, the X Games have no rights fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers adore the X Games,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   And ESPN loves the X Games, so much so that when MTV wanted to
compete for a slice of the pie, ESPN produced the X Games concerts,
a series of music features with artists such as No Doubt,
Jamiroquai, U2, Jimi Hendrix, Third Eye Blind, Might Mighty
Bosstones, and Chumbawamba.

</P>
<P>
   ESPN will air the Home Run Derby live from Coors Field during
the 1998 All-Star Game July 7. Chris Berman and Joe Morgan call the
action and are joined by New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza. ESPN
plans to use 17 cameras throughout the two-hour telecast, including
one located in the left-field parking lot. ``Home Run Derby''
earned a rating of 5.7 last year, the highest non-NFL rating
achieved by ESPN ... ``Street &AMP; Smith's Black College Football,''
the only national magazine to exclusively cover the subject, debuts
in September ... CBS will make network history Saturday when it
airs an auto race during prime time _ NASCAR Winston Cup's Pepsi
400 at 8 p.m. Ken Squier hosts coverage from the Daytona
International Speedway. Mike Joy calls the race with analysts Ned
Jarrett and Buddy Baker.

THE OTHER ONES: COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long, diligent rehearsals? They were never a Grateful Dead
trademark, but they define The Other Ones, a new band that brings
together Dead alumni and other latter-day hippies intent on
carrying forth the Dead's legacy with as much respect as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones are headlining the third annual Furthur Festival.
The band has worked up almost 50 Dead songs, including some vintage
catalog numbers the Dead hadn't performed in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the shoulder to the wheel,'' says Bob Weir,
formerly of the Dead. ``We're determined to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rehearsing every day from 11 to 6, and there aren't any
two-hour breaks, like there were in The Grateful Dead,'' says
fellow alum Mickey Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rehearsing longer than we're gigging,'' adds Bruce
Hornsby, an auxiliary member of the Dead since 1990. ``We're doing
six weeks of rehearsals for four weeks of gigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the hard work pay off? Time will tell, but there's no
denying that this is a watershed year in post-Dead history, since
the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995 caused the group to disband.
</P>
<P>
   No one is calling this a reunion, but, percussionist Hart says,
``this is as close as it's going to get. And the spirit is right.''
(The only Dead survivors not participating are drummer Bill
Kreutzmann, who declined to tour, and keyboardist Vince Welnick,
who wasn't invited because the keyboard chair was given to
Hornsby.)
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones are anchored by Weir, Hart, and Hornsby, who have
played in separate bands at the Furthur Festival, such as Weir's
Ratdog and Hart's Planet Drum, before jamming together at the end
of each show. But this year, they're playing only in The Other
Ones, and are boosted by the return of Dead bassist Phil Lesh, who
hasn't toured since Garcia's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil has a completely unique style that makes it easier to go
to those musical places that are Dead-like,'' says Hornsby.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of four new players _ guitarist Steve Kimock from
the band Zero, guitarist Mark Karan from The Rembrandts, drummer
John Molo from Hornsby's solo band, and saxophonist Dave Ellis from
Ratdog _ helps give Deadheads legitimate cause for hope, though no
one pretends that Garcia's void can be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new guitar player is going to take a little heat,'' Weir
says from his car phone in San Francisco. ``But it occurred to us
that having two new guitarists would help dilute the heat. No one
person is going to fill the shoes of old Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to think about it. It would just get in the way
of the music,'' guitarist Karan says. ``There's also a lot of
Internet gossip about who is cooler _ me or Steve (Kimock), but we
just won't go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can take Garcia's place. He was a very individual
player, a very brilliant player, and a social icon,'' adds Karan.
``What this is about is carrying on the tradition of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The final Other Ones lineup came together after a typical bout
of Dead craziness. Another guitarist, Stan Franks (from the David
Murray Octet), was considered, but that didn't pan out. Then a
debate ensued about whether Karan or Kimock would be better; both
were chosen after a jam session revealed their combined, unselfish
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a crazy idea at first to have both of them,
because there was already so much going on in the band,'' says
Hornsby, who adds that the group also considered alternating the
two. ``But it's worked out well. It feels more open with the two of
them. I know that seems impossible, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Karan, 43, grew up in San Francisco and caught nearly 50
Grateful Dead shows as a youth, in such places as the Fillmore West
and Golden Gate Park. So he knew the band's material.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of my friends used to call me `Baby Hippie,''' says
Karan, who once saw the Dead play on a flatbed truck in
Haight-Ashbury and was even photographed on the ``Live Dead'' album
cover. ``I'm in the picture if you look closely,'' says Karan, who
has played with the Dave Mason Band, Delaney Bramlett, and Sophie
B. Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   For his audition, Karan was a nervous wreck. ``I don't do well
in auditions. I'm not what they call a `Yo!' cat. I don't schmooze
and work the room well. At many auditions, there's a sense of
secrecy and a weird vibe. But the Dead audition couldn't be further
from that. There was no secret, Machiavellian BS going on. I met
everybody and had a sandwich and started playing. Then I looked up
and realized who I was playing with. I thought, `Hey, wait a
minute. These are the guys I grew up listening to.'''
</P>
<P>
   The audition included jams of the Dead's ``Truckin','' ``Friend
of the Devil,'' ``The Other One,'' and ``Playin' in the Band.''
Says Karan: ``It took a while to get used to the freedom in this
group, but I've always loved real stretchy bands like the Dead, The
Allman Brothers, and Quicksilver Messenger Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the surprise of Kimock, 42, joining after the
rehearsals started. ``Steve and I are old friends,'' Karan says.
``We greeted each other, he unpacked his guitar, and we started
playing. Stylistically, we're different, but we both have the
influence of Jerry's playing. Steve is probably a more trained
player. I'm more raw, more intuitive. But the gist of what goes on
here is pretty loose. Nobody is a testosterone-filled 20-year-old
with a lot to prove. We're all just into the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the music. ``I expect deep grooves mixed with a lot of
love, a lot of spice, and a lot of fun,'' says Hart. ``There's
growth left in everybody _ and there's a new hunger. You just can't
go out and expect it to happen. You have to have a deep hunger to
bring it up to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the new guys have been chosen for their talent, and in The
Grateful Dead, that's very specific,'' he adds. ``You have to be
able to change and morph and be quick on your feet. And you have to
be kind, and love what you do, and listen to your brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart also plans a new series of ``drums and space'' jams with
Molo, much like Hart used to do with Kreutzmann. ``Molo and I have
a lot of chemistry. ... We played a lot at the jams during the
earlier Furthur Festivals. He's conscious. He listens. We're after
the feeling. We're not after virtuoso playing. It's not the notes.
It's what's in between them that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones will play some new songs, such as Weir's ``Banyan
Tree'' and ``Lao Tzu Blues.'' But there will be many Dead rarities,
too. Among them are ``Saint Stephen,'' ``The Eleven,'' and
``Mountains of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to balance it out by doing classics and yet still
have fun with the new stuff,'' says Weir. ``And we're looking at 2
1/2-hour sets. We're going to take our shoes off and get real
comfy.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about further into the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're still practicing the left-foot-right-foot method
here,'' says Weir. ``But the plan is to re-cord the last two gigs
and beyond that, chances are that we'll take it to the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of encouragement. But we've still got to
get out and produce the magic.''

FILM FESTIVAL A FIRST FOR MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film festivals have been popping up throughout the country, and
the world. Now, Maine will be holding its first International Film
Festival July 10 through 19 in Waterville, a small city in central
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will feature at least 40 American and international
films with several having their premiere at the festival. ``The one
thing everyone involved in this project has in common is that we
enjoy going to the movies and seeing good films,'' said project
director Joan Phillips-Sandy. Ken Eisen, one of those who selected
the films to be shown, added, ``The festival is going to offer
everyone a sense of discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Films will be shown at the Railroad Square Cinema, an art house
since 1978, and the 940-seat historic Waterville Opera House (``a
wonderful reminder of the kind of theater where movies used to be
shown,'' said Phillips-Sandy).
</P>
<P>
   Among features of the festival is a look at ``Maine in the
Movies'' and the opportunity for visitors to spend time with the
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best parts of the festival is that it gives visitors
a chance to discover the vacation opportunities of the central
lakes area of the state. Special four- and seven-day vacation
packages are being offered that include white-water rafting,
canoeing, hiking, and other activities. For information, call
800-393-8629. For information on the festival, call 207-861-8138 or
visit the Web site at www.mint.net/movies/miff.

Windjammer sail

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sailing on a windjammer is part of the New England experience.
Unfortunately, not everyone has the time even for a three-day sail.
Fortunately, there is one schooner, the 67-foot Wendameen, that
offers one-night sails out of Rockland, Maine. Captain Neal Parker
sails the 14-passenger schooner through Penobscot Bay wherever the
winds and tide allow. A sail is $155 a person and includes meals
and music from the Wendameen's original Victor Gramophone. For
information, call 207-594-1751.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Beads and bones
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Beads, Bones and Ancient Stones: 70 Years of Collecting;
10,000 Years of History'' is the anniversary exhibit of the Abbe
Museum in Bar Harbor, Maine. The exhibit of Maine Native American
objects commemorates the impact the collection's objects have had
on makers, users, collectors, and viewers. Sara Lustsky, 15, of Bar
Harbor, wrote about an ancient bone flute on view: ``I love music.
I have my radio on all the time. Al I have to do is push a button
and sounds fill my world. Prehistoric Abenakis had to create their
own music. They had to select the bone, know where to put the
holes, how to make the sound. The music came from them, from
within.'' Other items on view range from baskets, beads, and
barkwork to a bone of a 4,000-year-old dog. For information, call
207-288-3519.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
First law school
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Noblest Study: The Legacy of America's First School of
Law'' has opened at the Litchfield (Connecticut) Historical
Society. The state-of- the-art exhibit tells of Tapping Reeve's
school, which began in his living room and soon moved to its own
building. In doing so, the exhibit illustrates students'
experiences of travel, study, entertainment, and courtship. The
first student was Aaron Burr, Reeve's brother in law, and soon
included future leaders of the country, including Vice President
John C. Calhoun, educator Horace Mann, and Supreme Court justices.
The exhibit, Tapping Reeve House, and Law School are all near the
Litchfield Green, one of the most picturesque in New England. For
information, call the historical society at 860-567-4501.

 PORTLAND, Maine: ... of the '90s.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is cheering over the growing opportunities for
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry some people in Maine have is the jobs that are being
created are not high-paying jobs,'' said John Davulis, an economist
with Central Maine Power. ``So we get a call center, and it's not
providing nearly the livable income that one would get from working
at a paper mill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some call centers, such as that run by credit card
giant MBNA in Belfast, pay a starting annual salary of $20,000 with
health benefits, other companies pay less. But many offer a good
benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy also has changed the face of many small towns.
</P>
<P>
   While York, which is within commuting distance to Boston, once
had much unused commercial space, ``everything that's available is
now being gobbled up,'' said planner Brian Chernack. And places
like Falmouth that once were sleepy farming and fishing villages
are being transformed into bedroom communities and retirement
havens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these towns are now grappling with school crowding and
overburdened municipal services.
</P>
<P>
   The economic activity is contributing to what Lachance calls
``the bathtub effect.'' Look at Maine's census data, and it appears
that someone pulled the plug in York County and the population
started draining south.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has flowed from Aroostook County, the vast, mostly
wilderness area of northern Maine that has awed outdoorsmen but
discouraged new businesses. There, in small towns that border
rolling acres of potatoes and broccoli, the future is far removed
from the simple certainties that colored life for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Aroostook County, the least-populated county in the state, has
lost 11.3 percent of its residents since 1990. Much of that loss
occurred after Loring Air Force Base closed in 1994, and 9,000
people _ military personnel and their dependents _ left the small
town of Limestone for new assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint heard over and over again in ``The County,''
as Aroostook residents refer to their home, is that young people
with educations are leaving as soon as practicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to keep our kids here anymore,'' says Jo-ann
Lewis, 57, who calls numbers for senior-citizen bingo games at the
American Legion hall in Caribou.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis smiles faintly when asked about the call-center jobs and
other telecommunication work that King hopes will help keep young
adults in northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the type of calls we used to hang up on,'' Lewis
says. ``People here aren't used to that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the air base is also felt keenly in the Caribou
business district, where a once-bustling commercial strip is now
dotted with vacant department stores and dozens of empty parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Sloan, a saleswoman at the Buzzels clothing store, is
discouraged about the local economy, but hopes the state can find
some long-term solutions for the region. ``Don't think of us as the
end of the line,'' she pleads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; King says he has made economic assistance for the area, and
other rural counties, a priority of his administration. ``We want
people to stay if they want to,'' the governor says. ``No young
person should have to leave Maine to find a decent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Buzzels clothing store, a small step is
being taken to make that goal a reality. There, in a previously
empty building bought for a dollar, two brothers have moved a
business that sells computer software for tax preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Forty employees, most of them from the area, will work in
downtown Caribou, eat lunch there, and begin using those empty
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think this is a neat thing to do, we really do,''
says Gregory Jackson, marketing director for ATX Forms, the
software company. ``We decided we'd like to be part of the rebirth
of a downtown, if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   So &UR;  &LR; when co-owner Glynn Willette was searching for a place to
move the business from cramped quarters in nearby Washburn, the
withering environs of Caribou looked like the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have an employee who wants to live in northern Maine,
that takes a certain kind of person,'' Jackson said. ``He's
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the telecommunications infrastructure in Aroostook
County, Jackson says, ATX can put down roots in Caribou and compete
globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as much in the world as anybody,'' he says, waving to
Willette as his boss jogs up the street to his son's Little League
game.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude matches the pep-rally enthusiasm that Brian Hamel
brings to his job as president of the Loring Redevelopment
Authority. With missionary zeal, Hamel extols the benefits of the
base's sprawling facilities and the area's ready pool of workers.
Already, Hamel says, the base has attracted enough new jobs and
commitments to replace the 1,100 civilian positions that were lost
when Loring closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel, a native of Amesbury, Mass., knows firsthand that the
popular perception of northern Maine is an uninviting one. But now,
his wife and three daughters would fight any decision to leave
Aroostook County after their four years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and family thought I had lost my marbles,'' said
Hamel, who previously worked on the redevelopment of the former
Pease Air Force Base outside Portsmouth, N.H. ``Now, my house is
like a bed and breakfast in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy in remote Maine is depressed enough that
Galen Rose, an economist with the state planning office, says that
``if it's not as bad as it gets in New England, it's pretty
close.''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Donihue, an economics professor at Colby College, is
skeptical that high technology is on the verge of becoming a major
player there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to say that we are going to develop a Silicon Valley in
Bangor or Caribou, that just isn't going to happen,'' Donihue says.
However, he adds, ``a few software manufacturing firms would make a
huge difference'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges of spreading the state's economic
benefits more evenly, Maine has rarely had as much appeal _ for
vacationers and entrepreneurs alike.
</P>
<P>
   King senses that, and is criss-crossing the state with a mantra
of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that appeal must be working. Up for
re-election this fall, King enjoys soaring popularity ratings. But
he deflects credit from himself to the ripple effects of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like someone who woke up on third base and thinks he
hit a triple,'' the governor says. ``Maine is one of the most
beautiful places on the planet. It is. It's a beautiful place with
a great infrastructure and great people. Therefore, we're going to
succeed.''

PROSE THAT BREAKETH GRAMMAR'S RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Shakespeare is alive and well, currently lighting up the
New York stage as the inspiration for ``Love's Fire,'' a collection
of mini-plays by seven playwrights, each based on a different
sonnet.
</P>
<P>
   But Shakespeare's grammar is taking a beating, often from people
who should know better _ such as the headline writer who handled
last week's review of ``Love's Fire'' in The New York Times. ``How
Aged These Sonnets, but They Doth Speak Fresh,'' proclaims the
six-column headline, blithely ignoring the fact that doth is a
third person singular verb, the equivalent of the modern does.
</P>
<P>
   In Elizabethan English, a he, she, or it is the subject of verbs
like doth, singeth, runneth. ``The lady doth protest too much,''
says Hamlet's mom; ``Pride goeth before a fall,'' we say,
condensing the biblical verse to a more user-friendly length. The
other archaic verb forms, the ones that end in -st, are second
person singular: ``Whither thou goest,'' ``That time of year thou
mayst in me behold.'' But plural forms, in general, are the same
then as now: ``Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.''
</P>
<P>
   Some writers, though, seem to think these forms have become
meaningless, mere verbal jesters' caps to give words the look of
Olden Days.
</P>
<P>
   Another Times attempt at Shakespearean language, celebrating
Valentine's Day 1997, landed in a grammatical badger hole with
every other step. A mock interview with the aging Romeo and Juliet,
the Sunday magazine piece makes Juliet sound like a tourist groping
her way in a foreign language: ``They'd all gangeth up on us like
the furies,'' she says. ``Cupid's bow doth got put in storage. At
one time Romeo wouldst have slain love for me. ... We couldst not
find a resolution.'' Romeo, given fewer lines, gets off with fewer
missteps: ``And we taketh separate vacations'' is his worst moment.
</P>
<P>
   These are highly visible examples, but of course the Times is
not alone. A 1996 Globe column was headlined ``Their cups runneth
over,'' and it probably wasn't the first appearance of that
variant. Other newspapers surely have their share of misplaced
doths and runneths, whether in headlines or hiding in the small
type.
</P>
<P>
   The question, as always, is how much we should care. Most of us
learned what we know of this grammar from Shakespeare or the King
James Bible, not from Elizabethan grammar books; we're not experts,
and we might well have trouble navigating the thees, thous and
yous, which have usage subtleties, like tu and vous in French, that
no longer exist in English.
</P>
<P>
   But the verb forms are simple enough that the wrong one sounds
comical to any reader with a few sonnets or psalms stored away in
his or her memory bank. Not comical-funny, as having Juliet use the
20th-century gang up might be, but comical-pitiable.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers who dabble in archaic verbs are surprised that
anyone would care about correctness. They know that if they mangle
an Italian phrase or get a Yiddish word wrong, readers will let
them hear about it, but few people today speak Shakespeare _ and
they seem to have their hands full without policing the daily
papers. Still, an archaism gone awry is likely to annoy as many
readers as it amuses; here, as so often, the better part of valor
is discretion.

 By MARK SCHOOPS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When the Harvard AIDS researcher Bruce Walker first learned
about the Berlin patient last September, he had one overriding
thought: Get a sample of his blood.
 &HT;    He dashed off E-mails to the scientists studying the patient and
then phoned his research associates, saying, ``You won't believe
what I just heard.''
 &HT;    Word of the unusual German case quickly spread to a support
group for patients in one of Walker's clinical trials at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Since then the group has
had an extra, invisible member: The Berlin patient, who is
discussed and analyzed almost as if he were actually present.
 &HT;    ``I've never met him, and I don't even know his name, but I've
followed his case,'' says one member of the group. ``He is what we
want to be.''
 &HT;    The source of all this excitement is a young German man who
became infected with the AIDS virus just over two years ago and
quickly started taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs. After just
six months of therapy, however, he ignored the advice of his doctor
and stopped taking the drugs.
 &HT;    When that happens, the virus ordinarily comes roaring back,
resuming its advance to full-blown AIDS. What makes the Berlin
patient so intriguing is that his virus hasn't come back. The most
precise tests detect no HIV in his blood and only trace amounts in
his lymph tissue, the major reservoir for the virus. He harbors so
little HIV that in order to detect it in one of its hiding places,
Dr. Robert Siliciano, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, had to redesign his assay, making it five times
as sensitive.
 &HT;    What little virus remains in the patient is fully capable of
reigniting an infection, so he is not cured. But his immune system
is apparently suppressing HIV without drugs. He has not taken an
AIDS pill in a year and a half.
 &HT;    The Berlin patient fascinates researchers, who hope that clues
to this singular case may lead to new treatments, especially for
those patients lucky enough to get an early diagnosis. At the same
time, researchers are terrified that news of his case might
encourage other patients to abandon their drugs, a rash decision
that virtually always frees the virus to continue its destruction
of the immune system and, possibly, mutate into drug-resistant
strains.
 &HT;    Indeed, another patient in Berlin _ infected at nearly the same
time and treated by the same doctor with the same drugs _ similarly
stopped taking his pills. Immediately, his virus reared up. The
overwhelming majority of AIDS doctors agree with Marcus Conant, a
veteran AIDS doctor in San Francisco, who says, ``If someone comes
to me and says, `I want to go off drugs,' I look him in the eye and
say, `You're nuts.'''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, two world-class labs have confirmed that the Berlin
patient's viral infection is being held in check, and a third is
scrutinizing his immune system. Their interest reflects a recent
shift in thinking about the disease.
 &HT;    At the last international AIDS conference, held two years ago in
Vancouver, Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York, projected a slogan onto the screen
that could have been a motto for HIV research at the time: ``It's
the virus!'' And, indeed, targeting the virus has led to a class of
antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors, the primary force
behind a remarkable two-year decline in AIDS death rates.
 &HT;    No one is suggesting a retreat from this front, but as 10,000
researchers, doctors and advocates gather in Geneva June 28 for the
12th World AIDS Conference, the research focus is broadening from
simply attacking the virus to strengthening the immune system as
well. The Berlin patient, along with several similar, but less well
documented cases just now coming to light, are helping to spur this
shift.
 &HT;    Such cases are ``really pivotal for how we think about HIV,''
says Walker, an immunologist who obtained and analyzed the Berlin
patient's blood. ``What they're banging us over the head with is
that the immune system can control this virus.''
 &HT;    The renewed interest in the immune system comes at a time when
AIDS research has reached a plateau following the development of
protease inhibitors. Despite a presidential commitment to create a
vaccine, and despite the recent approval by the FDA to begin
large-scale testing of one experimental vaccine, there is
widespread sentiment that vaccine research lags behind drug
development.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, an estimated 16,000 people are infected with HIV
every day, and 90 percent of them live in developing nations that
can't afford the expensive new medications. At the same time, early
euphoria over protease inhibitors has been tempered by the
realization that they achieve a stalemate, not a victory. Cocktails
of two to four drugs can stop HIV from replicating and halt disease
progression but can't eliminate the virus, because it integrates
into the DNA of every cell it infects.
 &HT;    Scientists hoped that if HIV were paralyzed long enough, the
body might purge every infected cell. But that possibility dimmed
last year when three independent research teams found that HIV can
hide indefinitely in long-lived cells known as resting T cells.
 &HT;    So unless new strategies are developed, patients might have to
take their drugs for life. But the drugs can cause persistent
nausea and diarrhea, and frightening long-term side effects have
recently been emerging, including redistribution of body fat and
possible heart complications.
 &HT;    Moreover, the drugs currently fail to suppress HIV in as many as
a third of all patients, and that proportion may grow over time.
When drugs fail, it often means that the virus has mutated into a
strain that is resistant to many drugs, even ones the patient has
never taken, leaving few or no options for effective therapy.
 &HT;    ``We could be on a short-term euphoria,'' warns Dr. Ronald
Desrosiers of Harvard. If toxicities or drug resistance forces
enough patients off medication, he says, the two-year decline in
the AIDS death rate could prove short-lived. ``Ten years from
now,'' Desrosiers says, ``we could be back to where we were five
years ago.''
 &HT;    Yet despite their limitations, the drugs do pin down the virus,
at least for a while, thus providing a window of opportunity for
researchers to revive the overwhelmed immune system. Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md., says that it might not be necessary to
decrease the viral level to zero.
 &HT;    ``You may just need to get it low enough so that the immune
system can kick in and keep it in check,'' he says. Ho agrees:
``Control without eradication might be something we could call
remission.''
 &HT;    That's why the Berlin patient, who seems to fit precisely this
description, is so exciting to researchers.
 &HT;    ``What we're looking for,'' Walker says, ``are clues,
experiments of nature that will allow us to understand how to tweak
the immune system so that it can control the virus. And it's
patients like this guy in Berlin who will give us those insights.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    At 30, he is still a student, and he dresses like one: jeans, a
plaid shirt open at the neck and, on his wrist, one of those
colorful cloth bracelets from Mexico. He has short, alfalfa hair
and eyes that often look away, for he is almost painfully shy. He
has never before spoken publicly about his situation and _ fearful
of discrimination against both himself and his parents, who still
live in a small town in southern Germany _ he agreed to talk only
if his identity were concealed.
 &HT;    I met the Berlin patient in his doctor's office, and we walked a
few blocks through the heart of West Berlin's gay neighborhood to a
cafe, where he explained how he became a celebrated medical
mystery. It began on May 10, 1996, when he had sex that wasn't
safe. Three weeks later, he came down with what is called primary
infection syndrome, the fever, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue
signaling that HIV is gaining an initial foothold.
 &HT;    Heiko Jessen, a Berlin doctor with a large AIDS practice,
suggested an HIV test. On June 20, Jessen delivered the bad news.
``I could not move,'' recalls the Berlin patient. ``I didn't even
cry.''
 &HT;    Ten days later, the Berlin patient started on a cocktail of
three drugs _ the protease inhibitor indinavir, ddI and an
experimental and controversial drug called hydroxyurea. The amount
of virus in his blood quickly plummeted.
 &HT;    Then, less than three weeks after starting his medication, he
developed a testicular infection requiring an emergency
hospitalization. But he hadn't taken his HIV pills with him. So for
several days he didn't take his medicine, and his virus popped
back, though only to low levels. Restarting the drugs squelched it.
 &HT;    After that the Berlin patient took his pills religiously until,
about four months later, he started feeling weak and eating began
to make him vomit. He had contracted hepatitis A, which forced him
to interrupt his medication again.
 &HT;    When he recovered two weeks later, Jessen advised him to resume
taking his HIV drugs. Curiously, the virus didn't come back as it
had during his testicular infection.
 &HT;    But it wasn't the lab tests that ultimately persuaded the Berlin
patient to take the dangerous step of ending his drug regimen.
 &HT;    ``When the hepatitis stopped,'' he says, leaning forward, ``I
felt so healthy. I remember especially one evening. I was listening
to some music, and it was really, really cold _ it was November _
but I opened the windows and I was breathing and I thought: `My
body, it's OK. Everything's fine.'''
 &HT;    After that he took his pills only half-heartedly. ``One day I
took all of them,'' he laughs, ``and the next day it was only two,
and some days I really took nothing.''
 &HT;    Jessen calls his patient a ``dream boy.'' Indeed, he relies on
intuition and feeling more than logic and fact. And before becoming
infected, he had never known anyone with HIV, and no one close to
him had ever died. So he is totally sincere when he says he was
``not so surprised'' that his virus didn't come back, because ``it
was almost my will to become healthy.''
 &HT;    With 400 AIDS patients under his care, Jessen couldn't afford to
be so naive. When the Berlin patient admitted, just before
Christmas 1996, that he wasn't taking his medicine regularly,
Jessen told him, ``This is not a good idea.''
 &HT;    Jessen tried to bargain, proposing that his patient postpone his
decision for a few more months. ``But he said he had definitely
decided,'' Jessen remembers with resignation. ``What could I do?''
 &HT;    Yet Jessen realized that something fascinating was happening in
his patient. The virus should have already come back. Indeed, a
concurrent infection such as hepatitis normally stirs up HIV. So
Jessen said: ``You must come at least twice a month to the office.
You owe me that.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient has certainly fulfilled his debt to science,
according to Dr. Franco Lori, the principal scientist working on
his case and director of the Research Institute for Genetic and
Human Therapy in Washington and Pavia, Italy. Lori once joked that
the reason the Berlin patient has virtually no virus left is that
researchers have removed it all by drawing so much blood.
 &HT;    Yet he feels no larger debt, no new lease on life. ``I really
did not suffer,'' he says. ``Only the pills reminded me I was
ill.''
 &HT;    Lori first presented the Berlin patient's case at a September
1997 conference organized by the lab of Dr. Robert Gallo,
co-discoverer of HIV. Two similar cases had already been reported
in the British medical journal The Lancet, but many researchers
doubted those cases.
 &HT;    The lead scientist _ Dr. Jorge Vila, medical director at the
French drug company Compagnie de Developpement Aguettant in Lyons _
isn't well known to AIDS researchers. And Vila's two patients had
such small amounts of virus in their blood before starting therapy
that scientists even speculated that they might not have been
infected at all. (The Berlin patient had a substantial infection,
verified by two separate tests.)
 &HT;    But now there is growing evidence of more cases. David Ho
revealed in an interview that he is following two patients who,
like the Berlin patient, started treatment soon after they were
infected and then decided to stop therapy against medical advice.
 &HT;    Their virus, Ho says, has not returned ``in a detectable way
with traditional tests.'' He declined to give additional details
until he has studied them in more depth.
 &HT;    And Vila now says that he has eight additional patients who have
had no detectable HIV rebound three to 12 months after stopping
their medication. One was treated early, but the others are what
are known as A1 patients, meaning they have suffered no AIDS
symptoms and retain relatively strong immune systems.
 &HT;    All of them started therapy with blood tests showing HIV counts
of less than 10,000, a low number. None of these 10 new cases have
been formally presented in scientific conferences or journals. But
if they hold up, there could be 13 patients who are suppressing HIV
after stopping treatment.
 &HT;    ``That's not a trend,'' says Dr. Beatrice Hahn, a University of
Alabama AIDS researcher, ``but it's more than an anecdote. These
are some of the most important patients to study.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient is the best documented of all, and clinical
trials are about to begin that, in essence, try to repeat certain
key elements of his case. As it stands, his luck is still
unexplained _ and still provisional.
 &HT;    ``I don't think the virus will come back,'' he says. ``We have a
German phrase for my situation, `uber den Berg','' over the hump.
``It's finished for me.''
 &HT;    Perhaps. But he must continue practicing safe sex because he
might still be infectious, and he went to his first HIV support
group only after he had stopped taking drugs and had suppressed the
virus. ``Once you are HIV-positive,'' he explains, less naive now,
``the virus is always in you.''

   CORRECTION TO WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding

WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The following is a correction to last week's
vote chart regarding the ``IRSREFORM'' bill. The chart shows how
house representatives voted on the IRS reform bill. A ``Y'' means
the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''

</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRSREFORM
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 402-8, to pass an IRS overhaul and tax
bill. The measure would establish a citizens' oversight panel and
increase taxpayer rights in collection disputes with the IRS.
Supporters said the bill would protect taxpayers from any abuse
from the tax agency. Opponents objected to a measure that shortens

 By PETER LIPPMAN  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In March, I became a prisoner in Kosovo, along with a group of
activists from Peaceworkers, a California-based organization that
monitors human-rights abuses and promotes nonviolent conflict
resolution.
 &HT;    I arrived in Kosovo as part of the Peaceworkers' delegation, at
the invitation of the Independent Student Union there.
 &HT;    We witnessed the brutality of the Serbian government in this
Albanian-populated province. And we noted the remarkable efforts of
Kosovo's Albanian citizenry to stave off disaster by engaging in
creative nonviolence.
 &HT;    In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, we met the people who are
holding together the infrastructure of Albanian society _
professors, doctors, journalists and human-rights workers.
 &HT;    The dean of philology at Pristina's underground university told
us how, in 1991, the Belgrade regime had imposed an exclusively
Serbian-language curriculum. When the Albanian professors refused
to teach the curriculum, they were fired. The same thing happened
in the high schools. Teachers and professors soon set up a parallel
educational system in private rooms, basements and storefronts.
 &HT;    We visited an English class in an unheated, empty store. The
students sat on makeshift wooden benches, wearing their coats, hats
and gloves. The young teacher shivered as she gave a lesson in
prefixes: neo-liberalism, neo-colonialism, pan-Hellenic,
pan-Balkan.
 &HT;    All of the college-educated people we spoke with said they were
convinced that their conflict with the Serbian regime must be
resolved peacefully. One of our young translators was the most
eloquent. Asked how she felt about the Kosovo Liberation Army, she
responded, ``Did anyone ever win a war? You can take territory, but
everyone still loses.''
 &HT;    At the same time, many people are at the end of their patience.
A journalist said to me, ``Each night I go to bed knowing that the
police can break into my apartment and do whatever they want to my
family. This is psychological terrorism. Every parent is a
potential fighter.'' One student in the English class told us, ``If
the police hurt my father or my brother, I will have to fight.''
 &HT;    At the student union office, I looked at pictures of the victims
from Drenica, the region west of Pristina where Serbian police and
paramilitary units surrounded more than a dozen villages in late
February and massacred at least 90 people. I saw photos of the
bodies of old people, men, women and children. Many had been shot
at close range. Half of one woman's face was gone.
 &HT;    Later I watched the Serbian TV coverage. Only the male victims,
all of whom were termed ``terrorists,'' showed up on television.
 &HT;    We met a former Serbian politician who was forced out of his job
after he spoke against the regime when it took away Kosovo's
autonomy. We asked what would happen to him if he protested now
against massacres of Albanian civilians. ``Probably the same thing
that happened to the people in Drenica,'' he said.
 &HT;    Another Serb we met, a shopkeeper, said he had friends and
customers among the Albanians. He came close to tears when he
talked about the Albanian woman who used to take care of his
children. He told us he wished the Albanians would receive their
independence so that things could calm down.
 &HT;    But his mood changed when we brought up the recent massacre. ``I
knew some of those policemen who got killed,'' he said. ``In
America, what do you do with your terrorist problem? You hunt them
down and shoot them, right? I am just waiting to leave here.''
 &HT;    The Serb shopkeeper blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for the
troubles in the region. But he also expressed hateful views of the
Albanian people generally.
 &HT;    ``The Albanians just think about sex and guns,'' he said. ``If
they have two wives and we have one, they can have 10 or 15
children, and we usually just have two. And they always make sure
to have lots of guns. The Albanians I know here in town are mostly
normal. But not those in the villages. Did you see the pictures of
the people who were killed? They looked like monkeys.''
 &HT;    At noon on Friday, March 13, my colleagues and I walked up a
muddy hill in Pristina to observe a protest. Demonstrators chose
the hillside location, among other reasons, because of its
inaccessibility except by foot. No cars could make a sudden attack.
The demonstration started earlier than announced, so the police
wouldn't have time to block it.
 &HT;    About 50,000 people stood among the houses on the edge of a
sloped field. They sang freedom songs, waved Albanian and American
flags, carried signs saying, ``Serbian Terror out of Kosovo'',
``NATO: S.O.S.'' and ``Drenica, We're with You''. Protesters made
speeches, and then the demonstration broke up. The crowd marched
down Qafa Street, renamed Yugoslav National Army Street by the
Serbian government.
 &HT;    We went to visit the Mother Teresa clinic, located in a small
house in the poor part of Pristina. It is the only free women's
clinic in Kosovo, staffed by doctors and nurses who donate their
time. One doctor told us about her surreal firing from the state
hospital in 1990 by a policeman wearing a doctor's white coat,
holding a gun in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other.
 &HT;    She also said another doctor was fired while operating on a
patient. When he insisted on finishing the operation, he was
handcuffed to a radiator and beaten. On days when traffic is not
disrupted by police actions, an average of 15 children are born in
the clinic. Because of space limitations, mothers who have just
given birth have only two hours to rest before they are sent home.
Women are often doubled up, two to a bed.
 &HT;    The day we visited was a slow one, because of the
demonstrations. There were only three newborns, tightly wrapped and
placed together in a bed with bottles of warm water between them.
Most women are giving birth at home now, the doctors said, and
there is anecdotal evidence of a big jump in infant mortality.
 &HT;    On Sunday, four days after we arrived, we watched more
demonstrations. One was scheduled to coincide with Catholic Mass.
There were no signs this time, just pictures of Mother Teresa.
Demonstrators also carried candles in honor of the dead at Drenica.
About 100,000 people walked around the town quietly. Seven young
men at the front of the line wore T-shirts that spelled
D-R-E-N-I-C-A.
 &HT;    Near the center of town the march stopped. An old man stepped
out and motioned everyone to be quiet. The silence of those
thousands of people was overwhelming. The man lit all the candles
of those in front of the line, and then walked away, lighting a
cigarette.
 &HT;    The next day, 20,000 women tried to march to Drenica with bread
in their hands. The police turned them back. Human-rights groups
and aid organizations were also prevented from reaching Drenica,
where terrified villagers hiding in the woods were reportedly
starving. The head of the International Red Cross in Pristina gave
up on relief efforts and left town after receiving death threats.
 &HT;    On Thurs., March 19, the students called another brief
demonstration. This time everyone was to bring keys and rattle
them, to symbolize unlocking the prison of military repression, a
tactic protesters used in Chile and Czechoslovakia. A half-dozen
policemen blocked the protest at a main intersection. Pistols,
grenades, and knives hung from their belts. The marchers all sat
down. Snipers stood on the rooftops. Two armored vehicles raced to
the scene, and 10 helmeted policemen got out. They filed around to
stand behind the seated protesters.
 &HT;    But what were they going to do to thousands of people who were
sitting down, with dozens of international journalists watching?
Nothing happened. The demonstrators rattled their keys and blew
their whistles. For half an hour unarmed men, women and children,
sitting on the pavement, prevailed over the police.
 &HT;    On the same day, a large Serbian demonstration took place. Word
spread that many busloads of people were brought into Pristina from
Belgrade, Nis and Kragujevac. We watched as a crowd of people
walked by carrying signs: ``Kosovo is the Heart of Serbia'';
``We'll Give our Head, But Not Serbia!'' _ and a swastika with the
words ``America'' and ``Germany'' over it.
 &HT;    Some Serbian marchers caught sight of my colleagues and me
standing near some journalists who were wearing plaid shirts and
carrying cameras. The marchers started yelling, ``Profiteers! Go
home.'' People sang the old song, ``Who's lying? Who says Serbia is
small?'' As we left, an old woman followed us, yelling, ``You
should be killed!''
 &HT;    I heard a piano when I arrived at my host's house to rest. The
14-year-old music student who lives there was practicing. I went in
to listen while he played Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, all three
movements, without sheet music. I was impressed, and asked him how
long he had been working on it.
 &HT;    He told me, ``Since the beginning of the year, only I haven't
had much time.''
 &HT;    Then he played Mozart's March Alla Turca, which sounded easy
after the Beethoven piece.
 &HT;    Our visit ended abruptly when my group was arrested, tried by a
``judge'' (more properly a magistrate) and sentenced to 10 days in
jail, all in the space of a few hours. I was apprehended a day
before my colleagues when I reached a checkpoint while trying to
leave Kosovo by bus for Sarajevo.
 &HT;    The police, not liking the fact that I had no evidence to show I
had registered my presence in Kosovo with the police, removed me
from the bus. They held me at the Mitrovica police station for
several hours, talking to me sometimes politely, and other times
rudely. Eventually they decided to send me back to Pristina. Two
armed policemen drove me back in an unmarked car.
 &HT;    During the entire detention and arrest incident, I was more
inconvenienced than scared because I believed I would soon be fined
and allowed to go on my way. When one of my guards conjectured that
I would be sentenced to 10 days in jail and then deported, I
thought he was trying to intimidate me. But I soon learned that he
was right.
 &HT;    And as my mother warned me before I went to Kosovo, ``In a war
situation, there's no one you can complain to.''
 &HT;    On entering the jail, I was not physically mistreated, just
yelled at for a long time by the guards. Some of them seemed to be
enjoying their opportunity to yell at an American. They asked me if
I wanted a haircut. I said no. Then they shaved my head and took me
to a cell.
 &HT;    I spent the night in the cell with seven Albanian men, ages 16
to 40. They had been arrested the same day as I was. It was clear
that the police had already been hard at work on a couple of them.
I shook hands with everyone except the two whose hands were too
swollen from pounding by nightclubs.
 &HT;    Two men adopted me, talked to me in a whisper, and told me how
to act in order to survive. I asked if we could speak openly. One
said, ``You can, but we can't.''
 &HT;    The police entered the room every half hour that night. Each
time, we had to jump up and form a line with our hands behind our
backs. One big guard was particularly mean. He asked the
16-year-old boy standing next to me a question. The boy answered in
Albanian.
 &HT;    The man slapped him on one cheek and told him to speak Serbian.
The poor kid didn't know much Serbian.
 &HT;    The guard slapped him hard on the other cheek. His hand whizzed
by my face. He asked the boy, ``Were you in the demonstration?''
The boy answered, ``Yes.'' Slap. The guard left, satisfied for the
time being.
 &HT;    I was arrested on a Friday, and the rest of my colleagues came
in on Saturday. Diplomatic pressure on the Serbian government
ensued. U.S. diplomats all the way up to Madeleine Albright were
making a clamor to high Serbian officials.
 &HT;    On Monday, we were suddenly taken out of the jail and driven to
the Serbian border with Macedonia. The Serbian government had made
a mistake in detaining us. The arrest gave us a special opportunity
to publicize our findings. After we were released, we held press
conferences in Skopje, Macedonia, and in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    We were relieved to be out of jail, but sorry to be forbidden to
reenter the country for three years. The privileged Americans are
free, but for the Albanians, life goes on.
 &HT;    Albanians in Kosovo are close enough to Bosnia to know that no
amount of human suffering will necessarily force Western
policymakers to act. But every day I spent there, I heard the same
things: ``What is America going to do? NATO needs to wake up and
help us.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, as the West cranks out ``strongly worded
statements,'' the atrocities continue. Serbian soldiers keep
pouring into Kosovo. They are setting up more checkpoints, and
violent attacks on Albanian peasants are not restricted to the
Drenica area, but are taking place all over the province. By now,
there are well over 40,000 refugees. Some even showed up in
Sarajevo.
 &HT;    As long as the conflict does not spill over the borders, sending
thousands more refugees into NATO countries, the West seems content
to keep its distance. But there will be more Drenicas. Madeleine
Albright's declaration that ``we will not rule out force'' and
pontification about an arms embargo on Yugoslavia are pathetic
gestures. It is getting very late for the Albanians.

had registered my presence in Kosovo with the police, removed me
from the bus. They held me at the Mitrovica police station for
several hours, talking to me sometimes politely, and other times
rudely. Eventually they decided to send me back to Pristina. Two
armed policemen drove me back in an unmarked car.
 &HT;    During the entire detention and arrest incident, I was more
inconvenienced than scared because I believed I would soon be fined
and allowed to go on my way. When one of my guards conjectured that
I would be sentenced to 10 days in jail and then deported, I
thought he was trying to intimidate me. But I soon learned that he
was right.
 &HT;    And as my mother warned me before I went to Kosovo, ``In a war
situation, there's no one you can complain to.''
 &HT;    On entering the jail, I was not physically mistreated, just
yelled at for a long time by the guards. Some of them seemed to be
enjoying their opportunity to yell at an American. They asked me if
I wanted a haircut. I said no. Then they shaved my head and took me
to a cell.
 &HT;    I spent the night in the cell with seven Albanian men, ages 16
to 40. They had been arrested the same day as I was. It was clear
that the police had already been hard at work on a couple of them.
I shook hands with everyone except the two whose hands were too
swollen from pounding by nightclubs.
 &HT;    Two men adopted me, talked to me in a whisper, and told me how
to act in order to survive. I asked if we could speak openly. One
said, ``You can, but we can't.''
 &HT;    The police entered the room every half hour that night. Each
time, we had to jump up and form a line with our hands behind our
backs. One big guard was particularly mean. He asked the
16-year-old boy standing next to me a question. The boy answered in
Albanian.
 &HT;    The man slapped him on one cheek and told him to speak Serbian.
The poor kid didn't know much Serbian.
 &HT;    The guard slapped him hard on the other cheek. His hand whizzed
by my face. He asked the boy, ``Were you in the demonstration?''
The boy answered, ``Yes.'' Slap. The guard left, satisfied for the
time being.
 &HT;    I was arrested on a Friday, and the rest of my colleagues came
in on Saturday. Diplomatic pressure on the Serbian government
ensued. U.S. diplomats all the way up to Madeleine Albright were
making a clamor to high Serbian officials.
 &HT;    On Monday, we were suddenly taken out of the jail and driven to
the Serbian border with Macedonia. The Serbian government had made
a mistake in detaining us. The arrest gave us a special opportunity
to publicize our findings. After we were released, we held press
conferences in Skopje, Macedonia, and in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    We were relieved to be out of jail, but sorry to be forbidden to
reenter the country for three years. The privileged Americans are
free, but for the Albanians, life goes on.
 &HT;    Albanians in Kosovo are close enough to Bosnia to know that no
amount of human suffering will necessarily force Western
policymakers to act. But every day I spent there, I heard the same
things: ``What is America going to do? NATO needs to wake up and
help us.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, as the West cranks out ``strongly worded
statements,'' the atrocities continue. Serbian soldiers keep
pouring into Kosovo. They are setting up more checkpoints, and
violent attacks on Albanian peasants are not restricted to the
Drenica area, but are taking place all over the province. By now,
there are well over 40,000 refugees. Some even showed up in
Sarajevo.
 &HT;    As long as the conflict does not spill over the borders, sending
thousands more refugees into NATO countries, the West seems content
to keep its distance. But there will be more Drenicas. Madeleine
Albright's declaration that ``we will not rule out force'' and
pontification about an arms embargo on Yugoslavia are pathetic
gestures. It is getting very late for the Albanians.

HARSHBARGER FIRMLY IN LABOR'S GOOD GRACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was a defining moment in the battle to be the next
governor of Massachusetts, it arrived Thursday when the state's
largest union organization gave its endorsement to Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   While winning the state Democratic convention's endorsement
earlier this month was an important step for Harshbarger, that
victory was largely the result of a struggle between his team and
party insiders who had hoped to embarrass him by denying him that
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But the state AFL-CIO approval will have influence far beyond
convention walls, reaching to virtually every corner of the state.
Which is why Harshbarger wanted it so badly, and why his two
Democratic rivals, Patricia McGovern and Brian Donnelly, wanted so
badly to deny him the necessary two-thirds vote of the AFL-CIO
Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
   With this backing, Harshbarger will now have organized labor
working in his behalf, not only for the September primary, but
leading to the November final. That gives the AFL-CIO ample time to
build support for him among rank-and-file union members.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harshbarger actively sought the AFL-CIO's endorsement,
there was no assurance that he would get the support from the
executive council. Some unions were reluctant to support him, and
several others expressed outright opposition, largely over
perceptions that he was not aggressive enough against state wage
law violations, a charge that Harshbarger denies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Harshbarger and key AFL-CIO officials worked right
up to the day of the vote to persuade enough union leaders on the
council to support the Democratic front-runner, making the case
that Harshbarger is the only Democratic hopeful who can defeat
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, should he survive his own primary
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted after the candidates made their
pitch, Harshbarger won, 40 to 16, an overwhelming victory for a
candidate who was not high on labor's list of potential
endorsements at the beginning of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   If half of the 400,000-member AFL-CIO, plus a 100,000 of their
friends and relatives, voted for Harshbarger, that could help put
him over the top in November.
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger had not received the council's endorsement, he
would have been politically weakened, giving his rivals and other
critics an argument that he neither earned nor deserves organized
labor's support. That could also have sparked new life in
McGovern's campaign, which has been lagging Harshbarger's in voter
support.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the one candidate who could have impeded Harshbarger
last week was not McGovern, but Donnelly. Although he is a distant
third in the campaign, Donnelly had a good enough labor record
during his years in Congress to gain significant support from the
AFL-CIO's Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
   However, his thus-far subpar performance in this election has
prevented him from winning greater support on the council. He lost
ground early when the media printed revelations that contradicted
earlier stories about being a high school and college football
player. Donnelly lost a bit more ground when he had to retract two
union endorsements his campaign said he received. Had Donnelly's
campaign not made such mistakes, his candidacy might have been more
viable.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern still believes she can appeal to ``rank-and-file''
union members in an effort to diminish the impact of the AFL-CIO
endorsement of Harshbarger, but that will not be an easy task,
since the rank-and-file membership is more likely to support
Harshbarger for the same reason the AFL-CIO leadership endorsed
him: as the best chance of unseating Cellucci. If he is elected,
Harshbarger is likely to be as supportive of labor's agenda as
labor was of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor needs no reminder that some candidates who
received its backing ended up on the losing end of elections. One
was James Shannon, who lost his 1990 bid for attorney general to
Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   But now with Harshbarger and the AFL-CIO working together in
this election, Harshbarger is likely to be in better shape for the
November final than Cellucci may be after his bitter primary battle
with State Treasurer Joseph Malone.
</P>
<P>
   This endorsement, however, is only the official beginning of
organized labor's efforts to put Harshbarger into the governor's
chair. Now the AFL-CIO and its supporting affiliates must go out
and persuade as many union workers as possible that a vote for
Harshbarger is a vote for union workers and working families.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Suplee walked into Doyle's Cafe at precisely 12:15 the
other afternoon and waited by the bar for a few minutes until his
old pal, Jack Spinney, came in out of the heat in order to wrap his
hands around a good, cold beer. The two men, Suplee and Spinney _
one 82, the other 77 _ have been getting together at noon, on the
same stools, in the same marvelous Boston tavern for nearly 50
years, ever since discovering that they shared a common past as
prisoners of war in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had it easy,'' Freddie Suplee said, smiling at Jack
Spinney. ``He got to ride all over Europe. He was in the Air Force.
I was in the infantry. We got a ditch and a can of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Spinney's story: Dorchester High. Joined the Army Air Corps
on Dec. 8, 1941. Assigned to the 449th Bomber Group, 417th Wing as
a ball-gunner, the guy who sits in a tiny turret attached to the
belly of the bomber; by spring 1944 his unit was flying out of an
American base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had flown 36 missions,'' Spinney recalled. ``April 11, 1944
was my 37th. And it was also `adios.' We got shot down over
Romania, bombing the oil fields at Ploesti. I got sent to a POW
camp in Bucharest.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Suplee: Drafted in 1941 out of Our Lady of Lourdes High.
Walked across France after D-Day with the 26th Infantry Division
until the first week in October when he and three others in his
anti-tank gun crew got separated from their unit in the Saar Valley
along the German border, and hid upstairs for two days in a
farmhouse as 80 German soldiers ate and slept downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had us outgunned,'' Suplee said simply. ``Our lieutenant
ordered artillery in on our own position to kill the Germans. He
was a brave guy, but they got us. There were only four of us, and
they brought us to an SS unit in the nearest town where they lined
us up in front of a row of machine guns. I figured that was it, but
they changed their minds and walked us almost all the way to Berlin
to a POW camp 7 miles outside the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men found freedom in the spring of 1945 when the Russian
Army liberated their camps. Spinney came home and worked for
decades as an ambulance driver for Boston. Suplee returned and got
on the cops, working for decades in old Division 10 at Jackson
Square until retirement.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of an uncomplaining generation who first saved and
then helped transform the United States from a sleepy, isolationist
outpost to the economic, industrial powerhouse that dominates the
stage today. Unfortunately, with their modesty, self-reliance,
sense of obligation, loyalty, and lack of any feelings of
victimization both men are nearly completely at odds with the
confused, celebrity-crazed, self-pitying culture currently around
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't bad,'' Suplee said. ``Most of the guards were good
guys. They were all old. The camp was outside Berlin. We'd hear our
planes going overhead all day and all night; it was a beautiful
sound, made us feel good until they dropped a bomb in the camp one
day and killed a couple hundred guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was us then,'' Jack Spinney told Suplee. ``We bombed in
the day. The British bombed at night. Funniest thing, though, was
getting freed by the Russians. Turns out they weren't bad bastards
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to walk in circles all day, saying the Rosary on our
fingers,'' Freddie Suplee added. ``Then we'd go to Confession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had that, too,'' Spinney remembered. ``I could never figure
that out. I mean, what the eff are you going to confess in prison
camp? What could you do? They wouldn't even let us smoke. The
Germans actually were ahead of their time: They made me stop
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberated young men both came back the same summer _ 1945 _
to a different country, to their families, jobs, and neighborhoods.
And ever since they discovered each other nearly 50 years ago they
have grown old keeping the light of memory and nobility alive at a
time when much in our midst seems neither memorable or essential
when compared to the courage and sacrifice each man displayed
without ever being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing is when I got back and came into Doyle's the first
time, the bartender said to me, `Where the hell you been?''' Fred
Suplee recalled with a laugh. ``His name was Sean Bradley. He was
from Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Whalen and Tom McDonough were the other two bartenders,''
Jack Spinney pointed out. ``They said the same thing to me. Like we
was gone a week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was OK,'' Fred Suplee said to his friend Jack Spinney.
``We were just glad to be home. It wasn't any big deal.''

 &HT;    U.S. FIRMS TRYING TO ATTRACT A CLINTON VISIT GET BYPASSED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With CHINA-HISTBOX 
 &HT;    EDS: We expect to top this story by 10:45 p.m. EDT with fresh
Clinton remarks from meetings with business leaders 
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ American corporations lobbied months for President
Clinton to visit their factories in China, but on Wednesday he will
bypass the chance to be photographed next to eager, low paid
Chinese workers making goods for export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies talked about trying to get the president to
do a whole host of things, visit their plants, visit schools that
they support, and a whole host of them,'' a top member of the
Clinton entourage, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley,
acknowledged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley said the closest he expects Clinton to get to any
American business is at a half-hour speech Wednesday morning to the
American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. As the day with the least
crowded schedule, Wednesday was the most likely target for a
factory visit.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said a ``symbolic visit'' to a U.S. factory wouldn't have
nearly the impact as Clinton's overall message ``of greater
cooperation'' between China and America.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America got several other disappointments from
Clinton's nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The White House waffled for weeks before finally deciding not to
include a business delegation as part of Clinton's official
entourage. That would have given commercial relations a high
profile role in Clinton's five-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Clinton and his administration achieve an agreement on
China's admittance to the World Trade Organization, which business
leaders listed as a number one priority of this summit. As a WTO
member China would have to reduce tariffs and loosen tough controls
over foreign firms doing business here.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors especially appealed hard for Clinton to stop by
its new joint venture factory that will turn out a version of the
Buick Regal here in Shanghai, a daring project that carries the
risk of falling flat for lack of big-car demand. GM was still
hopeful by mid-month, but a major strike in the United States made
a presidential visit a bad publicity risk.
</P>
<P>
   Daley also said at a briefing Tuesday that no progress had been
made on reducing China's trade deficit, with the American side
saying China sells about $50 billion more than it buys from the
U.S. New figures show the deficit has jumped by another 13-14
percent in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, our exports have not grown anywhere near
the degree that their exports to the United States have,'' Daley
said. And he said no ``concrete steps'' have been taken in the last
five days to shrink the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly shifted the mood of this trip from official
meetings to more informal visits with Chinese people as soon as he
got to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Clinton held a roundtable discussion with
intellectuals and sat through call-in questions during an hourlong
radio talk show. He walked in the lush Yu Gardens with his daughter
Chelsea, fed the fish and bought some ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the round table discussion Clinton made one comment in a
rather off-hand way that will make China's top leaders sit up and
take notice back in Beijing. It also caused dismay in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finally repeated specifically the ``three noes'' that
Chinese have wanted him to commit to upholding in regard to U.S.
policy on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In official meetings earlier in the trip, Clinton said, he had a
chance to reiterate the American policy, ``which is that we don't
support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one
China,'' he said. ``And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a
member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what China's President Jiang Zemin said he
wanted from Clinton, but did not get until Tuesday morning.
Earlier, without giving specifics, Clinton said vaguely that he
supports the existing U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Chinese communists have no rights and
are in no position to conduct bilateral negotiations on anything
related to our affairs,'' Taiwan foreign ministry spokesman Roy Wu
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House press spokesman Mike McCurry tried to downplay
Clinton's comment, questioning its significance as ``merely a
reiteration of longstanding U.S. policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no particular reason Clinton finally in
Shanghai made the comments Chinese leaders had called the most
important aspect of his trip. Clinton may have waited until leaving
the Beijing seat of government in an effort to diminish the impact
of his statement, and he also may have withheld it until seeing how
the Chinese would respond to some of the administration's desires.
</P>
<P>
   After getting two live televised appearances broadcast on
Chinese television, which had been a high administration priority,
Clinton delivered the sought-after statement that cements U.S.
policy as coming from the government's highest source.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai Clinton largely achieved the kind of informal
give-and-take he had hoped to experience in China, as part of his
effort to give Americans a better understanding of the country that
well may be the economic powerhouse of the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest talk show question probably was the query about
which team he thinks will win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert in soccer, but I think the Brazilians are
always hard to beat,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Show host Zuo Anlong wondered whether America couldn't adapt the
``ping-pong diplomacy'' that opened the door to China into ``soccer
diplomacy'' and open a route to better relations with Iran.

   Summer is a busy time for hotel chains. Take the Hampton Inn
group, which will accommodate 6 million travelers at its more than
800 properties from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The hotels
expect to:
</P>
<P>
   _Distribute more than 8 million bars of soap and 3 million
bottles of shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   _Supply guests with more than 32 million towels _ more than
enough, if laid flat, to circle the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _Wash more than 1.5 million loads of laundry. That's equal to
washing 11 loads every minute throughout June, July, and August.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide 432,000 gallons of juice. That's enough to fill more
than 11,000 bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   _Serve more than 9 million complimentary breakfasts, which will
include nearly 3.5 million bagels and more than 14 million cups of
coffee. That's enough coffee for every resident of Florida to have
a cup.
</P>
<P>
   _Distribute more than 5.5 million copies of USA Today. We know:

MAPPING OUR PLACE IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ After Norman B. Leventhal has guided a
visitor through his collection of historical maps of Boston and New
England, he calls attention to a rather ordinary 1930 map of
Dorchester that has pride of place in the exhibit at MIT's Compton
Gallery, right inside the door, hanging above the visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
   It is not immediately obvious why that map is hanging where it
is. What significant _ or insignificant _ bit of local history
could it represent? Is it what Dorchester would look like if it had
remained a separate city instead of being annexed by Boston? Or
does it show how Blue Hill Avenue and Dorchester Avenue provided
escape routes to suburbia?
</P>
<P>
   Both true, but neither are what Leventhal had in mind, so he
resolves the issue _ quite impishly _ by pointing to a small red
dot pasted on a small side street off Columbia Road.
</P>
<P>
   It marks Wolcott Street, he tells a visitor, pausing for an
unspoken ``and?'' before he explains with a very quiet chuckle that
it's the street where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are Norman B. Leventhal, 81 years old this summer,
developer of some of Boston's most recent landmarks and owner of
what is regarded as one of the finest private collections of maps
in New England, you are more than entitled to a bit of fun.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you are not Norman B. Leventhal, these maps let any
Bostonian, longtime resident or newcomer, see the city with a new
awareness, even a sense of rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's collection _ begun some 30 years ago with the
purchase of a small map of Boston _ now comprises some 300 items,
ranging from speculative maps drawn before Columbus's voyage of
discovery to contemporary ones created with the most advanced
technology. The MIT exhibit, ``Mapping Boston: Delineating the City
and Its Region,'' is open weekdays only through July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, 69 maps from Leventhal's collection are on permanent
display in the lobby of the Boston Harbor Hotel, developed by
Leventhal's Beacon Companies, and another 26 in the lobby of the
Hotel Meridien, another Beacon project.
</P>
<P>
   In its seeming ordinariness _ it lacks the rich details of the
cartographers' art that mark the other maps in the exhibit _ that
``Plan of Dorchester'' illustrates what most intrigues Leventhal
about maps.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he said, ``the stories behind them'' _ whether they are
of his personal Dorchester in the days of his youth, or of how, and
why, Boston changed through the 360 years of its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see how things were viewed at the time the map was
drawn,'' Leventhal said. Then with later maps of the city, ``you
see a history evolving through them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, the map that first catches the visitor's
eye (assuming that visitor has walked right past the Dorchester
map).
</P>
<P>
   It is a richly colored map, produced in 1776 by a German
cartographer, in which Boston _ still pretty much the tiny
peninsula of its first settlement a century and a half before _
appears overwhelmed by the surrounding hills and Harbor Islands,
studded with the small red blocks of army encampments and artillery
fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   That map should have bluntly suggested to the city's British
commanders that they were in a most untenable situation and that it
was time to think about pulling out and heading for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A beautifully detailed map from 1838 suggests how much the world
changed over the next half-century. Its Boston is depicted as the
hub of a great transportation network _ railroad lines
crisscrossing the bend in the Charles River that would become the
Back Bay, the broad Boston Wharf along what is now Fort Point
Channel eclipsing the slender wharves of the old Colonial
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the 1776 and 1838 maps illustrate the point made
by urban historian Kevin Lynch in ``The Image of the City,'' that
as a city like Boston develops, its ``specific character'' becomes
``perhaps as much the result of human action and desires as of the
original geological structure.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of maps, from the Municipal Registers of 1852 and 1855,
pinpoint the time when the Back Bay began to take shape. In the
earlier map, that area &UR;  &LR; is still a widening of the Charles River, a
waterfront edge for the Public Garden, labeled ``Receiving Bay''
and still crisscrossed by the trestles that carried the Providence
and Worcester railroad lines. But just three years later, a grid of
streets had been superimposed over the bay, the future Arlington,
Berkeley, Clarendon, and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there is a 1914 city map with the routes of a
proposed new street over the Boston and Albany Railroad tracks and
a railroad tunnel under a new street to be built between North and
South stations. They suggest the logic _ perhaps even the
inevitability _ of the future routes of the then
not-even-dreamed-of Massachusetts Turnpike and Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal likes poking around for additions to his collection in
rare and used book stores. And urban planner Alex Krieger, a fellow
map fancier and curator of the collection, keeps his eye open for
possible additions as well. Krieger is co-editor for a book based
on the Leventhal collection to be published next spring by MIT
Press.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time that Leventhal has spent studying his maps
since he brought his first one some 30 years ago, there remains the
thrill of fresh discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at them I see something new,'' Leventhal
said, pointing to an 1800 map that is of historical interest
because it is the first one to show the city divided in wards for
voting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent in this map is the long street running down the narrow
neck of land that connected the original peninsular city to Roxbury
on the mainland. Soon it would be renamed Washington Street _ and
much later be a trolley route _ but then it was still Orange
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Until looking at the map recently, as he was selecting it for
inclusion in the MIT exhibit, Leventhal said, ``I never associated
Orange Street with the Orange Line.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other map that intrigues Leventhal's playful
nature.
</P>
<P>
   It's an 1886 map drawn for the Boston Park Department _ one on
which the Emerald Necklace and other city parks are marked in
bright green.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the exhibit, Leventhal peered closely at it
for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hummm,'' he said very much tongue in cheek, ``how come there
isn't any green at Post Office Square?'' That, of course, could
only be colored green now, as the site of the popular Financial
District park created by Leventhal and other abutting property
owners on the site of a parking garage.

 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sixteen-year-old tour guide Shauna Rigaud is delivering
her standard tour-guide pitch. She is explaining the significance
of a Victorian-era brick apartment building in Boston's South End.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lived here, she
says &UR;  &LR; matter-of-factly, when he was a theology graduate student at
Boston University. King met his future wife during these years in
Boston at a social gathering, Rigaud tells the group.
</P>
<P>
   A wide grin appears beneath the rim of her baseball cap. ``At a
frat party or something,'' she adds, as though sharing a playful
secret. ``He asked his friend, `Aw, who's that fly honey over
there?' His friend said, `That's Coretta Scott. She goes to the New
England Conservatory of Music.' And the rest is civil rights
history.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the ``fly honey'' comment might be a bit revisionist for a
tour of Boston. But Rigaud knows her facts about the subject of her
tour, the South End, a community steeped in neighborhood activism
and ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Rigaud is one of 20 tour guides employed by the Multicultural
Youth Tour of What's Now (MYTOWN). Nearly three years old, the
nonprofit group uses young people to point out lesser-known
neighborhood landmarks, providing tour groups with a deeper
understanding of recent local history. While other Boston
excursions may dwell on Colonial and revolutionary times, the young
historians of MYTOWN focus on the last 100 &UR;  &LR; years of urban
development.
</P>
<P>
   On their guided two-hour walking tours, they tell the less
traditional stories of community action and contributions to the
city by people of color. ``Stuff doesn't get told because people
don't ask,'' tour guide Elizabeth Miranda, 18, says. ``Whether you
work in Fidelity or you're cleaning the streets, you better know
that street. It's all about ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the South End is often associated with young, well-to-do
residents of gentrified bow-front homes, longtime South Enders know
its rich history of immigrants and minorities. A potpourri of
Irish, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, Chinese, Greek, Syrian,
Puerto Rican, and Jewish people have filled the neighborhood over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The South End was built on filled land when Beacon Hill grew
overcrowded with well-to-do Brahmins in the 1850s. These families
migrated to the South End _ or built houses there for their
servants _ but soon fled to the Back Bay during strong waves of
immigration. Over the years, its brick and brownstone row houses
were turned into rooming houses, and it is only within the past 30
years that so many high-income residents have found a haven in this
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Each MYTOWN tour selects 10 to 12 neighborhood stops from a pool
of more than 60 points of interest. In her debut stop, rookie guide
Danielle Youngblood, 17, of Dorchester, explains how Charlie's
Sandwich Shoppe on Columbus Avenue was one of the few places black
jazz musicians would be served after their gigs in the 1920s and
'30s. She points to her feet. Members of her tour group see two
pairs of dice _ lucky sevens _ embedded in the sidewalk, indicating
the gambling scene at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Things like that often go unnoticed in an everyday stroll. The
small Union United Methodist Church, 485 Columbus Ave., was a stop
on the Underground Railroad. The attractive apartment complex of
Tent City, 130 Dartmouth St., was the fruit of neighborhood protest
for affordable housing during urban renewal. State Representative
Byron Rushing's campaign headquarters are stationed at the former
Academy of Musical Arts, 547 Columbus Ave., a studio that offered
dance and music lessons to working-class families for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the legwork needed to unearth South End history took
place outside library doors. Few of the stories told by tour guides
are documented; MYTOWN historians collect them by taking the oral
histories of the South End residents who remember the desegregation
crisis, urban renewal, and King's march on Boston in April 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is the preservation capital of the world,'' says
co-founder Karilyn Crockett. ``But at MYTOWN, we don't put history
in a climate-controlled box that's never to be used again. To us,
preservation is an act of sharing, not hoarding, information.''
</P>
<P>
   MYTOWN is the brainchild of Crockett and Denise Thomas, both
Yale University seniors in 1995 when they came up with the idea. As
an African-American raised in Dorchester, Crockett says, she found
it hard to feel like a Bostonian when the schools taught her only
about the likes of Paul Revere and John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Children ``at school are learning about the Tea Party and our
patriot fathers,'' Crockett says. ``They sound like cool enough
guys, but they don't help people understand what's happened in our
neighborhoods for the past 150 years. There's a broader part of
history that must be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women started MYTOWN out of a combination bedroom and
office in the Dorchester home of Crockett's uncle, alternating
nights sleeping on the cot and bed. They first secured the initial
$30,000 grant from the New York Echoing Green Foundation, which
awards money to college graduates who start social justice
projects. Since then, MYTOWN has subsisted on money from local
foundation and individual contributors. Tour prices are set on a
sliding scale, anywhere from $2.50 to $15 per person. (For example,
school groups pay less than for-profit organizations.) MYTOWN's
target audience is Boston residents, primarily middle- and
high-school students.
</P>
<P>
   In the organization's cramped downtown office above a Downtown
Crossing storefront, the largest room belongs to the youth
historians who make MYTOWN happen. Three young but experienced
guides are shouting out their picks for the newest batch of MYTOWN
youth guides. Over 70 teenagers have applied for just 13 spots for
the summer. Thomas holds a fat Magic Marker as she points to each
name on the oversize tablet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a Latino here,'' says Miranda. ``This is
multicultural.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an Asian, yo!'' shouts Huong Hoang, 17. ``I'm the only
sistah here!''

THE BUFFETT OF THE BOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Buffett is the widely admired ``Wizard of Omaha,'' and
the entire investment world is constantly trying to divine his
every move. Class A stock in his company, Berkshire Hathaway, sells
for an astounding $78,400 a share.
</P>
<P>
   No one we know has ever called Christopher Makepeace ``the
Wizard of Wareham,'' but at $11,600 a share his company, A.D.
Makepeace Co., has the distinction of being the priciest stock in
all of Massachusetts. If Buffett knows investing, Chris Makepeace
knows cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Makepeace is the largest owner of Ocean Spray Cranberries
Inc., the giant cooperative that dominates the cranberry business
in a way that General Motors could only dream about in the auto
business. And Makepeace is maybe the largest private land owner in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But don't rush out to load up on the stock. With about 80
percent of Makepeace still held by the family and the rest by a
couple of institutions and a handful of ``collectors,'' the stock
rarely trades. The last trade, in fact, was April 2, when two _
yes, two _ shares traded at $11,600. There's a long waiting list to
get in. ``A 10-share transaction is cataclysmic,'' says one Boston
broker who follows the stock for a few clients.
</P>
<P>
   Among institutions, the T. Rowe Price Small Cap fund owns a
small stake and Wellington Management's Binkley Shorts, who has
long followed the company, has some for clients. Wellington won't
comment, but a Price spokesman says its small-cap manager, Greg
McCrickard, likes the ``asset-rich company.''
</P>
<P>
   Asset rich, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Makepeace owns 15,000 acres of land, about 12,000 of that in
Eastern Massachusetts. The land is carried on the balance sheet at
about $17 million, its value in 1922. But consider: Makepeace has
about 1,750 acres in cultivation; value that at the going rate of
$40,000 an acre and the cranberry bogs and the abutting land alone
has a value of about $70 million. This is a company with a market
value of just $81 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the land, Makepeace is Ocean Spray's biggest
producer. The company harvested nearly 300,000 barrels of
cranberries last year, up 54 percent for a disappointing 1996 crop.
Makepeace had net income of $1.9 million on $14.7 million in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   As Ocean Spray's biggest producer, Makepeace is also the
cooperative's biggest owner, with a 7 percent stake. If Ocean Spray
were valued at maybe two times revenues _ the number being used to
value Seagram's proposed spinoff of Tropicana _ the cranberry co-op
would be worth about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's slow growth and flat payouts to cranberry growers
has created a fair amount of unrest down on the farm, particularly
among younger growers who are stuck with big debt to pay off their
bogs. Makepeace in its annual report says it is encouraging Ocean
Spray ``to explore structural alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say those alternatives could range as wide as
taking a part of the company public to selling a piece of the
company to a strategic partner such as Pepsico, which has a
distribution agreement with Ocean Spray. Robert L. Rosbe Jr.,
Makepeace's vice president for finance, talks in considerably more
modest terms of ``finding ways to raise growth capital'' and the
``constraints'' of being a cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Makepeace still operates more like a private company than a
public one. But those who follow Makepeace say it has been shifting
away from a tightly managed family enterprise. Rosbe came from a
venture capital firm two years ago and handles much of the business
side, allowing Chris Makepiece, the chief executive, to focus on
the actual cranberry production. John Drew, who is married to a
family member, was brought in about 1 1/2 years ago to manage the
real estate side.
</P>
<P>
   Makepeace's development plans have generated some concern,
particularly in the towns of Carver and Wareham. Rosbe says
developing Makepeace's huge holdings ``is going to be a much
longer-range process than most people would expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another long-term issue to watch: the family itself. The
Makepeace family is now in its sixth generation, many of them far
removed from the cranberry business. How many similar situations
have we seen where the issue was not how did the business get the
family here, but what kind of returns can it produce for the kids
going forward?

HENRY LEE LUCAS ENDED UP ON DEATH ROW BECAUSE OF HIS OWN WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ In many respects, Henry Lee Lucas was the
author of his own death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-born drifter was scheduled to be executed June 23
for what had been the all-but-forgotten rape and murder of an
unknown woman near Georgetown in 1979. But that sentence was
commuted to a life term on Friday by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, any suggestion that the man who once confessed
to some 600 killings deserves mercy might seem ludicrous. Beginning
15 years ago this month, Lucas joined law enforcement officials
from numerous states at one crime scene after another where he
coldly described a series of stabbings, drownings and
strangulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even after investigations by news reporters and the Texas
attorney general's office proved that most of the confessions were
false, Lucas generated little sympathy because law officers
remained convinced that he had killed somebody.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had served 10 years in a Michigan prison for
fatally stabbing his 74-year-old mother and, more recently, led
police to a prairie in Denton where they found the dismembered
remains of the 15-year-old girl whom he described as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   So there was little surprise when Lucas was condemned to die for
the Georgetown slaying. But the conviction rested not on eyewitness
accounts, not on rock-solid physical evidence and not on a mountain
of circumstantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lucas' own words _ repeated to lawmen, captured on
videotape and written on paper _ that put him on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed her ... by strangling her with my hands,'' Lucas said
in a written statement presented to jurors at his 1984 trial. It
describes the slaying of a brown-haired woman whose body, clad only
in orange socks, was found in a culvert off Interstate 35 in rural
Williamson County on Halloween 1979. ``She was later undressed, and
I had sex with her after she was dead,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
last week said the recommendation that the death sentence be
commuted hinged on doubts that Lucas was in Texas when the woman
was killed, prosecutors and jurors at the time were not swayed by
any alibi testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Lee Lucas is a cold-blooded murderer,'' said Williamson
County District Attorney Ken Anderson, who as a deputy prosecutor
in 1984 helped win the conviction. ``The jury looked at all the
evidence that his defenders now say clears him and they rejected
it. So have the 23 judges who have looked at this case on appeal.''
Because of the publicity Lucas' confessions generated in Williamson
County, the trial in the ``Orange Socks'' murder was moved to San
Angelo and began in April 1984. Anderson and then-District Attorney
Ed Walsh built their case on the numerous confessions that Lucas
had handed them.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Lucas had recanted the confessions, saying
that they were hoaxes designed to toy with police. He claimed that
he had actually been working as a roofer in Jacksonville, Fla.,
when ``Orange Socks'' was killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to trial transcripts in the archives of the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals, prosecutors read aloud for the jury of
eight women and four men Lucas' single-page admission of guilt,
which he had signed at 10:47 a.m. on June, 23, 1983, in the
presence of then-Sheriff Jim Boutwell.
</P>
<P>
   They also played audio tapes of Lucas talking with Boutwell
about the strangulation and postmortem sex.
</P>
<P>
   Then they showed a video of Lucas at the crime scene. Handcuffed
and wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, Lucas is seen stepping over a
guardrail as he simulates dragging the woman's body to the huge
concrete culvert near the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' lawyers argued that the confessions should not have been
admitted into evidence. But Judge John Carter rejected their
assertions that the statements had been coerced and that Lucas,
heavily medicated with Thorazine to control a mental illness, was
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony, Boutwell said Lucas was often informed of his
rights and just as often waived offers that an attorney be provided
for him. On at least one occasion, Boutwell testified, Lucas
insisted that a lawyer who had shown up uninvited at the jail be
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Boutwell, who died in December 1993, said that an uncoached
Lucas led them to a culvert about 30 miles north of Austin where a
woman's body had been found.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Boutwell acknowledged that on some
occasions, Lucas had key facts about the case wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Max Parker asked Boutwell: ``Isn't it a fact,
sheriff, that when you first talked to him on June 22nd (1983) ...
he thought the lady had blond hair, not brown hair?''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Boutwell: ``He mentioned a lady with blond hair, yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker: ``Initially, didn't he tell you he took the body out
into a field or some type of ... secluded area?''
</P>
<P>
   Boutwell: ``That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Two foremen from the Jacksonville roofing company testified that
work records showed that Lucas was on the job during the last week
of October and early November 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors again used Lucas' own words to poke holes in the
alibis. They played tape recordings of Lucas saying that the
foremen had accepted kickbacks from absent roofers who were marked
present for work.
</P>
<P>
   The foremen adamantly denied falsifying work documents. But
during cross-examination, Anderson confronted them with records
showing that each had served prison time for convictions such as
fraud, theft and passing hot checks.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from psychiatrists suggesting that mental illness
prompted Lucas to make a false confession also had little or no
effect on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   When the testimony ended, jurors deliberated a little more than
nine hours before returning the guilty verdict. Then they decided
on the death penalty after a 45-minute discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Virginia on Aug. 23, 1936, the last of 12 children,
Lucas said he grew up neglected and abused, taunted by a mother who
was a prostitute and who committed sex acts in his presence. His
father, a railroad brakeman whose legs were severed when he was hit
by a rail car in a freight yard, spent his spare hours drunk, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas recalled being an unsupervised child whose family migrated
from Virginia to Maryland to Michigan. He never made it past the
fourth grade and said his first arrest came at age 15 for stealing
food. He was sent to a reformatory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Lucas was convicted of second-degree murder in Michigan
for the stabbing death of his mother, Viola.
</P>
<P>
   A drifter with an extensive criminal record, Lucas began his
rise to notoriety inauspiciously in June 1983 when he was taken
into custody in Montague County for being an ex-con with a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff actually suspected that he killed 80-year-old
Ringgold resident Kate Rich 10 months earlier, but lacked enough
evidence. But the sheriff got a break when Lucas confessed to the
stabbing and mutilation of the elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   He also confessed to killing Freida Lorraine ``Becky'' Powell,
the 15-year-old he called his wife. Soon thereafter, he became a
confession machine who earned him international headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Now 61 _ the oldest of the 454 inmates on Texas' Death Row _
Lucas bears little resemblance to the lean, cold-eyed desperado who
came forth with those ghastly confessions 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His once-rugged face is wrinkled, pale and puffy. The coarse
black hair is mostly gray, and his words are tinged with regret
over what he calls his wasted life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame myself for letting people walk all over me,'' Lucas
said. ``I should have been a man and stood up on my own two feet.
But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that Lucas will ever walk free again. He
is serving 10 sentences, including six life terms, and he still
faces murder charges in other states, including a Florida case that
could carry the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Many who question his guilt in the ``Orange Socks'' case believe
that he killed Powell, Rich and possibly others. Few express
sympathy for Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Wise County Sheriff Phil Ryan, who as a Texas Ranger was among
the first lawmen to hear Lucas' confessions, said he wouldn't have
lost any sleep if Lucas were executed. Ryan said he believes that
Lucas is a killer but remains undecided about his guilt in the
``Orange Socks'' murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody deserves to die for something he didn't do,'' Ryan
said, ``it would be Henry.''

CHRISTIAN BROTHER HAS A CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH BIG BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than two years have passed since the FBI
decided St. Mary's College communications professor Ray Berta, a
Roman Catholic brother, might be the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Ray is OK now, but for a while there, the man of God's
mild clerical demeanor went on sabbatical and he stormed about the
college's Moraga, Calif., campus breathing fire and brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   `I felt terribly violated,'' Ray, a member of the religious
order Fratres Scholarum Christianarum, told the college newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any notions Americans have of personal privacy are bogus _ it
just does not exist,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame him for taking such a dim view of things.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 57, found out he was a target only when a television
reporter called the public information officer at St. Mary's for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had worked up a dossier on Ray without his knowledge _
to the extent of secretly presenting the college with a court order
for his personnel file. Someone then leaked it all to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Brother Ray was among the last to learn that Big Brother
thought he might be the terrorist who turned out to be Theodore
Kaczynski. The FBI had zeroed in on Ray so stealthily and in such
detail, it made the hair on the back of his neck stand up like
stalactites in a catacomb. He was a match on 13 of 16 key
identifiers in the portrait FBI profilers had worked up.
</P>
<P>
   Some identifiers were simple, like gender, facial hair, glasses
and both academic and connections in the San Francisco area. Others
were out there in the Major Improbabilty Zone _ if you assume, as
Ray did (incorrectly), that government isn't watching all of us,
all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Such as: Born in the early 1940s in or near Chicago; graduated
in 1958 from a Chicago-area high school; worked or studied in the
southern part of mid-Michigan in the late '60s and early '70s;
dislikes technology; and at some point was linked to Northwestern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the one that gave Ray the absolute creeps and, as he
claims, made the G-men and women especially attentive: flew out of
Salt Lake City on Aug. 8, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been in the Chicago area because my father was ill, but
the doctors told me I might as well return to California,'' Ray
recalled. ``So I left O'Hare in the morning, but the plane had
trouble and landed in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was there, the airline contacted me, said my father
had passed away and arranged for me to get back to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same day, the Unabomber had something to do with Salt Lake
City; what it was, I don't know. So my presence in Salt Lake for
two or three hours triggered that match with the FBI profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal public defender Quin Denvir, Kaczynski's attorney, said
that while the Unabomber was linked to Salt Lake City on several
occasions in the '80s, he wasn't aware of anything in the summer of
1995. But Ray is certain of the date, Aug. 8, 1995, because that's
when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   I asked FBI spokesman George Grotz about this matter. He
politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received over 55,000 calls in this case, and of those about
2,100 rose to a level for us to take a look,'' Grotz said, ``but
we're not saying who they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kaczynski's name came up, there were maybe 1,000 names
remaining on the list. For a short period of time agents continued
to work those names. The overwhelming majority weren't aware they
were on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Christian brother? ``All I can say is we received
information about individuals from very diverse backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ray learned the FBI was on his tail, he was told by a St.
Mary's administrator that the bureau wanted him to call a toll-free
number. He was informed, in a very official, totally unapologetic
way, that his profile had been cranked into a worldwide web of
computers. He'd auditioned for bogeyman without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   What made the whole affair especially disturbing was the fact
that the Unabomber's carnage had indirectly touched the college in
1993, when University of California at San Francisco geneticist
Charles Epstein, brother of St. Mary's Dean Edwin Epstein, was
wounded by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it all hurt a great deal; now Ray laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when I'm teaching freshmen,'' he said, ``I know a hand
will go up and a student will ask, `What's this about the
Unabomber?' I'll say, `You'd better get a good grade _ or I'll blow
you up.'''

   TAKE-BOS  
 (a and f coding)  
 PORTLAND, Maine: ... of the '90s.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is cheering over the growing opportunities for
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry some people in Maine have is the jobs that are being
created are not high-paying jobs,'' said John Davulis, an economist
with Central Maine Power. ``So we get a call center, and it's not
providing nearly the livable income that one would get from working
at a paper mill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some call centers, such as that run by credit card
giant MBNA in Belfast, pay a starting annual salary of $20,000 with
health benefits, other companies pay less. But many offer a good
benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy also has changed the face of many small towns.
</P>
<P>
   While York, which is within commuting distance to Boston, once
had much unused commercial space, ``everything that's available is
now being gobbled up,'' said planner Brian Chernack. And places
like Falmouth that once were sleepy farming and fishing villages
are being transformed into bedroom communities and retirement
havens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these towns are now grappling with school crowding and
overburdened municipal services.
</P>
<P>
   The economic activity is contributing to what Lachance calls
``the bathtub effect.'' Look at Maine's census data, and it appears
that someone pulled the plug in York County and the population
started draining south.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has flowed from Aroostook County, the vast, mostly
wilderness area of northern Maine that has awed outdoorsmen but
discouraged new businesses. There, in small towns that border
rolling acres of potatoes and broccoli, the future is far removed
from the simple certainties that colored life for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Aroostook County, the least-populated county in the state, has
lost 11.3 percent of its residents since 1990. Much of that loss
occurred after Loring Air Force Base closed in 1994, and 9,000
people _ military personnel and their dependents _ left the small
town of Limestone for new assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint heard over and over again in ``The County,''
as Aroostook residents refer to their home, is that young people
with educations are leaving as soon as practicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to keep our kids here anymore,'' says Jo-ann
Lewis, 57, who calls numbers for senior-citizen bingo games at the
American Legion hall in Caribou.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis smiles faintly when asked about the call-center jobs and
other telecommunication work that King hopes will help keep young
adults in northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the type of calls we used to hang up on,'' Lewis
says. ``People here aren't used to that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the air base is also felt keenly in the Caribou
business district, where a once-bustling commercial strip is now
dotted with vacant department stores and dozens of empty parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Sloan, a saleswoman at the Buzzels clothing store, is
discouraged about the local economy, but hopes the state can find
some long-term solutions for the region. ``Don't think of us as the
end of the line,'' she pleads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; King says he has made economic assistance for the area, and
other rural counties, a priority of his administration. ``We want
people to stay if they want to,'' the governor says. ``No young
person should have to leave Maine to find a decent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Buzzels clothing store, a small step is
being taken to make that goal a reality. There, in a previously
empty building bought for a dollar, two brothers have moved a
business that sells computer software for tax preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Forty employees, most of them from the area, will work in
downtown Caribou, eat lunch there, and begin using those empty
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think this is a neat thing to do, we really do,''
says Gregory Jackson, marketing director for ATX Forms, the
software company. ``We decided we'd like to be part of the rebirth
of a downtown, if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   So &UR;  &LR; when co-owner Glynn Willette was searching for a place to
move the business from cramped quarters in nearby Washburn, the
withering environs of Caribou looked like the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have an employee who wants to live in northern Maine,
that takes a certain kind of person,'' Jackson said. ``He's
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the telecommunications infrastructure in Aroostook
County, Jackson says, ATX can put down roots in Caribou and compete
globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as much in the world as anybody,'' he says, waving to
Willette as his boss jogs up the street to his son's Little League
game.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude matches the pep-rally enthusiasm that Brian Hamel
brings to his job as president of the Loring Redevelopment
Authority. With missionary zeal, Hamel extols the benefits of the
base's sprawling facilities and the area's ready pool of workers.
Already, Hamel says, the base has attracted enough new jobs and
commitments to replace the 1,100 civilian positions that were lost
when Loring closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel, a native of Amesbury, Mass., knows firsthand that the
popular perception of northern Maine is an uninviting one. But now,
his wife and three daughters would fight any decision to leave
Aroostook County after their four years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and family thought I had lost my marbles,'' said
Hamel, who previously worked on the redevelopment of the former
Pease Air Force Base outside Portsmouth, N.H. ``Now, my house is
like a bed and breakfast in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy in remote Maine is depressed enough that
Galen Rose, an economist with the state planning office, says that
``if it's not as bad as it gets in New England, it's pretty
close.''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Donihue, an economics professor at Colby College, is
skeptical that high technology is on the verge of becoming a major
player there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to say that we are going to develop a Silicon Valley in
Bangor or Caribou, that just isn't going to happen,'' Donihue says.
However, he adds, ``a few software manufacturing firms would make a
huge difference'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges of spreading the state's economic
benefits more evenly, Maine has rarely had as much appeal _ for
vacationers and entrepreneurs alike.
</P>
<P>
   King senses that, and is criss-crossing the state with a mantra
of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that appeal must be working. Up for
re-election this fall, King enjoys soaring popularity ratings. But
he deflects credit from himself to the ripple effects of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like someone who woke up on third base and thinks he
hit a triple,'' the governor says. ``Maine is one of the most
beautiful places on the planet. It is. It's a beautiful place with
a great infrastructure and great people. Therefore, we're going to
succeed.''

   OIL-ROUGH-NECKS (Abilene, Texas) _ Many ``rough necks'' _
laborers on oil rigs _ lost their jobs when oil prices hit bottom
in the late 1980s. Such a big glut of workers was created that for
years new opportunities in the field were almost nonexistent. When
prices strengthened several years ago, though, the oil-service
companies suddenly found that a whole generation of workers had
vanished, and they have been scrambling ever since to catch up. Oil
prices have fallen again, but this time, some industry executives
argue, the pool of skilled workers has shrunk so much that the
labor shortage will persist for at least several years. By Agis

LOW RATES POWER UTILITY STOCK SURGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Utility stocks have had a good run lately.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about that is that they've done it in a
still-strong stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities have been the best-performing sector of the market
for the last four weeks,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks, as measured by the Dow Jones utility average,
were up 3.3 percent, compared with a 0.9 percent decline in the
benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unusual in bull markets,'' Johnson said. ``The worst
sector for the market during a bull market has consistently been
the utility sector since 1945.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because in a bull market, investors care more about the
price appreciation of their stock than the dividends it pays out.
Consequently, utility stocks traditionally have been a safe haven
for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has become increasingly vulnerable due to the
fact that corporate earnings are not going to be able to keep pace
with these high PEs (price/earnings ratios),'' said Bruce Bittles,
market strategist at J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in Nashville, a brokerage
firm. ``Investors are going to get more defensive as times go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor juicing up utility stocks is that interest
rates are low. Electric utilities historically have been loaded
with debt because they borrowed money for projects such as power
plant construction. As interest rates fall, it becomes cheaper for
them to repay their debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the construction is virtually over, and they're using
their excess capital to pay down debt,'' said Geraldine Weiss,
editor of Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla, Calif., an
investment newsletter. ``They've pared them way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates also make utility stocks more attractive,
compared with bonds. Because of their steady dividend income,
utility stocks have behaved more like bonds than stocks and compete
with bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of utilities depends heavily on their dividend
yield, which represents the annual percentage return on your
investment flowing from a company's dividends. When interest rates
are low, it makes the dividend yield more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   When you invest in utilities, you're betting that rates will
stay low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like it's going to be very difficult for the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates anytime soon, primarily due
to the deflationary forces that continue to filter throughout our
economy,'' Bittles said.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at utility stocks today, be very selective because
utilities no longer have the lock on the market as they used to,
thanks to deregulation and increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   For example, non-utility companies such as Houston-based Enron
Corp. are getting into the electric business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for utilities in areas where the population is growing,
where industry is growing,'' said Les Fox, a money manager at Dain
Rauscher in Houston, an investment firm. ``Look for utilities that
have shown an ability to diversify outside of their own
traditionally regulated business, such as selling power directly to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation and consolidation are forcing utilities to watch
their bottom line, and that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation of the electric utilities is causing a lot of
consolidation, causing utilities to get more cost-conscious than
they have been in the past, more bottom-line and
investor-friendly,'' Bittles said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just invest in Houston Industries, the parent company of
Houston Lighting &AMP; Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, people simply buy their own local utilities,''
said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at the Edward Jones
brokerage firm in St. Louis. ``We think that's a dangerous practice
today. You really have to do your homework and invest in
high-quality companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get hung up on the dividend yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yield is not the best indicator of the return you should
expect,'' Skrainka said. ``It's really the dividends plus any
change in the stock price, and companies that are high-quality,
low-cost companies should be able to grow earnings and dividends
and therefore the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the utility isn't paying too fat a dividend from its
earnings. That's called the ``payout ratio,'' the percentage of a
firm's profits that's paid in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Skrainka said a reasonable payout ratio for utilities is 65 to
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is paying out 90 percent of its earnings in
dividends, there is no cushion and margin for error, and a dividend
cut may be looming,'' he said.

RENO ERRED BIGTIME IN HANDLING THE LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- To arange the scenery properly for Linda Tripp
Week, it helps to know a few things about Attorney General Janet
Reno's slipshod handling of this entire mess in January, confirmed
by past and present associates:
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general made no effort to inquire into the content
of the Tripp-Monica Lewinsky tape recordings made in the months
before Tripp was wired by the independent counsel's office for one
last recording on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general, moreover, made no serious effort to
inquire into that final, roughly 90-minute tape _ neither its
content nor circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   _She also did nothing to check Kenneth Starr's claim in his
request for jurisdiction in the Lewinsky matter that there was an
overlap between people caught up in it and in other subjects he was
investigating that involved (Reno's words) ``possible efforts to
influence witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   _The attorney general was (pick one) bullied, intimidated, or
threatened by Starr and his people into making a snap decision. By
telling her that Newsweek was preparing an article on the Tripp
tapes, they were telling Reno that if she did not give them the
case, Newsweek would be reporting a sensational sex and coverup
story along with her refusal to let an independent counsel
investigate it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Starr and Reno had a private meeting. No details
available, but one hopes she is finally getting serious about
Starr's having played her like a violin.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, an issue that goes to the heart of the case,
or to its official origin. The one refrain always heard from
Starr's office and its Republican and journalistic amen corner as
the rookie prosecutor's credibility and behavioral problems mount,
is that his investigation was based upon the determination of the
attorney general herself.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. It was not a determination by a fact-finding
gatekeeper, it was paper shuffling along an automated transmission
belt. The stupid law under which independent counsels operate has
many, much-discussed flaws, but it has no chance at all of ever
working properly unless the attorney general performs the tasks
assigned that office with far more diligence than Reno has shown.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, one of the least accurate sentences in the
entire Lewinsky so-called investigation was made by the AG at the
top of her jurisdiction-expanding petition to the allegedly
supervising US Court of Appeal panel here on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In accordance with the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act
of 1994, I hereby notify in writing the special division of the
court that I have commenced a preliminary investigation ... into
whether violations of federal criminal law were committed by Monica
Lewinsky or any other individual, as described below.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``preliminary investigation'' consists in Reno's petition
of nothing beyond the Jan. 14 tape of Tripp, wearing the FBIs wire,
and Lewinsky. And, in fact, it did consist of nothing beyond that,
which means there was no such investigation at all.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been, she might have learned that the tapes Tripp
herself made of Lewinsky consist of a variety of conflicting tales,
none of them bearing directly on obstruction of justice, and all of
them raising questions about just who was suborning whose perjury;
she might also have learned, had she inquired, more about how the
final tape came about, particularly how Tripp was scripted by
Starr's office to elicit alleged obstruction comments regarding
Vernon Jordan that have yet to receive an ounce of direct
corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, Reno associates note that she was at least
exposed to Monica Lewinsky's words that she intended to lie when
deposed in the Paula Jones case, that she was urging Tripp to lie,
and that Reno had an obvious conflict there because the Jones case
involved President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No sale. The whole idea of the independent counsel law is that
its trigger must be credible evidence, which is subverted if there
no serious effort to assess credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, perfunctory or no examination makes an attorney general
vulnerable to the presentation of a slanted or edited case. At this
point, given what he knew and didn't know in January, Starr's
presentation to Reno resembled the cut and paste job Representative
Dan Burton's slimy aide, David Bossie, did on Webster Hubbell's
prison tapes this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Reno's response didn't ask for what Starr didn't tell.

   SONOMA-WINES (Sonoma, Calif.) _ Residents of Sonoma County will
say this much about their neighbor to the west: Napa is better
known and has better restaurants. That said, they wouldn't dream of
living there. They would have to give up their wild and spectacular
coastline. They would have to abandon their magnificent fruits and
vegetables, superb cheeses and foie gras, prize-winning olive oil,
succulent lamb and pristine oysters. They would have to leave the
low-key atmosphere that attracts fascinating (some would say
eccentric) characters. And, of course, they would have to give up
bragging rights on those Sonoma pinot noirs and chardonnays, wines
they would put up against Napa's any day. By Marian Burros.

TECHNOLOGY BOOMLET ENERGIZING MAINE'S ECONOMY

   PORTLAND, Maine _ It's not just about paper, shoes, and lobsters
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is undergoing one of the most profound changes in its
economic history. Long dependent on textiles, logging, and fishing,
Maine is enjoying a boomlet driven by the sorts of things that
people ``from away'' associate more with Route 128 than
Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   A major computer-chip manufacturer recently expanded its
operations in South Portland. Statewide, 5,000 telephone jockeys
sell everything from Red Sox credit cards to European rental cars.
Biotechnology is now worth more than the lobstering and potato
industries combined. And Maine's top international export last year
was not lobsters, Bass shoes, or paper products _ it was electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Moody's is questioning if we have a diversified economy.
Ha!'' state treasurer Dale McCormick says of the bond-rating
company that recently reviewed Maine's financial situation for
money borrowing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maine suffered with the rest of New England during the recession
of the late 1980s. But by the spring of 1997, state officials said,
it had regained all of the 35,000 jobs it lost, and since then, has
added 5,000 more. Since January 1990, the state's nonagricultural
employment has grown by 6.7 percent, according to the US Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's resurgence, impressive as it is, has been outpaced by
New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts, whose nonagricultural
jobs this decade have grown by 12.8 percent, 8.4 percent, and 7.7
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But emerging in Maine, perhaps more than elsewhere in New
England, are economic shifts that could neutralize the state's
geographic isolation, long seen as an impediment to economic
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer at the end of the line,'' says Governor Angus
S. King Jr., the popular Independent who has preached the gospel of
economic development from Kittery to Calais.
</P>
<P>
   That optimism seems to ring true outside the state as well.
Despite any questions Moody's may have had, Maine's bond rating was
upgraded recently for the first time since 1982, enabling it to get
a favorable interest rate on money it borrows.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Maine has prospered so neatly from the recent
economic upswing. Although the unemployment rate in Cumberland
County, the hub of Maine's economy, is a statewide-low 2.1 percent,
Washington County on the Canadian border lags with 9.1 percent of
its population out of work.
</P>
<P>
   And while Maine as a whole has recovered from the recession, job
growth in most of the state's 16 counties has not nearly kept pace
with Cumberland and York in the south. Between 1990 and 1996,
according to state economist Laurie Lachance, more than 10,000 jobs
were created in Maine _ and 8,000 of those were in Cumberland
County, which includes the city of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   King does not like to use the term, ``the two Maines,'' but he
acknowledges the division exists. And how to narrow the gap between
rural and suburban Maine is as difficult a question as it has ever
been. &UR;  &LR; ``It's the most serious economic issue we have,'' King says
of the imbalance in wealth and jobs. ``It's why I decided to run
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aroostook County, for example, more than 10,000 people have
moved away this decade; unemployment is 7.2 percent, or nearly
twice the state average; and longtime residents wonder how they can
persuade their children to stay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While low-paying jobs such as laborers and store clerks are a
hard fact of life for many in remote Maine, the state's coast and
Interstate 95 corridor are bustling. And the jewel of the crown,
the sea-girt city of Portland, fairly glistens.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Port section has been a hot attraction for tourists for
20 years _ and is even hotter now. Its cobblestone streets are
lined with boutiques. Its bars evoke a nostalgic, inviting feel of
maritime New England. And its restaurants rise significantly above
the provincial.
</P>
<P>
   Theater, arts, and sports contribute to the feel of a hip city
on the move. Add to that a jetport, soon-to-be-revived rail service
to Boston, proximity to beaches and mountains, and the city seems
to have it made.
</P>
<P>
   Says Scott Bonney, 36, the former manager of the Old Port
Tavern: ``I've been around the world three times. And from April to
October, there's no better place to be than here. You don't find
these places in America anymore.'' He said many Maine-raised
engineers who fled in search of work are coming back to take
advantage of new opportunities here.
</P>
<P>
   Morten Asbjornsen would agree. Asbjornsen edits Interface
Monthly magazine and directs the Old Port Technology Center, a
recently opened collection of high-tech businesses operating under
one roof in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks who are doing technology can do it anywhere,''
Asbjornsen says. ``And there's no reason to go to Boston or New
York City or California when you can do it in Portland, Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-chip manufacturer National Semiconductor recently
invested $830 million in a new facility in South
Portland. &UR;  &LR; National and its spinoff, Fairchild Semiconductor,
employ more than 2,000 people here. Other major employers include
insurance companies, paper and shoe manufacturers, supermarket
chains, hospitals, and retailers. Bath Iron Works, a defense
contractor, remains the state's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for high-tech workers in Maine now outpaces supply, as it
does in the other New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Griffith runs the Great Moose Lake Corp. in Scarborough, a
recruiting company for high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be: `Come back to Maine! Work twice as hard for
half the pay!''' Griffith said. ``That doesn't happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine has 50,000 miles of fiberoptic cables and sophisticated
switching systems that make its telecommunications infrastructure a
major selling point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can say, with a pretty high level of assurance, that
we have the best telecommunications infrastructure in all of New
England,'' King boasts.
</P>
<P>
   That advantage helps explain why Maine has approximately 5,000
jobs in call centers _ offices where operators handle a company's
telephone work, such telemarketing, catalog sales, technical
support or billing questions _ and recently announced the addition
of 750 more. &UR;  &LR; Another factor may be that wages generally are less
than they are in places like metropolitan Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' King says, ``the call center is the factory of
the '90s.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, settles into office,
soldiers are returning to their barracks and students to their
dorms, and some hardy American investors are mulling over returning
to Indonesia.
 &HT;    For investors, getting in on the ground floor of an Indonesian
recovery would be a bonanza. In the last year, political
instability and Asia's economic turmoil combined to reduce prices
of Indonesian debt and equity to almost derisory levels.
Bottom-fishing investors can now buy what were once well-regarded
companies and financial assets for pennies on the dollar. An
economic rebound would make millions for those daring enough to
fish in Indonesia's murky, choppy markets.
 &HT;    With Washington and Tokyo seemingly determined to stabilize the
yen and promote a regional recovery in Asia, this might look like a
good time. But Indonesia's troubles run deep, and what looks like
an opportunity today may become a disaster in the not-too-distant
future.
 &HT;    Indonesia, an archipelago of 13,000-plus islands, is the largest
Muslim country in the world and the fourth most populous country
overall. Nevertheless, the Indonesian state is fragile. Its 214
million people speak hundreds of different languages. Their
backgrounds range from the ritualized and ancient Javanese
civilization to tribal cultures of Irian Jaya.
 &HT;    As with many African countries, the only thing many of
Indonesia's peoples had in common at independence was the
experience of colonial domination by the same nation. In
Indonesia's case, that was the Dutch, who finally withdrew in 1949.
 &HT;    Bad as the former president, Suharto, was in many respects, he
ran a stable regime that kept Indonesia's disparate elements in
place. He also steadied a turbulent region while helping to balance
China's growing power. The climate of peace and cooperation that
Suharto promoted _ notably with his neighbors in Malaysia and
Singapore _ did much to set the stage for the region's explosive
economic growth.
 &HT;    Suharto relied on the armed forces and the economy to hold the
country together. Both were built up _ primarily through patronage
and corruption _ under his long reign and both now face the
difficult task of gaining popular trust and legitimacy.
 &HT;    That won't be easy, and the main reason is the economy.
Indonesians _ like Americans _ seem willing to tolerate
presidential hanky-panky when the economy is strong. And for most
of Suharto's tenure the economy was extremely strong.
 &HT;    Thanks to family planning and economic growth, per capita gross
domestic product rose by an average of 4.3 percent annually from
1965 to 1988. As the Far Eastern Economic Review points out, this
was one of the highest sustained increases in living standards in
the world.
 &HT;    The poverty rate dropped from an estimated 70 percent of the
population in 1970 to about 15 percent two decades later. At the
same time, however, Suharto allowed the Chinese minority in
Indonesia _ about 3 percent of the population _ to control an
estimated 70 percent of the national economy.
 &HT;    Now that the economy _ and living standards _ are in free fall,
there are widespread calls to investigate the Suharto family's
extensive web of partnerships and cross holdings. Because Suharto
did so much of his business with ethnic Chinese, and because the
Chinese prospered so greatly during his tenure, calls to
investigate and return Suharto family wealth could turn into
something like a general assault on the Chinese businessmen who
largely control the economy.
 &HT;    The trouble, however, is that once the Indonesians start picking
at the threads of economic corruption and political cronyism, the
whole fabric of their national life could unravel. It isn't just a
few bankers and real-estate developers who are tied to the former
ruling family. The whole business class was implicated in an
economic development that was systematically perverted to favor the
Suharto clan.
 &HT;    And it isn't just a handful of generals who participated in
repression and corruption under the ``ancien regime.'' Over the
last 30 years, Suharto reshaped the Indonesian armed forces in his
image.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, a vicious circle is likely to develop as economic
turmoil leads to more anti-Chinese agitation and to calls for new
trials and investigations that a weak government may be powerless
to resist. This would further undermine confidence among the
country's business elite, leading to more capital flight and more
economic turmoil.
 &HT;    Having repressed moderate politicians and prevented responsible
opposition leaders from developing strong national organizations,
Indonesia's elites may now face an inexorable rise of popular fury
as living standards continue to fall.
 &HT;    If this scenario unfolds, both Indonesia and the region are in
for much more tumult than we have yet seen. Indonesia could well be
in the early moments of a two-stage revolution _ such as the
Russian and Iranian revolutions. In Stage 1, the old emperor goes
out; in Stage 2, an ineffectual transitional regime is overthrown
by a radical and more permanent successor.
 &HT;    Czarist Russia was a promising emerging market and a friend of
the United States before its October Revolution. Indonesia, many of
whose people rightly accuse Washington of supporting Suharto
through decades of repression, could yet emerge as a world-class
foreign-policy and economic headache.
 &HT;    Without a quick economic recovery, Indonesia could all too
easily slide into chaos or move toward an anti-Western radicalism,
conceivably with Islamist overtones.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, settles into office,
soldiers are returning to their barracks and students to their
dorms, and some hardy American investors are mulling over returning
to Indonesia.
 &HT;    For investors, getting in on the ground floor of an Indonesian
recovery would be a bonanza. In the last year, political
instability and Asia's economic turmoil combined to reduce prices
of Indonesian debt and equity to almost derisory levels.
Bottom-fishing investors can now buy what were once well-regarded
companies and financial assets for pennies on the dollar. An
economic rebound would make millions for those daring enough to
fish in Indonesia's murky, choppy markets.
 &HT;    With Washington and Tokyo seemingly determined to stabilize the
yen and promote a regional recovery in Asia, this might look like a
good time. But Indonesia's troubles run deep, and what looks like
an opportunity today may become a disaster in the not-too-distant
future.
 &HT;    Indonesia, an archipelago of 13,000-plus islands, is the largest
Muslim country in the world and the fourth most populous country
overall. Nevertheless, the Indonesian state is fragile. Its 214
million people speak hundreds of different languages. Their
backgrounds range from the ritualized and ancient Javanese
civilization to tribal cultures of Irian Jaya.
 &HT;    As with many African countries, the only thing many of
Indonesia's peoples had in common at independence was the
experience of colonial domination by the same nation. In
Indonesia's case, that was the Dutch, who finally withdrew in 1949.
 &HT;    Bad as the former president, Suharto, was in many respects, he
ran a stable regime that kept Indonesia's disparate elements in
place. He also steadied a turbulent region while helping to balance
China's growing power. The climate of peace and cooperation that
Suharto promoted _ notably with his neighbors in Malaysia and
Singapore _ did much to set the stage for the region's explosive
economic growth.
 &HT;    Suharto relied on the armed forces and the economy to hold the
country together. Both were built up _ primarily through patronage
and corruption _ under his long reign and both now face the
difficult task of gaining popular trust and legitimacy.
 &HT;    That won't be easy, and the main reason is the economy.
Indonesians _ like Americans _ seem willing to tolerate
presidential hanky-panky when the economy is strong. And for most
of Suharto's tenure the economy was extremely strong.
 &HT;    Thanks to family planning and economic growth, per capita gross
domestic product rose by an average of 4.3 percent annually from
1965 to 1988. As the Far Eastern Economic Review points out, this
was one of the highest sustained increases in living standards in
the world.
 &HT;    The poverty rate dropped from an estimated 70 percent of the
population in 1970 to about 15 percent two decades later. At the
same time, however, Suharto allowed the Chinese minority in
Indonesia _ about 3 percent of the population _ to control an
estimated 70 percent of the national economy.
 &HT;    Now that the economy _ and living standards _ are in free fall,
there are widespread calls to investigate the Suharto family's
extensive web of partnerships and cross holdings. Because Suharto
did so much of his business with ethnic Chinese, and because the
Chinese prospered so greatly during his tenure, calls to
investigate and return Suharto family wealth could turn into
something like a general assault on the Chinese businessmen who
largely control the economy.
 &HT;    The trouble, however, is that once the Indonesians start picking
at the threads of economic corruption and political cronyism, the
whole fabric of their national life could unravel. It isn't just a
few bankers and real-estate developers who are tied to the former
ruling family. The whole business class was implicated in an
economic development that was systematically perverted to favor the
Suharto clan.
 &HT;    And it isn't just a handful of generals who participated in
repression and corruption under the ``ancien regime.'' Over the
last 30 years, Suharto reshaped the Indonesian armed forces in his
image.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, a vicious circle is likely to develop as economic
turmoil leads to more anti-Chinese agitation and to calls for new
trials and investigations that a weak government may be powerless
to resist. This would further undermine confidence among the
country's business elite, leading to more capital flight and more
economic turmoil.
 &HT;    Having repressed moderate politicians and prevented responsible
opposition leaders from developing strong national organizations,
Indonesia's elites may now face an inexorable rise of popular fury
as living standards continue to fall.
 &HT;    If this scenario unfolds, both Indonesia and the region are in
for much more tumult than we have yet seen. Indonesia could well be
in the early moments of a two-stage revolution _ such as the
Russian and Iranian revolutions. In Stage 1, the old emperor goes
out; in Stage 2, an ineffectual transitional regime is overthrown
by a radical and more permanent successor.
 &HT;    Czarist Russia was a promising emerging market and a friend of
the United States before its October Revolution. Indonesia, many of
whose people rightly accuse Washington of supporting Suharto
through decades of repression, could yet emerge as a world-class
foreign-policy and economic headache.
 &HT;    Without a quick economic recovery, Indonesia could all too
easily slide into chaos or move toward an anti-Western radicalism,
conceivably with Islamist overtones.

 FROM: Washingtonian Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The U.S. Navy has ruled that the late Adm. Mike Boorda was
entitled to wear two combat award designations that were being
called into question when he committed suicide two years ago.
 &HT;    Boorda, the Navy's highest-ranking officer as chief of naval
operations, shot himself on May 16, 1996, in the garden outside his
residence at the Navy Yard. As Boorda was taking his life, two
Newsweek reporters arrived at the Pentagon to question him about
whether he had improperly worn ``Combat V'' devices on medals
awarded during the Vietnam War. The V device signifies that a medal
was won for service in combat operations.
 &HT;    The Navy's recent ruling certifying Boorda's awards was not
publicly announced. In a ``memorandum for the record'' dated April
3, 1998 _ almost two years after Boorda's death _ Navy secretary
John Dalton ordered corrections made to Boorda's official Navy
transcript certifying that he was entitled to wear the Combat V on
two medals awarded for his service in Vietnam.
 &HT;    ``Admiral Mike Boorda's citations for awards of the Navy
Achievement Medal and Navy Commendation Medal plainly state they
were awarded for service including `combat operations' and `while
operating in combat missions,''' Dalton wrote.
 &HT;    He also cited the authority of retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, who
commanded U.S. naval forces and served as chief of naval operations
during the Vietnam conflict. In a memorandum also made a part of
Boorda's record, Zumwalt wrote that Boorda was ``clearly authorized
to wear the Combat V insignia on his medals.''
 &HT;    With Dalton's action, the Navy has tacitly acknowledged that its
Office of Awards and Special Projects was mistaken three years ago
in advising Boorda that he did not rate the combat designations.
The restoration of Boorda's combat awards was reviewed and approved
by Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations; Steven Honigman,
the Navy's general counsel; and the office of the secretary of
defense.
 &HT;    As detailed in ``Breaking Point,'' a story in the December 1996
issue of The Washingtonian, the medals controversy was only one of
many Boorda faced during his tenure as chief of naval operations.
Other pressing issues included how the Navy should deal with
continuing repercussions from the Tailhook scandal, disputes over
the role of women in combat, scandals at the Naval Academy, and
pressures to perform expanded naval missions with reduced forces in
the post-Cold War era.
 &HT;    In 40 years in the Navy, Boorda had forged a unique career. A
high-school dropout who enlisted at 16, married at 17 and fathered
four children before he was 22, Boorda didn't fit the mold of
leaders in the nation's most traditional military service.
 &HT;    He was the first chief of naval operations who had not attended
the U.S. Naval Academy, the first former enlisted man to reach the
office, the first Jew to become CNO, and only the second
surface-ship officer _ all others had been aviators or submariners
_ to head the Navy in four decades.
 &HT;    Only five-foot-four, Boorda was called ``a sailor's sailor'' by
the enlisted men and women from whose ranks he had come. Exuberant,
down-to-earth and competitive, Boorda earned their loyalty _ and
the ire of some officers _ by cutting through the chain of command
to solve problems.
 &HT;    Feeling that he had ``grown up'' in the Navy, he was devoted to
it and to his family, including his handicapped oldest son, David.
 &HT;    In disputes over Tailhook and the role of women, Boorda's
critics accused him of being a ``politically correct'' admiral who
didn't stand up for the ``warrior'' values of Navy culture. His
defenders cited his accomplishments as a military commander from
Vietnam to Bosnia. But the insinuation that he was not a
``warrior'' made him vulnerable to accusations that he wore combat
decorations to which he was not entitled.
 &HT;    In addition to coping with the Navy's problems, Boorda was being
urged by his wife to resign in order to relieve the strain of the
CNO's job on the family. In the days before his death, Boorda had
told family members that he did plan to resign early.
 &HT;    The question of whether Boorda was entitled to wear the Combat V
on his Vietnam medals first arose in 1995, when Roger Charles, a
retired Marine lieutenant colonel acting as a correspondent for the
National Security News Service, filed a Freedom of Information Act
request to examine the official record of Boorda's medals.
 &HT;    When Charles' inquiry was brought to Boorda's attention, the
admiral asked the Navy's awards office for an opinion. When the
awards office replied that he was not entitled to wear the combat
insignia, Boorda removed the Vs from his medals.
 &HT;    Ten months later, Charles gave the story to David Hackworth, a
highly decorated, retired Army colonel who was then a contributing
editor to Newsweek. Hackworth in turn took the story to Newsweek
editor Maynard Parker. Hackworth told Parker that his exposure of
Boorda's medals could end the admiral's career.
 &HT;    Less than three hours before Boorda's suicide, an aide informed
him that Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and defense
reporter John Barry were coming to the Pentagon to question him
about the Combat V awards.
 &HT;    Telling his aides that he was going home for lunch, Boorda drove
his official car to the CNO's residence, wrote a note to his wife
and a note ``to my sailors,'' then went into the garden and shot
himself.
 &HT;    In the note to Navy enlisted personnel, discovered on Boorda's
desk at home after his death, he had written:
 &HT;    ``I am about to be accused of wearing combat devices on two
ribbons I earned during sea tours in Viet Nam. It turns out I
didn't really rate them. When I found out I was wrong I immediately
took them off but it was really too late. I don't expect any
reporters to believe that I could make an honest mistake and you
may or may not believe it yourselves. I've made it not matter in
the big scheme of things because I love our Navy so much, and you
who are the heart and soul of our Navy, I couldn't bear to bring
dishonor to you.''
 &HT;    In the months following Boorda's suicide, the Navy refused to
offer an opinion as to whether Boorda had been entitled to wear the
two Combat V devices.
 &HT;    Dalton's recent ruling follows a two-year effort by Boorda's
widow, Bettie, and son Cdr. Edward Boorda, now captain of the USS
Russell, a guided-missile destroyer on duty in the Arabian Gulf, to
clear the admiral's name of the allegations that he had worn combat
awards that he should have known he was not entitled to wear. The
effort was supported by many retired and active-duty military
officers, including Zumwalt.
 &HT;    After examining the history of Boorda's awards, Dalton and other
Navy officials concluded that Boorda was entitled to the combat
designation on both.
 &HT;    Officials say that changes in Navy regulations governing the
Navy Achievement Medal, which Boorda won as weapons officer on the
destroyer USS Craig in 1965, created confusion. Boorda initially
was awarded not a Navy Achievement Medal, which didn't exist at the
time, but a Navy Commendation for Achievement ribbon. The
Commendation for Achievement, won by Boorda and two other officers
on the Craig in 1965, did not qualify for the Combat V.
 &HT;    But two years later, in 1967, the Navy retroactively upgraded
all the Navy Commendation for Achievement ribbons awarded between
1961 and 1967 into a new award, the Navy Achievement Medal. The
Navy mailed the new medal to thousands of personnel, including
Boorda, to replace the Commendation for Achievement ribbon. The new
Navy Achievement Medal was eligible for the Combat V if it was
earned during combat operations.
 &HT;    Authorization for the Combat V was specifically written into the
citation for each eligible Navy Achievement Medal beginning in
1967.
 &HT;    But the Navy never reviewed the thousands of Commendation for
Achievement ribbons that had been upgraded to Navy Achievement
Medals to determine which ones were eligible for the Combat V, and
so issued no authorizations for the device on the retroactively
awarded medals. In the absence of such a review, the only record
available for determining eligibility for the Combat V is the
language in the original citation awarding the Achievement ribbon.
 &HT;    The citation for Boorda's ribbon stated:
 &HT;    ``For meritorious service while serving as Weapons Officer in
USS John R. Craig while operating in combat missions supporting the
Republic of Vietnam from 10 April to 10 August 1965. ... Craig was
assigned duties as commander of the Vietnam Naval Gunfire Support
Unit from its inception until the ship's departure from the area.
 &HT;    ``Boorda's unparalleled knowledge of the tactical and
operational aspects of the employment of Naval gunfire support
contributed immeasurably to the successful introduction ... of
Naval gunfire support'' of U.S. Marine infantry and Republic of
Vietnam forces on shore.
 &HT;    In Boorda's fitness report, Cdr. James K. Jobe, the Craig's
captain, commended him for developing and implementing the naval
gunfire support plan for the entire destroyer support group and
noted that the Craig had fired more than 3,000 five-inch shells to
support U.S. and South Vietnamese forces engaged with the Vietcong
on shore.
 &HT;    At the outset of U.S. naval involvement in Vietnam, Jobe
observed, Boorda frequently had gone ashore to develop gunnery
support plans with officers of the U.S. Third Marine division and
Republic of Vietnam I and II Corps.
 &HT;    Most clearly supporting the case that Boorda rated the V device
was that Jobe himself was awarded a Navy Commendation Medal with
Combat V ``for meritorious achievement'' in the same
gunfire-support mission that Boorda oversaw as Jobe's weapons
officer. Only with the upgrade of Boorda's award two years later
did it become eligible for the Combat V.
 &HT;    In certifying Boorda's entitlement to wear the Combat V on his
second medal, officials relied on Zumwalt's verbal directions to
Navy personnel in Vietnam during the war.
 &HT;    In 1973, during his second tour of duty in Vietnam, as executive
officer of the destroyer USS Brooke, Boorda was awarded a Navy
Commendation Medal for ``meritorious achievement ... during combat
operations.'' The award citation praised Boorda for ``training,
organizing, and directing ... a combat-ready crew in a variety of
demanding roles including protection of vital units and rescue of
downed aviators.''
 &HT;    The Brooke's primary role was to protect U.S. aircraft carriers
whose planes flew missions over Vietnam. In one instance, the
Brooke assisted in rescuing a flyer whose plane had been shot down
by Vietcong anti-aircraft fire. In a fitness report, Cdr. W.D.
Pivarnik, captain of the Brooke, called Boorda ``without
qualification, the finest officer with whom it has been my pleasure
to serve.''
 &HT;    Navy regulations in effect in 1973 stated that the Combat V was
warranted only when the medal citation specifically authorized it.
Boorda's medal citation did not mention the Combat V.
 &HT;    But Zumwalt had issued other instructions. In his recent
memorandum to Boorda's file, Zumwalt recounted: ``As Chief of Naval
Operations (1970-74), I achieved a verbal understanding that
directives would be clarified to stipulate that the `V' could be
worn on any ribbon resulting from operations in the combat zone of
Vietnam. In over 100 visits to ships and shore stations, I
reiterated to Navy personnel time and time again that the `V' was
authorized for any ribbon awarded for duty in the combat theater of
Vietnam _ on shore and off shore.''
 &HT;    In reviewing the matter, Navy officials confirmed that many
naval officers who won medals in Vietnam wore the Combat V at the
direction of Zumwalt, and that other officers had received
authorization for the combat designation on the Commendation Medal
for performing duties almost identical to those Boorda performed on
the Brooke.
 &HT;    In May, copies of the memoranda to the record by Dalton and
Zumwalt, along with an updated transcript of Boorda's official Navy
record restoring the Combat Vs, were sent without comment to Bettie
Boorda.

Navy Achievement Medal, which Boorda won as weapons officer on the
destroyer USS Craig in 1965, created confusion. Boorda initially
was awarded not a Navy Achievement Medal, which didn't exist at the
time, but a Navy Commendation for Achievement ribbon. The
Commendation for Achievement, won by Boorda and two other officers
on the Craig in 1965, did not qualify for the Combat V.
 &HT;    But two years later, in 1967, the Navy retroactively upgraded
all the Navy Commendation for Achievement ribbons awarded between
1961 and 1967 into a new award, the Navy Achievement Medal. The
Navy mailed the new medal to thousands of personnel, including
Boorda, to replace the Commendation for Achievement ribbon. The new
Navy Achievement Medal was eligible for the Combat V if it was
earned during combat operations.
 &HT;    Authorization for the Combat V was specifically written into the
citation for each eligible Navy Achievement Medal beginning in
1967.
 &HT;    But the Navy never reviewed the thousands of Commendation for
Achievement ribbons that had been upgraded to Navy Achievement
Medals to determine which ones were eligible for the Combat V, and
so issued no authorizations for the device on the retroactively
awarded medals. In the absence of such a review, the only record
available for determining eligibility for the Combat V is the
language in the original citation awarding the Achievement ribbon.
 &HT;    The citation for Boorda's ribbon stated:
 &HT;    ``For meritorious service while serving as Weapons Officer in
USS John R. Craig while operating in combat missions supporting the
Republic of Vietnam from 10 April to 10 August 1965. ... Craig was
assigned duties as commander of the Vietnam Naval Gunfire Support
Unit from its inception until the ship's departure from the area.
 &HT;    ``Boorda's unparalleled knowledge of the tactical and
operational aspects of the employment of Naval gunfire support
contributed immeasurably to the successful introduction ... of
Naval gunfire support'' of U.S. Marine infantry and Republic of
Vietnam forces on shore.
 &HT;    In Boorda's fitness report, Cdr. James K. Jobe, the Craig's
captain, commended him for developing and implementing the naval
gunfire support plan for the entire destroyer support group and
noted that the Craig had fired more than 3,000 five-inch shells to
support U.S. and South Vietnamese forces engaged with the Vietcong
on shore.
 &HT;    At the outset of U.S. naval involvement in Vietnam, Jobe
observed, Boorda frequently had gone ashore to develop gunnery
support plans with officers of the U.S. Third Marine division and
Republic of Vietnam I and II Corps.
 &HT;    Most clearly supporting the case that Boorda rated the V device
was that Jobe himself was awarded a Navy Commendation Medal with
Combat V ``for meritorious achievement'' in the same
gunfire-support mission that Boorda oversaw as Jobe's weapons
officer. Only with the upgrade of Boorda's award two years later
did it become eligible for the Combat V.
 &HT;    In certifying Boorda's entitlement to wear the Combat V on his
second medal, officials relied on Zumwalt's verbal directions to
Navy personnel in Vietnam during the war.
 &HT;    In 1973, during his second tour of duty in Vietnam, as executive
officer of the destroyer USS Brooke, Boorda was awarded a Navy
Commendation Medal for ``meritorious achievement ... during combat
operations.'' The award citation praised Boorda for ``training,
organizing, and directing ... a combat-ready crew in a variety of
demanding roles including protection of vital units and rescue of
downed aviators.''
 &HT;    The Brooke's primary role was to protect U.S. aircraft carriers
whose planes flew missions over Vietnam. In one instance, the
Brooke assisted in rescuing a flyer whose plane had been shot down
by Vietcong anti-aircraft fire. In a fitness report, Cdr. W.D.
Pivarnik, captain of the Brooke, called Boorda ``without
qualification, the finest officer with whom it has been my pleasure
to serve.''
 &HT;    Navy regulations in effect in 1973 stated that the Combat V was
warranted only when the medal citation specifically authorized it.
Boorda's medal citation did not mention the Combat V.
 &HT;    But Zumwalt had issued other instructions. In his recent
memorandum to Boorda's file, Zumwalt recounted: ``As Chief of Naval
Operations (1970-74), I achieved a verbal understanding that
directives would be clarified to stipulate that the `V' could be
worn on any ribbon resulting from operations in the combat zone of
Vietnam. In over 100 visits to ships and shore stations, I
reiterated to Navy personnel time and time again that the `V' was
authorized for any ribbon awarded for duty in the combat theater of
Vietnam _ on shore and off shore.''
 &HT;    In reviewing the matter, Navy officials confirmed that many
naval officers who won medals in Vietnam wore the Combat V at the
direction of Zumwalt, and that other officers had received
authorization for the combat designation on the Commendation Medal
for performing duties almost identical to those Boorda performed on
the Brooke.
 &HT;    In May, copies of the memoranda to the record by Dalton and
Zumwalt, along with an updated transcript of Boorda's official Navy
record restoring the Combat Vs, were sent without comment to Bettie
Boorda.

 &HT;    
 By JEFFREY GOLDBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive officer of
one of the four most reviled corporations in America, looks like a
man in need of a cigarette.
 &HT;    A dismal funk has settled over the Benton Convention Center in
Winston-Salem, N.C., which is where his company, RJR Nabisco, is
about to open its annual shareholders' meeting.
 &HT;    The meeting won't be pleasant for him, but what is these days?
It's reefer madness out there _ not so much in Winston-Salem, one
of the last of the country's pro-tobacco redoubts, but almost
everywhere else.
 &HT;    It is perhaps the worst moment in history to be a tobacco CEO.
The industry Goldstone leads is a pariah, the Libya of American
commerce. Congress has spun itself into a frenzy, weighing huge tax
increases on tobacco and considering measures to let the Food and
Drug Administration regulate the nicotine out of cigarettes.
 &HT;    Wall Street, meanwhile, views the tobacco companies the way
Sloan-Kettering views smoking. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is a
highly leveraged company, and its stock price is so depressed that
the company's market cap _ the total value of all outstanding
shares _ is actually exceeded by its debt.
 &HT;    Goldstone, a shortish and combative 52-year-old, is Big
Tobacco's prime strategist. Last year he led his fellow CEOs into
historic negotiations with their enemies, the state attorneys
general who had made it their mission to take down Big Tobacco.
 &HT;    Two and a half years ago, before he became president of RJR
Nabisco, which owns R.J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest
tobacco company, he was just another rich Wall Street lawyer. But
now that Goldstone oversees the production of Camels, Winstons and
Dorals, it seems an article of faith among tobacco's foes that he
pushes drugs to children.
 &HT;    When I asked C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, if he
thought Goldstone was actually evil, he answered, ``Is it evil to
know that the product you sell is going to kill one-third of your
customers, and then sell it anyway?''
 &HT;    Lying in ambush for Goldstone this May morning in Winston-Salem
are a number of Koop's acolytes. Goldstone knows he's in for it _
he calls the annual meetings ``a continuing psychodrama'' _ so it
is no surprise that he looks as if he needs a cigarette. Alas, he
quit 20 years ago. ``At some point, I just said, `Jeez, I'm killing
myself,' so I stopped,'' he explains. ``The pleasure component was
beginning to be outweighed by my anxiety that I was injuring my
health.''
 &HT;    And so he has become addicted _ if that is the word _ to Breath
Savers, one of the noncontroversial products manufactured by his
company. He pops one into his mouth and, tagged by security agents,
makes his way to the main conference hall.
 &HT;    ``Let's go do this thing,'' he says. At the first opportunity,
the anti-tobacco contingent crowds the microphones. The first to
speak, a Virginia woman named Anne Donley, asks Goldstone to
describe the provisions made by the company should ``you or the
other directors be indicted.'' Goldstone maintains his equilibrium,
thanking her for her question without providing an answer.
 &HT;    Another critic, a Virginia physician named David Lewis, says to
Goldstone: ``I had to tell one of your customers a few days ago
that the shadow in her chest is lung cancer. I suspect that she is
still crying. I believe there is higher power, Mr. Goldstone, and I
believe that one day you will have to answer to that higher
power.''
 &HT;    ``Thank you, Dr. Lewis,'' Goldstone replies. He becomes testy
only once, when another woman announces that a petition drive in
support of a Nabisco boycott has already netted 12,000 signatures.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry that 12,000 people are not using Nabisco products,''
he says, a malevolent grin spreading across his face. ``We're doing
a great job on Snackwell's, and when they see their weight going up
they might come back.''
 &HT;    This draws a laugh from his cigarette-subsidiary executives, who
fill the front rows and smoke like fiends through the meeting. They
don't really trust Goldstone, who is decidedly not a tobacco man,
but today he is a hero to them. He is a hero to his shareholders
too. It's not because he has figured out a way to grow the
cigarette business.
 &HT;    Quite the opposite: He is certainly one of the only CEOs in
America who tell their employees and shareholders that the most
they will achieve for them is a ``slow and manageable decline in an
increasingly obsolete industry.''
 &HT;    Nor is he a hero because he has formulated the magic arguments
that would convince the country that his company never manipulated
the nicotine levels in cigarettes, never marketed its products to
teen-agers and never thought, even for a moment, that Joe Camel
could be attractive to 5-year-olds.
 &HT;    He is a hero instead because on April 8, he stood at the dais of
the National Press Club in Washington and let Congress know that if
it wanted to legislate his industry into oblivion, it could do so
without his help. The man who marched his industry's CEOs into
cease-fire negotiations with the states was marching them back to
war.
 &HT;    ``I finally saw that there wasn't a chance in hell of any
resolution to this problem in the near future,'' he says.
 &HT;    Goldstone's pullout wasn't entirely impetuous. The CEOs had all
been stewing for some time about the Republican Congress'
election-year conversion to the anti-tobacco cause. But it was
still something of a cliff jump. Goldstone says that he made his
announcement with only the cloudiest sense of his industry's
future.
 &HT;    ``It would scare my shareholders to know this, but in my own
mind I do not have an endgame plan,'' he would tell me later. ``The
only thing we can do now is continue fighting.''
 &HT;    After the annual meeting, Goldstone sinks into the back seat of
his chauffeured sedan and considers his fate, as laid out to him by
the crusaders. ``So, I'm going to jail or I'm going to hell,''
Goldstone says. ``Some choice.''
 &HT;    One year ago, when Goldstone and his fellow tobacco CEOs
approved the agreement with 40 state attorneys general, they
believed it would put an end to their troubles. In exchange for
protection against future lawsuits, the CEOs agreed to pay the
states $368.5 billion over 25 years, end many forms of advertising
and accept FDA oversight of their product.
 &HT;    For an industry that had never ceded a penny to its foes, it was
a landmark moment _ irrefutable evidence, the tobacco chiefs
believed, of their good will.
 &HT;    In the months that followed the June 1997 signing, however, it
became clear that the public-health lobby, the White House and
Congress _ which would have to legislate the settlement into law _
all believed, for reasons ranging from the idealistic to the
mercenary, that $368.5 billion was too small a price to pay for
absolution.
 &HT;    Nine months after signing the agreement, when Sen. John McCain,
the Arizona Republican, introduced a bill that would nearly double
the tax on a pack of cigarettes proposed in the settlement with the
states, Goldstone decided that the process was ``off the rails.''
And so, the pullout.
 &HT;    What he was pulling out of no one was sure, since McCain's
Commerce Committee barred Big Tobacco's lobbyists from the
bill-writing process. I could not allow these people to have veto
power over the bill, McCain told me.
 &HT;    Newt Gingrich, the ardent, if recent, foe of tobacco, gave me
this explanation for why Congress would no longer listen to
tobacco's arguments: ``Their deliberate mendacity for a generation
earned them exclusion.'' Referring to Goldstone's pullout, the
Speaker said, ``I thought it was an irrelevant act.''
 &HT;    But it wasn't. All along, advocates of a comprehensive
settlement argued that industry cooperation was necessary to cut
the rate of teen smoking, and it was the fight against teen smoking
_ not the raising of tax revenue _ that was the ostensible reason
for the entire process.
 &HT;    President Clinton apparently felt Goldstone's participation was
important enough that, shortly after his speech at the National
Press Club, he secretly dispatched Sen. John Breaux, the Louisiana
Democrat, to New York, where he tried to figure out what it would
take to coax Goldstone and the CEOs back in the process. Breaux
left New York empty-handed.
 &HT;    Today, anti-tobacco legislation is moving tortuously through
Congress. The tobacco companies have launched a campaign to
convince American smokers that Congress is trying to oppress them
with new taxes. The slowdown in momentum is the result of $50
million of advertising by the tobacco companies, Vice President Al
Gore told me. There's no question it's easier for us to pass this
with the companies inside the tent. But we will pass it.
 &HT;    I asked Goldstone one day why he believes tobacco's enemies,
faced with a CEO who claims he's ready to compromise, would rather
make war than reach a peaceful settlement.
 &HT;    ``They're more comfortable demonizing us than anything else,''
he replied. ``They think they can demonize us out of this business,
and when you try to explain to them that this product is not
disappearing, it only angers them more. It isn't a resolution
they're looking for, it's eradication. In political terms, that's
prohibition.'' He paused and then added: ``This process is now
completely irrational. I didn't count on vengeance being a part of
it. Not at all.''
 &HT;    None of the chief executives of the four major American
cigarette companies counted on vengeance. They still do not seem to
appreciate how bottomless the well of anti-tobacco feeling in
America really is. Nor are the CEOs convinced that they are the
authors of their own misery.
 &HT;    In fact, Goldstone is the only one to acknowledge that real
ethical lapses on the part of the tobacco industry, and not just
failures of public relations, account for the industry's current
predicament. His fellow CEOs, in recent interviews with me, spoke
with surprising defiance.
 &HT;    Geoffrey C. Bible, the CEO of Philip Morris, which produces 50
percent of the cigarettes sold in America, is in absolutely no mood
to apologize. Unlike Goldstone, he has been a true tobacco man for
nearly 30 years. At one point he oversaw the sale of Marlboros in
nearly 200 countries. He is Australian-born, 60 years old and an
enthusiastic smoker.
 &HT;    ``Do I feel badly about selling cigarettes?'' he says. ``No, I
do not, and I don't know why I should. I feel badly about children
smoking cigarettes, but I don't know how to deal with that. I tell
you, I feel worse about under-age people getting alcohol more so
than cigarettes.''
 &HT;    In a recent conversation at Philip Morris headquarters in New
York, Bible even argued the merits of smoking. ``There's an
interesting question you should ask the public-health people,'' he
said. ``What do you think smokers would do if they didn't smoke?
You get some pleasure from it, and you also get some other
beneficial things, such as stress relief. Nobody knows what you'd
turn to if you didn't smoke. Maybe you'd beat your wife. Maybe
you'd drive cars fast. Who knows what the hell you'd do?''
 &HT;    A few blocks away, at the headquarters of the Loews Corp., whose
subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Co., manufactures nearly 9 percent of
the cigarettes sold in this country, the defiance was even more
palpable.
 &HT;    ``There are only four companies in America that care about youth
smoking and want to stop it,'' Laurence A. Tisch, co-CEO of Loews,
told me. ``Those companies are Lorillard, Brown &AMP; Williamson, R.J.
Reynolds and Philip Morris. We're the only four genuine people out
there. Everybody else is giving it lip service.''
 &HT;    The tobacco CEOs are not exactly friends. That would look too
collusive, and besides, they are all in terrible competition with
one another, each fighting for market share in a slowly shrinking
business.
 &HT;    ``We don't trust each other on financial issues one jot,'' Nick
Brookes, the CEO of Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., told me.
 &HT;    But by virtue of often being sued collectively, they communicate
with some regularity, meeting face to face _ with their lawyers
present _ to discuss common strategy. As a result, they have
managed to come to unanimous decisions on several key issues. In a
recent state anti-tobacco case in Minnesota, for instance, they all
agreed to settle with Minnesota's attorney general _ for $6.5
billion _ rather than take their case to the jury.
 &HT;    This was done, they claimed, out of deference to RJR Nabisco's
tenuous financial situation: ``If they'd have listened to me, we
would have gone to verdict in Minnesota,'' Tisch said. ``And I
would have appealed if we lost. But RJR couldn't have survived
that.'' Bible too deferred to Goldstone's thinking. ``We'd be the
last to go bankrupt, because we're the biggest,'' Bible said.
 &HT;    Philip Morris had sales last year of $72 billion, $40 billion of
which came from tobacco (and of that, international sales
contributed two-thirds). RJR Nabisco is in far more tenuous shape.
Without the $1.4 billion in annual operating profit made by its
tobacco subsidiary, the company could barely afford to service its
annual debt.
 &HT;    Despite RJR's shaky financials, Goldstone _ a ``smart fella,''
Bible allows _ seems to have emerged as the chief theoretician of
the four. Brookes and his superior, Martin Broughton, the
London-based CEO of BAT Industries, are the bad boys of the bunch.
Broughton and Brookes have gone along with Goldstone's ideas only
grudgingly at times.
 &HT;    Tisch, a billionaire who is the king of New York philanthropy,
is said by his fellow CEOs to be the one who feels most keenly
betrayed by Washington. Like Goldstone, he is not a tobacco man _
he says he has visited the North Carolina headquarters of Lorillard
just once in the 30 years he has controlled the company. His anger,
he says, grows from what he calls the irrational vilification of a
legal industry.
 &HT;    ``When the truth is undermined in America, then you've
accomplished everything the fascists will want to try to do 20
years from today,'' he told me. Under cover of a children's
crusade, he argues, Washington is engaged in a huge tax grab.
 &HT;    ``The Big Lie is prevailing, Tisch says. The Big Lie is that
these companies were ever marketing to kids. What worries me is
that if you can get away with this against a legitimate industry,
what could be the next big lie? This is McCarthyism.''
 &HT;    Like Tisch, Bible believes dangerous historical forces are
motivating the anti-tobacco crusade.
 &HT;    ``The American people fought a war for freedom,'' he said. ``It
was an ugly, horrible war that engulfed the world. We fought that
war for the freedom to choose. Hitler and Hirohito were going to
take that away from us. We fought vehemently to prevent that from
happening.''
 &HT;    Are you equating your opponents to Hitler and Hirohito? I asked.
 &HT;    ``I'm not going to say that at all,'' he responded, ``but I
think we've seen in the past individuals influencing a whole
nation.''
 &HT;    The individuals to whom Bible is referring, he makes ringingly
clear during the course of conversation, are Koop and Dr. David
Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration _ the two enemies of tobacco generally credited with
(or blamed for) sinking last year's settlement.
 &HT;    Goldstone, by contrast, does not spend much time predicting a
blitzkrieg of health fascism. He was made CEO because he was a
lawyer skilled at complex negotiation. ``I took this job because I
thought I had a set of skills and an opportunity to resolve a very
dangerous problem for this company,'' he says.
 &HT;    Koop and Kessler, Goldstone will even cede, know what they're
talking about.
 &HT;    ``They don't know what gives an individual pleasure, he says,
but I have absolutely no doubt they know what's best to prolong a
person's life.''

   CUBA-ALBUM (Undated) _ The ``Buena Vista Social Club'' album
quietly crept into the marketplace in the fall of 1997. It was an
an unpretentious record steered by an American musician, Ry Cooder,
and made in Havana by 80- and 90-year-olds singing a gentle,
prerevolutionary pop music that had mostly been forgotten. Then it
started selling. The tempo picked up, and now some 10 months after
its release, it has sold nearly a million copies around the world.

interior design, which may well require you to wear high boots. The
latest thing for home and office interiors is a pot of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Large shallow pots, bulbous medium pots and thimblelike tiny
pots planted with domestic grasses and neatly trimmed. The idea,
which is called a concept in trendy circles, is to place the pot of
trimmed grass where people coming into a room will see it and reach
out and touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Like, Pet Lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Our daughter-in-law confirmed these reports of Eastern
trendiness and added that the smaller, coffee-cup-size of interior
lawns are reportedly the most popular. Such little excavated clumps
of grass are common on our golf courses, where they are called
divots. But the little signs advise us that these little chunks are
to be returned to Mother Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh, Grasshopper, as I did when Honorable Wife Person
mentioned that her viewing of a television feature revealed this
pot-of-grass trend was taking root in all the beautiful East Coast
places filled with beautiful people. These little carry-out lawns
fulfill an inner need to commune with, literally touch, the living
grass.
</P>
<P>
   I must communicate this information also to our friend, Bill the
Artist, whose loft building in New York City's SoHo District has
the only tree on his section of Wooster Street. The concept of Pet
Lawns would grow well in an area where people do not have real
lawns or trees and where what they know as grass is sold in little
Baggies.
</P>
<P>
   You and I know, Grasshopper, that there are mushrooms growing
under the desks of some people at work. These people are not just
slobs, Grasshopper. Rather, they are necessary elements in the feng
shui of the workplace, the balance of natural elements.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, in the home, where the rooms of young people harbor
mysterious growths and fumes of growing sweat socks and old running
shoes, there must be a harmony. And this harmony, according to the
experts Back East, is accomplished by planting grass in a small
shallow pot in your home or office.
</P>
<P>
   If the winds and water and most life forces naturally flow from
west to east, it has been determined by Great People in corporate
board rooms and media production facilities that all things
beautiful and important must originate in the East and flow
westerly until we simple folks learn what is beautiful and
important. Like Pet Rocks and Pet Lawns.
</P>
<P>
   And grass in a pot on the kitchen counter or the coffee table or
the reception desk is very big in the East now, so it must be
important. So I will tell you about the living magic of the plant
world and why people must be in harmony with it instead of just
smoking it or sticking it up their noses.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Grasshopper, I have several plants on the
windowsill of my office overlooking Elliott Bay and Myrtle Edwards
Park. These plants serve to bring the park inside, where I can
appreciate the living forces up close. I must be careful, however,
not to apply any more Alaskan Fish Fertilizer, because my
journalistic colleagues say the odor greatly upsets the feng shui
of our common space.
</P>
<P>
   At our home beneath the tall firs, there are many plants and
almost too much lawn, Grasshopper. This grass is prospering partly
because it is over the septic tank drain field, and partly because
I upset the natural balance by fertilizing the newly sown seed last
spring. Now I must walk upon the grass every week and trim it so
the yard achieves enough feng shui for the family dog to do to it
what I do to my office plants with that fish fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   I would walk barefoot in the new grass to better commune with
nature, little Grasshopper, but as you know, there is dog doo-doo
and slugs upon the grass, which are parts of nature better left
outdoors and untouched. The Eastern experts do not mention
doggy-doo or slugs in their televised talks of trendiness.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the soft winds of harmony to our home, Grasshopper, I
stopped snickering long enough to dig up a bunch of grass and plop
it into a pottery vessel. I presented it humbly to Wife Person to
satisfy her desire to be trendy, but she scoffed and said it looked
too much like a bunch of grass plopped into a pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be grown from seed evenly spaced in good soil,'' she
said, repeating the carefully memorized instructions from the Back
East television program. She suggested, Grasshopper, that I remove
the planted vessel and do it right, the way one of Martha Stewart's
many lackeys would do it just before she went on camera.
</P>
<P>
   My great failing, Grasshopper, is impatience in dealing with the
temporal circumstances that give rise to things such as Pet Lawns.
And in my impatience, I may have suggested to Honorable Wife Person
that it would be a cold day in another world before I planted
individual grass seeds in a pot so that grass would grow in our
house.
</P>
<P>
   And if people coming to our home want to touch live grass, I
will invite them to remove their Birkenstocks and socks and walk
barefoot upon my free-range mixture of red fescue, perennial rye
and whatever. Only I will remind them not to step in the feng shui.

`ARMAGEDDON' IS A NO-BRAINER OF THE FIRST ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, Disney's $100 million-plus, end-of-the-world
thriller, ``Armageddon,'' has the exact same premise as ``Deep
Impact'' _ a heavenly object the size of Texas is hurling toward
Mother Earth and has to be nuked off course.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's a totally different movie. While ``Impact'' was
somber, reflective and dull, this instant rehash is moronic, filled
with non-stop action and special effects, and played mostly for
wisecracky guffaws and chest-pounding heroics.
</P>
<P>
   The model for producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael
Bay (``The Rock'') appears to be 1996's ``Independence Day,'' and,
as in that film, the filmmakers are less interested in scaring
anyone with any real apocalyptic possibilities than in jiving a
lowest-common-denominator audience for every second of the lengthy
screen time.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers roared through the Seattle preview last week, and
the movie smells like a hit, but be warned it's a no-brainer of the
first order. The script is filled with story holes as large as its
asteroid, and _ if you're resistant to its adolescent humor and
action overkill _ that 144-minute running time can seem like an
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes this time are not astronauts but a team of rough-neck
oil drillers, whose tough-guy leader (Bruce Willis) is whisked from
his rig in the South China Sea back to the States and given the bad
news: an asteroid will impact with the Earth in exactly 18 days,
wiping out all life (``even bacteria'') _ unless he can help stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   So he gathers up his crew (who, in a bizarre time warp, have
scattered over the country _ and taken up new lives and new
pursuits _ in the few hours that have elapsed since he left them in
the South China Sea) to be trained by NASA so they can intercept
the asteroid and drill a hole in it suitable for planting a nuclear
device.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, a lot of the staggering budget for ``Armageddon''
is up there on the screen. It looks like a hugely expensive movie
in almost every frame, the effects are generally better than those
of ``Deep Impact,'' and several of them _ particularly the meteor
showers that practically wipe out New York and Paris _ are as good
as they get.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's over-produced, MTV-style quickly distances us
from the characters and gradually pulls the movie down. As in ``The
Rock,'' Bruckheimer and Bay are intent on making every scene play
like a gushy, super-glossy television commercial. And there are no
low points _ just one crisis after another, to the point of
numbness.
</P>
<P>
   There's zero suspense. Because the characters are so absorbed
with delivering one-liners, and blithely unconcerned about the
possibility of extinction, so are we. In fact, the overworked
interpersonal drama here _ which is built around Willis'
disapproval of the relationship between his daughter (Liv Tyler)
with one of the crew members (Ben Affleck) _ would be highly
irrelevant if there was any real chance the world was about to end.
</P>
<P>
   The last act of the film is one long action sequence on the
asteroid: thousands of quick cuts, hundreds of explosions, endless
shots of characters in space suits hurling through the air. But
it's so poorly staged as narrative, it's almost impossible to
figure out who is who, and what exactly is going on. The entire
finale is altogether about as engaging as a video game glimpsed
over someone else's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon. Directed by Michael Bay. Screenplay by Jonathan
Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams. Cast: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton,
Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck. Disney/Touchstone. 144 minutes. Rated PG-13
for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

AMERICA IS BEAUTIFUL, FROM STETSONS TO PATRIOTIC POETS TO BLACK
COWPOKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seldom does a children's book come along as well-conceived,
-written and -executed as ``Boss of the Plains: The Hat That Won
the West'' (DK, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Carlson has taken a complex subject and cleverly whittled
it to a simple tale full of history, rich in nuances and lovely to
read.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the birth of the Stetson hat has a better plot than
``Godzilla,'' as many twists and turns as ``The X-Files'' and the
epic proportions of ``Titanic.'' Immigration, gold fever,
economics, fashion, health ... what a story.
</P>
<P>
   John Batterson Stetson grew up in a New Jersey hat-making
family. He could make hats, but he couldn't shake his dreams of
going west. Gold fever beckoned, and the young Stetson headed to
Colorado Territory. He didn't find much gold, but he found a need
for a hat that kept off the sun and rain, impressed the ladies,
could serve as a bucket and more. He wanted a hat that was ``big
and picturesque.'' He invented the Boss of the Plains hat.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Meade's distinctive cut-paper illustrations add a lively
cowboy spirit to the book. She uses dusty colors and a stock tank
of wit with delightful results.
</P>
<P>
   Stetson ``put energy into improving his own life and the lives
of others around him. Biographies of people like him give kids
much-needed heroes,'' she writes. ``I have a Stetson of my own. ...
There's something about putting on one of these regal hats that
reflects the spirit of the West. You find yourself standing a bit
taller, a bit straighter, and looking people right in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stetson Hat Co. still makes Boss of the Plains hats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another journey west is the topic for ``Purple Mountain
Majesties: The Story of Katherine Lee Bates and America the
Beautiful'' (Dutton, $16.99).
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Younger begins the Bates story with a child who loved
words and ``stories, rhymes, and clever ways of saying things.''
When she was 9 her mother gave her a red leather diary. She kept
writing in diaries and notebooks as she grew up, went to a new
college for women called Wellesley, taught English literature there
and traveled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1893 her travels took her to Colorado Springs, Colo., where
she had been invited to lecture. She journeyed by train, and what
she saw captured her poet's imagination. In Colorado, she and a
group of teachers rode a wagon to the top of Pikes Peak. There
Bates gazed at the Rockies purple in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The sight became a line in a poem. ``Oh beautiful for halcyon
skies/For amber waves of grain./For purple mountain majesties ...''
</P>
<P>
   The poem was set to music, several times, and became one of the
country's most popular songs. ``A the B,'' her family called it.
She won fame but not money. Bates never requested payment for the
use of her words.
</P>
<P>
   Younger's story of the trip that gave us ``A the B'' is a
smidgen of history, but one every child can relate to. Stacey
Schuett's charming, detailed illustrations have a primitive quality
that helps carry Younger's (and Bates') message.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Black Cowboy, Wild Horses: A True Story'' (Dial, $16.99)
looks at the plains from horseback, not a train window or a
mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   The team of writer Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney
has another winner on its hands. Lester's story is beautifully
woven. The lackadaisical pace is more reminiscent of a hawk's
flight than a horse's gallop. But it does envelop the ways of Bob
Lemmons, on whose life the book is based.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons, a former slave, was a well-known cowboy. He could think
like a horse, put himself in the middle of a herd of wild mustangs
and, with patience, bring in a whole herd by himself. He did it
because he made horses think he was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lester tells how he did it, describing one roundup and weaving
the texture of the plains _ lonely, exciting, boring, hot, wet,
dirty, tense. And there was the waiting, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney's paintings (pencil, gouache and watercolor) are
beautiful. Once again, he proves his versatility. He can do cute
and charming. But he captures the very essence of wild mustangs on
the harsh open plains in a flurry of wild strength and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   These three top-notch books, each revealing a different player
in the history of the West, demonstrate a method good children's
authors know and wannabes don't: research. Imagine tidily
condensing the history of a song and its writer into 29 pages, and
most of that art.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the organization that the lottery funds
to help people with gambling problems? How many calls does it get?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.L., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The group is the Texas Council on Problem and Compulsive
Gambling, and it fields about 4,000 calls per month.
</P>
<P>
   However, 90 to 95 percent of the callers want information on how
to play the lottery, said council director Sue Cox. The remaining
200 to 400 calls each month are from people seeking help with a
gambling problem.
</P>
<P>
   The help line, which opened on the same day (May 29, 1992) as
the state's lottery program, is printed on all Lotto and
scratch-off game tickets. The group receives $350,000 in funding
each year from lottery proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   To contact the council for help, call (800) 742-0443.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news show ``Dateline'' featured a story about vitamins
that could be used to alleviate arthritis. What information is
available about this?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.F., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: According to NBC's Web site for ``Dateline,'' the information
you're seeking is in two books by Dr. Jason Theodosakis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Arthritis Cure,'' Theodosakis discusses the benefits of
taking glucosamine and chondroitin sulfates.
</P>
<P>
   The book claims that these supplements can rebuild lost bone
cartilage and provide relief to those suffering from
osteoarthritis. A follow-up book is titled ``Maximizing the
Arthritis Cure.''
</P>
<P>
   More information is available from Theodosakis at
www.drtheo.com. Or write to Jason Theodosakis, 6890 E. Sunrise, No.

<P>
   Q: Is the director Betty Thomas the same person who appeared on
``Hill Street Blues'' for many years?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.S., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: It is. Thomas has become a busy director in the '90s after a
13-year acting career, with credits that included ``Hill Street
Blues,'' ``Troop Beverly Hills'' and ``Used Cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas directed this year's ``Doctor Dolittle.'' She also
directed ``Private Parts,'' ``The Late Shift'' and ``The Brady

quietly crept into the marketplace in the fall of 1997. It was an

and made in Havana by 80- and 90-year-olds singing a gentle,

   SONOMA-WINES (Sonoma, Calif.) _ Residents of Sonoma County will
say this much about their neighbor to the west: Napa is better
known and has better restaurants. That said, they wouldn't dream of
living there. They would have to give up their wild and spectacular
coastline. They would have to abandon their magnificent fruits and
vegetables, superb cheeses and foie gras, prize-winning olive oil,
succulent lamb and pristine oysters. They would have to leave the

SAN ANTONIO THROWS GRAND OLD PARTY FOR REPUBLICAN SEARCH PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANITA McDIVITT  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Thousands of people here staged a grand old party
trying to convince the Republican National Committee to stage its
2000 presidential nominating convention in this South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``We want you,'' some 5,000 people were at the
Alamodome Monday to cheer Republican Party scouts touring potential
sites for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we just saw on Monday at noon ... is absolutely
incredible,'' said Jan Larimer, chairwoman of the Republican Site
Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not gotten a facility reception like this at all,''
RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the crowd, the RNC committee was greeted with
10,000 balloons and fireworks at the home of the San Antonio Spurs,
a National Basketball Association franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've put on a very good show,'' Larimer told a news
conference after the rally. ``But you've also put together a very
good proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio was the GOP's fifth stop on a nationwide tour of
eight cities, each fiercely competing for the party's political
bash.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, once considered an unlikely site for the convention
because the city had lacked sufficient hotel accommodations, has
added hotel rooms and bolstered its convention presence in the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
   The city of more than 1 million people is seen as a strong
candidate for the Republican convention because of its large
Hispanic population and strong Republican presence.
</P>
<P>
   Larimer said the matter of hotel rooms _ city leaders say there
are about 22,000 _ is still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The convention could have an estimated economic impact of $100
million to $200 million from 35,000 conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted earlier this year to commit $6.3 million
to the convention, and a private host committee has pledged to
raise another $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, N.C., New Orleans, New York and Philadelphia wined
and dined committee members earlier this month. The search
committee is scheduled to visit Chicago, Indianapolis and
Minneapolis in the coming weeks.

staff was sending him to drum up investment from a $17 million

   The fun for this toddler starts simply enough, but add a cat and
dog to the mix, plus some canned goods and cereal boxes, and you
end up with _ a very messy floor and a very happy kid. Cute
illustrations capture the mayhem. Sturdy pages for tiny hands. For
infants to age 2. &QL;

<P>
   No one beats the World Wildlife Fund for dazzling pictures of
exotic animals. In this 1-20 counting book, children start counting
one owl, then progress through bright-eyed lemurs, grazing wart
hogs, leaping kangaroos, lounging polar bears, flying macaws,
red-eyed tree frogs, rare bald eagles, splendid zebras and regal
lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Wildlife Fund Bugs'' presents vivid photos of 26 creepy
crawlers, from the Ladybug to the Stink Bug. For ages 1-4. &QL;

<P>
   It's a busy day at the Hundred Acre Wood, starting at 8 a.m.,
when Pooh and Christopher Robin wake up, get dressed and eat
breakfast. By 10 a.m., Tigger, Roo, Owl, Piglet, Rabbit and Eeyore

 &UR; ADVENTURE ON KLICKITAT ISLAND &QL; 
 &UR; Hilary Horder Hippely; illustrated by Barbara Upton (Dutton,
$15.99)
</P>
<P>
   As a nighttime storm picks up on Klickitat Island, a boy and his
bear set out from their cozy bed to help keep the forest animals
dry. The boy takes control, directing the deers, otters, rabbits,
birds and raccoons on how to build a fort with tree limbs and
stones. The happy group settles in for a nice, long snooze, and the
boy and his bear creep back to their bed.
</P>
<P>
   Hippely, a poet, tells the charming story about leadership and
cooperation in rhyme, with white print set against dark blue pages.
Upton's soft illustrations glow with warmth. The animals'
expressive faces capture emotions ranging from alarm to blissful
contentment. For ages 3-5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WE BOTH READ: JACK AND THE BEANSTALK &QL; 
 &UR; Adapted by Sindy McKay; illustrated by Lydia Halverson (Treasure
Bay, $7.99)
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Now parents and kids can read stories
together, taking turns reading pages. In the new series of
storybooks called ``We Both Read,'' parents read the left-hand
pages, which have more sophisticated vocabulary and structure, and
children read the right-hand pages, with short, easy sentences.
</P>
<P>
   More difficult words are introduced first in the parent's text
with bold lettering. Each child's page advances the story line, so
young readers truly are contributing.
</P>
<P>
   The series has books at three reading levels, for preschool
through third grade. The first four books, available in August, are
adaptations of well-known classics for grades one to two. Besides
``Jack,'' they are ``The Emperor's New Clothes''; ``The Tales of
Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny''; and ``The Frog Prince.'' McKay
is best known for her Emmy-winning writing for the Muppets. For
ages 4-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY BIRTHDAY BOOK &QL; 
 &UR; Catherine Hoesterey; illustrated by Mary Lake-Thompson (Little,
Brown &AMP; Co.,
 &UR; $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   This offering takes up where the baby book leaves off. Children
are invited to record their memories of five birthdays, within such
categories as ``My birthday wish,'' ``How I celebrated,'' ``The
best thing that happened'' and ``Friends and family who celebrated
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another page, called ``About Me,'' is devoted to
autobiographical reflections. The book has plenty of space for
party invitations, photos and mementos. OK, maybe it's more for Mom
and Dad than for kids, but someday they'll appreciate it. For ages
4-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THERE'S A FROG IN MY SLEEPING BAG &QL; 
 &UR; Susan Clymer (Scholastic, $3.50)
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye classroom! Hello Camp Buffalo! Janna and her third-grade
friends are enjoying their summer camp activities _ boating, hiking
and telling ghost stories at night _ when mysterious pranks begin.
</P>
<P>
   First, Janna's stuffed snake disappears and ends up on a buffalo
head in the dining hall. Next, peanuts are scattered on her cabin
floor. Then the trickster slips a slimy frog in Janna's sleeping
bag. Who is playing tricks? And why are they picking on Janna?
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic publishes a wide selection of inexpensive paperbacks
that are perfect summer fare for young readers. For ages 6-10. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TRAPPED &QL; 
 &UR; George Sullivan (Scholastic, $3.99)
</P>
<P>
   Is someone in your house fascinated by disaster? Here's a
collection of six true adventures, starting with the gripping drama
of little Jessica McClure of Midland, Texas. Few adults can forget
the 1987 near-tragedy that had Americans riveted to their
television sets, rooting for the toddler trapped in a dark,
abandoned well for more than two days. She made it, and today,
Jessica has no memory of the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories are equally compelling. They include a brave
kindergarten teacher who led her 14 students to safety after they
were trapped in an elevator during the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing; a group of mountain climbers trapped on Mount Everest; and
a foolish but gutsy Cuban stowaway who escaped his country by
hiding in the wheel well of a jetliner bound for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Though the stories end on an uplifting note, their intensity may
be too much for some youngsters. For ages 9 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; DOUGAL DIXON'S DINOSAURS &QL; 
 &UR; Dougal Dixon (Boyds Mills Press, $17.95)
</P>
<P>
   This is the definitive dinosaur book. Recommended by The
Dinosaur Soci ety, Dixon's authoritative text, pub lished in 18
languages, has been updated with the latest dinosaur dis coveries,
including Argentinosaurus, the biggest dinosaur known.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful illustrations and photographs bring the great beasts to
life. A Q &AMP; A in the back covers everything you'd want to know,
including which was the most intelligent dinosaur (Troodon); which
had the smallest brain (Stegosaurus, at 2.5 ounces); and which
nation has the most dinosaurs (the United States). Aficionados will
love it! For ages 8-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TEN QUEENS: PORTRAITS OF WOMEN OF POWER &QL; 
 &UR; Milton Meltzer; illustrated by Bethanne Audersen (Dutton, $24.99)
</P>
<P>
   Esther, the Jewish wife of King Ahasuerus of Persia, gives us
historical perspective on the women's movement. In the fifth
century, B.C., Esther foils the plot of the king's prime minister,
Haman, to wipe out the Jews _ an accomplishment celebrated
worldwide ever since with the Feast of Purim, a popular folk
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other strong women who ruled in their own right are
profiled, including Cleopatra, Isabel of Spain, Catherine the Great
of Russia and Elizabeth I of England. Their lives are portrayed in
an interesting way by Meltzer, who has written more than 90 books
for young people and adults in the fields of history, biography and
social reform. For ages 10 and up. &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; aol.com &QL; 
 &UR; Kara Swisher (Times, $25)
</P>
<P>
   When Swisher, who writes for the Wall Street Journal, began work
on this book in 1996, America Online was considered a goner. What a
difference a year makes. This is a story of entrepreneurial savvy
and dogged determination after Bill Gates told Steve Case, in 1993,
``I can buy 20 percent of you or I can buy all of you, or I can go
into this business myself and bury you.'' It was a time when Case's
struggle at AOL, Swisher writes, was ``like jumping from one
unstable ice floe to the next in a frantic attempt to prevent the
whole enterprise from sinking into the icy depths of capitalism's
ever-churning sea.'' All of this was complicated by the fact that
everything was new _ this was the Internet, on which everyone and
everything had just been born. Now we know what happened _ or at
least what has happened so far. Swisher's book is an entertaining
account of how this time, Microsoft didn't bury anyone. It's all in
the subtitle: ``How Steve Case Beat Bill Gates, Nailed the
Netheads, and Made Millions in the War for the Web.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SUITS ME: THE DOUBLE LIFE OF BILLY TIPTON &QL; 
 &UR; Diane Wood Middlebrook (Houghton Mifflin, $25)
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 in Spokane, Wash., a teenage boy named William summoned
an ambulance to a trailer park where his father, Billy, an aging
and very ill White jazz musician, had passed out. When paramedics
examined the old man, they discovered _ to the surprise of William,
the women who had lived with Billy and everyone else who knew him _
that he was a woman. Pronounced dead at the hospital, Billy Tipton
had fooled them all, from the time she was 19 until ``he'' died at
74. She began life as Dorothy Tipton, probably a lesbian, who was a
jazz pianist and saxophonist at a time when women were not accepted
in those roles. Her remarkable charade was known, at first, by some
tolerant fellow jazz players, and later, when her disguise had
fooled everyone else, she had several lovers and adopted three
sons, none of whom ever suspected that Billy was a woman.
Middlebrook was in Spokane in 1991 to publicize her previous book,
``Anne Sexton: A Biography,'' when she was approached by Kitty
Tipton Oakes, Billy's former wife, who asked Middlebrook to write a
book about him. It's the fascinating story, set against
Depression-era Oklahoma, of a woman born in 1914 and reborn in 1933
after she discovered, Middlebrook writes, ``that being taken for a
man provided access to almost everything she wanted _ music,
travel, the love of adventures and caretaking women.'' And she kept
it up, flawlessly, for nearly 60 years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; RATTLESNAKE CROSSING &QL; 
 &UR; J.A. Jance (Avon, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Brady, single mother and sheriff of Cochise County, is
investigating a shooting rampage on a local ranch when she stumbles
upon the body of a rural gun dealer whose fortresslike shop has
been cleaned of all its merchandise, apparently by his killer. Two
more killings follow, with both victims shot and scalped, and
suspicion settles on a local rancher and isolationist who wages his
own little war against the government and those he calls
``enviro-nuts.'' But the discovery that the dead gun dealer was
suffering from AIDS sets Brady looking for another solution to the
crime spree. Jance's sixth Joanna Brady novel is like its
predecessors _ notable here for its Arizona settings, but not for
its prose or plot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 8 WEEKS TO OPTIMUM HEALTH &QL; 
 &UR; Andrew Weil (Fawcett, $13.95)
</P>
<P>
   Change your life _ eat some broccoli. Get rid of the lard, save
the olive oil. Read those labels, buy some flowers, make friends
with vitamin C and (you might have to gear up for this one)
``fermented soybean products.'' Exercise, and throw out your
electric blanket. And whatever you do, don't keep your electric
clock radio within a foot of your head. Weil's seventh book, now
new in paperback, is an eight-week program that he says will ``give
you the information you need to keep your healing system in optimal
working order so that you can stay healthy as you encounter the
obstacles and challenges of day-to-day life.'' He includes lots of
testimonials from people who swear by his approach, and recipes
that involve things like tofu and gingerroot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MONSTER &QL; 
 &UR; John Gregory Dunne (Vintage, $12)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is Dunne's funny, enlightening look at one
screenplay and what happened to it in Hollywood after eight years,
27 drafts and many daunting battles with a monster called money (in
this case, it belonged to the Walt Disney Co.). In 1988, Dunne and
his wife, Joan Didion, were asked to write a movie script based on
the life of the late television journalist Jessica Savitch. Savitch
died horribly in 1983 when she was trapped in a car that overturned
in a Pennsylvania canal. Her messy life had involved drug abuse,
promiscuity, mental instability and the disdain of her colleagues.
(David Brinkley called her ``the dumbest woman I have ever met.'')
In 1996, however, the screenplay once based on her dark life was
released as ``Up Close &AMP; Personal,'' a sappy fairy tale starring
Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The rough road from one
extreme to the other is great reading about modern Hollywood,
behind the scenes. &QL;

HARVARD PROFESSOR WEIGHS IN WITH NOVEL THAT CHARMS READERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sanjay Nigam was doing his medical residency in Dallas 14
years ago, he learned two things that would change his life.
</P>
<P>
   The first was how not to sleep, a talent that came in handy at a
busy hospital where residents were responsible for most of the
patient care. The second was how to enjoy big, challenging novels,
the kind he'd never read before. Nigam had grown up in Arizona,
where in high school and later at Arizona State University in Tempe
he had taken only the basic writing and literature courses required
of him. He was, after all, a scientist, and had other interests.
But in Dallas, in the frenzy of a residency that was one of the
most demanding things he would ever do, he suddenly discovered
Tolstoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I started reading as some kind of coping mechanism,'' he
says today from Boston, where he is an associate professor at
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished `War and Peace' and `One Hundred Years of
Solitude,' Dostoyevsky, `Dr. Zhivago,' all those big Ayn Rand
books. Anything that was heavy, I read. I don't think I `took them
on,' as you say. It was more that I just dissolved into them. They
are good stories, and they were big enough to get swallowed up in.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading like that, you find that this is what you admire
_ good literature. I also think when you get into the intensity of
a residency you develop a kind of double vision. I'd always had a
strong theoretical, abstract, scientific bent. And then I got hit
with (begin itals) life. (end itals) The extremes of an emergency
room or an ICU. You have this abstract thing going on in your head,
but there are people bleeding and throwing up all over you. I think
out of that tension, plus my growing admiration for good
literature, I decided to write.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigam's first novel, ``The Snake Charmer,'' was released in June
to good reviews and strong reader interest, but it is not the book
you would expect from a man whose inspiration was some of the
weightiest fiction ever written. Just over 200 pages and written in
spare, accessible prose, it is the story of Sonalal, a poor, Indian
snake charmer who is set on a journey of self-discovery when in a
fit of anger he kills his beloved cobra, Raju.
</P>
<P>
   The story is deceptively simple (one critic called it ``the
midlife crisis of a snake charmer''). At times, it reads like a
fable. But there are many themes tucked into the folds of Sonalal's
dilemma: the quest for artistic perfection, the elusive beauty of
scientific thought, the importance of responsibility, of love and
of even a poor man's sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonalal is definitely a flawed character,'' says Nigam. ``On
the one hand, he's noble _ he wants to find perfection in art if
not in life. On the other hand, life just keeps getting in the way
and his own flaws keep tripping him up. He doesn't have a degree in
philosophy and he's not the most pro-active guy you'll ever meet.
There's this tension between what he's after and what he has the
talents to find. I think that's what drives the story forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigam learned to write when he went to New York City to do
scientific research after he finished his residency. He made his
own work schedule, and was able to take advantage of the city's
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from day one I got involved in writing workshops and
went to readings and met other writers,'' he says. ``You have the
opportunity there to commune both with big-name writers and a lot
of wannabes. It's informal, but I suspect that's the only way a
writing education can be. You can almost do your own tailored MFA,
just by living in New York and looking at the poetry calendar each
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigam was born in India, but left as a baby when his father came
to attend graduate school, first in Canada and then in the United
States (the family has lived in Arizona since he was 5). He
returned to India regularly throughout his childhood for long
visits with his grandparents. Some of the scenes in ``The Snake
Charmer'' _ most notably those set in Chandni Chowk, a colorful and
chaotic part of Old Delhi _ are based on firsthand knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigam is quick to point out that he grew up in Arizona and
his identity is Indian-American, even though he now is being linked
to some of the grandest Indian writers, including Vikram Chandra,
Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me right now, it's nice to be compared to people who are
so well-known _ it's flattering, frankly,'' he says. ``But with all
the attention on Indian writing, it becomes hard to distinguish
yourself. And it's even more complicated than that, really, because
there are two issues _ distinguishing yourself period, and
distinguishing yourself in the Western mind. Even for someone who's
deeply interested in literature _ let's even say foreign literature
_ how many Indian writers can you hold in your head? Five? Ten?
Whereas you can hold 50 or even 100 American or English writers in
your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a tendency to categorize. To lump. Right now
I'm grateful for it, but I can see how it might become annoying
later on.'' Nigam admits that he belongs to another category that
he likes even less, that of the doctor/writer. He can rattle off
the names of others _ Perri Klass, Robin Cook, Michael Crichton,
Ethan Canin, Richard Selzer, Samuel Shem.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not something he will change. He has no plans
to leave his work in medicine, nor will he stop writing. He has
gone back to a long novel he was working on sporadically before he
stopped two years ago to write ``The Snake Charmer.'' He has a
family, a job and stories to write, but says he has the stamina to
do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sleep much,'' he says, laughing. ``I never quite
recovered my ability to sleep after my residency. It's too bad in
some ways. But I suppose if I had, I'd never have written
anything.'' &QL;

ARE SOME WOMEN REALLY LIKE THIS?  
 
BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  Helen Fielding (Viking, $22.95)  
 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an ugly thought: What if someone were to put Helen
Fielding's new novel, ``Bridget Jones's Diary,'' into a time
capsule so as to preserve for women of the distant future an image
of what they might have been like if they had lived today?
</P>
<P>
   Think about that as you accompany the beleaguered Bridget
through a year in her terribly trivial life. Has evolution really
been working in reverse all this time? At least Neanderthal Woman
had something mildly pressing _ survival _ to occupy her mind
between boyfriends. Bridget has nothing better to do than to tint
her eyelashes, nurse her hangovers and evade her couple friends
(the ``Smug Marrieds'') as they try to fix her up with ruddy men
who wear braces and refer to women as ``fillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bridget is single and in her 30s, and therein lies her
crisis. She has a job that is largely unexplained, except that it
involves a computer on which she sends flirty messages to Daniel, a
co-worker with whom she is smitten but who we know will treat her
badly. Her mother has left her father after 35 years of marriage,
and run off with a con man from Portugal. Bridget smokes and drinks
too much, and sometimes treats a hangover by eating muesli out of
the package with a spoon and finishing off the dregs of wine in the
refrigerator. Her weight goes up and down, which never helps. And
she is beginning to have those single-but-no-longer-a-girl
thoughts, or as she describes them, ``fears of dying alone and
being found three weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that Bridget is unappealing. Actually, she is
very funny, in a guileless sort of way. This is because Fielding's
book is written as a diary, so nothing is kept secret from us.
Bridget begins each entry with a record of her weight (anywhere
from 119 to 133 pounds), her calorie consumption (low: 345, high:
8,489), her cigarette and alcohol tally and occasionally her thigh
girth and the number of minutes she spends counting her wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   We also know the entertaining details of her inner life. We wait
with her as she longs for Daniel's call, which seldom comes. We
squirm with her as the Smug Marrieds quiz her on her sex life. We
share her worries that her daffy mother might end up ``sitting on a
sofa with someone in stone-washed jeans called Gonzales and
explaining that, if you really love someone, a 46-year age gap
really doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bridget's supporting cast, the best is Tom, her gay friend,
something every single woman needs nowadays. When Bridget
inexplicably loses a few pounds, it is Tom who suggests that she
has a tapeworm. After she musters the resolve to stomp out on
Daniel, Tom pours vodka down her throat from the bottle, adding the
tomato juice and Worcestershire sauce afterward. When Bridget makes
herself up to look like a Hollywood star, he tells her that she
looks like Barbara Cartland.
</P>
<P>
   I should mention something else: Bridget is British. She began
life as the subject of Fielding's London newspaper column, on which
this book is based, and she is wildly popular in Britain.
Fielding's American publisher has smoothed over any semantic
wrinkles that might have interfered with a similar reception here.
</P>
<P>
   But can Bridget win readers in this country? It depends on how
much self-absorption your sense of humor can stand. I, for one, had
not read far into her diary before I found myself thinking of
Mother Teresa, someone I've never had occasion to think much about
before. This was bizarre and bewildering until I realized that
Mother Teresa was as different from the depthless Bridget as you
can get, and it was nice to remember that she, too, existed at the
end of the 20th century. What's more, Bridget _ fresh from
comforting her aging parents over their failing marriage _ knows
just how I felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so long since I have done anything at all for anyone
else that it is a totally new and heady sensation,'' she tells her
diary. ``This is what has been missing in my life. I am having
fantasies about becoming a Samaritan or Sunday school teacher,
making soup for the homeless (or, as my friend Tom suggested,
darling mini-bruschettas with pesto sauce), or even retraining as a
doctor. Maybe going out with a doctor would be better still, both
sexually and spiritually fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Bridget knows what she is, and so do we. And as long
as they put Mother Teresa in the time capsule too, we won't
complain. &QL;

BOOK RAISES NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT GULF WAR ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After the Gulf War, Gens. Colin Powell and
Norman Schwarzkopf benefited from public euphoria over the victory
_ and their national hero status _ by writing best-selling memoirs
and joining the lucrative talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But when the men and women who served in the 1991 desert war
began falling ill with a variety of puzzling symptoms and
debilitating ailments, the generals were no longer in command.
</P>
<P>
   When investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh interviewed Powell
and Schwarzkopf for his new book, ``Against All Enemies _ Gulf War
Syndrome: The War Between America's Ailing Veterans and Their
Government,'' the generals expressed dismay that the government has
failed to provide unstinting medical care for sick Gulf War
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' exclaimed Schwarzkopf, who was the commander of
Allied troops in the Gulf. ``Anybody who's sick deserves to be
treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf stressed that he retired in mid-1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you are retired, you're cut off from the flow of
events,'' he told Hersh. ``When you leave, someone else is
promoted, and the last thing they want is some old general coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during
the Gulf War, said his responsibilities ended when he retired in
1993. ``If there are still some veterans who say I should have done
more or said more, my answer is, I wasn't in the government,'' he
told Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against All Enemies'' serves as a primer on the roadblocks
soldiers have faced trying to get medical treatment and
compensation for Gulf War illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hersh said he hoped the book would put
new attention on the plight of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh notes in the book that at least 35 soldiers died in
``friendly-fire'' exchanges in the Gulf, accidents in which
Americans were hit by U.S. fire.
</P>
<P>
   But Hersh says the true toll is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 100,000 Gulf War veterans have registered thus far
for physical examinations at Pentagon and VA clinics, with nearly
90 percent reporting some symptoms,'' he wrote. ``Those men and
women are friendly-fire casualties just as surely as if they had
been fired upon by their fellow soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said his hunch is that ailing veterans and active-duty
soldiers were exposed to toxic substances in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are studying the effects of exposure to pesticides,
chemical and biological warfare agents, vaccines, infectious
diseases, depleted uranium, oil well fires and smoke, and
petrochemical products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell what's made them sick,'' Hersh said. ``That's a
very complicated issue. The Pentagon has tried skating away by
talking about stress. What that means to most GIs is that they're
sick because they're weaklings. Even if they are suffering from
combat fatigue or shellshock or post traumatic stress disorder, so
what? The bottom line is, it doesn't matter. We should take care of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Against All Enemies,'' Hersh introduces readers to the cast
of characters that has helped _ and hindered _ sick soldiers in
their quest for care and compensation. He also presents people who
were prevented from helping.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains a memo written by a Veterans Administration
doctor who described herself as ``one of the many refusenik
professionals who remain deeply concerned about the integrity and
efficacy of today's federal medical programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, an infectious disease specialist who treated more
than 600 veterans, was fired in 1997 after sending superiors a
sarcastic five-step outline on how to avoid treating Gulf War
veterans: (1) Keep claims lost in limbo for years; (2) Bill
veterans for services; (3) Alter diagnoses to reflect depression,
stress and postcombat fatigue; (4) Ignore physical, clinical or
laboratory abnormalities in veterans and deny their presence
publicly; (5) Never admit that modern medicine may be facing a new
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's slim book _ 100 pages _ focuses on the politics of Gulf
War illnesses. He takes readers behind the scenes, to the months
before the war when the Pentagon was scrambling to figure out how
to protect troops from Iraqi biological and chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hersh also describes the scene on the battlefield: ``The
chemical warfare alarms did not work as designed. Many gas masks,
carried by each soldier as the first line of defense, could not be
made to fit or work properly.''
</P>
<P>
   He relates failures of the U.S. intelligence community: ``The
possibility of low-level exposure to nerve agents from (U.S.)
bombing and demolition (of Iraqi facilities) was not entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, an award-winning investigative reporter, concludes: ``It
was more than sloppy, and more than the normal fog of war. A
veteran suffering from Gulf War syndrome could even believe it to
be criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's last book, ``The Dark Side of Camelot,'' tackled the
mythologies surrounding the presidency of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against All Enemies,'' is the fifth offering in a monthly
series published by Ballantine's Library of Contemporary Thought.
The series is designed to give writers the chance to explore a
topic they feel passionately about.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said he was inspired to focus on Gulf War illnesses after
the father of an ailing veteran sent him a ``care package'' of
information on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Against All Enemies'' Hersh shows how America's ailing
veterans have taken the gloss off the victory in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military's inevitable dilemma is profound: Can it protect
our soldiers and sailors in future wars if it was unable to do so
in the Gulf War?'' Hersh wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh says the ``last battle'' of the Gulf War will focus on the
use of depleted uranium ammunition, which is made of metal that is
toxic and radioactive. The Pentagon, which failed to train troops
about its hazards, admitted this year that ``thousands'' of
soldiers may have been exposed to contaminated dust and debris in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concern about that exposure, and reports of rising
cancer rates in Iraq, the Pentagon has declined to reconsider its
reliance on the ammunition, Hersh wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depleted uranium shells and bombs are now being offered for
sale by the United States to foreign armies and air forces,'' he
wrote. ``Sales are brisk. American know-how, and radioactive
poisoning, is being merchandised around the world.''

CARIBBEAN COAST

the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.

<P>
   XCACEL, Mexico _ She struggles ashore in darkness, illuminated
only by a milky spray of stars in the Caribbean sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sole sounds on the beach are the waves, the wind and the
steady crunch of webbed fingers scooping sand with amazing agility.
About 90 minutes later, the massive loggerhead sea turtle _ four
feet long, weighing nearly half a ton _ completes her task: she
lays more than a hundred pearl-colored eggs and furiously kicks
sand over her secret nest before lumbering back into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since time immemorial, creatures like this have relied on this
secluded Mexican beach called Xcacel (isk-ka-SEL) to come ashore
and reproduce. Only one in 100 hatchlings survive the perils of
nature. Fewer survive the dangers of man, who has pushed sea
turtles toward extinction.
</P>
<P>
   And now, biologists fear, Xcacel, one of the most important sea
turtle nesting grounds in the Caribbean and Atlantic, may soon be
gone. Earlier this year, over protests by sea turtle experts, the
state of Quintana Roo sold 113 acres of this small stretch of
paradise, a little more than a mile long and 390 acres in total, to
the Spanish luxury hotel developer Sol Melia.
</P>
<P>
   More sales of the beach, which is 67 miles south of Cancun, are
planned. They will also result in hotels unless environmentalists
can find a way to stop construction or buy back the land.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of solitude, biologists say, sea turtles who nest at
Xcacel may soon encounter the glare of artificial lights coming
from hundreds, perhaps thousands of hotel rooms, and they will be
driven back into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will become a hotel sanctuary, not a turtle sanctuary,''
said Julio Zurita, one of Mexico's leading sea turtle specialists
and a marine biologist at Quintana Roo's College of the Southern
Border. He has studied Xcacel for years and helped develop a
pioneering program that places volunteers on the beach at night to
protect the turtles and their eggs from poachers.
</P>
<P>
   The potential destruction of Xcacel ``is indeed one of the most
urgent conservation crises in the world for sea turtles,'' said
marine biologist Brian Bowen of the University of Florida in
Gainesville, who has also studied Xcacel.
</P>
<P>
   Xcacel is home to the largest reservoir of genetic diversity
anywhere in the Atlantic of loggerhead and green sea turtles, Bowen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Xcacel nesting ground is eliminated,'' he said,
``twenty percent of the genetic diversity in Atlantic loggerhead
turtles and 22 percent of the genetic diversity in Atlantic green
turtles will be lost forever. Such a loss would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic diversity is the insurance, Bowen said, that allows
species to survive climate changes, pollution and other
environmental challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Xcacel's fame is evidence that the Mexican beach is
the ``well spring'' from which these turtles eventually colonized
the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 15 percent of the sea turtles trapped and found
dead in drift nets off the Azores islands off Portugal are Xcacel
natives, testimony to these turtles' reach and vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on sea turtle nesting grounds is a global problem
now, Bowen and other specialists said, as well as one of the top
concerns of Latin American turtle specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, Bowen said, a beach that used to host 1,000 turtles
a season is now down to one or two because of a hotel development
that, ironically, invited tourists to see the turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Perez Erales, environmental secretary for Quintana Roo
state, accuses environmentalists of acting prematurely and
exaggerating the scope of development that will take place at
Xcacel. First, he said, developers must obtain permits from
Mexico's National Ecology Institute and finish environmental impact
studies that show plans comply with some degree of conservation
required on this coast.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a requirement to protect turtles, Perez Erales said,
Quintana Roo governor Maria Villanueva declared a portion of Xcacel
a state turtle reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the area only extends 100 meters, or 110 yards, from the
water line, an amount that is ``just a Band-Aid,'' said Bowen.
``Protect a narrow strip of the beach is just not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whispering in the dark, while a turtle laid her eggs at Xcacel,
Zurita too scoffed at the idea: ``This is how they're protecting a
turtle sanctuary? With 100 meters?''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the governor's declaration had no scientific
foundation, and seemed to be more of a move to smooth controversy
over selling Xcacel. The beaches adjacent to Xcacel, which are also
important nesting grounds, have already been sold and are now under
development as part of Mexico's new tourist attraction, the ``Mayan
Riviera.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Cantu of Mexico's Greenpeace chapter said, ``Sol
Melia doesn't care at all about turtle protection at Xcacel . . .
And the governor stuck it to everyone by selling the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sol Melia, which has built large hotels and golf resorts in
Cancun and other parts of Mexico, failed to return requests for
interviews about Xcacel.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the sale, Mexican conservationists had tried to
persuade Mexico's federal government, which controlled the land
until 1993, to declare Xcacel in its entirety a federal reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the turtles, the property is home to other
threatened wildlife and contains mangrove thickets protected under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the Mayab Ecology Group based in Cancun began
to press the government to protect Xcacel. In 1994, it submitted an
official proposal with requisite scientific research. Only this
year did officials respond to the request, turning it down, shortly
before the state sold the land.
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Dominguez of the Mayab Ecology Group said, ``We're
asking for what, two kilometers of beach? Is that too much to
ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are also upset because a 1995 land use plan for
the Quintana Roo coast, signed by the governor, included ``strong
recommendations'' to protect Xcacel.
</P>
<P>
   The land use plan included a clause recommending that if Xcacel
were to be sold, environmentalists should have the first right to
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists say they were never given that chance. But it
may not be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ecology groups are interested in buying the land, we'll
sell it to them,'' Perez Erala said. But they will have to come up
with the $11 million that Sol Melia paid for its share of the land,
plus additional funds for the remainder of the property if they
also want to buy that.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sol Melia is willing to cancel its Xcacel contract.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the $11 million figure is far more than
the price they've heard quoted for the land. Nevertheless, they
would like to buy Xcacel, but fear that raising so much money on
short notice would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be really tough, unless they can find someone like
Ted Turner,'' Bowen said. ``By the time they raise the money, those
turtles could be a distant memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican environmentalists are also weighing legal options here,
but worry there are few left before construction starts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Mexico banned molestation of all sea turtles, and in a
gesture of good will, it hosted the first two meetings for the
establishment of the Inter-American Convention for the Protection
and Conservation of Sea Turtles. Mexico hasn't signed the accord
yet, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sol Melia has put up a sign at the entrance to
the beach declaring it ``private property'' and advertising a
``tourist development.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can ask a guard to allow them onto the beach, and
student volunteers still camp there at night, transplanting eggs to
protected nesting areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always says, 'Nothing will happen when hotels are
built.' But it's not true,'' said Daphne Gadar, a Mexico City
biology student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine tourists like to come to a place like this now,''
she said, swinging in a hammock, ``with clean water, no big hotels.
Mexico is still exotic in that way, but we're fast doing away with
it.''

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Greg Louganis, the Olympic diver, who has
HIV? How is he doing now? He hasn't been in the news lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: The four-time Olympic gold medalist, who found out in 1988
that he had tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
making the rounds to promote ``Looking to the Light,'' a video
diary of his life over the past two years. The video shows his
tedious daily routine of taking several medications that help him
battle HIV and a wide range of side effects. He participated in the
video project in lieu of another book. His autobiography,
``Breaking the Surface,'' was a best seller and was made into a USA
Network movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he was
appearing at a bookstore, he said he has ``some great doctors'' who
look after him physically and mentally. ``For some people, HIV has
become their first occupation,'' Louganis said. ``I just have other
things to do. ... I am reminded every time I take my medication,
but there are other things going on that's taking my focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Louganis also makes speeches, to student groups among others,
about health issues. ``With all my stumbles and falls, I've picked
myself up and I'm still going,'' he told an audience recently at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The League of Conservation Voters grades members of Congress
annually on their voting record on environmental issues. How can I
contact that group to get its scorecard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scorecard is produced for each session of Congress. The
organization welcomes inquiries from everyone interested in knowing
how members of Congress have voted on issues related to the
environment, said spokeswoman Lisa Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecards are free and can be obtained by writing: League
of Conservation Voters, 1707 L St. NW, 750, Washington, DC 20036;
or by calling toll-free 1-888-744-8683 or 202-785-8683. You also
can request the information by e-mail (lcv(at)lcv.org). And for
those with Internet access, the League has posted its scorecards on
its home page: www.lcv.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Margaret Thatcher doing these days? She seems to have
dropped out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   A: Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven _ her title since 1992 _ still
pops up on the lecture circuit from time to time. But other than
that, the former British prime minister appears to prefer a low
profile at her base in London. In April, she met with Zhu Rongji,
China's newly selected premier, during his visit to London. And she
traveled recently to the United States to address a group at St.
Louis University on the topic ``Reflections on Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think Thatcher has been forgotten, however. She was one of
only thee women selected by Time in April for its list of 20 people
designated ``the most influential leaders and revolutionaries of
the past century'' (the other two: Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret
Sanger).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the atomic-powered merchant ship
Savannah?
</P>
<P>
   A: The N.S. (nuclear ship) Savannah is moored in the James River
at Norfolk, Va., along with about 100 other vessels in the James
River Reserve Fleet. It's under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Maritime Administration. The Savannah, the world's first
atomic-powered merchant vessel, was launched in 1959. In 1979 it
was retired from active service, and in 1981 was moved to
Charleston's Patriots Point Naval &AMP; Maritime Museum, home of the
USS Yorktown (CV-10) and other vessels. The Savannah was designated
a National Historic Landmark in 1991 and was turned over to the
Maritime Administration and moved to Norfolk in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 595 1/2-foot Savannah will be in the James River
Reserve Fleet for quite some time _ because of radiation concerns
it will be at least 30 years before it can be safely scrapped,
according to the maritime agency's Robert Rohr _ it won't be
reopened to the public. It is constantly monitored with remote
alarm systems to ensure its ``integrity,'' Rohr said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Garth Brooks is the No. 3 best-selling recording
artist of all time. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: He appears to be No. 2. International statistics are hard to
come by, so this information applies to the United States. Brooks,
with total album sales of about 68 million, is second only to the
Beatles, whose total U.S. album sales are about 105 million (1
billion discs and tapes worldwide). But there's an asterisk
involved: As Brooks himself has noted, the keeping of statistics
didn't begin seriously until well after Elvis Presley was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the current wages and benefits of the striking
General Motors workers?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to The Wall Street Journal, GM pays $44 an hour, on
average, in wages and benefits to its workers who are members of
the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent editorial said tobacco kills 400,000 Americans a
year. How does that compare to alcohol-related deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: More than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States can be
attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, according to the
National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print ``13 Things Graduates Need to Know But Are
Never Taught,'' as read by Paul Harvey recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harvey read ``Rules Not Learned'' by Charles Sykes, author of
``Dumbing Down Our Kids,'' and is reprinted with permission of Paul
Harvey News:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Life is not fair. Get used to it. (2) The world won't care
about your self-esteem as much as your school does. The world will
expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about
yourself. (3) You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high
school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone until you
earn both. (4) If you think your teacher is rough, wait till you
get a boss. He doesn't have tenure. (5) Flipping burgers is not
beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for
burger-flipping. They called it ``opportunity.'' (6) If you screw
up, it's not your parents' fault. So don't whine about your
mistakes; learn from them. (7) Before you were born, your parents
weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your
bills, cleaning your room and listening to you tell how idealistic
you are. So before you save the rain forest from the blood-sucking
parasites of your parents' generation, try de-lousing the closet in
your own room. (8) Your school may have done away with winners and
losers, but life hasn't. In some schools, they've abolished failing
grades. They'll give you as many times as you want for the right
answer. This, of course, bears not the slightest resemblance to
anything in real life. (9) Life is not divided into semesters. You
don't get summers off. And very few employers are interested in
helping you ``find yourself''; do that on your own time. (10)
Television is not real life. In real life, people actually have to
leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. (11) Be nice to nerds;
chances are you'll end up working for nerds. (12) Smoking does not
make you look ``cool;'' it makes you look moronic. Ditto for purple
hair and pierced body parts. (13) Living fast and dying young is
romantic _ only until you see one of your peers at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   And this, June graduates, is a footnote of my (Harvey's) own:
Get up when you fall down. Get up when you fall down. Michael
Jordan has missed the basket 9,000 times. He has lost almost 300
games. Twenty-six times, Michael Jordan has been trusted to take
the game-winning shot _ and missed. Jordan says, ``Over and over
and over again, I have failed. And that is why I succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The book ``The Fourth Estate'' by Jeffrey Archer has a story
about a media mogul who takes his yacht out and jumps overboard to
commit suicide. Isn't this something that actually happened a few
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're thinking about the case of Robert Maxwell, flamboyant
British billionaire press baron who was called ``the Citizen Kane
of his time.'' His unclothed body was found floating in the
Atlantic near the Canary Islands Nov. 5, 1991, several hours after
he was reported missing from his yacht. An official pathologists'
report from the Spanish National Institute of Toxicology concluded
that Maxwell, 68, had suffered a heart attack before he fell off
his yacht. The pathologists ruled out the possibility that his
death had been caused by poison, drugs, alcohol or foul play,
noting that there were no signs of violence on the body other than
marks on the head, apparently caused when the body was lifted out
of the water by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the report, some people speculated that Maxwell's death
may not have been from a heart attack. Not long before he died,
Maxwell had been accused in a book by U.S. investigative reporter
Seymour Hersh of having close ties to the Israeli secret service.
Maxwell was buried Nov. 10, 1991, at the Mount of Olives in
Jerusalem. He received what was close to a state funeral, with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and President Chaim Herzog in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned that Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.)
receives $37,500 in veterans' benefits. What is that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cleland receives annual disability benefits from the Veterans
Administration in the amount of $37,506, said his spokeswoman,
Julie Robinson. Cleland was left a triple amputee by wounds
suffered in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Will Smith paid for his role in the original ``Men
in Black''? I heard he would make $20 million for the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hollywood sources say Smith was paid $5 million for ``MiB.''
Although his base salary for the sequel is said to be $20 million,
it could be more. Like other heavyweights involved in the film _
Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Sonnenfeld _ he is said to be seeking
whatever amount is higher, the $20 million or 10 percent of the
film's gross income. Steven Spielberg, by the way, is seeking 20
percent of the sequel's gross.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said that cholorine, when used in swimming pools,
wipes out virtually all bacteria and most viruses, including all
coliform, polio virus, hepatitis A and common cold germs.
Conspicuously omitted was any reference to the AIDS virus. Does
chlorine kill that, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: The risk of transmission in swimming pools or whirlpools of
HIV (the AIDS virus), or other viruses such as hepatitis B or
herpes simplex type II, is so low that it's unmeasurable, according
to medical experts at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. While the usual amount of halogen used to disinfect
swimming pools and whirlpools is considered more than sufficient to
kill these viruses, ``chemical germicide,'' such as chlorination,
isn't a factor. The simple dilution of the water wouldn't allow the
pathogenic agent to invade a susceptible individual, the CDC adds.
So the risk of transmission with swimming pool water, or even
wastewater, is virtually nonexistent.

   SECOND OF TWO PARTS
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where has the E. coli bacteria been all my life? As a kid, I
played in many swimming pools throughout the summers, but I don't
ever recall hearing about E. coli until recently. Is it a new
strain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It isn't new. The E. coli implicated in the current outbreak,
0157:H7, was identified in 1982 as a source of illness in people,
said the CDC's Katy Hopkins. That was the outbreak related to
contaminated hamburgers in the Northwest. There are literally
hundreds of strains of E. coli, most of which are harmless, Hopkins
added. They live within the intestines and don't cause any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many times has Larry King of CNN been married?
</P>
<P>
   A: He took the vows for the seventh time last November.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain what ``derivatives'' are? I've read that many
banks and insurance companies are heavily invested in them.
</P>
<P>
   A: Derivatives are financial contracts whose gains and losses
are tied to the performance of underlying financial instruments,
such as stocks and bonds. An option to buy or sell a stock is one
example of a derivative. Many companies use derivatives to hedge,
or reduce risk, from changes in interest rates, currency values and
commodity prices. But they also are used for speculation, and some
derivatives are considered more risky than others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the case of Jeff Smith, ``The Frugal Gourmet'' on PBS,
ever resolved? Several months ago I heard some accusations were
made about him, but I never saw a followup.
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith has been accused of molestation by several men who
allege that he used his power as their employer to force them to
perform sex acts with him years ago. Edward Winskill, Smith's
attorney, has denied all accusations in the lawsuits and in public
statements by the plaintiffs. No criminal charges have ever been
filed against Smith and the statute of limitations has expired on
the alleged incidents. A civil case is set for trial July 9. One
sexual abuse lawsuit against Smith has been dismissed in Pierce
County, Wash., Superior Court. It involved Clinton Smith (no
relation to Jeff Smith), who was sentenced to four years in prison
in 1981, partly for stealing money from the Chaplain's Pantry, a
business Jeff Smith owned in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in a story I heard about the Greenbrier Hotel
in West Virginia. It supposedly had an underground area where U.S.
government officials would go in case of a nuclear attack.
Apparently its existence was made public only when information was
declassified in recent years. Can you tell me about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The former government relocation facility under the hotel was
a top secret of the Cold War. ``Project Greek Island,'' as it was
code-named, was designed to house members of Congress in the event
of a nuclear strike on Washington. The Greenbrier is in White
Sulphur Springs, W.Va., a four- or five-hour drive from Capitol
Hill. The secret 112,000-square-foot bunker was built into a
mountain when the hotel's West Virginia Wing was added in 1960. Its
existence was revealed in 1992, and in 1995 the bunker was opened
for public tours _ but with its furnishings and equipment removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A wonderful montage of the NBA playoffs was shown recently on
ESPN ``SportsCenter.'' It was done to the music of ``He Got Game.''
Is it being sold to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, ESPN says it's not available for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did CNBC cancel the Charles Grodin TV program?
</P>
<P>
   A: When ``Charles Grodin'' was canceled abruptly earlier this
month, midway through its fourth season, the official reason cited
was that the talk show and the network were going in different
directions. NBC News President Andrew Lack, who is responsible for
CNBC's prime-time and weekend programmimg, said the network's
increasing focus on news-oriented programming didn't mesh well with
Grodin's increasing focus on social issues, ``and that warranted a
change.'' USA Today reported this comment from Grodin after he was
zapped: ``It's remarkable that they let me do it for three years. I
go against the grain and the grain is bottom line and business.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports keep recommending that we wash our vegetables
and fruits as a safeguard against bacteria. Does that mean just
rinsing them with water, or should we use some kind of soap? If
soap is needed, can it be dishwashing soap, or should it be
antibacterial?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to use any kind of detergent, bleach or
special rinse. In fact, that would do more harm than good, says
Judy Harrison, food scientist with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. Her advice: Remove and discard the outer leaves
from green, leafy vegetables and wash one or two leaves at a time
thoroughly in clean water. You can peel other fruits and vegetables
to eliminate possible surface bacterial contamination, but some of
the fiber will be lost. So you're better off just washing them
thoroughly, using running water.
</P>
<P>
   One other recommendation is to choose fruits and vegetables from
a ``name-brand, reputable company,'' Harrison added. ``They tend to
have more strict control measures in place to ensure sanitation and
safety of their foods.'' She also pointed out that the United
States has the safest food supply in the world, so the problem here
isn't as acute as in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A committee is being formed to investigate the transfer of
technological information to China under the administration of
President Clinton. I thought this sort of thing was started in the
Ronald Reagan administration, and continued in that of George Bush.
Don't I also remember that either China or Japan gave Reagan $2
million after he left office? Which country was it, and why was it
given?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're likely thinking of the case of Reagan's visit to Japan
in October 1989. Reagan, who had left office the previous January,
and his wife, Nancy, were guests of the Fujisankei Communications
Group, a leading Japanese media conglomerate. Some eyebrows were
raised, particularly in the United States, when it was reported
that Fujisankei paid Reagan a $2 million fee to give two 20-minute
speeches during his stay. While Reagan foes questioned the taste
and seemliness of a former U.S. president accepting such an
enormous sum for so little work, his staffers rebuffed the
criticism by saying large honoraria were the norm in Japan at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand Bill Gates' net worth is an estimated $40
billion. When Cornelius Vanderbilt died, his fortune was estimated
at more than $105 million. What would that amount be today, if it
had been invested since 1877?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gates would look like a pauper in comparison, said Lawrence
D. Brown of Georgia Georgia State University. Brown based his
assessment on the assumption that Vanderbilt's $105 million would
have earned a return of 10 percent a year, compounded annually.
That's essentially what the stock market has done on an annual
basis over the past 121 years, he said. By that reckoning, at the
end of 1997 Vanderbilt's $105 million would have ballooned to $10.7
trillion. ``Vanderbilt would have been worth more than 267 times
what Gates is worth today,'' Brown said. ``Or, to put it another
way, for every dollar that Gates has, assuming it's 40 billion,
Vanderbilt would have almost 268.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chefs may want to get you into their restaurants, but
now more than ever, they have their eye on your pantry shelf as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs, and their product lines, were out in force at this
year's Fancy Food Show, the annual trade show that began Sunday at
the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and ends Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, maybe there were five chefs exhibiting
products,'' said Ronald Tanner, the spokesman for the National
Association for the Specialty Food Trade. ``This year there are
close to 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new faces in chef's whites dishing out samples to
buyers, store owners and others was Lidia Bastianich of Felidia,
Becco and Frico Bar in Manhattan, who was introducing a line of
three tomato-based pasta sauces being made under her name by
Colavita.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Rondelli, the French chef who closed his San Francisco
restaurant a few months ago to devote his time to developing a line
of products, was there, too. He has concentrated on a category
that's become popular among chefs, the cooking sauce; his are
champagne-based, and they come in seven flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Denton and Marc Valiani of Lulu's in San Francisco were
handing out little cups with samples of their new condiments to
anyone who stopped at their booth.
</P>
<P>
   With its fig, currant and black cherry balsamic vinegars, the
Lulu's line was as trendy as anything in the show, except perhaps
seasoned dipping oils for bread: the Javits Center was awash in
them. And tangerine oils _ there were at least four at different
booths. But nothing a chef could concoct was as weird as seeing
samples of chocolate cheese alongside the smoked fish at the Royal
Baltic Smoked Fish booth.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Trotter of Charlie Trotter in Chicago was another chef
whose foods, including salad dressings like black olive-caper
vinaigrette and dessert sauces like cinnamon-butterscotch, were
being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Products like these _ the salad dressings, marinades, sauces,
oils, vinegars and dessert toppings _ are easy for home cooks to
use and add a touch of dining-out glamour.
</P>
<P>
   David Burke, the chef and co-owner of Park Avenue Cafe in
Manhattan and Chicago, who has been at the show in previous years
with the spiced salmon products he developed for Perona Farms in
Andover, N.J., was dishing up slices of duck meatloaf, a new
product that he serves in the restaurant and which is now being
made for retail sale by D'Artagnan.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lucrative niche. ``Chefs are where it's at,'' said
Michael Shine, the president of the Shine Companies in Spring,
Texas, which is making products like Dean Fearing's Caesar Salad
Diablo dressing from the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. ``As
this industry grows, you need something to set a product apart.
Something that was Mama's recipe is not enough anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   From the chef's point of view, being in business with an
experienced food producer that can take care of the technical side,
the marketing and the distribution is a big plus. A few chefs, like
Rondelli, are putting up their own money for these ventures, but
most have licensing agreements with food producers and receive
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   As Burke put it, ``It doesn't cost me a thing, except some time,
to do this.''

 &HT;    HEALTH EQUALS WEALTH FOR AGING BOOMERS
 &HT;    570&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Baby Boomers entering their 50s, staying
healthy may be the key to being wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   For people between the ages of 51 and 61, ``health shocks'' such
as cancer and heart attacks are increasingly frequent, and often
determine whether a family accumulates wealth or depletes it, said
James P. Smith, senior economist and chairman of labor markets and
demographic studies for the RAND Corp., an independent research
group.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his research showed the loss of wealth is not
necessarily due to out-of-pocket payment of medical bills, but was
more closely tied to loss of income and the opportunity to invest
those earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health insurance is not synonymous with wealth insurance,''
said Smith, summing up his findings of a six-year study of health
and wealth of middle-aged Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was among several researchers who took part Tuesday in a
seminar on the economics of aging sponsored by the National
Institute on Aging, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's findings are based on an ongoing study of 10,236
Americans born between 1931 and 1941 who were interviewed first in
1992-1993 and at two-year intervals since then.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents who describe themselves as having excellent health
have two and a half times as much household income and five times
as much household wealth as respondents who describe their health
as poor, the study found. Wealth includes equity in homes,
financial assets and value of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cautioned that the relationship between health and wealth
is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Wealth often has a direct influence on health, he acknowledged.
``Good health is an outcome that people desire, and higher wealth
or income enables them to purchase more of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said health often has an equally direct influence on
wealth _ especially as people reach middle age and increasingly
experience ``new health events'' such as high blood pressure. His
research found that this deterioration has ``quantitatively large
effects on wealth accumulation among those in their 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   One illustration is that middle-income earners have dramatic
differences in accumulated wealth despite having had roughly equal
paychecks. The wealthy were more like to have enjoyed good health
than those who had accumulated little.
</P>
<P>
   While paying medical bills does cut into wealth accumulation,
with the prevalence of health insurance this expense is not as
devastating as might be imagined, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``More directly, healthier people may be able to work more,
leading to higher earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found respondents often hit with ``health shocks'' in
their 50s. During a four-year period, one third were hospitalized
at least once and 5 percent of those spent at least a month in the
hospital. About one in every eight experienced at least one
``severe new onset'' of cancer, heart disease, stroke or lung
disease.
</P>
<P>
   While people generally know their health may deteriorate as they
age, ``the actual realization, especially its timing, may be
unanticipated,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   With the oldest of the Baby Boomers celebrating their 52d
birthdays this year, and millions more marching into their 50s
every year for the next decade, Smith said more attention should be
paid to the generation's links between health and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Boomers who plan to retire early need to substantially increase
their savings, said Olivia S. Mitchell, executive director of the
Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School, who also spoke at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Private savings among American families is at an all-time low,
and most people will not be able to sustain a lifestyle that
extends beyond two decades of retirement, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The average couple in which at least one spouse falls in the
51-61 age bracket will need to increase their savings by 16 percent
_ beyond such devices as their present investment and pension
accounts such as 401(k) tax-deferred retirement plans _ to maintain
their pre-retirement lifestyle if they retire at age 62. By
remaining in the work force an additional three years, they could
cut their additional savings in half to just over 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, high-income earners will have to increase their
savings the most to keep up with their pre-retirement consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A couple with earnings of nearly $12,000 a year would have to
increase savings 6 percent to retire at 62 without a diminution in
consumption, and could even reduce savings nearly 5 percent if they
continued working until 65. But the average couple with earnings of
$102,000 would have to increase their savings nearly 24 percent to
retire at 62, and 16.5 percent to retire at 65.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, based on a study of 12,000 families in 1992,
assumed that the median household wealth _ including the value of
the home and estimated pension and Social Security benefits _ was
$383,000 for those retiring at age 62 and $420,000 for those
retiring at 65.
</P>
<P>
   While those figures apply to the average family, not every
family meets the prescription for savings, Mitchell said. Nearly a
third of those planning to retire at 62, and 40 percent of those
planning to retire at 65, do not need to increase their current
savings rate to retain their same standard of living.

WATERMELON DRINKS: COOL, SWEET, COLORFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watermelon has an all-American image, one that goes along with
hot summer days, picnics at the beach and backyard cookouts. But
this does not give enough credit to a fruit that has been
refreshing people since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   Botanists believe that watermelons originated in the Kalahari
Desert of southern Africa, based on the reports of the explorer
David Livingstone, who found vines there in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The vines were also cultivated in Egypt at least 5,000 years
ago, and are depicted in wall paintings there. (Cubes of watermelon
with salty, feta-like cheese, are still a favorite Egyptian
breakfast.)
</P>
<P>
   Watermelons followed the trade routes throughout the Middle East
to Central Asia, China and Europe. Just imagine trading caravans
provisioned with the quenching melons, the merchants munching on
refreshing wedges, spitting the seeds and thus inadvertently sowing
the crop in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit made its way to America, most likely on slave ships.
Thomas Jefferson planted what he called ``Neapolitan watermelons''
in his garden in 1773, but they were already growing in other parts
of the country, including New England. The American taste for
watermelon goes back a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 86 percent of all households in the United States buy
watermelon at least once a year and 73 percent of them buy it once
a month, according to the National Watermelon Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
   More than four billion pounds of watermelons were harvested in
the United States last year, mainly in California, Florida, Georgia
and Texas. Nonetheless, nearly 600 million pounds were imported
into the United States, mainly from Mexico, to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Americans ate an average of 16 pounds a person, down
a bit from the record of 17.4 pounds a person in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all those watermelon fans already know that a chilled
wedge is not the only way to enjoy this fruit. What about drinking
it instead?
</P>
<P>
   Watermelon is easy to seed, pulverize and season to serve over
ice with or without a splash of vodka, rum, wine or other alcohol.
The juice is an excellent sweetener for iced tea or sangria. And
chilled or frozen watermelon can also be pureed to tint and flavor
some classic cocktails like margaritas and daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for watermelons, which are often sold cut, look
for flesh that is firm and bright, without any splits and grainy
areas. The latest additions to the market are yellow-fleshed ones
and seedless or triploid varieties, both of which taste about the
same but cost more than the garden Godzillas.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these are perfectly suited to making watermelon drinks.
But why spend more than necessary? And considering that watermelons
are 92 percent water, you do not have to do much to them to get
them into a glass. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two guidebooks designed to make traveling in the California wine
country more fun have just been published. They're both good, even
though neither one offers help on the single most pressing issue
facing the Napa County visitor: How in blazes do you make a
left-hand turn coming out of a winery along Route 29?
</P>
<P>
   Route 29 is the main drag through the Napa Valley. From the Napa
city line to the outskirts of Calistoga, from May to October, from
dawn (almost) to dusk, the traffic creeps past the wineries in a
solid line, defying anyone to break into it. Don't be misled;
Californians are friendly folk, but not when they're in their cars.
They won't hurt you, but they may very well cause you to be late
for lunch at Mustards or Tra Vigne. (Read on for a traffic tip you
won't find in these books.)
</P>
<P>
   Napa and Sonoma Counties, the best-known California wine
regions, are hardly twins, as the Napa and Sonoma Book (Berkshire
House, $17.95) points out. Napa is formal, tony and chic; Sonomo is
laid-back, warm hearted and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Sonomans never tire of pointing out that they are earthy and
unpretentious, while Napans are socialites who wear designer
clothes. The analogy is sometimes made to two famous regions in
France: that Sonomans are the Burgundians of California, and the
Napa residents are the Bordelais.
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor intent on seeing, and tasting, as much as
possible, the Wine Country Guide to California (Wine Spectator
Magazine, $6.95) is a must, as it covers the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Mendocino, for example, can take in wineries like
Navarro and Roederer Estate, with perhaps a side trip to the wild
Mendocino coast. Or they might want to explore Lake County to visit
Lily Langtry's home at the immense Guenoc Winery estate.
</P>
<P>
   They might choose to zip across the Bay Bridge from San
Francisco to taste some zinfandels at Rosenblum Cellars in Alameda,
or go south to check out Ridge Vineyards high in the Santa Cruz
Mountains at Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Country Guide will get them there. The book is divided
into nine wine regions, with listings of wineries, restaurants,
lodgings, events and diversions that may include beaches, parks,
golf courses, farm tours and balloon trips.
</P>
<P>
   The winery listings include addresses and phone numbers, tour
hours, the kinds of wines offered and tasting charges.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly interesting wineries are designated ``Top Stops''
and singled out with photographs. Some of them in Napa are Clos
Pegase, Domaine Chandon, and Niebaum-Coppola. In Sonoma, Martini &AMP;
Prati and Sam Sebastiani's Viansa Winery and Italian Market Place
are among those singled out.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves, an underground
winery and art museum, as well as the Jordan Winery, which is a
reproduction of a Bordeaux chateau; an appointment is needed to
visit it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Top Stops are well-known. Ever heard of the Cilurzo
Vineyard and Winery in Temecula, south of Los Angeles? Or Chatom
Vineyards in Douglas Flat, in the Sierra foothills? This is a
wine-producing region in the mountainous eastern part of the state,
closer to Nevada than to the Pacific Ocean. Regulars there say it
resembles the Napa Valley 30 years ago in its simplicity and rural
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed fold-out winery maps are included for Sonoma and Napa,
where, let's face it, most of the action is. Most of the better
restaurants are covered, with concise reviews and tips on what to
eat and what to wear. Not covered is the problem of getting a table
in the most popular eateries during the peak tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   What can be more depressing than having someone say, ``We can
take you Tuesday night'' when you will be flying home on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   The Napa and Sonoma Book, by Tim Fish and Peg Melnik, both local
authors, has much of the same data as in the Wine Country Guide
sections on those two counties _ and much more. It's a good book
for the casual visitor, and a better book for anyone who plans to
stay around Napa and Sonoma for a while. Even travelers on their
3rd, 4th or 20th trip to the region will find valuable tips.
</P>
<P>
   There are long sections on the history of the region, an
excellent treatise on architecture, and sections on local
microbreweries, sports and spas. The wineries are described in some
detail, often with descriptions of the wines and advice on which
ones to buy.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of history, good shopping tips for most cities
and towns, and solid sections on local arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
   There is helpful advice on such fundamental things as to how to
get to the wine country and when to go. (not on weekends). The
authors recommend having a designated driver but, unless you can
find a teetotaller, it's cruel to ask someone to tour the wineries
with you and not drink anything. The trick is to visit no more than
three wineries in a day and go easy on the wine samples.
</P>
<P>
   Neither book touches on the tackiness that now blights so many
wineries, which is more prevalent in Napa because it is more highly
developed commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wineries probably make almost as much money from
T-shirts, baseball caps and ugly souvenirs as they do from wine.
But then these days, Napa and Sonoma counties welcome some eight
million visitors a year; they can't all be interested in cabernet
sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are still lots of small wineries where you can
talk to the owner, try his wines and pet his dog. But you have to
know where you want to go and you must call in advance. Both of
these guides can help you find those places.
</P>
<P>
   As for negotiating Route 29: if you are driving up from the Bay
Area, visit only wineries on the east side of the road as you come
into the valley and wineries on the west side on your way back.
Turn around up past Calistoga, where the traffic thins out, and
where the valley gets rural again.

WHERE DOGS ARE COMFORTABLE DINING WITH THEIR MASTERS

 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For dog owners and their pets in search of a dinner
out together, New York can be a town without pity. Yet with the
city's dog population on the increase, man, dog and restaurant seem
to be entering a new era of accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   For months, for instance, the canine cognescenti have eagerly
anticipated the opening of the Fido Cafe and Lounge, the first
indoor place in the city constructed to accommodate people and
their pets. In the New York Dog Spa on West 18th Street, the Fido
Cafe is set to begin serving espresso-bar fare and dog snacks later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, those seeking quality time _ as well as drinks or
dinner _ with their pets are settling in restaurants with outdoor
seating. Technically, outdoor cafes where no cooking is taking
place are the sole preserve for dining a la dog in New York City,
said Sandy Mullen, a spokeswoman for the city's department of
health. (Fido can serve dogs because it has discrete dining and
cooking areas.)
</P>
<P>
   Many outdoor spots now cater to basic canine needs and more
places are offering elaborate dog amenities like fanciful water
bowls and biscuits. Some places, like the Time Cafe, will
cheerfully serve dogs a steak. Others, like Cafe Giardinetto in
Murray Hill, have entire dog menus featuring minced turkey breast,
chopped beef and an antipasti platter.
</P>
<P>
   But special menus aside, cooks in even the finest restaurants in
have become accustomed to making dinner for dogs. At Verbena on
Irving Place, Diane Forley says her employees are trained to ``be
as hospitable to pets as they are to their owners.'' Regulars
include a fox terrier, a French bulldog and a Jack Russell, who
dines on hanger steak, rare, served cut into bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters at restaurants all over town have become used to dodging
tails that stick out from under tables and pointing out
dog-appropriate dishes on their menus. (``They like our burgers,''
advised a waiter at the Coconut Grill on the Upper East Side.
``Medium-rare.'')
</P>
<P>
   Busboys fill water bowls as routinely as water glasses. (``No
one should go thirsty on a hot summer night,'' said Mark Oram, the
co-owner of the Chelsea Lobster Company. It has just upgraded its
dog serving ware from aluminum takeout containers to vintage dog
bowls from Fishes Eddy.)
</P>
<P>
   The result? A doggie cafe society rivaling that of Paris, where
city regulations have never excluded Fifi from joining her master
at the table _ inside or out.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is dogs are good business: an enormous number
of people own dogs, and they tend to return to dog-friendly
restaurants. Although the number of licensed dogs throughout the
city has remained stable at 120,000 for the past five years, said
Ms. Mullen of the Department of Health, the agency estimates that
only one in three dogs is actually licensed. And based on the
increased numbers in city dog-runs, some say that the longstanding
estimate of 300,000 licensed and unlicensed dogs has nearly doubled
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot potential customers, four-legged and otherwise.
Dogs remember places where they've been spoiled. More than one dog
has lead its owner to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening on Irving Place, for instance, Karen Kopta,
a public relations consultant, was tugged toward Picnic by Lulu,
her seven-and-a-half pound Yorkshire Terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eat out twice a day,'' Ms. Kopta said. ``Picnic is Lu's
favorite. They have a basket of dog biscuits and a bowl of fresh
ice water by the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dog owners are loathe to leave their pets home alone at
night, particularly if they've been there all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meal time is quality time and I want to spend all the quality
time I have with Sadie,'' said Rob Abner, the publisher of DGNY, a
bimonthly guide to owning a dog in New York City. Most evenings
find Abner appraising menus for Sadie, his beagle, as a parent
would peruse a menu on behalf of a young child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves the negimaki at Sushi Generation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still others deploy their pets as social emblem. ``A dainty dog
like Isabelle is one thing,'' said a woman lunching at the cafe
outside of Le Cirque 2000 with a tiny, be-ribboned teacup poodle
nestled in her lap. Offering the dog a tiny forkful of her poached
chicken, she added, ``Those big uncouth things are another
matter.''

REPORTER ASSIGNED TO COWBOY REUNION IN '36 TO LEAD ITS PARADE 62
YEARS LATER
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Fixes title of John Selman in 8th graf) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ When 84-year-old Harry Holt first saw the Texas
Cowboy Reunion in Stamford, it was 1936 and the Dust Bowl days
still hung over the vastness of West Texas. Holt was a pup reporter
then, running behind the chutes in the sweltering heat, trying
desperately to get a story.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he will be comfortably up front in the 68th reunion,
serving as grand marshal of the parade that kicks off four days of
celebration on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is more than just a rodeo,'' explained Gary Mathis,
manager of the Swenson Ranches and organizer of the event. ``This
is a Texas cowboy reunion, and Harry has been in this part of the
country a long time. It is an honor for us to have him be a part of
this year's event.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt worked for 15 years as a reporter and columnist for the
Abilene Reporter News. He left the paper in 1953 and began a weekly
TV program called ``West Texas This Week'' and a daily ag report on
Abilene radio. They continue today.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the heyday of the reunion, which began in 1931; he
has seen the difficult times as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year before I started covering it was 1935, the year that
Will Rogers was there,'' he said. ``Rogers came to Abilene with his
pilot, Wiley Post. Post once lived just outside Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, Rogers got a taxi and went to Stamford, unannounced,
and sat up in the bleachers in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt remembered that John Selman was foreman of the Swenson
ranches back then and that when Selman recognized Rogers, he called
him down to the arena, gave him a horse and turned him loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogers did his rope tricks and put on a show for the crowd,''
Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Post and Rogers were killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Holt had the painful job of in?+%9g Post's wife of her husband's
death. It was, he said, the hardest thing he ever had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that Will Rogers touch, his presence, that put the
Cowboy Reunion over the top,'' Holt said. ``That, and the fact that
it was a pet project of Amon Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's first publisher, and
Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers made his appearance at
Stamford, 40 miles north of Abilene, Carter began dispatching
reporters to West Texas to cover the Fourth of July weekend event.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Mabel Gouldy, C.L. Richhart and Frank Reeves blanketed
the Cowboy Reunion, Holt sam$ The Abilene and Wichita Falls papers
then boosted their coverage, and the media attention made the event
irresistible to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last governor I remember coming was Preston Smith,'' Holt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Cowboy Reunion has always been a ranch rodeo. Although
the neighboring ranches didn't enter as teams, the cowboys would
travel to Stamford together and camp together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reunion was unique in that way,'' Holt said. ``The
contestants were real working cowboys. They would enter the wild
cow milking contest because they were used to roping cows out in
the pasture. Some of the cowboys today have never seen a wild
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who participated were ranch hands, too, Holt said.
Riders like Ardeth Copeland, Fern Sawyer and Christine Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   The first approved and sanctioned American Quarter Horse
Association show was held at the Cowboy Reunion. ``The King Ranch
was big then. Mr. Bob Kleberg came himself,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also a lot of good cutting horse competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Money was never really the object at Stamford, Holt said. It was
an amateur rodeo. First prize was only $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they gave away saddles and people would spend a lifetime
trying to win one of those saddles,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the reunion dwindled. The crowds and entries
shrank. It was, Holt said, simply a sign of the times. Every small
town now has its own rodeo and the competition for competitors is
tough.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathis said the Texas Cowboy Reunion is holding on. ``The
last four to five years we've really been coming back,'' he said.
``We've brought back some of the old activities like the wild cow
milking and a ranch horse competition. There has been interest in
the bit and spur show, the trade show and the chuck wagon cook-off
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now give six trophy saddles, 13 buckles and last year we
handed out $53,000 in prize money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the tradition, he said. No one wants to lose the tradition.
</P>

Reunion is available at (915) 773-3614 or (915) 773-2411.

SCIENCE AND RELIGION: BRIDGING THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (af)  
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since science began drifting away from religion, centuries
ago, each has dreamed of subsuming the other. Scientists, in their
boldest moments, speak of explaining away all the mysteries by
empirical inquiry, leaving no need for ancient wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And the faithful, fervently believing in spiritual forces
nmeasurable by any meter, find it absurd that God's children would
aspire to heaven solely by building telescopes and computers _
scientific Towers of Babel. They have longed for a reality beyond
the shadowplay of the material realm.
</P>
<P>
   Left between these extremes are many people who are both
scientific and religious, and confused about whether a bridge can
ever cross the divide. Every few decades, this hope for
reconciliation, or ``dialogue,'' experiences a revival.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent may be the biggest, with books, conferences and
television shows trying to find a common ground between two
fundamentally different ways of thinking about the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s scholars tried to merge science with Eastern
religion; the emphasis now is on rejoining science with
monotheistic, usually Christian, faith.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the work is motivated by religious passion. In his
best-selling book, ``Consilience'' (Knopf, 1998), the Harvard
biologist Dr. Edward O. Wilson tries to revive the Enlightenment
dream of a unified system of knowledge that would embrace not only
the sciences but also morality and ethics, removing them from the
uncertainties of religion. Here the effort is not to make science
spiritual but to make religion scientific.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the longing for reconciliation comes from the
religious side. With a $3 million grant from the John Templeton
Foundation, which is fueling much of the metaphysics boom with its
considerable resources, a modest newsletter on science and religion
was reborn this year as a glossy magazine called Science &AMP; Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a growing number of individuals looking toward religion
to explain what science cannot, and asking science to validate
religious teachings,'' the publisher, Kevin Sharpe, said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, PBS will broadcast ``Faith and Reason,'' a
documentary written and narrated by Margaret Wertheim and partly
financed with $190,000 from the Templeton Foundation, featuring
interviews with scientists about God. In the last two years, a
steady stream of books with titles like ``Cybergrace: The Search
for God in the Digital World'' and ``God &AMP; the Big Bang:
Discovering Harmony Between Science &AMP; Spirituality'' has been
published.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conspicuous events was the heavily promoted
conference called ``Science and the Spiritual Quest,'' held this
month in Berkeley, Calif., by the Center for Theology and the
Natural Sciences. The Templeton Foundation gave the center $1.4
million for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   For four days scientists, most of them Christians, Jews or
Moslems, testified about their efforts to resolve personal
conflicts over science and religion. All seemed to share the
conviction that this is a purposeful universe, that there is a
reason to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theology is not some airy-fairy form of metaphysical
speculation,'' said John C. Polkinghorne, a Cambridge University
particle physicist turned Anglican priest whose books include
``Quarks, Chaos &AMP; Christianity'' and the newly published ``Belief
in God in an Age of Science.'' Like science, he said, religion is
rooted in encounters with reality _ though in the latter case
encounters include spiritual revelations whose truths lie in the
unreachable realm of the subjective. The pervading question was
whether this kind of experience could ever be studied
scientifically.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the century people have espoused the view that
science and religion should be kept apart to avoid the inevitable
combustions. But to rational minds it has always been troubling
that two opposing ways could exist to explain the same universe.
</P>
<P>
   Science and religion spring from the human obsession with
finding order in the world. But surely there can be only one true
explanation for reality. Life was either created or it evolved.
Prayer is either communication with God or a psychological salve.
The universe is either pervaded by spiritual forces or ruled by
nothing but physical laws.
</P>
<P>
   One way out of the dilemma has been to embrace a kind of deism:
The Almighty created the universe according to certain
specifications and then left it to run on its own. ``God'' becomes
a metaphor for the laws that science tries to uncover.
</P>
<P>
   Or religion can be explained away scientifically. ``There is a
hereditary selective advantage to membership in a powerful group
united by devout belief and purpose,'' Wilson wrote in
``Consilience.'' He warned against letting this genetically
ingrained drive overpower the intellect. ``If history and science
have taught us anything, it is that passion and desire are not the
same as truth. The human mind evolved to believe in the gods. It
did not evolve to believe in biology.'' It is important not to
confuse the universe as it is with the universe as we wish it would
be.
</P>
<P>
   For many scientists, the point of the scientific enterprise is
to replace religious teachings with verifiable theories, and to
pretend otherwise is self-delusion. ``We're working on building up
a complete picture of the universe, which, if we succeed, will be a
complete understanding of the universe and everything that's in
it,'' Richard Dawkins, a University of Oxford biologist, said in a
preview copy of ``Faith and Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SCIENCE-RELIGION-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: and Reason.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He found it baffling that some of his colleagues struggle to
keep God in the picture, ``I don't understand why they waste their
time going into this other stuff, which never has added anything to
the storehouse of human wisdom, and I don't see that it ever
will.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like the cosmologist Dr. Allan Sandage, have found
that their search for objective truth has led them to questions
that science cannot answer. ``The most amazing thing to me is
existence itself,'' Sandage said at the Berkeley conference. ``Why
is there something instead of nothing?'' He said this impenetrable
mystery drove him to become a believer. ``How is it that inanimate
matter can organize itself to contemplate itself? That's outside of
any science I know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Science, like religion, is ultimately built on a platform of
beliefs and assumptions. No one can prove that the universe is
mathematical or that the same laws that seem to hold in the here
and now can be applied to the distant quasars or to the first
moments of time. These are among the tenets of the faith, marking
the point at which reasoning can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science is not able to question these issues,'' Dr. George
Ellis, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of
Capetown and a Quaker, said at the conference. ``It takes them for
granted as its bedrock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the coincidence of the approaching millennium
that is inspiring hopes for what would be the grandest unified
theory. Faced with science's undeniable success in modeling the
world, people find it harder to accept religious teachings that
cannot be verified.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians were disturbed when radiocarbon dating suggested
that the Shroud of Turin was not Jesus' burial cloth but a medieval
forgery, and they hope that new scientific data, not religious
fiat, will overturn the old research. Even the creationists
realized long ago that they can't sway the opposition simply by
asserting that their beliefs are true because they are written in
the Bible. They proffer scientific proof _ pseudoscientific, those
outside the faith would say _ that life and the universe were
created as described in Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   But science, too, is feeling its limits, leaving a vacuum that
religion is happy to rush into. Neuroscientists can explain the
brain, on a rough level, as networks of communicating cells called
neurons. But it is hard to imagine a satisfying theory of the
conscious experience _ what it is like to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   And no amount of theorizing is apt to converge on a persuasive
explanation of where the mathematical laws are written or what
happened before the Big Bang. Humans can observe and reason, but
ultimately the mind encounters chasms. Then the only choice is to
retreat or take the great leap and choose what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   For all the genuine philosophical longings, the recent drive to
put God back in science would not be nearly so intense without the
millions of Templeton dollars looking for places to land. ``We are
searching for a serious rapprochement between science and
religion,'' Charles Harper, the executive director and vice
president of the Templeton Foundation, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The money and the inspiration come from the investor John Marks
Templeton, founder of the Templeton Growth Fund and other ventures,
who retired in 1992 to work fulltime on his philanthropy. The most
prominent of Sir John's endeavors (he was knighted in 1987) is the
annual Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, guaranteed to
exceed the Nobel Prizes in monetary value. (Templeton thought
Alfred Nobel snubbed spirituality.)
</P>
<P>
   Early winners of the Templeton award, first given in 1973, were
usually religious leaders like Mother Teresa. More recently the
prizes, now more than $1 million, have gone to the political
scientist Michael Novak and the physicist and science writer Paul
Davies.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley is
receiving $12.6 million from Templeton to help develop science and
religion programs at universities. The American Association for the
Advancement of Science received $1.3 million ``to help establish a
science and religion dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the foundation's announcement that it would award
grants of $100,000 to $200,000 for a program in ``forgiveness
studies'' sent behavioral scientists scrambling to write proposals.
Among the work being funded are, ``Forgiveness and Community: A
Game-Theoretic Analysis,'' ``Assessment of Forgiveness:
Psychometric, Interpersonal, and Psychophysiological Correlates''
and ``Does Forgiveness Enhance Brain Activation Associated with
Empathy in Victims of Assault?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who submitted proposals were asked to include a section
about how their research would address the issues clarified in
Templeton's books ``Discovering the Laws of Life'' and ``Worldwide
Laws of Life: 200 Eternal Spiritual Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   A major focus of the foundation is publishing some 20 works by
and about Templeton. The foundation is also encouraging scientific
research on what its literature describes as ``optimism, hope and
personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the conference, no amount of money is likely to
succeed in blending science and religion into a common pursuit. A
kind of Sunday school politeness pervaded the meeting, with none of
the impassioned confrontations expected from such an emotionally
charged subject.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SCIENCE-RELIGION-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: charged subject. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the speakers have been preaching to the choir,''
Sandage complained. ``There are no atheists on the program, only
strict believers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the speakers avoided grappling with religion directly,
content to ponder mysteries that have disturbed scientists for
decades. The Stanford University cosmologist, Andrei Linde,
speculated on the tantalizing possibility that consciousness, the
very hallmark of humanity, could be an intrinsic part of the
universe _ as fundamental to the warp and woof of creation as space
and time. After all, he said, our subjective experience is the only
thing each of us is really sure of. All else is speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but with
perceptions,'' Linde argued. ``I know for sure that my pain exists,
my `green' exists, and my `sweet' exists. I do not need any proof
of their existence, because these events are a part of me;
everything else is a theory.'' It is to explain the source of these
perceptions that we posit the existence of an outside reality,
forgetting that this is just a supposition.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a real world is another of the tenets of the
scientific faith. It is impossible to proceed without it. But many
scientists would find the view that consciousness is the root of
everything to be hopelessly anthropomorphic and even solipsistic.
</P>
<P>
   The conference might also have booked prominent scientists, like
Stephen Jay Gould, who argue that consciousness, as powerful as it
necessarily seems to its holders, may be just an accident of
evolution. Behind consciousness, one can choose to find God. Or
not. Without a decisive experiment, it is a matter of personal
belief not of science.
</P>
<P>
   The astrophysicist Dr. John Barrow of the University of Sussex
spoke of another longstanding mystery: the cosmological
coincidences that make life possible. If certain physical constants
had slightly different values, stars would not have formed to cook
up the atoms that made the biological molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Since early in the century some truth seekers have taken this
sort of argument as a reason to believe that the universe was
created with people in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But one is also free to choose the opposite belief: that the
coincidences simply show that life is indeed an incredible fluke.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to know what to make of some of the presentations.
Dr. Mitchell Marcus, chairman of the computer science department at
the University of Pennsylvania, speculated that the craft of
artificial intelligence _ designing thinking computers _ is a
modern realization of the school of Jewish mysticism based on the
Kabala.
</P>
<P>
   According to this ancient teaching, it is not quarks and leptons
but the first 10 numbers and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet
that are the true fundamental particles: the elements of the divine
utterance that gave rise to creation. ``Computer scientists,'' he
declared, ``are the Kabba lists of today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient rabbis are said to have used magical incantations to
create beings called golems. The programmers create their simulated
creatures with incantations of computer code.
</P>
<P>
   The audience politely applauded after each presentation. But
there was little sense of intellectual excitement, that people were
coming to grips with the disturbing issue of whether there really
is a God.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presentations consisted more simply of heartfelt
testimonials about the difficulties of constantly being pulled by
two powerfully conflicting attractions, the material and the
spiritual, the known and the unknowable. And some of the speakers
seemed to believe that, for all the efforts to bring them together,
science and religion must inevitably go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do science differently if I weren't a Quaker?'' asked
Dr. Jocelyn Bell Burnell, chairwoman of the physics department of
the Open University in England. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandage, the cosmologist, matter of factly put it like this: ``I
don't go to a biology book to learn how to live. I don't go to the
Bible to learn about science.''

   As science continues to draw its picture of the physical world,
each question it answers will inevitably raise more. So there will
always be mysteries, the voids in human knowledge where religious
awe can grow.

 By CORINNE LaBALME 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The World Cup of soccer, being held in France until July 12, is
the only sports event that can dwarf the Super Bowl and challenge
the Olympics for global TV ratings. And in peak tourist season, an
estimated 300,000 to 350,000 soccer fans will swell the ranks in
Paris.
 &HT;    While the games are spread among 10 French cities (including
Bordeaux, Lens, Lyons, St.-Etienne, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nantes
and Toulouse), the hub will be Paris and St.-Denis, six miles
north, where the 80,000-seat Stade de France was built for this
event.
 &HT;    The French are determined to leave their imprint on the 1998
version of the quadrennial tournament _ Yves Saint-Laurent has
designed uniforms for the officials (the final on July 12 will kick
off with a Saint-Laurent fashion show).
 &HT;    And although only 2.5 million people are lucky enough to hold
tickets for any of the 64 matches (sold out since mid-April), the
mayor of Paris and French soccer officials are determined that no
visitor to the city be left out of the action.
 &HT;    Six giant screens _ at the Place du Trocadero, the Hotel de
Ville, the Charlety Stadium, the Place Stalingrad, the Vincennes
Hippodrome and the Porte de Clignancourt _ show the games live.
 &HT;    The games are being played at a variety of other, nonofficial
places _ the Lido cabaret, for example, on the Champs-Elysees, is
opening its doors before dark to present special soccer lunches
with live screenings and a menu created by Paul Bocuse ($115, at
5.7 francs to the dollar).
 &HT;    However, behind the banner-waving crowds and the beer parties,
Paris will continue to lead a very active nonsporting life.
 &HT;    Look at it this way: With soccer fever displacing Mona Lisa
watchers, this summer may be an ideal time to avoid those endless
lines at the Louvre.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    ``The Glory of Alexandria,'' the city's blockbuster museum show,
includes a colossal 23-ton Ptolemaic statue recently discovered in
Egypt by underwater archaeologists plus a glittering array of
mosaics, illustrated texts and jewelry. Through July 26 at the
Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10
a.m. to 5:40 p.m., Thursday to 8 p.m.; (33-1) 42.65.12.73; $7.90.
 &HT;    Rudolf Nureyev's 1984 choreography for ``Romeo and Juliet'' is
reprised through July 15 at the Opera Bastille, 120 Rue de Lyon.
Tickets to each event: $5.25 to $70. Reservations for both at
(33-8) 36.69.78.68.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Eugene
Delacroix, and museums throughout France will honor the foremost
painter of the Romantic School.
 &HT;    In Paris, the Grand Palais is host to ``Delacroix, The Last
Years (1850-1863)'' through July 20; Avenue du General Eisenhower,
Clemenceau entrance. Open daily except Tuesday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Wednesday until 10 p.m. Reserved tickets ($7.50 to $9.75) necessary
before 12:30 p.m.; admission $8.75 ($6.15 Monday) from 1 p.m.
Information, (33-1) 44.13.17.30; reservations, (33-1) 44.13.17.24.
 &HT;    The painter's secluded Left Bank studio, on a tiny square at 6
Rue de Furstenburg, is now the Musee Delacroix, where an exhibition
spotlighting his collaboration with the artist and engraver
Frederic Villot runs through July 31. Open daily except Tuesday
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $5.25 ($4 on Sunday; under 18 free). Call
(33-1) 44.41.86.50.
 &HT;    At the nearby St.-Sulpice Church, Delacroix painted a side
chapel with action-packed murals featuring St. Michael slaying the
dragon and Jacob battling with the Angel. And major Delacroix shows
are running in the Musee des Beaux Arts in Rouen (through July 15),
Musee des Beaux Arts in Tours (though July 31), Musee Leon Bonnat
in Bayonne (through Sept. 28) and the Musee Conde in Chantilly
(through July 20).
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Mondiresa, the organization that reserved more than 360,000
hotel nights throughout France for World Cup visitors, has a Web
site, mondiresa.com, that tracks cancellations and is available to
help find last-minute accommodations; (33-1) 53.92.60.00.
 &HT;    Some hotel rooms are still available in Paris; Rail Europe, for
example, has set up a special number for reservations: (888)
850-8918. Note that some hotels are raising their rates during the
World Cup.
 &HT;    The style is Directoire, the design theme is literary Paris at
the Hotel Libertel Quartier Latin, 9 Rue des Ecoles, fifth
arrondissement, (33-1) 44.27.06.45 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
43.25.36.70, a few blocks from the Sorbonne.
 &HT;    All 29 air-conditioned rooms at the year-old hotel are decorated
with portraits (Andre Gide, Colette and Jacques Prevert among
others).
 &HT;    The walls of the breakfast room sport discreetly stenciled
quotations from Baudelaire, while the inviting lobby offers
comfortable armchairs, a tea service and browsable bilingual
bookshelves. Doubles: $170.
 &HT;    Breakfast at the Etoile Pereire, 146 Boulevard Pereire, in the
17th, (33-1) 42.67.60.00, fax (33-1) 42.67.02.90, features 31
exotic jams and jellies like banana, chestnut, peach-hazelnut and
lemon. That's one for each of the 21 plain but reasonably priced
rooms and five suites overlooking a quiet courtyard.
 &HT;    The residential neighborhood in western Paris offers an
attractive garden and playground across the street, plus the shaded
jogging paths of the nearby Monceau and Bois de Boulogne parks.
Doubles: $140.
 &HT;    Budget: Artists and academics are drawn by the cheerfully
Bohemian aura at the 59-room Hotel Bellevue et du Chariot d'Or, 39
Rue de Turbigo, in the third, (33-1) 48.87.45.60, fax (33-1)
48.87.95.04. The stained-glass windows in the bar-breakfast room
exude the bygone glamour that the no-frills rooms lack.
 &HT;    The garment-district location north of the Pompidou Center is
nondescript but central; the spacious bedrooms sleeping four ($77)
are one of the city's best bargains. Doubles: $60.
 &HT;    Luxury: The exclusive residential district between Trocadero and
Place Victor Hugo is home to Le Parc, 55 Avenue Raymond Poincare,
in the 16th, (33-1) 44.05.66.66 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
44.05.66.00.
 &HT;    The British designers Nina Campbell and Viscount Linley created
a cozy country-house ambiance for the 116 air-conditioned rooms,
which are in four turreted turn-of-the-century buildings grouped
around a tree-shaded garden. Alain Ducasse, the Michelin
star-spangled chef, runs one of the hotel's two glamourous
restaurants. Doubles: $420 to $485.
 &HT;    The Marriott Champs-Elysees, 70 Avenue des Champs-Elysees, in
the eighth, (33-1) 53.93.55.00 or (800) 228-9290, fax (33-1)
53.93.55.01, brings American style (a floor-to-ceiling glass-topped
atrium) and American amenities (king-sized beds, computer hook-ups,
irons, no-smoking floors) to its 192 rooms. Some rooms have windows
only onto the atrium; the best ones overlook the Champs-Elysees.
 &HT;    The quiet outdoor dining terrace, shielded from automobile and
pedestrian traffic, is a summertime bonus. Doubles: $490 to $632.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Maceo, 15 Rue des Petits Champs, (33-1) 42.97.53.85, on the site
of the historic Mercure Galant near the Palais Royal, is the latest
spinoff of the ever-trendy Willi's Wine Bar. The ornate Napoleon
III walls have been daubed with Ralph Lauren Red. The menu features
vegetarian entrees as well as delicate seafood starters like
curried shrimp with bean sprouts. Dinner for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Adjoining the elegant Passage Vivienne shopping arcade, Le Grand
Colbert, 2 Rue Vivienne, (33-1) 42.86.87.88, is a lively brasserie
where, amid gilded 19th-century mirrors, diners enjoy green-bean
salad laced with foie gras, preserved duck and excellent sole
meuniere. Dinner for two with wine: $80.
 &HT;    Anastasia would feel right at home at Nikita, 6 Rue Faustin
Helie, (33-1) 45.04.04.33, especially when the Cossack musicians
play their violins and accordions. Tsarist treats at this romantic
White Russian hangout include creamed herring spiked with dill,
smoked salmon with blini, shashlik (marinated lamb kebabs) and
tangy Russian cheesecake. Dinner for two with wine and a Gypsy
serenade costs $115.
 &HT;    At Ma Bourgogne, 19 Place des Vosges, (33-1) 42.78.44.64, the
cuisine is as classic as the 17th-century stone arches that shade
its sidewalk terrace, with views of the fountains on the lovely
Place. Specialties include Burgundy-style snails with garlic and
steak tartare with some of Paris's most irresistible frites. Dinner
for two with wine: $95.
 &HT;    Le Rubis, 10 Rue du Marche St.-Honore, (33-1) 42.61.03.34, a
wine bar a few blocks from the Ritz, encourages customers to carry
their sandwiches and salads out to the oilcloth-topped wine barrels
on the sidewalk.A ham-and-cheese omelet runs $6.15 and a glass of
Beaujolais is $1.60. The petit sale (salt pork with lentils) is the
$8.75 plat du jour on Wednesday and worth noting on the calendar.
 &HT;    As far from the soccer frenzy as one can get within the city
limits is Le Pre Catelan on the Route de Suresnes in the Bois de
Boulogne, (33-1) 44.14.41.14. Not for nothing is it one of Paris's
most expensive one-star restaurants.
 &HT;    Beneath the stars in a glorious walled garden, Frederic Anton
presents dramatic main courses like boned sea bream baked in a
shell of rock salt and herbs (cracked open at the table to reveal
the flaky fish), with a fragrant Provencal stuffing of tomato,
basil and olives. Dinner for two with wine: $210.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    We were in Copenhagen without a car and wanted to go to Roskilde
to visit the Viking Museum, where five formerly sunken ships have
been restored. While searching for a mode of transportation, we
discovered the Copenhagen Card _ a way of paying a single price for
admission to a variety of museums and attractions and
transportation.
 &HT;    We used the card to take the train for a 30-minute ride to
Roskilde. Then we continued to use it during our stay for admission
to the city's museums, castles and other sites.
 &HT;    It's a great value _ about $20 for one day, $46 for three days _
and is available at train stations, tourist offices and hotels.
 &HT;    For additional information about the Copenhagen Card or similar
cards for other Danish cities, call the Danish Tourist Board at
(212) 885-9700, or visit www.woco.dk on the Web.
 &HT;    Now some U.S. cities are following Europe's lead by instating
their own passes and enhancing the idea with additional discounts
for mature travelers.
 &HT;    For example, CityPass cards are now available in Boston, New
York, San Francisco and Seattle, and they include special senior
prices.
 &HT;    CityPass features tickets to six popular attractions in each
city. And what a bargain! CityPass users save about 50 percent on
the combined total cost of regular admissions.
 &HT;    For example, in New York, the CityPass can be used at the
American Museum of Natural History, the Empire State Building, the
Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Museum of Modern Art and the Top of the World Trade Center.
CityPass costs seniors $18 compared to the regular adult price of
$26.75.
 &HT;    CityPass attractions in San Francisco include the Blue &AMP; Gold
Bay Cruise, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the M.H. de
Young Museum, the California Academy of Sciences and Steinhard
Aquarium, the Exploratorium, the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor and zoo. Here, the CityPass price for seniors is $19.85.
 &HT;    In Boston, the John F. Kennedy Library/Museum, the New England
Aquarium, the John Hancock Observatory, the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Science
are included. The price for seniors: $20.50.
 &HT;    CityPasses can be bought at any participating attraction,
visitor center and many hotels.
 &HT;    Other city cards with discounts for mature travelers include:
 &HT;     _ CITY CONNECTION-DENVER.  This pass, which costs $7 for
seniors ages 65 and older ($10 for other adults), opens the doors

Western Art, the U.S. Mint, the Butterfly Pavilion and the Botanic
Gardens. It can be purchased at Denver Visitors Centers and RTD
stations.
 &HT;     _ SWISS MUSEUM PASSPORT.  This passport costs seniors about $25

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Planning to get away this summer? Then act fast. This summer is
promising to be the biggest travel season ever, according to a poll
released by ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) and Fodor's
Travel Publications on May 22.
 &HT;    The ASTA/Fodor's Annual Summer Hot Spots Survey is the result of
a poll of some of ASTA's 27,000 travel agents. They were asked to
name the top five domestic city destinations they have been booking
for this summer. In descending order: Orlando, Las Vegas, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
 &HT;    ``Since this is a summer survey, it's really a byword for family
travel,'' James Ashurt, manager of communications for ASTA,
explains.
 &HT;    Orlando was far and away No. 1 because of Disney's continued and
unsurpassed reign as the most popular vacation destination in
America.
 &HT;    There's also the surge of interest in Disney's new ``Animal
Kingdom'' attraction, according to ASTA.
 &HT;    But surprisingly, value also plays a role when American
travelers choose Orlando as a vacation spot. In a separate survey
in which ASTA travel agents were asked about the destinations they
book for the value-conscious consumer, Orlando ranked No. 2 after
Cancun. The value is there because of the wide variety of
affordable air/hotel packages to the area and the selection of room
prices for every pocket.
 &HT;    Las Vegas ranked second. But while gaming enthusiasts will
always come to the Nevada city, the high ranking doesn't
necessarily reflect a huge influx of gamblers.
 &HT;    Las Vegas has become firmly established as a major family
destination, with a variety of packages for parents traveling with
their children. It's so affordable that it ranked third, after
Orlando, in ASTA's poll of destinations for value-conscious
travelers.
 &HT;    The next three cities were ranked closely together. San
Francisco ranked third, attracting visitors because of its scenic
beauty and laid-back lifestyle.
 &HT;    Los Angeles was fourth and Hollywood played a major role in its
ranking. The chance to visit studio lots and step into the
epicenter of the entertainment business is a major draw. So are the
area's fabled beaches.
 &HT;    New York, revitalized, booming and welcoming, was ranked fifth
in popularity for summer travelers. That's due to a reinvigorated
Broadway, with record-breaking productions of such shows as ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    The restaurant scene, from trendy places such as Balthazar to
the latest East Village sushi bar, has never been hotter. And the
civic pride of New Yorkers has never been greater or more
contagious.
 &HT;    The other cities in the ranking, in descending order, were
Seattle, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in a tie for seventh,
followed by Boston and Phoenix.
 &HT;    In terms of international travel, ASTA agents ranked the
following destinations. London was first, followed by Paris, Rome,
Cancun, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Dublin, Vancouver and Athens.
 &HT;    What the poll really means is that there has already been
significant demand for these destinations. With the American
economy booming, domestic hotel rooms will be very hard to find
this summer, especially in New York and San Francisco. Planning
ahead and booking as soon as possible are key to getting a
reasonably good deal on a vacation.
 &HT;    For those who like to do it themselves, the Web is a viable
option. And hotel brokers, such as Quikbook (381 Park Avenue South,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com), Express
Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123;
www.express-res.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut
Hill Lane, Suite 203, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com) can often provide 20 percent or more off the
cost of a domestic hotel room.
 &HT;    But ASTA, naturally enough, advocates using a travel agent _
someone who has essential travel information at their fingertips,
someone who knows which hotels are likely to have space and a
reasonable room rate. And agents can obtain some of the best prices
around for airfare and car rentals.
 &HT;    ``The Web is an excellent resource and there's lot of
information,'' Ashurst says. ``But that's part of the problem. Not
everyone is technically savvy enough to use it properly. You're not
getting professional advice or experience when you do. There's no
personal insight. And people are busy, they don't have the time to
do what it takes to get the information. The time factor doesn't
get included in the equation about whether the Web is better than a
travel agent.''
 &HT;    Ashurst points out, however, that an increasing number of travel
agents are using the Web themselves, both for communication
purposes and to research on behalf of their clients. And this
research will cost you. The days when an agent gave information
away for free are fast disappearing.
 &HT;    ``You pay a travel agent as you would pay any other
professional,'' Ashurst explains.
 &HT;    It's estimated that about 70 percent of ASTA's members are
either charging fees or are planning to charge fees. Those fees
vary widely, but they might run a consumer between $5 and $15 per

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Planning to get away this summer? Then act fast. This summer is
promising to be the biggest travel season ever, according to a poll
released by ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) and Fodor's
Travel Publications on May 22.
 &HT;    The ASTA/Fodor's Annual Summer Hot Spots Survey is the result of
a poll of some of ASTA's 27,000 travel agents. They were asked to
name the top five domestic city destinations they have been booking
for this summer. In descending order: Orlando, Las Vegas, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
 &HT;    ``Since this is a summer survey, it's really a byword for family
travel,'' James Ashurt, manager of communications for ASTA,
explains.
 &HT;    Orlando was far and away No. 1 because of Disney's continued and
unsurpassed reign as the most popular vacation destination in
America.
 &HT;    There's also the surge of interest in Disney's new ``Animal
Kingdom'' attraction, according to ASTA.
 &HT;    But surprisingly, value also plays a role when American
travelers choose Orlando as a vacation spot. In a separate survey
in which ASTA travel agents were asked about the destinations they
book for the value-conscious consumer, Orlando ranked No. 2 after
Cancun. The value is there because of the wide variety of
affordable air/hotel packages to the area and the selection of room
prices for every pocket.
 &HT;    Las Vegas ranked second. But while gaming enthusiasts will
always come to the Nevada city, the high ranking doesn't
necessarily reflect a huge influx of gamblers.
 &HT;    Las Vegas has become firmly established as a major family
destination, with a variety of packages for parents traveling with
their children. It's so affordable that it ranked third, after
Orlando, in ASTA's poll of destinations for value-conscious
travelers.
 &HT;    The next three cities were ranked closely together. San
Francisco ranked third, attracting visitors because of its scenic
beauty and laid-back lifestyle.
 &HT;    Los Angeles was fourth and Hollywood played a major role in its
ranking. The chance to visit studio lots and step into the
epicenter of the entertainment business is a major draw. So are the
area's fabled beaches.
 &HT;    New York, revitalized, booming and welcoming, was ranked fifth
in popularity for summer travelers. That's due to a reinvigorated
Broadway, with record-breaking productions of such shows as ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    The restaurant scene, from trendy places such as Balthazar to
the latest East Village sushi bar, has never been hotter. And the
civic pride of New Yorkers has never been greater or more
contagious.
 &HT;    The other cities in the ranking, in descending order, were
Seattle, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in a tie for seventh,
followed by Boston and Phoenix.
 &HT;    In terms of international travel, ASTA agents ranked the
following destinations. London was first, followed by Paris, Rome,
Cancun, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Dublin, Vancouver and Athens.
 &HT;    What the poll really means is that there has already been
significant demand for these destinations. With the American
economy booming, domestic hotel rooms will be very hard to find
this summer, especially in New York and San Francisco. Planning
ahead and booking as soon as possible are key to getting a
reasonably good deal on a vacation.
 &HT;    For those who like to do it themselves, the Web is a viable
option. And hotel brokers, such as Quikbook (381 Park Avenue South,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com), Express
Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123;
www.express-res.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut
Hill Lane, Suite 203, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com) can often provide 20 percent or more off the
cost of a domestic hotel room.
 &HT;    But ASTA, naturally enough, advocates using a travel agent _
someone who has essential travel information at their fingertips,
someone who knows which hotels are likely to have space and a
reasonable room rate. And agents can obtain some of the best prices
around for airfare and car rentals.
 &HT;    ``The Web is an excellent resource and there's lot of
information,'' Ashurst says. ``But that's part of the problem. Not
everyone is technically savvy enough to use it properly. You're not
getting professional advice or experience when you do. There's no
personal insight. And people are busy, they don't have the time to
do what it takes to get the information. The time factor doesn't
get included in the equation about whether the Web is better than a
travel agent.''
 &HT;    Ashurst points out, however, that an increasing number of travel
agents are using the Web themselves, both for communication
purposes and to research on behalf of their clients. And this
research will cost you. The days when an agent gave information
away for free are fast disappearing.
 &HT;    ``You pay a travel agent as you would pay any other
professional,'' Ashurst explains.
 &HT;    It's estimated that about 70 percent of ASTA's members are
either charging fees or are planning to charge fees. Those fees
vary widely, but they might run a consumer between $5 and $15 per
airline ticket. But research fees might be waived or deducted from
the cost of a vacation.
 &HT;    To find the nearest ASTA travel agent, contact ASTA at 1101 King
St., Alexandria, VA 22314; 800-965-ASTA.

   TAKE-BOS  
 HONG KONG: ... Chinese businesses.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is so cynical. Peter Churchhouse, managing director
of Morgan Stanley's Hong Kong office, gives China high marks for
its conduct. He argues that Beijing has not interfered in Hong Kong
and has been supportive of its right to run its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries
and a member of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's Cabinet, says
Beijing never has tried to influence any meeting he attended. ``If
anything, we have more protests and more freedoms today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Beijing has scored fairly high marks across the political
spectrum for leaving Hong Kong alone, the local government has been
given failing grades.
</P>
<P>
   David Zweig, a politics professor at Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology, says it is difficult to rate Hong Kong
leaders when they have had to cope with a spate of disasters _ from
the economic crash to a mysterious bird flu, from poisoned ice
cream to poisoned fish, from a mad cow scare to an arsenic spill on
the street. ``It's like trying to give a report card to a student
when the school walls have collapsed, his computer is
malfunctioning, and his pencils are breaking,'' Zweig said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to keep track of all the demonstrations in front of
Government House these days, and citizens are demanding that the
Hong Kong government be accountable even for things it cannot
control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors whose brokers went bankrupt want compensation.
Homebuyers who put their life savings in down payments now cannot
get mortgages because of the collapsed real estate market. Chicken
vendors and fishermen want reimbursement for their financial losses
from the bird flu and the red tide disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The government and big business ``don't care about us _ the
common people, the poor _ and they are unable to come up with any
solution to ease the crisis,'' complained C. Cheung, a 45-year-old
hawker protesting his lost down payment one recent afternoon.
``They are just corrupt and impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how did a civil service so highly esteemed before the
transfer sink so low?
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Lo, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong,
suggests that locals and colonial officials ``exaggerated the
competence of the civil service'' to reassure people that
everything would be the same after the handover. ``But now they
cannot turn to expatriate officers for crisis decision-making, and
they themselves seem to be quite indecisive,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped that the government has been caught napping,
flip-flopping, or simply clueless during numerous crises this year.
</P>
<P>
   The health secretary was on vacation at the height of the bird
flu. When the territory's chickens were slaughtered, at least
hundreds escaped the ax or were disposed of unhygienically. The
financial secretary gave the economy an A+ when it was the weakest
it has been in years. He declared that Hong Kong would enjoy 3.5
percent growth, and then revealed the next week it would contract 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month (June), after vowing to proceed with government land
sales despite pressure to restrict them, officials canceled the
auction a day before it was to happen.
</P>
<P>
   After the handover ``the civil service was supposed to take
front and center and political parties were supposed to fade away.
But just the opposite has happened,'' said Michael DeGolyer,
director of the transition project. ``The civil service went to its
offices and fell asleep ... while politicians who campaigned on
populist issues won big in the May elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling has been the seven-party coalition of
democratic and pro-Beijing parties formed to pressure the Hong Kong
government to improve its performance with the economy. The
coalition controls 48 of 60 legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that if you just shut up and make money, there's
no need for democracy,'' DeGolyer said. But the plummeting economy
brought together former legislative rivals and helped push voter
turnout an astonishing 50 percent higher than it was for the last
elections under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a retooled electoral system that favors small parties
and business groups, the territory's popular Democratic Party
managed to secure the same percentage of votes it did in 1995. Yet
even after winning two-thirds of the votes cast for directly
elected posts, pro-democracy candidates were rewarded with only
one-third of the seats under the redesigned system.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Beijing Liberal Party won nine seats with just 1,300
votes for seats held by special interest groups. The Democrats,
meanwhile, elected nine people with 633,000 direct, geographic
votes.
</P>
<P>
   And so what do those who warned of the worst say now? A year
ago, Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most famous democrat, said he didn't
think he would be jailed after the handover, but he couldn't be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today my answer is exactly the same,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I can say things to you and not be put in jail because
of the law. But the law can be changed. ... The system works when
the pendulum swings to the left in China, and they still allow us
freedoms when they tighten up on the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many people like Mary Chan, 55, a retired office
clerk, who believe that ``China is more free now'' and who hope
that Hong Kong will over time influence mainland China, rather than
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is time. ``We still have 588 months to go for the
50-year pledge'' by China, said Liu, the editor. ``Please let's
keep a long horizon.''

IN N.Y. DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, INCUMBENT IS THE COMMON FOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ One credits her mother. One points to
Ralph Nader. And the third praises two girls, his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The three seasoned Democrats _ former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro,
New York City Public Advocate Mark Green and Rep. Charles Schumer _
may have distinguished themselves the most when answering the
question: ``Who has been the greatest influence on your life?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first public debate among the three, the Democrats had a
difficult time Monday separating themselves from one another.
Except for one skirmish between Green and Ferraro over accepting
tobacco money, the three candidates agreed on a key point: that
Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato must go so that his replacement can
address restoring money for education and improving job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a former Nader associate, added the reform of health
maintenance organizations, and his competitors didn't put him down
for it.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of sniping at one another, the debaters, hitting on
topics put to them before the New York State Publishers'
Association, tended to direct responses away from themselves,
largely at the urging of Schumer, to attack the Republican
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   They described D'Amato as untrustworthy and an election-year
liberal, themes that have become common among the primary
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Green strayed from that script, criticizing Ferraro for taking a
$20,000 speaking fee from a leading cigarette maker, the Philip
Morris Cos., last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she would rethink that honorarium from Philip Morris
and give it back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro shot back that Green has taken $250 from a Philip Morris
executive _ in 1993 _ and $3,000 from a cigar company executive and
his wife last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of giving that money back,'' Ferraro said.
``I paid taxes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is Al D'Amato's record on tobacco. He receives huge
amounts and he's been one of the biggest friends'' of the industry,
Schumer said. Except for D'Amato's election-year tough stand on
anti-tobacco issues, Schumer said, the senator has voted with the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington,
D'Amato received $17,500 from tobacco interests in 1997 and 1998,
fourth most among senators.
</P>
<P>
   On a related measure, Green's campaign said it would not return
money from Howard Lazar, one of three construction company
executives convicted in a bid-rigging and kickback scheme in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the $1,500 was tied to his New York City advocate
campaign, and that campaign is closed. He said such sums couldn't
influence him even if he had recognized Lazar's name among the
25,000 who have contributed to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's office said the congressman would return $1,500 sent
to him in 1995 and 1997 from Lazar, of Lehr Construction Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for D'Amato, who received $2,200 from Lazar and $500
from his wife, said the senator was writing a check for $2,700 to
the Long Island Breast Cancer Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   As for the D'Amato-bashing at the debate, the spokesman, Harvey
Valentine, declined to speak specifically about tobacco votes.
``It's unfortunate they would rather throw mud than talk about
their own records,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats did discuss their records in an attempt to
look better than the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who called his daughters, ages 13 and 9, the biggest
influences on his life, said his career as the congressman who
wrote the Brady anti-gun legislation and pushed for a bill that put
more police officers on the streets proves he's the top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Green, crediting Nader for teaching the fundamentals of his
two-decade-plus career as a consumer advocate, said he could fill
pot holes and create policy.
</P>
<P>
   And Ferraro, focusing on her roles as teacher, prosecutor,
mother and congresswoman, said her mother instilled in her the
importance of education.

CROATIA DEFEATS ROMANIA 1-0, ON SECOND PENALTY KICK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Croatia does not occupy much space on the map
of Europe. It is a scenic sliver of land on the Dalmatian coast
with the capital Zagreb for a hub. But Croatia is big enough to
provide a homeland to one of the planet's better soccer teams, and
Tuesday that team advanced to the quarterfinals in its first World
Cup with a 1-0 victory over Romania that was more emotional than
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   The lone goal of the afternoon came on a penalty kick from Davor
Suker in the second minute of injury time in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has a country as small as Croatia come up with a result
like we did today,'' said Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic, whose
team will face Germany in the quarterfinals on Saturday in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Sport and marketing have become inextricably intertwined in this
bottom- line era, but nations have been using sport as a marketing
tool for centuries, and Croatia, a country of approximately 4.7
million that split from Yugoslavia seven years ago, has no shortage
of athletic ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   It won the gold medal in team handball at the 1996 Summer
Olympics; its basketball players Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja have
played in the NBA. Tennis player Iva Majoli won the French Open,
and Goran Ivanisevic already would have won Wimbledon if his powers
of concentration had even approached the power of his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years after reaching the quarterfinals of the European
championships, it is the soccer team's turn to take another star
turn, and Blazevic, the bespectacled, chain-smoking friend of
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, clearly was delighted to have
excellent news to report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just sport; there are political repercussions, too,''
he said. ''Before this match, maybe five percent of the people knew
Croatia. Now, maybe 15 percent know. So of course that is important
to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a World Cup of many matches and few surprises: the
traditional soccer powers have had their way with the parvenues.
Croatia does not quite qualify as an underdog _ not with players
like Suker, captain Zvonimir Boban and Robert Jarni _ but it is one
of two quarterfinalists, along with Denmark, who have had at least
a chuckle at the expense of the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Before this event began, the Yugoslavs were considered the
bigger threat from the Balkans, and Croatia's chances were hurt
further by a knee injury to star striker Alen Boksic. But Croatia
still has Suker, its other world-class striker who is fresh and in
fine fettle after spending much of last season on the bench at Real
Madrid. When Suker got his chance to take a penalty kick, he did
not hit the crossbar as his former Yugoslav teammate Predrag
Mijatovic did in Yugoslavia's 2-1 loss to the Netherlands on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had expected to go on holiday to the Adriatic coast, but now
I want to stay in France as long as possible,'' the 30-year-old
Suker said.
</P>
<P>
   Suker helped earn the penalty kick by letting a pass slip
through his legs to teammate Aljosa Asanovic, who was being marked
in the penalty area by Romanian midfielder Gabriel Popescu. There
was contact. Asanovic tumbled to the grass, and referee Javier
Alberto Castrilli of Argentina did not hesitate. Suker calmly put
the ball in the lower right corner of the goal. But his celebration
was cut short because Boban had run into the box too early. The
kick had to be retaken. The 30-year-old Suker simply recreated his
goal, putting the ball past goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea in the same
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Stelea would not be beaten again, and if not for his fine play,
he and his oddly muted teammates would have likely lost by more
than one goal. The Romanians and their creative captain Gheorge
Hagi, better known as ``the Maradona of the Carpathians,'' were
surprise quarterfinalists in the last World Cup, and with a mix of
veterans like Hagi and newcomers like striker Adrian Ilie, the team
had feuded frequently but not lost an official match in nearly two
years. But Tuesday, Romania often looked unsettled, even
unenthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   After dying their hair yellow after defeating England in their
second group match, they stopped shining on the field, drawing with
Tunisia and losing to Croatia. When the Hagi era ended, Hagi was no
longer on the field, having been replaced in the 57th minute with
what he explained was a sore groin. While it is unclear whether
Hagi, now 32, has really played his last for Romania, Iordanescu,
the army general with the tactical mind, already has signed a
contract to coach Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia now heads for Lyon and a rematch with the German team
that defeated them at the last European championship. ``We will do
all we can to get our revenge,'' Blazevic said. ``The Germans are
our friends, and as everyone knows, there is no greater pleasure in
sport than to beat your friends.''

 &HT;    Planning to get away this summer? Then act fast. This summer is
promising to be the biggest travel season ever, according to a poll
released by ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) and Fodor's
Travel Publications on May 22.
 &HT;    The ASTA/Fodor's Annual Summer Hot Spots Survey is the result of
a poll of some of ASTA's 27,000 travel agents. They were asked to
name the top five domestic city destinations they have been booking
for this summer. In descending order: Orlando, Las Vegas, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
 &HT;    ``Since this is a summer survey, it's really a byword for family
travel,'' James Ashurt, manager of communications for ASTA,
explains.
 &HT;    Orlando was far and away No. 1 because of Disney's continued and
unsurpassed reign as the most popular vacation destination in
America.
 &HT;    There's also the surge of interest in Disney's new ``Animal
Kingdom'' attraction, according to ASTA.
 &HT;    But surprisingly, value also plays a role when American
travelers choose Orlando as a vacation spot. In a separate survey
in which ASTA travel agents were asked about the destinations they
book for the value-conscious consumer, Orlando ranked No. 2 after
Cancun. The value is there because of the wide variety of
affordable air/hotel packages to the area and the selection of room
prices for every pocket.
 &HT;    Las Vegas ranked second. But while gaming enthusiasts will
always come to the Nevada city, the high ranking doesn't
necessarily reflect a huge influx of gamblers.
 &HT;    Las Vegas has become firmly established as a major family
destination, with a variety of packages for parents traveling with
their children. It's so affordable that it ranked third, after
Orlando, in ASTA's poll of destinations for value-conscious
travelers.
 &HT;    The next three cities were ranked closely together. San
Francisco ranked third, attracting visitors because of its scenic
beauty and laid-back lifestyle.
 &HT;    Los Angeles was fourth and Hollywood played a major role in its
ranking. The chance to visit studio lots and step into the
epicenter of the entertainment business is a major draw. So are the
area's fabled beaches.
 &HT;    New York, revitalized, booming and welcoming, was ranked fifth
in popularity for summer travelers. That's due to a reinvigorated
Broadway, with record-breaking productions of such shows as ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    The restaurant scene, from trendy places such as Balthazar to
the latest East Village sushi bar, has never been hotter. And the
civic pride of New Yorkers has never been greater or more
contagious.
 &HT;    The other cities in the ranking, in descending order, were
Seattle, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in a tie for seventh,
followed by Boston and Phoenix.
 &HT;    In terms of international travel, ASTA agents ranked the
following destinations. London was first, followed by Paris, Rome,
Cancun, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Dublin, Vancouver and Athens.
 &HT;    What the poll really means is that there has already been
significant demand for these destinations. With the American
economy booming, domestic hotel rooms will be very hard to find
this summer, especially in New York and San Francisco. Planning
ahead and booking as soon as possible are key to getting a
reasonably good deal on a vacation.
 &HT;    For those who like to do it themselves, the Web is a viable
option. And hotel brokers, such as Quikbook (381 Park Avenue South,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com), Express
Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123;
www.express-res.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut
Hill Lane, Suite 203, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com) can often provide 20 percent or more off the
cost of a domestic hotel room.
 &HT;    But ASTA, naturally enough, advocates using a travel agent _
someone who has essential travel information at their fingertips,
someone who knows which hotels are likely to have space and a
reasonable room rate. And agents can obtain some of the best prices
around for airfare and car rentals.
 &HT;    ``The Web is an excellent resource and there's lot of
information,'' Ashurst says. ``But that's part of the problem. Not
everyone is technically savvy enough to use it properly. You're not
getting professional advice or experience when you do. There's no
personal insight. And people are busy, they don't have the time to
do what it takes to get the information. The time factor doesn't
get included in the equation about whether the Web is better than a
travel agent.''
 &HT;    Ashurst points out, however, that an increasing number of travel
agents are using the Web themselves, both for communication
purposes and to research on behalf of their clients. And this
research will cost you. The days when an agent gave information
away for free are fast disappearing.
 &HT;    ``You pay a travel agent as you would pay any other
professional,'' Ashurst explains.
 &HT;    It's estimated that about 70 percent of ASTA's members are
either charging fees or are planning to charge fees. Those fees
vary widely, but they might run a consumer between $5 and $15 per
airline ticket. But research fees might be waived or deducted from
the cost of a vacation.

St., Alexandria, VA 22314; 800-965-ASTA.

   CHINA-CLINTON (Shanghai) _ Talk radio, in China, is still a
relatively new form of communication. Callers are generally polite,
not confrontational. And the idea of trying anything as risque as
voicing a contrary political opinion on the air is altogether
foreign, or maybe the vigilant screeners just make it seem that
way. So when President Clinton turned up on Tuesday at the studio
of Shanghai Radio 990 to make his first-ever appearance on a talk
radio show outside the United States, it may have caused great
excitement among callers but it yielded a decidedly benign, some
would say bland, set of questions and answers for listeners. By

business in Hong Kong,'' he said. Of course, Britain's exit from
Hong Kong has had little to do with the economic downturn of its
former colony, which sits at the crossroads of a becalmed Asia and
has suffered along with its neighbors. But Loon speaks for many
Hong Kong people, who are being ravaged by rising unemployment, a
20 percent drop in the stock market, and a 40 percent decline in

accompanying the British squadron, fired a single high-speed,

data are available. That rate is the lowest since 1969 when the

CALLERS QUIZ CLINTON ON CHINESE RADIO SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The first call was from Mr. Fong in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   And host Zuo Anlong wanted to get right to the phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it,'' urged President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You can take the politician a long way from home, but you can't
keep him away from his favorite communication devices.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton settled in for an hour Tuesday at the studios of
Shanghai Radio 990, China's most powerful urban radio station, and
was a guest on one of the nation's most popular call-in shows. The
president chatted with folks who inquired about topics from
international policy to the U.S. leader's exercise regime.
</P>
<P>
   It was just midday, and Clinton had already held a 90-minute
discussion session at the Shanghai Library with community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both formats _ the more intellectual round-table and the
cut-and-thrust chat show _ have been staples in Clinton's public
communications repertoire for years. And he was clearly in his
element.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the people were terrific,'' Clinton said after the
radio program. ``I thought they asked very good questions'' _ none
that touched on the sex and fund-raising scandals he left behind in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have the same feeling I always have when we do this. I
wish we could do it for two more hours,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The traveling White House pointed to Clinton's radio appearance
as another sign of what it sees as new openness of China's
authoritarian Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have made it enormously difficult'' for Clinton to
participate, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Like all radio and television stations in China, Shanghai Radio
990 is government controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was seated at a horseshoe-shaped desk, part of a small
studio in one of the dozens of modern skyscrapers that have sprung
up in Shanghai during the past 10 years. Although it was a steamy
summer day outside, the studio was well air-conditioned, and
Clinton kept his coat on as he donned headphones and leaned into
the bulbous microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by host Zuo's comment, he was aware of the caller's
questions, but spokesman McCurry said he did not believe the
inquiries were planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked only that they follow what their normal practice is
and try to encourage as diverse as possible a range of questions,''
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily into his policy-wonk mode, Clinton said he was most
impressed by the number of questions about education.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton also liked the query from a caller (who identified
himself as ``just a regular citizen'' from Shanghai) who wondered
about the rapid increase in the private ownership of cars in the
city of 13 million residents and the growth of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But the president initially let Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi, who
accompanied him to the show, handle the inquiry on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor backed a more lenient _ and less costly _ auto
licensing procedure but said that the city needed to insist on
lead-free gas and, by 2000, the use of exhaust purification
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the broadcast, Clinton added that while in Beijing he
had expressed concern to Chinese President Jiang Zemin about the
need to guide the way in which China's economy and industry will
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is that China will get rich in exactly the
same way America got rich. But you have four times as many
people,'' Clinton told the caller, ``so no one will be able to
breathe, because the air pollution will be so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the show, a Mr. Lee wondered how the president
kept his ``very nice figure'' _ surely a welcome description to
Clinton, who has fought to contain his ``junk food'' urges. The
caller wanted to know about the famous visitor's sports and
exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told of playing basketball in college and jogging for
about 30 years, until his tumble in Florida two years ago hurt his
knee, which has him huffing and puffing on a Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I play golf,'' Clinton said. ``It's my favorite sport.
Even though it doesn't burn up a lot of calories, it makes my mind
calm. So I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton passed up an opportunity to predict the winner of the
World Cup soccer competition (``the Brazilians are always hard to
beat``) but nattered on a bit about the politically charged match
the U.S. team lost to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the question exemplified a curiosity about Clinton
as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's most likely is because there's not the same level of
attention to the personal side of leadership here in China that
there is the United States,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the phenomenon of talk radio, U.S. programs ``are much
more prone to political discourse and political combat,'' McCurry
said. ``I don't think they've reached that point yet here in China
_ and maybe that's to their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The noon show is known as ``Citizens and Society.'' Host Zuo,
50ish, a former carpenter and electrician with Shanghai No. 1 Steel
Co., has been with the call-in program almost from its inception in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Zuo is a peppy host who kept the show moving, but bore little
resemblance to the U.S. shock-jocks such as New York's Don Imus,
whom Clinton appeared with in 1992 during his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Zuo's program reaches about 70 percent of households in the
region _ meaning it has a potential audience of 10 million
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said Clinton was the first non-Chinese guest on
the show.

LEADING BUSINESS GROUP CALLS YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM `HUGE'

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling the year 2000 computer glitch a potential
``disaster in the making,'' the National Association of
Manufacturers on Tuesday accused President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore of failing to make the problem a national
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the NAM, a lobbying group
representing 14,000 businesses, said at a news conference here that
many U.S. companies will not have enough time to fix the computer
glitch by Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a large, global disaster in the making,'' he said of the
problem, which experts warn will occur when computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on that date because they will think the year
is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski said Clinton and Gore, who often handles technology
issues for the administration, have neglected the issue and called
on them to increase public awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we, both in the business community and in the country as
a whole, need is leadership at the national level, and we simply
have not seen it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, administration officials said the president and vice
president were both concerned about the problem and were doing
everything possible to help solve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that the president holds as a high priority,
and he has stressed that to all the government agency heads,'' said
Jack Gribben, spokesman for the President's Council on the Year
2000 Problem.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski also said the problem is being made worse by the
reluctance of most companies to disclose what progress they have
made toward solving it. He said the companies are holding back
information on their efforts because they fear it could be used
against them in future lawsuits stemming from the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are worried that plaintiff lawyers will say, `Look,
the company's own information shows they weren't going to have this
problem fixed in time; so they must be guilty,''' Janinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress to enact legislation that offers companies
some legal protection in return for full disclosure of their
efforts to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get complete information on where companies are at
on this problem, we as a country risk large-scale disruptions in
our economy,'' Janinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, has introduced legislation that
would require companies to disclose what they have done to solve
the problem and what work they have left to do. But his bill does
not provide companies legal protection for giving the information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The millions of people out there putting their money into
these companies have a right to know if they're prepared or not,
and those companies have an obligation to tell them,'' Bennett said
at a Senate hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski's call for legal protection came on the heels of
recent announcements by computer consulting branches of the giant
accounting firms Deloitte &AMP; Touche and Price Waterhouse that they
will not accept new clients seeking Year 2000 help. Both units have
listed fear of lawsuits as a reason for scaling back their
operations.

<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Residents of Sonoma County will say this much
about their neighbor to the east: the Napa Valley is better known
and has better restaurants. That said, they wouldn't dream of
living there.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to give up their wild and spectacular coastline.
They would have to abandon their magnificent fruits and vegetables,
superb cheeses and foie gras, prize-winning olive oil, succulent
lamb and pristine oysters.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to leave the low-key atmosphere that attracts
fascinating (some would say eccentric) characters. And of course,
they would have to give up bragging rights on those Sonoma pinot
noirs and chardonnays, wines they would put up against Napa's any
day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these advantages, Sonoma's sense of being an
also-ran runs deep, as does resentment about the fame of Napa's
premium wines, which, Sonomans say, is partly driven by a
magnificent promotional machine that sometimes strays into pure
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, a spokesman for the Napa Valley Wine
Association described Napa as ``the premier food and wine growing
region in the country.'' Food? Olives are just about the valley's
only crop besides grapes.
</P>
<P>
   If Napa is to San Francisco what the Hamptons are to New York _
the weekend outpost for society doings _ Sonoma is the North Fork,
where potato fields still grow Long Island potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But in Sonoma, the local specialties are more refined than
potatoes. Laura Chenel, in the town of Sonoma, was one of the first
people in America to turn goat's milk into classic French-style
cheeses. Now, there are several excellent cheese makers in the
county, like Redwood Hill Farm, which makes a seductive
Camembertlike goat cheese called Camellia. And Ig Vella of Sonoma
makes probably the best Jack cheese anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   CK Lamb produces succulent and almost fork-tender meat that is
some of the best lamb in America. The foie gras from Sonoma's
Muscovy ducks has an incredibly fine texture _ silky and meltingly
rich, deeply flavored and with a delightful sweetness. And some of
the county's olive oils can hold their own with their European
brethren: DaVero's, with its intense flavor and peppery finish, is
exactly the kind that demands a shady spot and a few crusts of
country bread for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma does have a marketing organization for its bounty, called
Select Sonoma County, but the county does not have the money or the
name recognition of its Napa neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we are looking for respect,'' said Gaye LeBaron, a
columnist for The Santa Rosa Press Democrat in Sonoma's main town
and a longtime chronicler of this county-versus-valley feud. ``When
the national press misplaces things and puts them in Napa when they
belong in Sonoma, it just galls the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like fellow Sonomans, she cheered on the county's answer to
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid _ the Sonoma Valley Wine Patrol,
which in the early 1990s genially hijacked two busloads of European
travel writers on their way to taste Napa wines and ``forced'' them
to sample Sonoma wines instead. The same outfit raided the Napa
Valley Wine Train and cajoled the tourists into pouring their Napa
wine out the windows and drinking Sonoma wines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the residents of Sonoma want the glitz and the
glamour of the 20-mile-long, two-mile-wide Napa Valley or the
bumper-to-bumper traffic on its single north-south road as tourists
seek a little of ``Falcon Crest.'' Nor do they want what they call
the Disneyfication of the wine industry, to accommodate the
vacationing hordes.
</P>
<P>
   They especially don't want the 20,000-square-foot homes built by
people who have made their fortunes elsewhere and have bought
wineries as status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But it may already be too late.
</P>
<P>
   All over Sonoma, property values are rising as outsiders come
in, ``buying wineries and turning them over to professional
managers,'' said Lou Preston, the owner of Preston Vineyards in Dry
Creek Valley, disdain dripping from every word.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous sign of the kind of conspicuous architecture
that could await a more high-profile Sonoma is the new
Ferrari-Carano winery, in the Dry Creek Valley. It is a
25,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style villa of pink stucco and
limestone. Its owners, Don and Rhonda Carano, also own casinos and
hotels in Nevada, and at the winery they sell everything from ties
to refrigerator magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Stuart, a Berkeley ex-pat, who moved to Healdsburg in
1980 and opened the Downtown Bakery there in 1987, sees more and
more of these changes, with which Sonomans have a love-hate
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are social climbers here,'' she said over lunch at
Ravenous, one of the very few good restaurants in the county. ``And
there are a lot of transplants who want to start their own little
version of Napa, wearing their Ferragamos on weekends. They want to
be big fish in a little pond. Big money has come in here.''
</P>
<P>
   And if any town is going to become the center of this Napazation
it will be Healdsburg (population 9,750).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stuart acknowledged her bakery's role in the upscaling of
downtown: ``Before, there were a lot of empty storefronts, and it
was mostly farmers. Now, Healdsburg is totally cutesy-poo.'' She
added, ``I keep hoping the next incarnation will be more like 10
years ago, with a grocery store and a shoe store and a pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, downtown does have a grocery store. For the rich. It's
called the Oakville Grocery-Healdsburg and it's like a smaller
version of Dean &AMP; Deluca, but with better paneling. The Oakville
Grocery is a branch of a quintessential Napa store that entered
Sonoma only after consulting with a local committee on how to make
a Napa institution acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Though parts of the county are less than an hour north of the
Golden Gate Bridge, most of Sonoma is still very rural. Once beyond
the unattractive urban sprawl of tract housing and traffic jams
along the main north-south route, Highway 101, at Santa Rosa and
Petaluma, malls give way to gently rounded hillsides, softly peaked
mountains and long stretches of prime flat agricultural land.
Farther west, waves break against a rocky coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, life in rural Sonoma has been noncompetitive. It
is a place for individualists and eccentrics _ mavericks who
provide the color that keeps the place intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Skall is a more recent transplant who chose Sonoma over
Napa. Mrs. Skall has the carriage and accent of a San Francisco
grande dame, but she also has smudges of dirt on her face and under
her fingernails. Ten years ago, when she was 59, she and her
husband, Malcolm, started Middleton Gardens in Healdsburg, which
sells organic produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prices are high,'' she said, ``but we don't make any money
at it.'' And the quality of what they grow is such that they have
no trouble selling it. ``It's not a hobby,'' she said, ``it's an
obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she and her husband, a retired investment banker,
chose Sonoma over Napa, she said: ``Over there, they get dressed up
and wear jewels. Over here, we get dressed up by putting on clean
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   After living in Paris for years as an international lawyer,
Barry Sterling could have chosen either Napa or Sonoma for the next
phase of his life as a winery owner. In 1976, he and his wife,
Audrey, bought Iron Horse Vineyards in Sebastopol.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Napa is not my style,'' Mrs. Sterling said, sitting before a
crackling fire in her 1870s farmer-Gothic-style home. ``I don't
want to live in Disneyland. We do not conform to what is socially
correct. We are not a social branch of San Francisco.'' Far from
putting on jewels, Mrs. Sterling prefers to go barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cannard, whose fruits and vegetables appear on the menu of
Chez Panisse in Berkeley every day, would stand out in any setting.
His theories about farming are well beyond cutting edge: tall weeds
surround his rows of vegetables in happy harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I look like a lazy farmer,'' said Cannard, who has
been farming this way all his life. ``Twenty years ago, they said,
`You can't do this.' Ten years ago, they said, `Well, OK, but you
have to keep it mowed.' And now it's OK It's totally not true that
the weeds are taking up nutrients. Weeds are the fertilizer. I
don't fertilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannard may look like a hippie farmer, with his long scraggly
gray hair under his knitted cap, but he speaks about ecology and
the environment like a college professor. After a look at the lush
vegetation and listening to the songbirds on his mountaintop
paradise in southern Sonoma, it's not hard to come away believing
him when he says his food ``heals you and makes you think the way
the plant wants you to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannard is not a hippie type, but Sonoma is filled with present
and former members of that tribe. People like Steven Schack and
Jennifer Lynn Bice, who spent years making and selling yogurt,
mostly to health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe in capitalism,'' Schack said, ``but my ideals
have changed over 20 years.'' After studying cheese-making in
France, the two came back to their Redwood Hill Farm in Sebastopol,
on a hidden road overlooking Iron Horse Vineyards. Although they
have been making goat's cheese for only three years, their
Camembert-style Camellia is a standout.
</P>
<P>
   Among the farmers-turned-vintners, Tom Rochioli has made it to
the top. His vineyard is one of the hottest labels of the Russian
River Valley, in northern Sonoma. His grandfather moved to Sonoma
in 1916, and the family gave up raising hops in the 1950s to devote
its 160 acres to wine.
</P>
<P>
   Today, J. Rochioli wines are rated among the best in America.
The Wine Spectator describes its pinot noirs as ``silky smooth''
and ``intriguing,'' its chardonnays as ``stellar, sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel second to Napa Valley,'' Rochioli said.
``Image-wise, they have a reputation of being slicker, `Falcon
Crest' royalty, while over here we're a bunch of farmers who became
winemakers.'' Putting it another way, he describes Sonoma as
relaxed, like Burgundy; Napa, more formal, like Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   If wine prices declined tomorrow, these farmer-vintners would
convert to prunes, or whatever else could make them a living.
</P>
<P>
   In Napa, the farmers _ the people who grow the grapes _ don't
socialize with the winemakers. In Sonoma, the class structure is
much looser. Lunch on a cool, sunny afternoon at the home of
Ridgely Evers, a software millionaire turned olive oil producer,
and his wife, Colleen McGlynn, was a telling Sonoma mix.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guests, Bruce Campbell, who with his wife, Nancy,
raises Sonoma lamb, explained the difference: ``In Napa, producers
are not ever invited to wine dinners. In Sonoma, producers are
invited, and you don't have to cook or clean up to get invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Sonoma County native, did supply the luscious lamb
shanks that were cooked perfectly over a wood fire by Ms. McGlynn.
He's been raising sheep since he was 10. It's no ordinary lamb:
Wolfgang Puck of Spago is one of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Evers, a member of the entrepreneurial class, supports his olive
oil habit by working in San Francisco during the week. This year,
after a decade, his olive oil business should break even.
</P>
<P>
   ``You plant grapes for your children and olives for your
grandchildren,'' he said of his 4,500 trees. His DaVero olive oil
was the first from America to be accepted as extra virgin by the
International Olive Oil Council, and it won a blind tasting in
Italy, much to the chagrin of the tasters.
</P>
<P>
   With so many superb raw ingredients to go with the top quality
wines, the question is: Will Sonoma outdo Napa in the restaurant
game?
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Toni Robertson, the new executive chef at the
Sonoma Mission Inn just outside the town of Sonoma, is typical.
When she arrived at the inn, she was taken to lunch at two
restaurants, both in Napa: Tra Vigne and the French Laundry, which
has a nationwide reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told there isn't much restaurant competition in
Sonoma,'' Ms. Robertson said. ``Our competition is in Napa.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that Sonoma needs to get some noteworthy restaurants
are enough customers with high standards, like those wealthy people
and their 20,000-square-foot homes from Napa. The ones they don't
want.
</P>
<P>
   But once Sonoma's restaurants are as good as its wines, Sonoma
will find itself a world destination, like it or not. &QL;

 &HT;    INDUSTRY SEEKS NEW RULES TO EASE Y2K BUG
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing a ``global disaster in the making'' as the
year 2000 approaches, the nation's leading industrial trade group
called on the federal government Tuesday to offer antitrust and
liability relief to business users of computers infected with the
so-called ``Millennium Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability of many older software programs to correctly read
dates beyond Dec. 31, 1999 promises ``to have an impact on the
world economy that will be much more severe than generally
anticipated,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
</P>
<P>
   Jasinowski said his group will seek both antitrust waivers and
liability protection against private lawsuits as they cope with the
Year 2000 problem, also known as Y2K. Jack Gribben, a spokesman for
President Clinton's newly formed Y2K council, said the White House
will work with NAM and other business groups to solicit an advisory
opinion from the Justice Department on the kind of information that
companies will be allowed to share without risking antitrust
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Securities Industry Association in New York
also plans to seek such an opinion soon, Justice Department and SIA
officials said. A departmental official said that once such an
advisory is issued, it automatically will cover companies and
organizations in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   At the NAM press conference, Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities, said ``the administration doesn't want to
panic the public, and that's why they are taking such a low
profile'' on the looming Y2K issue
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who was named by The Wall Street Journal as the leading
U.S. economic forecaster in 1997, said efforts by Clinton and other
world leaders to deal with the oncoming problem have been
``pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing virtually nothing to increase global awareness,
to accelerate the pace of remediation or to prepare for the failure
of vital systems,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the slow progress being made, his personal estimate
of the chances that computer bug will trigger a recession have
risen from 60 to 70 percent, Yardeni said. An economic downturn
sparked by missing or inaccurate information in networked computer
databases could cause a vicious cycle of falling prices, or
deflation, accompanied by a stock market crash, he added.

A DESSERT OF STRAWBERRIES AND ELEGANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Precious as they are, strawberries are not often eaten out of
hand _ they're delicate, their colors bleed and in most instances,
they simply aren't sweet enough. These drawbacks, however minor,
have combined to make strawberries the basis for some of the best
fruit desserts, from strawberry shortcake to summer pudding.
</P>
<P>
   After a heavy meal, though, you might regret eating something so
rich and luxurious. But here is a strawberry dish that not only is
delicious and intriguing but also can compete with plain fruit in
its lightness.
</P>
<P>
   The strawberries are sugared to juice them up a bit, then
drizzled with balsamic vinegar and a pinch of black pepper. The
result is so elegant that it is found in great restaurants from New
York to the Romagna region of Italy, the home of balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   All balsamic vinegar is slightly sweet. The authentic version,
which is aged at least 10 years, draws its velvety sweetness from
the concentration of the unfermented wine that is its base. The
subtle flavor of wood _ the barrels are made from cherry, oak,
apple or other trees _ lends an elusive vanilla quality that is
also perceived as sweet. (Inexpensive balsamic vinegar, which sells
for about $3 a bottle, gains much of its flavor from sugar.)
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this dessert should be made with ripe, local berries
and authentic balsamic vinegar, which is expensive but is normally
used in tiny quantities _ as it is here. Of course it isn't always
possible to get both, and we make the compromises we must.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is a combination of flavors here that is unlike
any other and is instantly likable, even to children, as long as
you take it easy on both vinegar and pepper and don't disclose the
presence of either.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries with balsamic vinegar will not hold for any length
of time. You can sugar the berries an hour or two before serving
them, but no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle on the vinegar and pepper, very judiciously, just
before serving. Feel free to mix in some blackberries or
blueberries for color; their addition is a striking one. The
berries, of course, can be served solo.
</P>
<P>
   But for an even more elegant presentation, add a few crisp
cookies or a slice of pound, sponge or angel food cake. A glass of
slightly sweet, lightly sparkling wine would complete the picture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STRAWBERRIES WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 quart strawberries, rinsed, hulled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   { pint blackberries or blueberries, optional
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon high-quality balsamic vinegar, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh mint leaves for garnish, optional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Toss strawberries and other berries, if using, with the \ cup
sugar, and let sit for 10 minutes or longer. Do not refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sprinkle with the vinegar; toss gently, then taste and add
more sugar or vinegar if necessary. Sprinkle with the pepper, toss
again, and serve, garnished with the mint, if you like. Spoon into
a glass or bowl, and serve next to cookies or a piece of cake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. &QL;

BUILDING A STEW FROM CORN KERNELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the second of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef of Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman.)  
 (HLW)  
 By DEBORAH MADISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, while traveling in Mexico, I was served a stew
made with an unusually fragrant chewy corn. It was unlike anything
I had ever had before. The complex flavors of the stew _ nutty and
bright and most of all big _ came from something that appeared
utterly simple.
</P>
<P>
   I soon learned that posole is the name for corn kernels that are
dried and then boiled, and are the soul of the stew. The dish,
naturally enough, is also called posole. These kernels can be
ground into masa, the distinctively flavored building block from
which corn tortillas and chips are made.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, posole is often the center of a large communal dish
surrounded by an array of garnishes like avocado, for creaminess;
onions, for crunch; and oregano, for aromatic flavor. And then
there are grated cheese and tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, where I now live, posole is more likely to be a
side dish in place of beans. It sometimes serves as a simple main
course, containing pork, onion, oregano, and garlic. The pork makes
a kind of broth as it simmers with the corn, rendering the meat
tender and integrating it beautifully into the stew.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years I have become more inclined to make a vegetarian
version of the dish and to look for other ways to enliven it. My
variation begins with roasted, fresh, mild green chilies. (If you
can't get these, substitute long-frying peppers and add fresh
jalapeno or another hot chili.) I add zucchini near the very end; I
want it to become soft but not mushy. Then, in the Mexican fashion,
I serve my posole with a few condiments, including a fresh cilantro
salsa, avocado, and chopped cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Like beans, posole takes longer to cook as it ages, so cooking
times are approximate. But this dish can be prepared in advance; it
gets better as it sits. You can double or triple the amounts and
add chunks of pork at the beginning of the cooking time. But
practicalities aside, the result is a beguiling, hearty stew of
bursting corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER POSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Time: at least two hours, plus optional soaking time
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups dried posole, available at health-food stores or stores
selling Mexican or Southwest ingredients
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 dried red chilies
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano, plus more for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 fresh, mild green chilies, like Anaheims
</P>
<P>
   1 big bunch cilantro, well washed, large stems removed, minced
(there should be about 2/3 cup finely minced cilantro)
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno, stem and seeds removed, very finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup minced scallions or shallots
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 avocados, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 medium zucchini, cut the long way into quarters, then into
chunks
</P>
<P>
   Lime wedges
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh shredded and chopped cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   1. If time allows, soak posole overnight in water to cover.
Drain, and place in a pot with 8 cups water, red chilies, 2
teaspoons oregano, onion, and all but a teaspoon of garlic. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat so that mixture bubbles gently, and cover.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast the 4 fresh chilies over an open flame, on either the
grill or a gas stove (you can just let them sit on a burner; they
won't make much of a mess). Turn them frequently, until they are
blackened and blistered all over. Remove them to a bowl, then cover
and let sit while you prepare the salsa.
</P>
<P>
   3. Combine cilantro with remaining garlic, jalapeno, scallion,
oil, and one of the avocados. Add salt and pepper, then taste and
adjust seasoning as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   4. When roasted peppers have sat for at least 30 minutes,
uncover, and remove their skins, stems and seeds. Chop the pepper
flesh roughly, and add it to the stew. When the posole kernels
begin to pop (not audibly, but visibly), add salt and pepper to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   5. The stew is done when the posole is tender but not mushy;
many of the kernels will have popped. Add zucchini, and cook a few
minutes more, until it becomes tender. Taste, and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   6. Serve with the salsa, the remaining avocado, the lime, a
small bowl of oregano, and the cabbage; each should be added by
individual diners, to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WINE OF THE WEEK: FULL CABERNET  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Cakebread Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon, 1995, Napa Valley, Calif.
About $30. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For a while there in 1995, it seemed as if nature wanted to even
things up, after having been so generous to the Napa Valley in
1994, one of its best years ever.
</P>
<P>
   There were floods in the winter, rain in the spring, hail in
June and, for good measure, an occasional day of grape-shattering
heat. Just enough alibis to get any winemaker through an iffy year,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Not Bruce Cakebread. He took on the challenge that the weather
had tossed him and managed to turn out a marvelous cabernet
sauvignon. This, to me, is the quintessential California cabernet:
rich, intense, full without being weighty, deep without being
cloying.
</P>
<P>
   The Cakebreads, winemakers all, believe this wine to be a bit
more austere than their 1994. That's good: a touch of leanness
supplies the elegance that so many California cabernets lack. It is
well worth its price.

`WHERE THE SEA USED TO BE': SEARCHING FOR OIL, LOVE, IN THE SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Bass is an oil geologist and environmentalist whose books
exalt the world of nature and the practice of solitude. A few years
ago, he spent a year or so in a tiny, isolated, unelectrified
community of 30 human inhabitants in the Yaak Valley of northern
Montana, an experience from which his essay ``Notes From Montana''
was drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' is Bass' first full-length novel,
and it combines the author's knowledge of oil exploration with his
experience in a snowbound village near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a geologist named Wallis who is sent by a
coarse and power-hungry wildcatter called Old Dudley to find oil in
a place very much like the real-life Yaak Valley. Wallis engages in
a life-and-death struggle with Old Dudley, a struggle that poses
the themes of human love, possession and greed against the
unsparing, harshly beautiful, brutally indifferent background of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   These are not new themes, though they are promising ones, which
Bass here and there exploits with telling effect. But ``Where the
Sea Used to Be'' is encased in an aesthetic of such contrived,
over-elaborated meaningfulness that the effect is stock melodrama
rather than genuine human struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bass intends this book to be taken for a kind of natural
realism, a psychological, Nietzschean duel to the death among
strongly willed figures whose characters drive them to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Bass' aim is undermined by his propensity for a
self-conscious, epic-heroic mysticism that at times approaches
self-parody, as in passages like this one: ``They drove into and
then through the cold front, so that the snow was behind them and
the stars burned fiercely above, so bright that the stabs and
flashes of them welded and seared old memories in their minds,
summoned things within them, old stories and histories they had not
remembered in a long time, or had never known.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gothic quality of ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' is evident
from the very first pages, where Bass introduces his protagonist,
Old Dudley, a man of ``nearly immeasurable wealth,'' who doesn't so
much employ geologists to help him find oil as devour and destroy
them. ``He could read scents and gestures as other men and women
might read a newspaper,'' Bass' narrator writes, striking an early
tone of hackneyed portent. ``He could follow these scents straight
into their seams of weakness _ the soft places.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis, a man who had ``lost everything,'' is a new geologist
hired by Dudley. Wallis is sent off in a Jeep to the isolated Swan
Valley in northern Montana with instructions to map the land and
find where the oil is. Wallis wonders about this particular task,
since another of Dudley's geologists, Matthew, has already mapped
the terrain and drilled 19 dry holes there.
</P>
<P>
   He also wonders why Dudley is determined to find oil in the very
spot in Montana where his only daughter, Mel, happens to live. But
Mel, who is Matthew's woman and lives in a cabin in the woods
studying wolves, knows what Dudley is up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Dudley was carving one of them with his blood,'' she says
of her feverishly controlling father, ``and the other with his
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene, in other words, is set for simultaneous struggles:
one is between Wallis and Matthew for the love of Mel, the other
between Mel and Dudley for the contested and tortured soul of
Wallis. As these twin battles are played out in the snow-barricaded
valley where Mel lives, Bass delivers some patches of fine writing
but in a Paul Bunyanesque tall-tale mode that requires a good deal
of credulity.
</P>
<P>
   Mel, for example, carries the arriving Wallis on her back as she
skis the 10 miles into town _ an unlikely exploit. ``They dropped
lower down into the mountains, descending, corkscrewing, as if into
its interior. He could feel the pleasure coming straight through
her _ could feel it like heat conducted, as if it were his.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel teaches Wallis about the deer and the wolves in a way that
is unsentimental about the violence and the blood of nature yet is
saturated in an anthropomorphism that is sentimentalizing in
itself. ``The deer are leaving this layer of earth and are going to
the next kingdom,'' Mel tells Wallis, ``and the cedars are a bridge
between those two worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis sets about trying to map the geological strata, which is
difficult given that the earth is covered by mountains of snow.
Meanwhile, working in Mel's cabin, he uncovers a diary written by
Dudley that contains his ruminations on geological history, these
too written in what seems a kind of unintended imitation of ``Thus
Spake Zarathustra'': ``We understand now that man's birth was
foreshadowed. It was expressed in the formal gradation of the
continents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley himself turns out to be less Zarathustra than simply a
lecher and a megalomaniac. He impregnates a woman by spraying her
with sperm from a distance of six feet (another tall tale). He
leads Wallis and Matthew to drill a hopeless well, which makes one
wonder, if that is Dudley's modus operandi, how he managed to gain
his immeasurable wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, Wallis and Matthew go off to hunt elk to lay in a
store of meat for Mel's winter, an episode that furnishes Bass with
an occasion for some of the best descriptive writing that appears
in this book, but for some semi-nonsensical rapture as well.
``Forty yards up the ridge, on the flat, the elk rested. Wallis
emptied his mind of them, as he knew he must, so they would not
know he was among them.'' In other words, if you don't think about
elk, they won't think about you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' is a book that seems to mimic an
echo chamber in which sounds are magnified and deformed, leaving
the reader, or the listener, wishing for the rhetorical volume to
be turned down.

IS IT PASTEURIZED? JUICE LABELS WILL TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall's jug of fresh apple cider will look different from
the cider jugs of previous years. It will wear a label that warns
of the hazards of drinking juice that has not been pasteurized or
otherwise treated to destroy potentially harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   This new warning label, which is expected to be announced by the
Food and Drug Administration this month, will apply to all fresh
fruit and vegetable juices, not just apple cider, whether they are
farm-made or from a large manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Such labeling may help worried parents, like the woman who asked
me last week whether it was safe for her daughter to drink fresh
chilled raspberry juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it pasteurized or not?'' she asked. ``It doesn't say
anything on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is no way to know whether juices in a
refrigerator case have been pasteurized, if the label does not say
so. It is, however, safe to assume that packaged or canned juice
not held under refrigeration has been pasteurized.
</P>
<P>
   Most juice sold in the United States is pasteurized; only about
2 percent is not. There are no figures on how many people are
sickened by tainted juice each year, but a number of cases have
gained national attention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, one child died and 66 others became ill from drinking
Odwalla unpasteurized apple juice, which was contaminated with the
potentially lethal bacterium E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many people, especially parents of small children,
have had something else to worry about: whether fresh juices, whose
ingredients are so much more healthful than those of a can of soda,
are safe to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 incident brought pressure from public health proponents
for pasteurization of all juices. In response, the FDA proposed a
rule in April to require all fresh juices, both fruit and
vegetable, to be processed to remove harmful bacteria _ through
pasteurization or other means.
</P>
<P>
   Until that rule takes effect, in about two years, all
unprocessed juices will have to carry a warning label that states:
``This product has not been pasteurized or otherwise treated and
may contain harmful bacteria, which can cause serious illness in
children, the elderly and persons with weakened immune systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The new labeling rule ``puts parents on notice that it is no
longer safe to serve unpasteurized juices to their children,'' said
Caroline Smith deWaal, the director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria like E. coli O157:H7 and salmonella have mutated and
made their ways into foods in which scientists did not believe they
could survive, the consumption of fresh juices has become something
of a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Take orange juice, for example. Though citrus juices have a high
acid content and would seem immune from these harmful bacteria,
there are types of salmonella that can survive in unpasteurized
orange juice. One of these was the culprit in an outbreak in 1995
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So that means all those juices that are freshly squeezed at the
grocery will have to carry warning labels, too. (The FDA news
release about the warning labels assures the public that children's
lemonade stands are exempt.)
</P>
<P>
   Apple cider also poses problems, in part because the whole
fruit, including the skin, is used in making juice. Since 1974,
there have been at least three reported incidents of people
becoming sick after drinking apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   People have eagerly turned from canned pasteurized or otherwise
treated juices to fresh juices, even though they are more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fresher, and the perception is that they are
healthier,'' Ms. DeWaal said. ``But parents aren't doing their kids
any favor by giving them unpasteurized juice. Extra vitamins are no
help to a kid hospitalized with E. coli poisoning.''

WILL THE REAL ROOT BEER PLEASE STAND UP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - The Fourth of July approaches, and Americans are
going to gobble millions of hot dogs and drink oceans of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   They already know they have no clue what goes in hot dogs _
America has made peace with that ambiguity _ but everyone thinks
they know what root beer is. Unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer is not an item, but a class. There is no official
definition for the beverage and the differences between brands are
often quite striking.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since 1960, when the federal Food and Drug
Administration made traditional root beer illegal in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the root in root beer _ traditionally
sassafras root _ is a carcinogen. Soft-drink manufacturers had to
scurry around to find replacements for the main ingredient of the
popular drink.
</P>
<P>
   So that no root beer today is made by the same ``Old Timey''
recipe that may be advertised on the label.
</P>
<P>
   What is all the more ironic about this turn of events is that
root beer has its origins in the world of patent medicines. It was
supposed to make you well.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common story among soft drinks. Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper,
7Up and even the once-ubiquitous Moxie all had their beginnings in
the drugstore, sold originally as tonics to make people feel
healthier and more energetic.
</P>
<P>
   Before 7Up took its name from a cattle brand that its inventor
took a fancy to, its name was actually Bib-Label Lithiated
Lemon-Lime Soda.
</P>
<P>
   From the 18th century, naturally carbonated mineral water was
used as a medicine. Wells of the bubbly water were tapped and sold
in spas and health retreats. In 1825, Elie Magliore Durand, a
French immigrant, began selling the stuff in his Philadelphia
pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The first to add flavors, in 1838, was Eugene Roussel _ another
French immigrant in another Philadelphia drugstore _ who began to
add sugar and lemon flavoring to the fizz water, then carbonated
artificially. Within a few years, there were no fewer than six
manufacturers of flavored carbonated water in Philadelphia alone.
It soon spread to New York.
</P>
<P>
   After about 1850, other flavors began to appear.
</P>
<P>
   All in the name of health.
</P>
<P>
   Well, two other streams of history added to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that of brewing, which makes another beverage with
bubbles _ beer. When the yeast action is interrupted before it has
a chance to turn all the sugars into alcohol, the result is ``small
beer,'' and it has very little alcohol and a lot of bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Apple cider is one example, and, later, root beer became
another.
</P>
<P>
   The third stream of this story begins in the mountains of
eastern North America, where inhabitants often collected sassafras
roots to make a tea that was considered a ``spring tonic,'' and was
believed to help healing and get the sluggish inner organs working
fluently once again after a hard winter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874, the health-giving tea joined the small-beer yeast to
make another carbonated beverage that could be sold in the pharmacy
for its medicinal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought the three streams of history together was
Charles Hires, a New Jersey pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   He began, by the way, as a pharmacist in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On Independence Day, we celebrate the signing of the Declaration
of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776. But, as you see,
Philadelphia had a vital role also in the development of soft
drinks. I leave it to you to decide whether democracy or soda pop
is more American.
</P>
<P>
   Hires began experimenting in the 1870s with a carbonated drink
flavored with roots and berries. He tried juniper, pipsissewa,
spikenard, wintergreen, ginger, licorice, vanilla, hops and
sarsaparilla. But a tonic he had been given by a New Jersey woman _
the landlady of a vacation house he was renting _ put him on the
track of sassafras.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1876 Centennial Exhibition opened in _ where else? _
Philadelphia, Hires was there to begin selling his new beverage. It
caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, close to 2,000 brands of root beer have been sold.
Even now, there are close to 200. Although the popularity of root
beer has declined from its height and colas now dominate, the drink
still makes up about 3 percent of the $54 billion domestic
soft-drink market.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective: In 1993, A&AMP;W _ the most popular root
beer _ sold 53.5 million cases of root beer; the same year, Coke
unloaded 1.6 billion cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a lot of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   It did take a hit in 1960, though.
</P>
<P>
   The main flavoring ingredient in root beer was sassafras, and
the FDA discovered that one of the components of sassafras could
cause liver cancer in rats. The offending chemical is called
safrole, although it sounds much more baleful by its longer name,
4-allyl 1-1, 2-methylenedioxybenzene.
</P>
<P>
   It was potent enough to be used topically as a pediculicide, or
delousing bath, in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds worse than it is. A 200-pound man would have to drink
something like 24 gallons of root beer a day to reach the levels of
toxicity the lab rats endured.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, root-beer manufacturers had to find a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Some managed to remove the safrole from the oil. Others found
artificial flavoring replacements. Still others used substitutes
like wintergreen oil or birch bark.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer has always had an ambiguous relationship with
sarsaparilla.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sarsaparilla (begin ital) is (end ital)a root beer, but
made with the root of the Central American sarsaparilla plant
instead of the sassafras. Sassafras doesn't grow in the West. So a
replacement was found that was regionally suitable, and
sarsaparilla was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today's drink seems more like a wintergreen soda, but
manufacturers guard their proprietary recipes carefully and we
cannot know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   A related drink is made from birch bark _ or was _ and is called
birch beer. It has a similar flavor to sarsaparilla, partly because
it seems as if some modern birch beers are really wintergreen
sodas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cream'' sodas are vanilla flavored sodas, and some modern root
beers are so vanilla-heavy, it is hard to tell them from cream
sodas.
</P>
<P>
   A final bit of trivia: Men and women have different preferences
in taste. Men, it turns out, tend to like herbal and root flavors
more; women tend to like berry and fruit flavors. So root beer _
although it has fans in both genders _ tends to be a boy's drink.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, perfect to slosh down with a hot dog slathered in
mustard and onions. &QL;

THE THRILL OF THE GRILL IS IN CHARCOAL, NOT GAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, or so it seems, the mail carrier delivers another
brochure touting a new gas mega-grill. These gleaming steel
behemoths, which can cost more than $5,000, are nothing less than
fantasy kitchens reconfigured for outdoor use. Each promises to
provide ease, convenience and great grilled food at the flip of a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two problems. First, these grills are no fun.
Second, you can cook better on an oven rack perched on bricks over
a charcoal fire. Because let's face it: no matter how fancy or
high-tech, gas grills are the microwaves of the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Like microwaves, gas grills are convenient, and there is
certainly no shame in using them. But to us, these new grills are
the very definition of a culinary Faustian bargain. In exchange for
the convenience of gas, the griller must give up the challenge of
unpredictability, that personal interaction with the fire that
forms the very soul of grilling.
</P>
<P>
   We have always seen grilling as more than just a way to cook
food. For each of us, it started out as a bonding activity with our
dads. In the wilds of the backyard, father and son braved the
vagaries of the flames together, faced with the constant threat
that dinner would be turned into ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing and pulling the coals, opening and shutting vents,
moving the food around on the grid, we were totally absorbed in our
task. Finally, triumphant, we bore the dinner unscathed into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   A thrill like this can never be achieved on a gas contraption,
nor can you reach the same level of grilled flavor. You may as well
wheel your stove outside.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for this. Grilling is essentially a
high-heat cooking method. When food is exposed to the direct heat
of a charcoal or wood fire, a crusty, hyper-flavorful, slightly
sweet seared crust develops on its exterior. It is this crust that
is most responsible for the characteristic grilled flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Gas cannot do as good a job of creating this crust. First, the
primary heat of a charcoal fire comes not from flames but from
coals, which provide a more intense heat. And gas is what we like
to call a ``wet heat.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Harold Schobert, the director of the Energy
Institute at Pennsylvania State University, propane contains some
carbon atoms and some hydrogen atoms. When it burns, the primary
products are carbon dioxide and water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charcoal has a much, much higher percentage of carbon than
propane does,'' Schobert said. ``So of course, there is less water
vapor coming off charcoal when it is burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In our experience, water vapor has the same effect on food being
grilled as moisture has on the surface of food being sauteed _ it
does not sear as well.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but what about the fact that charcoal's messy? Sure, but
after all, it's used outside. Even the convenience of gas grills,
their primary advantage, provides less of an edge than you might
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Gas grill manuals routinely advise, for example, that the grill
be turned on 10 to 15 minutes before cooking begins. By using
hardwood charcoal and a chimney starter, you can have a charcoal
fire ready to grill in 30 to 35 minutes. Saving 20 minutes hardly
seems worth it for the difference in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   So, the one remaining advantage of gas grills is that they are
easy to light. That we will concede, and those for whom this is a
major concern might opt for the new grills that ignite charcoal
with an instant-on gas flame.
</P>
<P>
   While they don't provide the whole grilling experience, at least
you cook over the real thing once the fire gets going.
</P>
<P>
   But for us, the bottom line is that gas, while handy, simply
can't deliver the flavor or the fun that live fire does.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting, adjusting and generally playing around with the fire
is a kind of ceremony to be reveled in, rather than avoided. Sure,
it may take a few minutes longer, but it engages the cook like no
other cooking method _ getting that fire just right, preparing just
the proper bed of coals for steak or lamb chops, eggplant or fish.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up to the plate to grill over a real live fire yields
not only incomparable flavor, but also a sense of triumph over the
elements, as well. You can't get that from simply turning yet
another knob. &QL;

   4 10- to 12-ounce shoulder lamb chops, about 1{ inches thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh rosemary

<P>
   \ cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon)
</P>
<P>
   12 pickled hot cherry peppers (if desired). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In large bowl, combine arugula, mint and onion. Toss to mix,
and then set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Sprinkle lamb chops with salt and pepper to taste. In small
bowl, combine vegetable oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and
rosemary, and mix well. Cover chops generously with rub. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Grill over medium-hot fire for about 6 minutes a side for
medium. To check for doneness, cut into a chop, and see whether the
center is slightly pinker than you want it to be when you eat it,
since it will continue to cook a bit after you remove it from the
grill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. While lamb is cooking, place bread slices around edge of
grill, and toast until golden brown, about 2 minutes a side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. In small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice and salt
and pepper to taste. Pour over arugula-mint mixture, and toss well.

<P>
   GRILLED EGGPLANT CIRCLES WITH SWEET CHILE SAUCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   { cup lime juice (about 2 limes)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ketchup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 medium eggplants, cut into rounds about 1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias (green and white parts)
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red pepper flakes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. First, make the sauce: In medium saucepan, place sesame oil
over medium heat until it is hot but not smoking. Add garlic and
ginger, and saute, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add lime
juice, ketchup and brown sugar, and bring to boil, stirring
occasionally. As soon as mixture begins to boil, reduce heat to
low, and simmer, stirring once in a while, for 20 minutes or until
sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from
heat, and set aside. (It may be covered and refrigerated for as
long as 1 week; bring to room temperature before using.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Put eggplant rounds, vegetable oil and salt and pepper to
taste into medium bowl. Toss to coat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Place eggplant directly on grill over medium-hot fire, and
cook until browned and soft, about 4 minutes a side. To check for
doneness, cut eggplant, and be sure interior looks moist (raw
eggplant is dry, cooked is moist). Brush eggplant on both sides
with chile sauce, leave it on grill for about 10 seconds, and then
transfer to plates or platter. Sprinkle with scallions, coriander
and red pepper flakes, and serve warm. &QL;

   GRILLED NEW YORK STRIP WITH SMOKY CORN RELISH AND GRILLED SPRING
ONIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 ears corn, blanched in boiling salted water for 2 minutes,
then drained
</P>
<P>
   { red bell pepper, seeded and diced small
</P>
<P>
   { green bell pepper, seeded and diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 teaspoons minced fresh chile pepper of your choice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons molasses
</P>
<P>
   { cup roughly chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 12-ounce New York strip steaks
</P>
<P>
   8 whole spring onions (or very large scallions), roots trimmed
</P>
<P>
   2 limes, halved. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a hot fire. Place corn around edges of grill, just
barely over the coals. Cook corn, rolling it around frequently, for
about 3 minutes, or until ears are well browned. Remove ears from
grill, and as soon as they are cool enough to handle, slice kernels
from cobs into a small bowl. Add bell peppers, red onion, chile
pepper, vinegar, oil, molasses, parsley and salt and pepper to
taste. Mix well, and set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Check fire to make sure it is still hot; if not, add some
coals and wait a few minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle steaks generously
with salt and pepper. Place on grill, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes a
side for rare. To check for doneness, cut into a steak and see
whether the center is slightly pinker than you want it to be when
you eat it, since it will continue to cook a bit after you remove
it from the grill. Remove steaks from grill, and allow to rest for
5 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. While steaks are resting, sprinkle spring onions lightly with
salt and pepper, and place them on the grill over a hot fire. Cook
for 3 to 4 minutes, rolling them over several times, or until
outsides are nicely browned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove spring onions from grill, and slice in half
lengthwise. Serve each steak with halved spring onion, squeeze of
lime and a big spoonful of the relish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

WILL THE REAL ROOT BEER PLEASE STAND UP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - The Fourth of July approaches, and Americans are
going to gobble millions of hot dogs and drink oceans of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   They already know they have no clue what goes in hot dogs _
America has made peace with that ambiguity _ but everyone thinks
they know what root beer is. Unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer is not an item, but a class. There is no official
definition for the beverage and the differences between brands are
often quite striking.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since 1960, when the federal Food and Drug
Administration made traditional root beer illegal in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the root in root beer _ traditionally
sassafras root _ is a carcinogen. Soft-drink manufacturers had to
scurry around to find replacements for the main ingredient of the
popular drink.
</P>
<P>
   So that no root beer today is made by the same ``Old Timey''
recipe that may be advertised on the label.
</P>
<P>
   What is all the more ironic about this turn of events is that
root beer has its origins in the world of patent medicines. It was
supposed to make you well.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common story among soft drinks. Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper,
7Up and even the once-ubiquitous Moxie all had their beginnings in
the drugstore, sold originally as tonics to make people feel
healthier and more energetic.
</P>
<P>
   Before 7Up took its name from a cattle brand that its inventor
took a fancy to, its name was actually Bib-Label Lithiated
Lemon-Lime Soda.
</P>
<P>
   From the 18th century, naturally carbonated mineral water was
used as a medicine. Wells of the bubbly water were tapped and sold
in spas and health retreats. In 1825, Elie Magliore Durand, a
French immigrant, began selling the stuff in his Philadelphia
pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The first to add flavors, in 1838, was Eugene Roussel _ another
French immigrant in another Philadelphia drugstore _ who began to
add sugar and lemon flavoring to the fizz water, then carbonated
artificially. Within a few years, there were no fewer than six
manufacturers of flavored carbonated water in Philadelphia alone.
It soon spread to New York.
</P>
<P>
   After about 1850, other flavors began to appear.
</P>
<P>
   All in the name of health.
</P>
<P>
   Well, two other streams of history added to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that of brewing, which makes another beverage with
bubbles _ beer. When the yeast action is interrupted before it has
a chance to turn all the sugars into alcohol, the result is ``small
beer,'' and it has very little alcohol and a lot of bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Apple cider is one example, and, later, root beer became
another.
</P>
<P>
   The third stream of this story begins in the mountains of
eastern North America, where inhabitants often collected sassafras
roots to make a tea that was considered a ``spring tonic,'' and was
believed to help healing and get the sluggish inner organs working
fluently once again after a hard winter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874, the health-giving tea joined the small-beer yeast to
make another carbonated beverage that could be sold in the pharmacy
for its medicinal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought the three streams of history together was
Charles Hires, a New Jersey pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   He began, by the way, as a pharmacist in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On Independence Day, we celebrate the signing of the Declaration
of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776. But, as you see,
Philadelphia had a vital role also in the development of soft
drinks. I leave it to you to decide whether democracy or soda pop
is more American.
</P>
<P>
   Hires began experimenting in the 1870s with a carbonated drink
flavored with roots and berries. He tried juniper, pipsissewa,
spikenard, wintergreen, ginger, licorice, vanilla, hops and
sarsaparilla. But a tonic he had been given by a New Jersey woman _
the landlady of a vacation house he was renting _ put him on the
track of sassafras.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1876 Centennial Exhibition opened in _ where else? _
Philadelphia, Hires was there to begin selling his new beverage. It
caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, close to 2,000 brands of root beer have been sold.
Even now, there are close to 200. Although the popularity of root
beer has declined from its height and colas now dominate, the drink
still makes up about 3 percent of the $54 billion domestic
soft-drink market.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective: In 1993, A&AMP;W _ the most popular root
beer _ sold 53.5 million cases of root beer; the same year, Coke
unloaded 1.6 billion cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a lot of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   It did take a hit in 1960, though.
</P>
<P>
   The main flavoring ingredient in root beer was sassafras, and
the FDA discovered that one of the components of sassafras could
cause liver cancer in rats. The offending chemical is called
safrole, although it sounds much more baleful by its longer name,
4-allyl 1-1, 2-methylenedioxybenzene.
</P>
<P>
   It was potent enough to be used topically as a pediculicide, or
delousing bath, in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds worse than it is. A 200-pound man would have to drink
something like 24 gallons of root beer a day to reach the levels of
toxicity the lab rats endured.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, root-beer manufacturers had to find a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Some managed to remove the safrole from the oil. Others found
artificial flavoring replacements. Still others used substitutes
like wintergreen oil or birch bark.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer has always had an ambiguous relationship with
sarsaparilla.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sarsaparilla (begin ital) is (end ital)a root beer, but
made with the root of the Central American sarsaparilla plant
instead of the sassafras. Sassafras doesn't grow in the West. So a
replacement was found that was regionally suitable, and
sarsaparilla was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today's drink seems more like a wintergreen soda, but
manufacturers guard their proprietary recipes carefully and we
cannot know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   A related drink is made from birch bark _ or was _ and is called
birch beer. It has a similar flavor to sarsaparilla, partly because
it seems as if some modern birch beers are really wintergreen
sodas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cream'' sodas are vanilla flavored sodas, and some modern root
beers are so vanilla-heavy, it is hard to tell them from cream
sodas.
</P>
<P>
   A final bit of trivia: Men and women have different preferences
in taste. Men, it turns out, tend to like herbal and root flavors
more; women tend to like berry and fruit flavors. So root beer _
although it has fans in both genders _ tends to be a boy's drink.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, perfect to slosh down with a hot dog slathered in
mustard and onions. &QL;

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I come from a bunch of pretty typical New Yorkers, each of us
imbued with a healthy dose of self-importance, each of us convinced
that he or she is working harder and doing more than anyone else.
Consequently, orchestrating attendance at a midweek family
occasion, as I needed to do for my daughter's school play, can be
an act of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of filing legal papers close to deadline, I called
my parents' office to choose a train that would get them to us in
time for dinner and the show. They were in a meeting, and my mother
had little patience as I fumbled with the train schedule. I, in
turn, had little patience with her lack of patience, and we shared
tight-lipped exchanges as we selected a train.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all done, I sighed audibly and asked: ``Mother, do
you have any idea how burdensome it is sometimes to be your
daughter?'' Expecting an argument, I was shocked to hear her sigh
in return and ask: ``Sally, do you have any idea how burdensome it
is sometimes to be me?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I declared a truce.
</P>
<P>
   _SALLY WASSERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Laitin's 13-year-old grandson, Adam Curtis, lives in a
suburb of Washington and constantly complains to his grandfather
that he's a ``big city boy,'' living too far away from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Laitin asked him how he'd like to visit New York, and
Adam immediately listed the things he'd like to do there _ the
David Letterman show, F.A.O. Schwarz, and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art among them. The trip was arranged, and Laitin managed to
meet all the requests.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhausting weekend, the two were strolling crosstown on
West 57th Street when Adam summed up his visit. ``Grandpa,'' he
said. ``This is a town that could really keep up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Estelle Cohen and her husband were in a large bird store looking
for a gift for their son. After buying a feeder and a book on the
care of hummingbirds, they were told they should get a six-foot
pole to hang the feeder on. While Mrs. Cohen was paying, her
husband exclaimed, ``We can't take that pole, we're going on a
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a moment's hesitation, the woman behind them said,
``Just tell them you're a shepherd.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-haired lady with the fluffy white dog tucked under her
arm was pursuing a second dog that had obviously strayed. As she
looked hither and yon, she called out ``Sotheby. Sotheby.'' Michael
Zentman had no doubt about the name of the dog she was holding. It
had to be ``Christie.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Alterman was leaving a movie theater recently when he
encountered two women with stroller-age children. One woman was
holding both children as the other woman struggled with her
stroller. The struggling woman was becoming increasingly
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she burst out: ``You know, just because we have
maternal instincts doesn't mean we know how to operate strollers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those seriously rainy days that we've had in the
last few months and Steven Ng spent 20 minutes with his arm
outstretched, trying to get a taxi. Finally, a vacant cab appeared.
Ng shook himself off, checked the water content of his clothes,
settled in and spotted the medallion number: 2H2O.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women were taking their seats near the back row of the
Delacorte Theater for a performance of ``The Skin of Our Teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Christensen overheard the following conversation.
</P>
<P>
   First young woman: ``It's so far away from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Second young woman: ``That's OK. They talk loud in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   One: ``This isn't Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``Yes, it is. It's Shakespeare in the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   One (looking in program): ``But it says `by Thornton Wilder.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``He's the adapter. They've made it into a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not his original creation but Armen Khachaturian got a
laugh out of the dictum of his friend, Greg Monsees, to his four
children and their dog. Monsees is separated from his wife, and the
children's primary residence is with their mother.
</P>

   Re: Amy's Stolen Car
</P>
<P>
   1. If you don't have enough money for putting the car in a
parking garage, do not drive to New York.
</P>
<P>
   2. If it is absolutely impossible for me to help you until the
next morning, do not call in the middle of the night. I seem to do
my best sleeping at 3:45 a.m. and
</P>
<P>
   3. If you do call, please do not begin with the phrase, ``Dad
I'm not calling you at this hour of the night with good news.''
I've already made that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Dad
</P>
<P>
   A message from a guidance counselor at a prestigious suburban
school asked that Phyllis Bocian get in touch as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian returned the call almost immediately. A woman with a
foreign accent answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``Marion Benson, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end: ``She isn't in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``May I have her voice mail?''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end (after small pause): ``He isn't here
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Glick was reminded recently of the day some years ago when
she had to go to work but two friends, one a visitor from Oregon
and the other a New Yorker, went to the Statue of Liberty. The two,
who had had some experience mountain climbing, decided to walk up
the stairs to the top. The Oregonian reached the top first and saw
a group of people drinking champagne.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the New York reward for climbing, she thought, and
politely asked, ``May I have one?'' She had just received her drink
when the New York friend joined her and was promptly advised to go
over and also claim her reward.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker did as suggested and also received a glass of
champagne but she suspected that the champagne wasn't a climbing
reward.
</P>
<P>
   She inquired of the group and was told that they were Russians
who had waited for years for permission to come to the United
States. They promised each other that when they got to America,
they would go to the top of the Statue of Liberty and drink
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG GAME HUNTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A big-game hunter went on safari with his wife and
mother-in-law. One evening, while still deep in the jungle, the Mrs
awoke to find her mother gone. Rushing to her husband, she insisted
on them both trying to find her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter picked up his rifle, took a swig of whiskey, and
started to look for her.
</P>
<P>
   In a clearing not far from the camp, they came upon a chilling
sight: the mother-in-law was backed up against a thick,
impenetrable bush, and a large male lion stood facing her.
</P>
<P>
   The wife said, `What are we going to do?`
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing,` said the hunter, `The lion got himself into this
mess, let him get himself out of it.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAGGY GUIDE DOG STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `We will not have him put down. Lucky is basically a damn good
guide dog,` Ernst Gerber, a dog trainer from Wuppertal told
reporters. `He just needs a little brush-up on some elementary
skills, that's all.`
</P>
<P>
   Gerber admitted to the press conference that Lucky, a German
shepherd guide- dog for the blind, had so far been responsible for
the deaths of all four of his previous owners. `I admit it's not an
impressive record on paper. He led his first owner in front of a
bus, and the second off the end of a pier. He actually pushed his
third owner off a railway platform just as the Cologne-to-
Frankfurt express was approaching, and he walked his fourth owner
into heavy traffic, before abandoning him and running away to
safety. But, apart from epileptic fits, he has a lovely
temperament. And guide dogs are difficult to train these days.`
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lucky's fifth owner would be told about his previous
record, Gerber replied: `No. It would make them nervous, and would
make Lucky nervous. And when Lucky gets nervous he's liable to do
something silly.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY MORMONS ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Jew, a Catholic and a Mormon were having lunch together after
a business meeting. The Jew, bragging on his virility, said, `I
have four sons. One more and I'll have a basketball team.`
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic, pooh-poohed this accomplishment, stating, `That's
nothing, boy. I have 10 sons, one more and I'll have a football
team.`
</P>
<P>
   To which the Mormon replied, `You fellas ain't got a clue. I
have 17 wives. One more and I'll have a golf course.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YUP, ANOTHER BLONDE JOKE ..  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three women are about to be executed. One's a brunette, one's a
redhead and one's a blonde.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the brunette forward and the executioner asks
if she has any last requests. She says no and the executioner
shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the brunette yells, `EARTHQUAKE!` Everyone is startled
and looks around as the brunette escapes.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the redhead forward and the executioner asks if
she has any last requests. She say no and the executioner shouts,
`Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the redhead yells, `TORNADO!` Once again, everyone is
startled and looks around, while the redhead silently slips away.
</P>
<P>
   By now the blonde has it all figured out, and the guard brings
her forward. The executioner asks if she has any last requests, she
says no and the executioner shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...` and the
blonde yells, `FIRE!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIRLINE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some actual humorous statements by several airline
flights crews. Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to
make the `in-flight safety lecture` a bit more entertaining:
</P>
<P>
   `As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables
and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable
position.`
</P>
<P>
   `There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4
ways out of this airplane...`
</P>
<P>
   `Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event
of an emergency water landing, please take them with our
compliments.`
</P>
<P>
   `We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must
smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you
to the wing of the airplane.`
</P>
<P>
   `Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught
smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane
immediately.`
</P>
<P>
   `Good morning. As we leave Dallas, it's warm, the sun is
shining, and the birds are singing. We are going to Charlotte,
where it's dark, windy and raining. Why in the world y'all wanna go
there I really don't know.`
</P>
<P>
   Pilot: `Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I
am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about
as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's
a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the
flight pattern.`
</P>
<P>
   Pilot _ `Folks, if you were with us last week, we never got
around to mentioning that it was National Procrastination Day. If
you get a chance this week, please try to celebrate it. If you
can't get to it, then maybe try to do it at the weekend, but no big
rush. Have a nice day.`
</P>
<P>
   And, after landing: `Thank you for flying Delta Business
Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we
enjoyed taking you for a ride.`
</P>
<P>
   `Last one off the plane must clean it.`
</P>
<P>
   `If you are so lucky to be traveling with small children...`
</P>
<P>
   And from the pilot during his welcome message: `We are pleased
to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry...
Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...`!

GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS A BOON TO NEW YORK GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
 BNY-ECONOMY-HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN D. ABBEY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New Yorkers are feeling better about the state's
economy than they have in years, a new survey says, and that should
bode well for Gov. George Pataki and other incumbents on Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted for the Albany Times Union and Syracuse
Newspapers earlier this month by Zogby International, a Utica-based
independent polling firm, shows that New Yorkers feel better off
financially than they did last summer. It also says they are
strongly optimistic about the state's future and expect their
personal economic circumstances to remain steady or improve in the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The results, according to pollster John Zogby and other experts,
is that the Republican governor should be able to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a good year for an incumbent,'' Zogby said.
``Where is the mandate for change? Among those who say they were
worse off, there isn't any anger and focus. It's really going to be
difficult for a nonincumbent party because of two things: To some
degree people are lowering expectations, and there are also lower
expectations for government.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``All in all, it doesn't spell a good year to
challenge the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of those surveyed said they were better off
financially than they were four years ago. That's up by several
points on the positive side from a Zogby poll last August. Only
half as many, 15 percent, said they were worse off. That's down
from a 22 percent negative feeling last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 69 percent of the Zogby survey respondents said they were
optimistic about the state's future, with only 20 percent
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Frank Mauro, executive director of Fiscal
Policy Institute in Latham, a research office funded by organized
labor and religious groups, said the good feelings were no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been happening in New York since November 1992 _ when
we hit bottom _ has been a meager recovery under (Gov. Mario) Cuomo
and Pataki,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year of the Pataki administration, there was a lot
of government downsizing, a lot of people retired and they were
weaned from the work force,'' Mauro said. ``The situation now is of
steady job growth. It's understandable that people are feeling
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Mauro, a regular critic of the Pataki administration,
that recovery has been sluggish, has failed to repeat past
increases in employment, represents increases in income more than
in jobs, is heavily weighted toward downstate financial employment
and would have occurred with or without Pataki in office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``tells governors and
mayors they will be blamed for the rain, so they may as well take
credit for the sunshine,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pataki administration did not respond to
questions about the survey. Administration officials regularly,
however, take credit for job growth and creation in New York and
are active around the state offering grants and loans to companies
to relocate, grow or remain in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration has said its business-friendly
policies have been responsible for continued private-sector job
growth in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Few people surveyed by Zogby said they feared they or a family
member would lose a job in the near future. The June total, 14
percent, is down from 21 percent a year ago. Similarly, only 13
percent reported working at a lower-paying job than their previous
one, down from 17 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent said they had lost their job due to downsizing or
a company leaving New York, down from 14 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good feelings, Mauro said that New York has yet to
reach its historic 1989 peak in employment. Total job count in the
state topped out at 8.3 million that year, and is now at 8.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   He said that economic weakness in western New York and widening
income disparities between the highest- and lowest-paid New Yorkers
could cause Pataki's glow to fade.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little to suggest that the overall economic picture
in New York will change substantially between now and the Nov. 3
election. Echoing pollster Zogby's point, Mauro said that unless
something cataclysmic happens, Pataki is likely to reap the
benefits of a sunny economy come Election Day.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I come from a bunch of pretty typical New Yorkers, each of us
imbued with a healthy dose of self-importance, each of us convinced
that he or she is working harder and doing more than anyone else.
Consequently, orchestrating attendance at a midweek family
occasion, as I needed to do for my daughter's school play, can be
an act of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of filing legal papers close to deadline, I called
my parents' office to choose a train that would get them to us in
time for dinner and the show. They were in a meeting, and my mother
had little patience as I fumbled with the train schedule. I, in
turn, had little patience with her lack of patience, and we shared
tight-lipped exchanges as we selected a train.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all done, I sighed audibly and asked: ``Mother, do
you have any idea how burdensome it is sometimes to be your
daughter?'' Expecting an argument, I was shocked to hear her sigh
in return and ask: ``Sally, do you have any idea how burdensome it
is sometimes to be me?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I declared a truce.
</P>
<P>
   _SALLY WASSERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Laitin's 13-year-old grandson, Adam Curtis, lives in a
suburb of Washington and constantly complains to his grandfather
that he's a ``big city boy,'' living too far away from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Laitin asked him how he'd like to visit New York, and
Adam immediately listed the things he'd like to do there _ the
David Letterman show, F.A.O. Schwarz, and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art among them. The trip was arranged, and Laitin managed to
meet all the requests.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhausting weekend, the two were strolling crosstown on
West 57th Street when Adam summed up his visit. ``Grandpa,'' he
said. ``This is a town that could really keep up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Estelle Cohen and her husband were in a large bird store looking
for a gift for their son. After buying a feeder and a book on the
care of hummingbirds, they were told they should get a six-foot
pole to hang the feeder on. While Mrs. Cohen was paying, her
husband exclaimed, ``We can't take that pole, we're going on a
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a moment's hesitation, the woman behind them said,
``Just tell them you're a shepherd.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-haired lady with the fluffy white dog tucked under her
arm was pursuing a second dog that had obviously strayed. As she
looked hither and yon, she called out ``Sotheby. Sotheby.'' Michael
Zentman had no doubt about the name of the dog she was holding. It
had to be ``Christie.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Alterman was leaving a movie theater recently when he
encountered two women with stroller-age children. One woman was
holding both children as the other woman struggled with her
stroller. The struggling woman was becoming increasingly
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she burst out: ``You know, just because we have
maternal instincts doesn't mean we know how to operate strollers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those seriously rainy days that we've had in the
last few months and Steven Ng spent 20 minutes with his arm
outstretched, trying to get a taxi. Finally, a vacant cab appeared.
Ng shook himself off, checked the water content of his clothes,
settled in and spotted the medallion number: 2H2O.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women were taking their seats near the back row of the
Delacorte Theater for a performance of ``The Skin of Our Teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Christensen overheard the following conversation.
</P>
<P>
   First young woman: ``It's so far away from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Second young woman: ``That's OK. They talk loud in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   One: ``This isn't Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``Yes, it is. It's Shakespeare in the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   One (looking in program): ``But it says `by Thornton Wilder.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``He's the adapter. They've made it into a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not his original creation but Armen Khachaturian got a
laugh out of the dictum of his friend, Greg Monsees, to his four
children and their dog. Monsees is separated from his wife, and the
children's primary residence is with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   His communique:
</P>
<P>
   Re: Amy's Stolen Car
</P>
<P>
   1. If you don't have enough money for putting the car in a
parking garage, do not drive to New York.
</P>
<P>
   2. If it is absolutely impossible for me to help you until the
next morning, do not call in the middle of the night. I seem to do
my best sleeping at 3:45 a.m. and
</P>
<P>
   3. If you do call, please do not begin with the phrase, ``Dad
I'm not calling you at this hour of the night with good news.''
I've already made that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Dad
</P>
<P>
   A message from a guidance counselor at a prestigious suburban
school asked that Phyllis Bocian get in touch as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian returned the call almost immediately. A woman with a
foreign accent answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``Marion Benson, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end: ``She isn't in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``May I have her voice mail?''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end (after small pause): ``He isn't here
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Glick was reminded recently of the day some years ago when
she had to go to work but two friends, one a visitor from Oregon
and the other a New Yorker, went to the Statue of Liberty. The two,
who had had some experience mountain climbing, decided to walk up
the stairs to the top. The Oregonian reached the top first and saw
a group of people drinking champagne.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the New York reward for climbing, she thought, and
politely asked, ``May I have one?'' She had just received her drink
when the New York friend joined her and was promptly advised to go
over and also claim her reward.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker did as suggested and also received a glass of
champagne but she suspected that the champagne wasn't a climbing
reward.
</P>
<P>
   She inquired of the group and was told that they were Russians
who had waited for years for permission to come to the United
States. They promised each other that when they got to America,
they would go to the top of the Statue of Liberty and drink
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG GAME HUNTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A big-game hunter went on safari with his wife and
mother-in-law. One evening, while still deep in the jungle, the Mrs
awoke to find her mother gone. Rushing to her husband, she insisted
on them both trying to find her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter picked up his rifle, took a swig of whiskey, and
started to look for her.
</P>
<P>
   In a clearing not far from the camp, they came upon a chilling
sight: the mother-in-law was backed up against a thick,
impenetrable bush, and a large male lion stood facing her.
</P>
<P>
   The wife said, `What are we going to do?`
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing,` said the hunter, `The lion got himself into this
mess, let him get himself out of it.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAGGY GUIDE DOG STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `We will not have him put down. Lucky is basically a damn good
guide dog,` Ernst Gerber, a dog trainer from Wuppertal told
reporters. `He just needs a little brush-up on some elementary
skills, that's all.`
</P>
<P>
   Gerber admitted to the press conference that Lucky, a German
shepherd guide- dog for the blind, had so far been responsible for
the deaths of all four of his previous owners. `I admit it's not an
impressive record on paper. He led his first owner in front of a
bus, and the second off the end of a pier. He actually pushed his
third owner off a railway platform just as the Cologne-to-
Frankfurt express was approaching, and he walked his fourth owner
into heavy traffic, before abandoning him and running away to
safety. But, apart from epileptic fits, he has a lovely
temperament. And guide dogs are difficult to train these days.`
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lucky's fifth owner would be told about his previous
record, Gerber replied: `No. It would make them nervous, and would
make Lucky nervous. And when Lucky gets nervous he's liable to do
something silly.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY MORMONS ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Jew, a Catholic and a Mormon were having lunch together after
a business meeting. The Jew, bragging on his virility, said, `I
have four sons. One more and I'll have a basketball team.`
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic, pooh-poohed this accomplishment, stating, `That's
nothing, boy. I have 10 sons, one more and I'll have a football
team.`
</P>
<P>
   To which the Mormon replied, `You fellas ain't got a clue. I
have 17 wives. One more and I'll have a golf course.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YUP, ANOTHER BLONDE JOKE ..  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three women are about to be executed. One's a brunette, one's a
redhead and one's a blonde.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the brunette forward and the executioner asks
if she has any last requests. She says no and the executioner
shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the brunette yells, `EARTHQUAKE!` Everyone is startled
and looks around as the brunette escapes.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the redhead forward and the executioner asks if
she has any last requests. She say no and the executioner shouts,
`Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the redhead yells, `TORNADO!` Once again, everyone is
startled and looks around, while the redhead silently slips away.
</P>
<P>
   By now the blonde has it all figured out, and the guard brings
her forward. The executioner asks if she has any last requests, she
says no and the executioner shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...` and the
blonde yells, `FIRE!`
</P>
<P>

   I come from a bunch of pretty typical New Yorkers, each of us
imbued with a healthy dose of self-importance, each of us convinced
that he or she is working harder and doing more than anyone else.
Consequently, orchestrating attendance at a midweek family
occasion, as I needed to do for my daughter's school play, can be
an act of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of filing legal papers close to deadline, I called
my parents' office to choose a train that would get them to us in
time for dinner and the show. They were in a meeting, and my mother
had little patience as I fumbled with the train schedule. I, in
turn, had little patience with her lack of patience, and we shared
tight-lipped exchanges as we selected a train.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all done, I sighed audibly and asked: ``Mother, do
you have any idea how burdensome it is sometimes to be your
daughter?'' Expecting an argument, I was shocked to hear her sigh
in return and ask: ``Sally, do you have any idea how burdensome it
is sometimes to be me?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I declared a truce.

   Joseph Laitin's 13-year-old grandson, Adam Curtis, lives in a
suburb of Washington and constantly complains to his grandfather
that he's a ``big city boy,'' living too far away from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Laitin asked him how he'd like to visit New York, and
Adam immediately listed the things he'd like to do there _ the
David Letterman show, F.A.O. Schwarz, and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art among them. The trip was arranged, and Laitin managed to
meet all the requests.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhausting weekend, the two were strolling crosstown on
West 57th Street when Adam summed up his visit. ``Grandpa,'' he
said. ``This is a town that could really keep up with me.''

   Estelle Cohen and her husband were in a large bird store looking
for a gift for their son. After buying a feeder and a book on the
care of hummingbirds, they were told they should get a six-foot
pole to hang the feeder on. While Mrs. Cohen was paying, her
husband exclaimed, ``We can't take that pole, we're going on a
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a moment's hesitation, the woman behind them said,
``Just tell them you're a shepherd.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-haired lady with the fluffy white dog tucked under her
arm was pursuing a second dog that had obviously strayed. As she
looked hither and yon, she called out ``Sotheby. Sotheby.'' Michael
Zentman had no doubt about the name of the dog she was holding. It
had to be ``Christie.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Alterman was leaving a movie theater recently when he
encountered two women with stroller-age children. One woman was
holding both children as the other woman struggled with her
stroller. The struggling woman was becoming increasingly
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she burst out: ``You know, just because we have
maternal instincts doesn't mean we know how to operate strollers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those seriously rainy days that we've had in the
last few months and Steven Ng spent 20 minutes with his arm
outstretched, trying to get a taxi. Finally, a vacant cab appeared.
Ng shook himself off, checked the water content of his clothes,
settled in and spotted the medallion number: 2H2O.

   First young woman: ``It's so far away from the stage.

   Second young woman: ``That's OK. They talk loud in

   One: ``This isn't Shakespeare.''

   1. If you don't have enough money for putting the car in a
parking garage, do not drive to New York.

next morning, do not call in the middle of the night. I seem to do
my best sleeping at 3:45 a.m. and

   A message from a guidance counselor at a prestigious suburban

   Selma Glick was reminded recently of the day some years ago when
she had to go to work but two friends, one a visitor from Oregon
and the other a New Yorker, went to the Statue of Liberty. The two,
who had had some experience mountain climbing, decided to walk up
the stairs to the top. The Oregonian reached the top first and saw
a group of people drinking champagne.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the New York reward for climbing, she thought, and
politely asked, ``May I have one?'' She had just received her drink
when the New York friend joined her and was promptly advised to go
over and also claim her reward.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker did as suggested and also received a glass of
champagne but she suspected that the champagne wasn't a climbing
reward.
</P>
<P>
   She inquired of the group and was told that they were Russians
who had waited for years for permission to come to the United
States. They promised each other that when they got to America,
they would go to the top of the Statue of Liberty and drink
champagne.

<P>
   &UR; BIG GAME HUNTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A big-game hunter went on safari with his wife and
mother-in-law. One evening, while still deep in the jungle, the Mrs
awoke to find her mother gone. Rushing to her husband, she insisted
on them both trying to find her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The hunter picked up his rifle, took a swig of whiskey, and
started to look for her.
</P>
<P>
   In a clearing not far from the camp, they came upon a chilling
sight: the mother-in-law was backed up against a thick,
impenetrable bush, and a large male lion stood facing her.
</P>
<P>
   The wife said, `What are we going to do?`
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing,` said the hunter, `The lion got himself into this
mess, let him get himself out of it.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAGGY GUIDE DOG STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `We will not have him put down. Lucky is basically a damn good
guide dog,` Ernst Gerber, a dog trainer from Wuppertal told
reporters. `He just needs a little brush-up on some elementary
skills, that's all.`
</P>
<P>
   Gerber admitted to the press conference that Lucky, a German
shepherd guide- dog for the blind, had so far been responsible for
the deaths of all four of his previous owners. `I admit it's not an
impressive record on paper. He led his first owner in front of a
bus, and the second off the end of a pier. He actually pushed his
third owner off a railway platform just as the Cologne-to-
Frankfurt express was approaching, and he walked his fourth owner
into heavy traffic, before abandoning him and running away to
safety. But, apart from epileptic fits, he has a lovely
temperament. And guide dogs are difficult to train these days.`
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lucky's fifth owner would be told about his previous
record, Gerber replied: `No. It would make them nervous, and would
make Lucky nervous. And when Lucky gets nervous he's liable to do
something silly.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE CRAZY MORMONS ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Jew, a Catholic and a Mormon were having lunch together after
a business meeting. The Jew, bragging on his virility, said, `I
have four sons. One more and I'll have a basketball team.`
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic, pooh-poohed this accomplishment, stating, `That's
nothing, boy. I have 10 sons, one more and I'll have a football
team.`
</P>
<P>
   To which the Mormon replied, `You fellas ain't got a clue. I
have 17 wives. One more and I'll have a golf course.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YUP, ANOTHER BLONDE JOKE ..  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three women are about to be executed. One's a brunette, one's a
redhead and one's a blonde.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the brunette forward and the executioner asks
if she has any last requests. She says no and the executioner
shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the brunette yells, `EARTHQUAKE!` Everyone is startled
and looks around as the brunette escapes.
</P>
<P>
   The guard brings the redhead forward and the executioner asks if
she has any last requests. She say no and the executioner shouts,
`Ready! ... Aim! ...`
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the redhead yells, `TORNADO!` Once again, everyone is
startled and looks around, while the redhead silently slips away.
</P>
<P>
   By now the blonde has it all figured out, and the guard brings
her forward. The executioner asks if she has any last requests, she
says no and the executioner shouts, `Ready! ... Aim! ...` and the
blonde yells, `FIRE!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIRLINE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some actual humorous statements by several airline
flights crews. Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to
make the `in-flight safety lecture` a bit more entertaining:
</P>
<P>
   `As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables
and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable
position.`
</P>
<P>
   `There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4
ways out of this airplane...`
</P>
<P>
   `Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event
of an emergency water landing, please take them with our
compliments.`
</P>
<P>
   `We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must
smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you
to the wing of the airplane.`
</P>
<P>
   `Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught
smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane
immediately.`
</P>
<P>
   `Good morning. As we leave Dallas, it's warm, the sun is
shining, and the birds are singing. We are going to Charlotte,
where it's dark, windy and raining. Why in the world y'all wanna go
there I really don't know.`
</P>
<P>
   Pilot: `Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I
am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about
as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's
a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the
flight pattern.`
</P>
<P>
   Pilot _ `Folks, if you were with us last week, we never got
around to mentioning that it was National Procrastination Day. If
you get a chance this week, please try to celebrate it. If you
can't get to it, then maybe try to do it at the weekend, but no big
rush. Have a nice day.`
</P>
<P>
   And, after landing: `Thank you for flying Delta Business
Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we
enjoyed taking you for a ride.`
</P>
<P>
   `Last one off the plane must clean it.`
</P>
<P>
   `If you are so lucky to be traveling with small children...`
</P>
<P>
   And from the pilot during his welcome message: `We are pleased
to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry...
Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...`!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists now think birds descended from dinosaurs. I think
that's true. Look how fast 'Godzilla' flew out of the theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``12,000 fires are burning out of control in Florida. In fact,
senior citizens are fleeing Miami at speeds of up to 10 miles an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a great night last night. I really slept. I slept like an
airline pilot at 30,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Siskel is recovering from brain surgery. Who would have
guessed by looking at the two of them that Ebert was the healthy
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one movie was 'The X-Files.' David Duchovny and
Gillian Anderson play two government officials who don't have sex
and believe there is a giant conspiracy out there. Actually, it's
based on Bill and Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the second straight day, John and Patricia Ramsey
voluntarily met with Boulder, Colorado officials and afterward they
complained about mistreatment by the police. The limo was late, the
oysters were not chilled enough, police served the wrong wine with
dinner. Just a travesty.''

SIZING UP THE MANY ROOT BEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Comparing root beers is like comparing apples and
oranges. Because there is not one thing that is root beer, but a
whole family of things, I subdivided the category into six
sections.
</P>
<P>
   The process of tasting is much like that of comparing wines. You
pour the cold drink into a glass and watch its head. Some root
beers are stronger on foam; others fizz like colas. Only one _
Henry Weinhard _ had a head that lasted to the end of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Then you hold the glass under your nose and wiggle it, sloshing
around the beverage. Some had decided ``nose,'' others really
didn't smell like anything. Most had a decided vanilla odor.
</P>
<P>
   A small taste comes next, swishing it around in your mouth to
get at all the contrasting flavors. You try to separate the
component parts, although in most cases nowadays, the only thing
you find is that the basic flavor tastes artificial rather than
vegetative. That isn't necessarily bad, if the flavor is pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most important diagnostically, you swallow, inhale
and feel for an aftertaste, looking for those aromatic, herby
flavors that shade the character of basic taste.
</P>
<P>
   The best root beers had good foam, a slight aroma, a solid
sassafras taste (even if artificial), and an interesting, lingering
herbal afterlife at the back of the palate.
</P>
<P>
   We bought examples of every root beer we could find in Arizona,
save only those ``home-brewed'' by local establishments, and not
available in stores. In the end, there were 20 different brands we
tried.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope, please: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream
</P>
<P>
   These are the buy-at-the-store brands that most people can find.
They are uniformly good.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tie for best in the category between Hires and Dad's.
Hires is the standard for ``regular'' root beer, but Dad's, with
its stronger hint of licorice, has a more individual flavor. Both
also scored high with foam, body and aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's and IBC were also strong contenders and some people
strongly prefer them to the previous two. The falloff, if any, is
minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;W, the bestselling root beer, is acceptable, but bland, and
with a heavy vanilla flavor. It is a long way from the franchise
A&AMP;W root beer that used to be sold in the root-beer stands in those
paper containers that were halfway between cups and Chinese takeout
food cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the grocery store repackagings, sold for bargain prices,
compare well with the mainstream brands. Trader Joe's root beer,
sold in cans and bottles, ranked high, although the two versions
tasted slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pirate's Keg tasted OK, but it has caffeine and is,
therefore, disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty
</P>
<P>
   Some call them microbrew, some call them premium, but they cost
more and you don't always get better quality for your expense.
</P>
<P>
   The clear winner is Henry Weinhard. It has the least traditional
flavor, heavily influenced by the honey used to flavor it, but the
flavor it has is better than anything else we tested. It has a
molasses-edged darkness to its taste and a head that lasted longer
than any other testee.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil's is an English brand with an obviously herbal taste.
Nutmeg, anise and wintergreen are mentioned on the label. Some
people like it a lot; others complain that it is not really root
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kemper is fine, but tastes much like a mainstream root
beer and had nothing to separate it from the pack except the extra
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mystic Seaport, however, was very bad, with a heavy medicinal
flavor, like a carbonated throat lozenge. It is said to contain
camomile, ginger and tarragon and tastes like a liquid salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate''
</P>
<P>
   When Pepsi and Coke get their corporate hands on a product, they
put all the money into marketing, not enough into product.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi sells Mug root beer, which is not actually objectionable,
but is one of the blandest of the tested products.
</P>
<P>
   And Barq's, sold by Coca-Cola, is disqualified for two reasons:
It isn't really a root beer, despite the label puffery that claims
it is ``Good Old Tyme Root Beer.'' It was invented, like Coke, Dr
Pepper or Moxie, to be (begin ital) sui generis. (end ital) No one
claimed it was a root beer until 1995, when Coke took over and
couldn't figure out how to market it. It tastes like a combination
cola and root drink, with a little Dr Pepper fruitiness thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   But worse, it contains caffeine, and nothing with caffeine is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sarsaparillas
</P>
<P>
   Sarsaparilla is a variety of root beer, invented in the West,
where sassafras, which formed the basis for root beer, didn't grow.
The root of the sarsaparilla plant, native to Central America, was
substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the current sarsaparillas actually contain
sarsaparilla root is questionable: All their formulas are
proprietary and they aren't saying. But the three brands we tested
all had a strong wintergreen taste.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux City Sarsaparilla was the winner. It pours out red into
the glass, fizzes nicely, has what wine drinkers call ``a good
nose,'' and a complex flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ol' Bob Miller was similar, but a little sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   And Mystic Seaport was overpoweringly sweet, with a strong honey
flavor. Its label declares vanilla, anise, cassia and wintergreen
as the flavoring agents, but the sweetness drowns it all out. Like
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Birch beers
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell the difference between most birch beers and
sarsaparillas. They all have a wintergreen taste. We tasted two
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux City was good and poured out red, like the sarsaparilla.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kemper was clear, an unusual look in the glass, and had a
more subtle taste, which means, though, it had less taste.
</P>
<P>
   Cream sodas
</P>
<P>
   These are vanilla flavored sodas, without the herbal additions
of classic root beers. This category gave us our best taste and the
only completely undrinkable product we bought.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Weinhard Vanilla Cream soda is one of the best-flavored
products on the market. I don't know what they do to it that makes
it different from other cream sodas _ the label claims different
varieties of vanilla bean _ but it works. The stuff is nearly
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;W cream soda was disqualified, not on account of taste, which
is acceptable and middle of the road, but because it quietly and
unannounced sneaks in caffeine. Be warned, if you are
caffeine-sensitive, A&AMP;W cream soda will keep you up and jittery.
</P>
<P>
   And Mystic Seaport Cream Ale was wretched. It had a strong odor,
was way, way too sweet, and had an aftertaste of burned coconut. It
was like drinking liquid Twinkies filling, but with an off-taste.
Nobody who I shared it with could stand it, and some had to rinse
their mouths out. &QL;

FRENCH PLAN TO BUY AMERICAN CENTER'S PARIS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When the new American Center here was inaugurated by
Hillary Rodham Clinton in June 1994, the $41 million building
designed by Frank Gehry looked set to become a hothouse of American
artistic creativity. Instead, barely 19 months later, the center
suspended its activities for lack of funds and its only remaining
asset, its ultramodern headquarters in eastern Paris, was put up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The American Center as such survived as a legal entity, but it
could do nothing until it had sold the Gehry building. And for the
best part of 30 months, it stood empty. Tuesday, the search for a
buyer finally ended when France's Ministry of Culture announced
that it planned to acquire the building and turn it into a new
Maison du Cinema, housing a film library and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal becomes final in the coming weeks, as expected, it
will conclude the most painful and embarrassing chapter in the
center's 67-year history and the beginning of a new era in which
the revenues from the sale will be used to create a fund to promote
American culture. But no longer will there be a physical location
where American and French students and artists can gather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that Frank Gehry's exciting state-of-the-art
building will continue to be a place of access, openness and
community for cultural affairs,'' the American Center's chairman,
Frederick B. Henry, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``We can
also now prepare to continue the center's mission of supporting
cultural, educational and artistic activities.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials refused to give the exact purchase price,
noting that the deal still required approval by the French
equivalent of the General Services Administration in the United
States, although they estimated the cost of buying and adapting the
building at around $34 million. They estimated the cost of
renovating the building alone at about $13 million, which would
place the proposed purchase price at close to $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million difference between the original cost of the
Gehry building and its current market value is the price that the
American Center has paid for its decision in the mid-1980s to sell
its run-down but popular Left Bank home on the Boulevard Raspail
and construct an entirely new headquarters. Its mistake was to
spend almost all its money on the new building and to count on
donations to finance the $6 million annual cost of running it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after it opened, the center realized it was hard-pressed
for cash and was unable to pay an outstanding $3.4 million debt to
the Paris city government. It mounted a campaign for contributions
from American corporations with interests in France, but almost no
new money was forthcoming. Last December, thanks to a loan from the
New York-based Bohen Foundation, which Henry also leads, the center
was finally able to settle its debt with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said the center's board had already begun studying how it
should use its new fund to promote cultural activities. ``The board
has made no final decision,'' he said, ``but our inclination is to
seek a broader constituency than in the past. For example, we may
make grants, which would be reactive, but we may also be more
proactive by forming partnerships with other organizations. We're
considering different models.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has had enough cash to maintain the Gehry building
since its closing in February 1996. Marc Nicholas, a senior
official from the National Center of Cinematography who was
involved in selecting the building, said that it can be adapted for
use as the Maison du Cinema more quickly and more cheaply than
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that it will become a house of culture,'' said
Marie-Claude Beaud, the center's last director, who now runs the
Museum of Decorative Arts here. ``Far better than some of the
alternatives that were discussed, like turning it into the
headquarters of the Gaullist party or a tribunal to judge terrorist
cases or even a Soccer Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Moreno, who heads the Ministry of Culture's building
office, said that Gehry had been consulted about changes that might
be carried out by a different architect before the Maison du Cinema
opens in 2000. ``Gehry said he was happy that the building will
recover a cultural role, its original function,'' Moreno added.

POLL SHOWS NEW YORKERS PREFER EDUCATION, TREATMENT OVER NEW
PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACEY TULLY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Given a blank check, New Yorkers would spend more
to improve mass transit, education and health care. They are also
willing to pay higher prices for milk to help struggling dairy
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not anxious to boost funding for welfare or build
new prisons, according to a recent Zogby International poll
commissioned by the Albany Times Union and Syracuse Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the recent survey of 703 likely voters suggests the
electorate is feeling generous, both with the state's bank account
and in their own attitudes toward rehabilitating convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the attention that came with Gov. George
Pataki's strong but unsuccessful push to delay parole for
first-time violent offenders, the public appears convinced that
longer sentences are only part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of every four people questioned agreed with Pataki and
would like to eliminate parole for inmates convicted of violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly as many also said the state should send drug
offenders to treatment programs rather than build new prisons. And
slightly more than 70 percent said New York should restore prison
programs designed to provide inmates with educational opportunities
and job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand that building more prisons does not reduce
crime,'' Peter Slocum, a spokesman and policy adviser to the
Democratic minority in the state Senate, said in response to the
poll results. ``This is common-sense stuff and the people
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenna's Law, which was named for slain Albany nursing student
Jenna Grieshaber, would have blocked the parole board from
releasing violent felons before they had served 85 percent of their
sentences and added a post-release supervisory period. A compromise
version of the bill _ which did not include increased drug
treatment or educational programs _ died in the Assembly this year.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed 70 percent of the public in favor of drug
treatment over stiff sentences, and the results also would appear
to bode well for those who support changes in the Rockefeller-era
drug laws, which impose harsh, mandatory prison terms on drug
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group is evaluating the 25-year-old laws with an
eye toward convincing the Legislature and governor to make changes
to the legislation that is frequently cited as a primary reason for
prison overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that judges that should be given discretion and more
effort should be put into rehabilitation rather than strictly
incarceration,'' said former state Sen. Warren Anderson, who was
the Senate majority leader when the laws were enacted in 1973.
Although he supported the laws then, he now believes they are
outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that at some point the Legislature and the governor
will move in the direction that we've been encouraging,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appeared split on other controversial issues debated
during the legislative session that ended just over a week ago. It
was a draw, for example, over whether New York should permit casino
gambling on non-Indian lands. Of those questioned, half said they
supported casino gambling, while an equal number said they were
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   A measure that would have started the lengthy process of placing
a casino gambling question on the ballot passed the Assembly this
month, but failed to reach a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed also appeared ambivalent over the governor's
decision to veto $1.6 billion in spending and borrowing from the
1998-99 fiscal year budget, an indication that the message
Democratic candidates for governor have been attempting to spread
is either not being heard or not being understood.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor did use his veto power to make some cuts, the
election-year budget Pataki proposed and approved increases state
spending by 9.8 percent, more than three times the inflation rate.
It also creates budget deficits of between $3.75 billion and $4.8
billion in 2001, depending on whether it is the governor or the
comptroller who is counting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, has led a
campaign to criticize Pataki's vetoes and Democratic candidates
also have seized on the opportunity to try to cast the Republican
governor as uncaring. The message has not, apparently, gotten
through.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results show that 20.5 percent of those questioned said
Pataki was right to use his veto power, while 36.7 percent said he
was wrong. But an even larger percentage _ 38.8 percent _ said they
did not have enough information to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The sample group did appear to have strong attitudes on new
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no built-in rejection to spending this year,''
pollster John Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   But observers cautioned that it is not unusual for voters to
support new or enhanced programs, yet balk when it comes to paying
for them. The poll question did not ask whether people would
support new spending even if it meant a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the programs, but if you ask them if they want the
taxes, they'll say, `No.' And most people are more motivated on the
tax issue,'' said Harry Spector, a spokesman for Assembly Minority
Leader John Faso, R-Kinderhook.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rein, a researcher with the Citizens Budget Commission, a
non-partisan and nonprofit budget watchdog group, said it was more
accurate to interpret the poll results as a vote for more
responsive and efficient government, not increased spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the abstract, everything else being equal, there's a lot of
things people want to spend money on,'' Rein said. ``They're
dissatisfied with a lot of the services they get, and there's
always an impulse: Spend more money. But what we believe you need
to do is increase efficiencies and with the same amount of money
get more bang for your buck.''

SCRAPING AWAY AT THE `BLACK LEGEND' OF A SPANISH KING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL, Spain _ King Philip II not only lost
the invincible Armada in 1588 while trying to invade England but
also sunk in most history books, as the epitome of the cruelty and
intolerance associated with imperial Spain.
</P>
<P>
   He promoted Catholicism at sword point against Protestants and
Turks. His armies at their zenith controlled the largest empire of
the era, a swath of territory so vast, from Europe to Asia to the
Americas, that yes, the sun never set upon it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, on the 400th anniversary of his death, the government
has organized three major art exhibitions to portray a different
side of Philip, as a Renaissance connoisseur of art and literature,
a bon vivant in his youth who loved royal parties and a devoted
family man.
</P>
<P>
   ``A monarch who collected Titian and Bosch couldn't be such a
demon,'' said Juan Martinez, an art expert on the exhibition team.
</P>
<P>
   Philip collected some 2,000 paintings, including the 40 by
Titian and six by Hieronymous Bosch. He also collected 5,000 books,
far more than his Spanish royal predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether ruthlessness would be at odds with
refined intellectual tastes. So the commemoration is stirring
discussion of just how much to clean up the image of Philip, and
Spaniards seem to be warming to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent biographies, ``Philip of Spain'' by Henry Kamen, an
English historian, and ``Philip II and His Time'' by Manuel
Fernandez Alvarez, a Spanish historian, dispel stereotypes of an
austere, narrow-minded Philip. Their combined sales of 60,000
copies are remarkable for the genre.
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration promises just as full and fair a look at
Philip, addressing his ``lights and shadows.'' The first
exhibition, ``The Hispanic Monarchy,'' opened on June 1 and runs
through Oct. 10 at El Escorial, the mammoth granite palace and
monastery he built 30 miles northwest of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The other two begin in October: ``A Prince of the Renaissance''
at the Prado, and ``The King's Land and Men'' at the Villena Palace
in Philip's native city of Valladolid, 120 miles northwest of
Madrid. More than 500,000 visitors are expected at the three shows.
</P>
<P>
   El Escorial, with four sharply pointed towers at its corners,
provides a powerful backdrop for the first show. It was here that
Philip received the bad news about the Armada, and here that he
died in Spartan quarters at age 71 and was buried.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes 514 items, including paintings, books,
documents, and jewelry recovered from sunken Armada ships, the
latter on loan from the Ulster Museum in Belfast and being shown in
Spain for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   There are two portraits of the proud, steely-eyed young Philip
wearing black armor with gold inlay, one by Titian in 1551 and the
other by the Spanish painter Antonio Moro in 1557, the year after
he took the throne. Each speaks to Philip's power, while the
numerous religious icons on view show his devotion to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Some Spanish conservatives defended him as a model ruler against
his numerous detractors, particularly English and Dutch Protestants
who spread what became known as the ``black legend,'' focusing on
his oppressive tactics in Europe and the New World. That view was
disseminated in books of the period, and six such volumes are part
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The show at El Escorial takes a fresh approach by emphasizing
the women in Philip's life: his mother, aunts, sisters, his four
wives, and his daughters. They generally helped him build the
empire through their strategic family alliances with other nations,
and they are pictured in chronological order.
</P>
<P>
   He outlived all four wives. His first marriage, at age 16 to
Maria of Portugal, bore a potential heir, Don Carlos, later the
subject of the Verdi opera that bears his name. Next was the stern
queen of England, Mary Tudor, a decade older than Philip.
</P>
<P>
   The third, the young Isabel de Valois, was the mother of his
favorite daughters. A portrait by the Spaniard Alonso Sanchez
Coello, dated 1568-1569, shows the two girls, almost holding hands,
dressed in full-length reddish gowns. Philip often kept the elder
daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, at his side.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth wife, the fair Anne of Austria, 22 years his junior,
bore the eventual heir, Philip III. But Philip outlived six of his
eight children.
</P>
<P>
   The show also highlights Philip's early training in Renaissance
values, displaying his handsome books on medicine, science and
music, and how he simply enjoyed himself.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous watercolor, ``Enchanted Salon of the Binche
Palace,'' depicts one of the lavish parties he attended, in 1549
near Brussels. Three tables stacked like sumptuous bunk beds brim
with porcelain and crystal dishes bearing savories and sweets.
After the guests tired of the treats on the bottom table, the
exhibition relates, the next one was lowered mechanically.
</P>
<P>
   Another striking piece is an anonymous oil, circa 1581, showing
Philip in a suit of gold for his coronation as king of Portugal.
Usually the king wore black in his later years, but the exhibition
historian, Feliciano Barrios, said that the painting showed that
Philip was willing to respect local custom, as the colorful
ceremony in Portugal demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exhibition, which includes various battle scene
paintings of Spanish victories over the Turks or French and the
Armada's fateful route to England, distinctly conveys the rough
challenges of the era. Even Philip's dog wore a coat of armor,
which is also on display.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish empire reached its peak during Philip's reign, and
after the Armada's defeat began its slow decline. Kamen argues that
the pragmatic, even cruel policies of his monarchy did not
necessarily mean that Philip himself was an ogre.
</P>
<P>
   But he and some other experts do not predict a quick revision of
attitudes toward Philip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rethinking and that is the best one can ask for,''
Kamen said. ``One cannot change views overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps not even in 400 years.

FOR OUTDOOR GRAZING, SOME HELP FROM CAMPAGNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Campagna Home, 29 East 21st Street, assembling a
Fourth of July picnic from scratch is a pleasure. This spacious new
shop, a sibling of Campagna, the restaurant across the street,
carries not only salamis, cheeses and prepared foods like cold
antipasto dishes, but also the accessories you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   His wicker picnic basket can hold food for four. And filled with
$50 or more worth of al fresco fare, basket costs $17, not $42.
</P>
<P>
   Most salad items, like marinated mushrooms, roasted potatoes and
grilled eggplant, are $9 to $12 a pound. The shop also has bread
from Sullivan Street Bakery and excellent fresh meats from DeBragga
&AMP; Spitler, a wholesale butcher that supplies restaurants. Mark
Strausman, Campagna's owner and chef, roasts or grills the meat;
grilled chicken is $2.79 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely paper plates and napkins ($3.50 to $5 a package) are also
available, as well as Belgian linen napkins ($7.50 each). A little
tempered glass cutting board from Germany is $12.50, and there are
extremely well-balanced knives, also from Germany; a six inch one,
good to tuck into the basket, is $45. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no better picnic food than a sandwich. And there is no
better place to buy a sandwich made on great fresh bread than at a
bakery. The excellent bakeries around town, many of them connected
to restaurants, have inventive sandwiches galore.
</P>
<P>
   All these bakeries are open on Saturdays and Sundays. At
Columbus Bakery, 474 Columbus Avenue (83d Street) and 959 First
Avenue (52d Street), the grilled portobello mushroom sandwich, with
fontina cheese, pesto and vegetable slaw on baguette ($6.95), is a
good choice. Francophiles would not find fault with the ham and
Gruyere on buttered baguette ($6) from Balthazar Bakery, 80 Spring
Street (Broadway).
</P>
<P>
   The mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich on Eli's onion ficelle
($6) from E.A.T., 1064 Madison Avenue (81st Street), has become
something of a classic. It's $3.50 at the Vinegar Factory, 431 East
91st Street, also owned by Eli Zabar. At Amy's Bread, 75 Ninth
Avenue (15th Street) and 672 Ninth Avenue (46th Street), sandwiches
on semolina-fennel bread include tuna salad ($3.60) and roast
turkey ($4.50). Bouley Bakery, 120 West Broadway (Duane Street),
makes a Cape Cod flounder sandwich with tomatoes on rustic mountain
bread for $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the bakeries, which have sandwiches wrapped and
ready to go, Le Pain Quotidien, 1131 Madison Avenue (84th Street),
makes its sandwiches to order, including smoked salmon with dill
sauce ($13), including a mixed salad on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The new Blue Ribbon Bakery, 33 Downing Street (Bedford Street),
has a smoked peppered bluefish sandwich with cream cheese on walnut
bread for $7.50. The bakery does not open until noon, so it's not
the place to go if you're embarking on an excursion to the country
and need to get an early start. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murray's Cheese Shop, 257 Bleecker Street (Cornelia Street), has
assembled cheese packages for picnics. A French assortment has
three cheeses plus peasant bread, duck mousse, sausage, cornichons
and olives; an Italian array includes mozzarella, a creamy
pagliattina (similar to Camembert), sun-dried tomatoes and roasted
peppers, plus bread and olives. Each is $50. Overnight delivery in
New York, New Jersey or Connecticut is $15 extra. To order: (212)
243-3289 or (888) 692-4339. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's an unusual new item to add to the picnic basket: a bottle
of cold borscht. Manischewitz has just started selling it in a
single-serving, 16-ounce bottle, without bits of beet in the
bottom. The borscht is about $1.30 in supermarkets. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The First Brands Corp., which makes Glad plastic wrap and bags,
now has lightweight stackable plastic containers with tight-sealing
lids, perfect for picnic food. They come in a deep 24-ounce size
and a shallow 25-ounce size. A package of five is about $2.40 in
supermarkets. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cherries are among the most convenient summer picnic fruits. And
those from upstate farms have started coming into the market,
including the golden variety. Growers say it's one of the best
seasons for these. Locust Grove Farms stand in the Union Square
Greenmarket has them for $3 a pint basket. At Grace's Marketplace,
1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), they are $3.99 a quart. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But do not plan on buying doughnuts from Georgie's Pastry Shop,
50 West 125th Street, for your picnic, because it has closed.
Similarly, doughnuts and doughnut holes from Fina Pastries, 344
Bowery (Third Street), will not be available because that shop, too
has closed. Fina is reopening in the fall at 1516 First Avenue
(79th Street), but the owners of Georgie's have retired, so those
wonderful doughnuts are gone for good. &QL;

GROUP TEAMS WITH HEALTH-CARE CENTERS TO TEACH GUN SAFETY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing recent killings by children who gained
access to firearms, a national gun-control group Tuesday solicited
the medical community's help in teaching youngsters that guns can
kill and urging firearm owners to lock up their weapons when not in
use.
</P>
<P>
   The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence will provide brochures
and posters to doctors and their aides encouraging them to tell
young patients and parents that guns intended for protection can
end up killing family members if left within children's reach, said
Sarah Brady, the group's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based center plans to disseminate its brochures
and posters at medical conventions and through health-care groups,
such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, she added.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokesman Jim Manown said the
center's public education campaign is no different than what the
gun group has been telling families and children for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms should be stored so that they are not accessible to
unauthorized persons,'' Manown said. NRA instructs children who see
guns to ``stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said that conveying the center's message on gun safety
will be as easy for health-care workers as their age-old practice
of telling parents to store poisonous chemicals out of youngsters'
reach. The group's education campaign, which extends to all medical
personnel, broadens the center's original effort in 1994 to
encourage pediatricians to tell gun-owning parents that children
will find and shoot firearms not kept in a locked place.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen children per day are killed with guns, the National
Center for Health Statistics reported last year. Many of these
deaths can be prevented if greater efforts are made to deny
children access to firearms, Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to vaccinate our children against gun violence as we
have with other infectious and dangerous diseases,'' she added.
``Many families who only think of their firearms in terms of crime
or self-defense need to realize that deaths and injuries from
firearms are as much of a health risk in this country as many types
of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The launch of the public education campaign, which Metropolitan
Life Foundation is funding, follows a spate of school shootings in
recent months. Students have been arrested in connection with
deadly incidents at schools in Jonesboro, Ark.; Springfield, Ore.;
Pearl, Miss.; and West Paducah., Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-profile shootings we all heard about this year are
just the tip of the iceberg,'' Brady said. ``Around the nation,
access to guns is killing our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala praised the
center's enlistment of health-care workers in encouraging safe gun
storage. She noted that doctors and their assistants have great
credibility with the children and parents they heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who better to be the messengers of firearm safety?'' said
Shalala. ``I think most health care providers would agree it's a
far, far better thing to protect children from gunshot wounds than
to fight to save their lives.''

   INGREDIENTS
</P>
<P>
   Traditional root beers primarily were flavored with sassafras
root altered by the addition of aromatics. Since sassafras was
outlawed in 1960 by the federal Food and Drug Administration,
commercial root-beer manufacturers have had to find substitutes,
including artificial root-beer flavoring, ``de-poisoned'' sassafras
and wintergreen, none of which is entirely satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial root-beer recipes are proprietary, but among the
ingredients used are: allspice, anise, birch bark, burdock root,
coriander seed, dandelion root, ginger, honey, hops, juniper
berries, licorice, molasses, prickly ash bark, sarsaparilla root,
spicewood, spikenard root, wild cherry bark, wintergreen oil,
yellow dock
</P>
<P>
   TRIVIA
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, the retail sale of soft drinks totaled more than $54
billion.
</P>
<P>
   _In the same year, per capita consumption of soft drinks was 54
gallons, a total of more than 14 billion gallons of soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Root beer accounts for only 3 percent of the U.S. soft-drink
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales of the seven largest root-beer brands have grown to
219.2 million cases (in a 1993 survey), up from 141.7 million cases
in 1986. &QL; 
_ There are about 200 brands currently made. &QL; 
_ A&AMP;W is the top-selling brand, followed by Barq's and Mug. &QL;

   GEEKS AND ROOT BEER
</P>
<P>
   Root beer must be awfully popular with computer geeks, judging
by the dozens and dozens of Web sites on the subject. They offer
history, information, and lots and lots of taste tests.
</P>
<P>
   I need to tell you about only one, ``Anthony's Root Beer
Barrel,'' because it lists about 60 links to other sites. It's root
beer hog heaven:

`SMALL SOLDIERS,' BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Think small, think real small.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makers of the new Universal Studios summer
attraction did when they put together ``Small Soldiers'': Behind
the Scenes, which is based on the upcoming film.
</P>
<P>
   According to its makers, the Universal/DreamWorks venture, which
opens Thursday at the theme park, boasts the first ever
walk-through of a Hollywood movie set coupled with an interactive
experience that promises to be ``more kid-friendly than the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The digitally enhanced action-adventure film, directed by Joe
Dante (``Gremlins'') and set for release July 10, tells the
life-and-death struggle between two sets of toys _ the
monstrous-looking yet people-loving Gorgonites and the power-hungry
Commandoes, who are accidentally implanted with military
intelligence chips and start an all-out war in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's video guided tour of the movie set opens into a
``prep room'' (a clinical name for such a gritty movie) and is
meant to provide background for those who haven't seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio's Sound Stage 36 is the original set as it
appears in the movie. The tour of the small postwar suburban house
is narrated by the film's co-stars, Kirsten Dunst and Denis Leary,
and includes scenes tied to two special effects: a puff of smoke
cued to a movie clip and an action figure twirling down a garbage
disposal coupled with sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want it to be a lecture. We wanted it to be a little
more hands-on,'' said David Weiss the project manager for the
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But the hands-on part of the tour comes when the set
walk-through dumps out into an arcade room, which offers several
venues, including about three dozen play stations that give kids a
choice between three different games.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a station where anyone can become part of the
movie magic by joining the character Chip Hazard in a chase scene
that is inserted into the movie version.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop is one that might make parents cringe _ the toy
store, the attraction's obvious ploy to get a leg up on
merchandising before the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the movie anymore, it's about the marketing.
And more than that, it's about the timing,'' said Norman Kahn, vice
president for Universal's entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the film features spectacular special effects
paired with radio-controlled puppets with digital enhancement from
Industrial Light and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is that audiences are smarter now _ they expect
more,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   But the interactive quotient in this attraction relies less on
the technical and more, well ... on the retail.

Our rating: 3 Stars  
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; This summer's second
big-space-rock-aims-for-Earth adventure, ``Armageddon,'' is
markedly noisier and stupider than ``Deep Impact.'' Yet this one
seems to understand what it is _ the party version of the end of
the world _ far better than the much-too-polite ``Impact'' grasped
what it really was _ a bad soap opera with philosophical
pretensions. I'll take the movie that knows it's a demo derby any
day of the week, which is not to say that ``Armageddon'' is all
dumb fun. It's dumb about its supposedly dramatic moments, too,
which are inevitably either too long, too repetitive or too
unintentionally campy (or all three at once). But while this gives
the film some serious pacing problems, there's no denying that
``Armageddon'' also offers up so much action, humor, spectacle and,
well, noise that it comes within near-miss range of true
extravaganza status.
</P>
<P>
   You want cool destruction? A cluster of small, preliminary rocks
_ the approaching Big Mama is approximately the size of Texas _ do
more damage to New York City in a few minutes than Godzilla managed
to in his whole movie (summer travel advisory: If movies at all
inspire copycat behavior, stay away from the Chrysler Building).
And that's just a few early, teaser scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The president is freaked. NASA honcho Dan Truman (Billy Bob
Thornton) calls his best brains together. The consensus:
``Basically, the worst parts of the Bible,'' one of several great
lines a small army of screenwriters sprinkled through the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so cool. But the idiocy factor goes up a few notches
when it's determined that the only hope for mankind rests with one
Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis), a deep-core drilling expert who
likes to lob golf balls at Greenpeace activists and take shotgun
blasts at the partner ``who's like a son to me,'' A.J. Frost
(``Good Will Hunting's'' Ben Affleck) _ on a mid-Pacific oil rig,
no less! _ because A.J. and Harry's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler),
have been sleeping together.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's also got a band of indispensable yahoos without whom
he's just not going to be able to stop the asteroid. Among them are
a genius geologist who's also something of a pedophile (Steve
Buscemi), a reliable foreman but deadbeat dad (Will Patton), and
some really big guys (Ken Campbell, Michael Duncan) who do, well,
something indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   They and the rest of Harry's crew enjoy cutting up during a
too-long astronaut-training crash course, while A.J. and Grace get
to profess their titanically eternal love, and Harry promises to
come back for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have guessed, Grace isn't going into space. Tyler's
job consists mainly of staying on the verge of tears and making
sure her hair looks great blowing in the wind against more red,
white and blue backdrops than NBC tricked up for the last Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When the men's work finally gets under way, it's pretty nonstop.
The two shuttles carrying our rowdy heroes barely escape from an
exploding Russian space station, one doesn't survive entry through
scads of asteroid debris, the one that does land safely keeps
breaking drill bits, things fall and explode all over the place,
the NASA pilots can't be trusted, some guys die, some go nuts, some
sacrifice needs to be made ... and, oh yeah, nothing they do can,
tsk tsk, save France.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a lot of what you saw in ``Deep Impact,'' only
megatons more of the good stuff. In still other words,
``Armageddon'' is indeed the creature of Jerry Bruckheimer and
Michael Bay, the producer-director team responsible for ``The
Rock,'' which means the soundtrack is so loud that it drowns out
half the dialogue anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And which also means that you're not missing a thing because you
can't hear it. Amazingly, there are well-acted set-pieces and lots
of good, tense confrontational scenes amid all the sound and fury.
And even the broader, maudlin moments have a certain emotional tug,
given that life on Earth is at stake and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is anything but a thoughtful or well-constructed
action film, but for the kind of high-tech kitchen-sink contraption
it's intended to be, it's got all the bells and whistles you could
possibly want. And all of them blow at full blast. &UR;

THE GOOD HUMOR MAN KEEPS 'EM LAUGHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When the music fills the room at the Reseda
senior center, it's as if the show biz high jinks had never
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Siracusa _ who spent six years as raucous bandleader Spike
Jones' drummer and sound-effects and gag man _ is in the spotlight
again.
</P>
<P>
   The wiry, mustachioed Siracusa, 76, is often the only man in the
roomful of women at the twice-weekly dance class for area seniors,
uninhibitedly twisting and turning, kicking and shaking his hips in
time to the music.
</P>
<P>
   When the former gagman feels the silliness quotient needs
boosting, he reaches into his ``bag of tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dancers gyrate to a Dixieland tune, Siracusa joins in
with his slide whistle, then keeps the beat banging a pair of
clacking spoons against one thigh. The music takes on a Greek
accent, and Siracusa clangs a school bell and blows a train
whistle, yelling, ``All aboard!''
</P>
<P>
   The beat picks up and so does the jokester, inserting the blare
of an auto horn, ringing sleigh bells and explosive mock sneezes _
``Ya-choo! Ya-choo!'' _ as the dancers finally break up with
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class is a real delight,'' Siracusa says, his grin as
wide as the plaid on one of the Spike Jones' band members' suits.
``I just make a fool of myself, have everybody laughing. I've been
doing that all my life, and I'm not going to stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Siracusa's routines were perfected in the late 1940s and early
1950s while devising sight-and-sound gags for Jones, whose frenetic
Dixieland jazz band, one critic complained, ``played like fugitives
from a speakeasy with the cops coming in the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's our band man, quite a percussionist,'' said Joanne
McColloch, a dance instructor at Valley Senior Service &AMP; Resource
Center in Reseda. ``He just brightens our class and makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw such a kindhearted man,'' said Martha Goldberg,
81, who sometimes joins Siracusa in his chicken dance, which comes
complete with chicken and egg puppets, rooster crowing and other
high jinks. ``With all he has to take care of, he comes in and
makes things brighter for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few years haven't been easy ones for Siracusa, who's
the father of two daughters and two sons. He was widowed in January
1997 after Eleanor, his wife of 55 years, died of a stroke during
heart surgery. That left him as the major caregiver for his pastor
son, Jim, who suffered debilitating head injuries in a 1989 auto
accident in which Jim's wife was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the former drummer finds comfort in hosting a weekly
Bible study group and delivering roses from his garden to cashiers
at his local market and post office.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, spicing up his dance classes. But then, Siracusa
has always loved to entertain. You could say it's in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   His father and his grandfather both were tuba players and
bandmasters in Sicily; his dad came to the United States in 1905
and played in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Circus band.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland-born Siracusa first played bells in his grammar school
rhythm band; a photo hanging in the hallway of his Reseda home
shows a grinning lad of about 7 or 8, wearing plus-four knickers,
with his bell-ringing band buddies.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to play several instruments, but his hands were
itching to get ahold of a pair of drumsticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up the sticks and just started playing without any
instruction,'' he grinned, mimicking a riff on an imaginary snare
drum.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was in high school, Siracusa was a percussionist
in both the school band and orchestra, and worked as a timpani
player with the Cleveland Concert Band. After graduating from high
school at 16, he played drums for performances in the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At age 20, he married high-school sweetheart Eleanor, 21. ``I
put my arm around her one day and never let go,'' recalls an
unabashedly sentimental Siracusa, dabbing at his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted in 1943, Siracusa's Army unit was bound for combat in
the South Pacific until his superiors took a liking to the band
he'd organized, which was particularly adept at imitating Spike
Jones' raucous Dixieland band style so popular with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   So while most of his buddies were sent to Fort Dix to train for
combat, bandleader Siracusa was sent to Fort Bliss, Texas, with
orders to join the Glenn Miller band.
</P>
<P>
   ``My drums saved my life,'' he said. ``I kissed my drums and
said, `Thank you, God'.''
</P>
<P>
   But through a wartime snafu, his orders changed and he and some
of his band members were loaded onto a ship bound for New Guinea,
where he was to become a combat medic. Halfway there, the ship
received word that the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped the ship and we started playing, `California,
Here I Come','' he said. ``We knew the war was over _ or would be
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged from the Army in 1946, he wrote to Spike Jones,
promising that he could reproduce virtually all the sound effects
that kept the bandleader's shows fast-paced and silly.
</P>
<P>
   When the band played Cleveland, Siracusa was summoned backstage
to meet the man dubbed ``King of Corn'' by a generation of
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike was sitting there in his zebra-striped bathrobe drinking
iced coffee,'' the musician recalled. ``I sang `The Sheik of Araby'
with a Jewish accent, with some hiccups and gargle sounds.'' By the
time he'd stopped singing, he had the promise of a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Told to join the band in Los Angeles after its tour, Siracusa
bought a new suit and hopped a westbound train. Soon he was part of
``The Spike Jones Musical Depreciation Review,'' on a countrywide
tour, earning $150 a week _ with no promises.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was Fargo, N.D., where the young drummer wowed
the dancers _ and Jones, too _ with his frenzied drumming, his
ear-splitting sound effects and his crazy antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the curtain came down, Spike yelled up at me, ``Joe, you
got the job and you got a raise','' Siracusa recalled with a grin.
``I was born to be a City Slicker.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next six years, he was a pivotal member of the craziest
band anywhere, a raucous group of musicians that played virtually
every song double or triple time, punctuated by gunshots, cowbells,
auto horns, slide whistles, screams and other sound effects and
sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   Siracusa devised new sound-and-sight gags for the band _ soap
bubbles coming out of the instruments, a trombonist's pants rising
and falling with the instrument's slide, a breakaway curtain that
collapsed, engulfing the band, at the end of the show. He scoured
music and pawn shops for discarded musical instruments and
noise-makers, the same ones that make up his ``bag of tricks''
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come out with the trombone and trip and fall into
the orchestra pit,'' Siracusa said. ``I was in good shape then and
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a prankster himself, used to vie with Siracusa to see who
could come up with the best gags. It was the bandleader who devised
a suit with a second head attached so he could boast that he
employed the only two-headed drummer in show business. But it was
Siracusa who rigged the heads so he could take a drag off a
cigarette _ and have the smoke come out of the second head's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gags we played on each other turned out to be the best
part of the show,'' Siracusa said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there was music and joking, Siracusa was happy. But
when Jones, stung at music critics' dismissal of his band's musical
abilities, decided to end the gags and play regular dance music,
the drummer lost interest. He left the band in 1952; Jones
continued to tour and had his own TV show through 1961. He died of
cancer in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Siracusa may have retired his drumsticks, but he didn't retire
from show business. He began making movies. Working for UPA
Pictures, he produced ``Mr. Magoo,'' ``Gerald McBoing Boing'' and
``Madeline'' animated films. Then he formed his own company,
producing Ross Bagdasarian's ``Chipmunks'' TV cartoon show.
Bagdasarian and Siracusa took turns providing the voice of chipmunk
Alvin, the trio's troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   He also did musical arranging and producing for films that
included ``The Pink Panther,'' provided sound effects and film
editing on ``The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show,'' and sound effects for
both ``Dr. Seuss'' and ``The Cat in the Hat'' (for which he won two
Emmys). He won two Oscars for sound effects and editing on ``Mr.
Magoo.'' And in 1991, he received a lifetime achievement award from
the International Animation Society.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly half a century in show business, the time had
come to retire. Now he delights in visits from his nine
grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-time drummer never gave up music entirely. Until son
Jim's injury, Siracusa and a group of Spike Jones veterans and
others banded together to form the Phunharmonic Orchestra,
organizing and performing benefit performances that raised more
than $20,000 for the Salvation Army. He's had several requests from
other groups _ and urgings from talent agents _ to get the band
back together to play local gigs, but he's turned them all down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told I could make a lot of money,'' he said. ``But I
do it for fun, for love, that's all. I said once I'll play again _
when my son Jim can sit in the audience and applaud. And I believe
it'll happen, someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he hones his jokester skills by keeping his dance
class in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Siracusa said, grinning. ``I'm a ham. I say if I
can make 'em laugh, well, that's what I'm here to do.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Opera House, dogged by accusations of elitism
and financial mismanagement, came under renewed attack on Tuesday
when a government-sponsored report said that its internal
organization often ``resembles a World War I battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Sir Richard Eyre, the former artistic director of
the Royal National Theater and one of the most respected champions
of the performing arts in Britain, said that to justify its annual
$24-million government subsidy and earn the public's confidence,
the Royal Opera House would have to get itself in order rapidly.
Among other things, he said, it should develop an effective, open
financial plan; draw new patrons with lower prices and better
education programs; put an end to its entrenched culture of
highhanded arrogance; stop issuing free tickets ``to the London
glitterati'' and establish better lines of internal communication.
</P>
<P>
   The management of the opera house, which includes the Royal
Opera and the Royal Ballet, ``has become ever more deeply mired in
ever more insoluble financial problems,'' Sir Richard said in the
report, ``even as its ability to plan and organize has been
hampered by chaos and misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``All too often, the situation resembles a First
World War battlefield, where the poor bloody infantry are trying to
fulfill a strategy about which they haven't been consulted, and
whose outcome is simply a matter of willful optimism or blithe
unconcern to its creators.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera house management recently said it needed an additional
government subsidy of $16.5 million to $25 million a year to remain
solvent. While saying the request ``was not substantiated by an
effective business plan,'' and that an increase now would be ``a
reward for incompetence,'' Sir Richard said that when the opera
house had finished reforming itself, it was likely to need more
public money.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard's report was commissioned in November by Chris
Smith, Britain's culture secretary, in response to the series of
problems that have bedeviled the opera house. In the last 13 months
two of its top executives have abruptly quit, saying they could not
do the job.
</P>
<P>
   In December, its board of directors resigned en masse. (Several
were later reinstated). And, as its home undergoes a $367-million
refurbishing (to be completed next year) that is heavily financed
by the National Lottery, the Royal Opera House is running at an
$8.25 million deficit, with its two companies losing money
performing to often meager crowds in other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report also looked at two other major performing arts
organizations, the English National Opera and Sadler's Wells, but
reserved most of its criticism for the Royal Opera House, a
showcase for performing arts here. The report also rejected several
of the more drastic measures proposed for the opera house's reform.
It dismissed, for instance, Smith's suggestion last year that the
Royal Opera and the English National Opera pool their resources and
perform from the same building. (The National Opera appears at the
Coliseum, near the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.) And it
rejected the recent demand by Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the
Culture Committee in the House of Commons and one of the opera
house most venomous critics, that it be privatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, they have to close or find their own money,''
Kaufman said recently, in response to an assertion by the opera
house management that even if it initiated reforms to the
government's satisfaction, and even if every performance of every
production were to be sold out, it would still need more than $16
million more a year to break even. ``The state cannot go on pouring
money into an enterprise, whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sir Richard, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, said that the
British support for the arts in general was woefully low. Echoing
complaints from other leaders of the traditional high arts,
including the director Sir Peter Hall, that the nation is
neglecting theater, classical music, dance, and opera in favor of
rock music and movies, Sir Richard said that the government should
drastically increase its grants to the arts, perhaps by as much as
$99 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard, Sir Peter, and other arts leaders voiced their
concerns at a meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday
night. Sir Richard said that the prime minister ``nodded'' when
told the arts needed more money, but Smith said that Blair listened
rather than agreeing, and that no new money was yet forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a news conference with Sir Richard, Smith said that
he welcomed the report's emphasis on the need for greater access to
the opera house, which has come under criticism for what, to some,
are prohibitively high prices. The opera house, which receives
comparatively little financing from private sources, charges as
much as $243 for a prime seat at the most elaborate opera. (For the
coming season, the top ticket price at the Metropolitan Opera in
Manhattan is $200.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to see the weight the report gives to improving
access,'' Smith said. ``It is essential that the companies reach
new audiences and welcome new people in, rather than excluding them
by atmosphere and perceived elitism.'' He gave the opera house a
month to respond to Sir Richard's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The composer Michael Berkeley, a Royal Opera board member, said
that the board was ``very encouraged'' by the report and that it
had begun to carry out Sir Richard's proposals. ``He has clearly
addressed all the issues,'' Berkeley said. ``While he clearly
thinks that the previous managements have not run the house in the
best possible manner, he does recognize that if we are to meet our
targets for better management and better access, then we can't run
without more money.''

<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, will develop
over northern New England on Wednesday as a potent upper-level
trough of low pressure swings slowly eastward over the region. On
the western flank of the trough, drier air from Canada will sweep
across the Great Lakes toward the central Appalachians on
northwesterly winds between 15 mph and 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, potent thunderstorms will erupt over parts of the
southern Middle Atlantic and Southeast states as jet stream
disturbances on the southern flank of the trough combine with a
stationary front to vigorously lift very warm and humid air. A few
of these storms will become severe, with damaging winds posing the
greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   A few severe thunderstorms are likely on the western high Plains
and Front Range of the Rockies across western Kansas, western
Nebraska, eastern Colorado and eastern Wyoming as warm, moist air
flowing westward behind a stationary front is forced to rise up the
sloping terrain. Damaging winds and a few tornadoes are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isolated but large thunderstorms will flare over
parts of eastern Florida. The coverage of these storms will be
spotty and will likely not douse the fires that continue over parts
of the Sunshine State. A few storms could become very intense over
northeast Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the morning fog and low clouds will gradually dissipate
from northwest California to western Washington. Isolated afternoon
thunderstorms will speckle areas farther inland in these states.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: PLAINS HEAT
</P>
<P>
   The persistent heat in the southern Plains claimed an all-time
record on Monday, when the mercury soared to 110 degrees in Dodge
City, Kan. Records in the western Kansas town date back 124 years.
While the current heat wave is reaching memorable proportions, the
standard for intense heat in the Plains is still the summers of the
1930s. Many state records in the region date from that decade. In
1936, Kansas City reached 100 degrees or higher on 53 days from
June to September. The sparse rainfall that accompanied the heat
led to the agricultural disaster now called the Dust Bowl. &QL;

 UNDATED: out there.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bither began targeting the album's logical market, literate 30-
and 40-year-olds who buy music to take part in a culture. Latin
radio in the United States has been resistant to Cuban music and
has barely played the record, partly out of fear of the reactions
of right-wing Cuban exile groups. Nonetheless, it has been a Top 3
Latin record since its release here, and the striking packaging,
including a well-made booklet, makes the CD more than music.
</P>
<P>
   For Cooder, the response to the music springs from a sense of
loss. As many of the great popular music traditions of the Americas
dating from the end of the last century to the middle of this
century vanish, audiences feel a nostalgic need to keep them
intact. And the traditions are still powerful for those who bother
to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The son, a Cuban style of music on the album, has everything
you need: improvisation, form, African rhythms, strange elliptical
rhythms with 19th-century chords,'' Cooder said. ``Where else are
you going to find master musicians with that sort of individuality?
Blues and country music and Hawaiian music are dead. Music like
this is dying everywhere. I have a feeling audiences want to hear
melodies and atmosphere. And they want an environment to believe
in, so they can say, `This is a place I can go, I can be in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooder's relationship with Cuban music dates to the 1960s, when
he lived in New York and picked up albums by the Trio Matamoros and
others. In the early 1970s, he visited Cuba on a tour boat with
Dizzy Gillespie, and the music there changed him.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooder has a son, Joachim (who plays on the record), and
needed money, so he took time off from touring to make movie
soundtracks. He recorded several acclaimed collaborations with Ali
Farka Toure, the African guitarist. And in 1996, when Nick Gold,
the owner of World Circuit, offered to send Cooder to Havana to
record with Cuban and African musicians, Cooder was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Gold greeted Cooder at the airport in Havana with bad news.
``Nick picks me up at the airport and says, `The Africans aren't
coming,''' Cooder said. ```Good,' I said. `Let's wail. It's fate
intervening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go well at first. They looked for Gonzalez, the
pianist, and had been told he had died. People checked again, and
found him alive, but suffering from arthritis. Compay Segundo
couldn't record because he had another contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a friendly country and the musicians all want to
play,'' Cooder said. ``It all came together.'' Cooder and Gold got
together with Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, the head of a well-respected
band, Sierra Maestra, and they attacked the problem of bringing
together a group. De Marcos directed the band and oversaw the
recording process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to push the musicians along or you get the same old
stuff,'' Cooder said. ``What was going on in the recording room
were all these people jamming. I'd go: `Wait! What was that, that
little three-note line? That thing you sang was beautiful.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid to make just another record, you might as well not
bother. So the musicians figured this out, and Compay, he's smart,
he'd come in and say, `I have thought of a great song.' And he'd
remember a song a friend of his wrote in the 1930s. `Now you're
talking,' I'd say to him. `Give me another weird song.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana the response to the project has been mixed. Some
people are proud of the album's international success. But at a
news conference in Havana, de Marcos and Cooder were criticized for
supporting prerevolutionary music at the expense of the flowering
of musical talent since the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't hear modern Cuban music,'' Cooder said. ``So I
said, `I only know what I know, and I'm recording this music
because I know something about it.' I understand the issues,
there's this sense that the carpetbaggers are coming down. The
Cubans don't need me, but if I can help the situation there, I
will.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the record's success, Cuban music in the United States
is often a losing proposition. The concert Wednesday night, which
cost roughly $150,000, including transportation and lodging, will
lose substantial money, even though it's sold out.
</P>
<P>
   For political, social and musical reasons, Bither of Nonesuch
thought the first American concert of the band had to be at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll even lose money doing it, but it's well worth it,
because ultimately we'll sell records. So we're comfortable. We're
investing in our artists.''
</P>
<P>
   De Marcos sees it like a dream. ``We're realizing a social and
political opening, a way of changing the realities of two countries
that have been enemies for so long. This music is that powerful.'' &QL;

NOT EVEN BRUCE WILLIS CAN SAVE THE EARTH FROM `ARMAGEDDON'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike ``Deep Impact,'' which teases viewers with major carnage
in the trailer but waits 'til the end of the movie to show any,
``Armageddon'' crushes New York City with a meteorite shower in the
first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems you have to be a stand-up comedian starring in a TV
sitcom to survive: Eddie Griffin of ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' and Mark
Cooper of ``Hangin' With Mr. Cooper'' pull through, but you can't
say the same about midtown Manhattan. It's a mess, but then so is
this movie, perhaps the first to combine the steroid-injected
pushiness of an action movie with the lump-in-the-throat
sentimentality of a disaster picture. It's not a pleasant mix.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite storm that pelts New York City is just an
appetizer. An asteroid ``the size of Texas'' is careening toward
Earth. The result? ``A global killer,'' intones NASA's Dan Truman
(Billy Bob Thornton, who gives a riveting, all-business
performance). The only solution? To drill into the core of the
asteroid and plant a charge to blow the thing up _ the same remedy
``Deep Impact'' used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' has that scramble-a-team-together vibe of many of
producer Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, among them ``The Rock'' and
``Con Air.'' This time, it's an elite squad of oil rig drillers,
led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), whom we meet as he's slamming
golf balls at a boatful of environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   This movie has more comic relief than all Bruckheimer's previous
films combined; the goofballs include Owen Wilson and Steve
Buscemi, who keeps his footing surprisingly well. Except for
Willis, for the most part, almost everyone functions as comic
relief.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a dizzying shift from low comedy to soap opera,
following the story of the two young lovers, Harry's daughter Grace
(Liv Tyler) and one of Harry's ragtag crew, A.J. (Ben Affleck).
(The presence of Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, may
explain the number of Aerosmith songs that pollute the soundtrack.)
</P>
<P>
   The performances are all over the map as well, although
Bruckheimer is smart enough to cast actors from the indie world,
such as Buscemi, Thornton and Wilson, who can do the job. Bruce
Willis may be one of the best action movie actors ever. He brings
depth of feeling, and he's capable of showing hurt. To his credit,
he plays Tyler's father, instead of her boyfriend. He's mostly the
sour-faced straight man, the daddy figure in this collection of
misfits.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Bay, who had to content himself with destroying
large chunks of San Francisco in ``The Rock,'' gets to use all his
smoke-churning technology to create a movie that's a gruesome
combination of cynicism and sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras circle the actors like vultures, floating around the
room before stopping for the most dramatic shot possible. This may
be one of the most aggressive movies ever made, with such a premium
on activity that every scene suffers from attention-deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Bay's feverish ambition is to make every single second mean
something, instead of letting the movie build toward a
less-contrived high point. But when everything is heightened,
nothing means anything. This kind of bravura, pumped-up filmmaking
is the stuff of great trailers; the coming attraction spots take
the top of your head off. But it's exhausting, and you begin to
feel that the movie runs on a special clock in which every minute
lasts 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is not nearly as luridly insane as Bruckheimer's
``Con Air,'' which got more outrageous with every scene. In this
movie, Bay includes several of those Justice League of America
shots, in which the heroes amble majestically toward the camera in
slow motion, clad in their cool, Kool-Aid-orange spacesuits. There
are quite a few slow-mo shots of people waiting for the world to
end that look like Nike ads directed by Norman Rockwell. And when
Harry and his crew are launched on a space shuttle to do battle
with the asteroid, they seem have packed up most of NASA to carry
with them. The asteroid-bound section of the film, where characters
you're barely aware of pop up and disappear, is almost
incomprehensible; it's like watching a foreign film with no
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about New York being the only global center to be
annihilated either. It might have been cheaper to blow up the world
than it was to make ``Armageddon.'' This is the first time that the
end of the world as we know it has a price tag hanging from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is rated PG-13 for violence, adult language,
destruction on a global scale.

`ARMAGEDDON:` HENNY PENNY GETS PRESIDENT'S EAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review) 
(JT)

<P>
   Doom threatens. Again. This time it's a giant asteroid (``It's
the size of Texas, Mr. President''), and it's the Chrysler Building
that becomes New York's most conspicuously flattened landmark (just
as ``Deep Impact'' toppled the Statue of Liberty and ``Godzilla''
wrecked the Brooklyn Bridge.) That damage is done by a fake meteor
shower during the first part of ``Armageddon.'' The sight, however
apocalyptic, isn't as scary as the prospect of raising a generation
of Americans on movies like this.
</P>
<P>
   Movie isn't actually the best word to describe ``Armageddon.''
More accurately it's a product, a feat of salesmanship, a sight
worth noticing only because, like the asteroid on a collision
course with planet Earth, its size and inevitability aren't easy to
miss. But it should surprise no one to learn that the catchy title
and prime opening date were more vital to the genesis of
``Armageddon'' than the burning need to tell one more derivative
disaster story. Or that, without counting technical jargon,
official titles, ``government'' or profanity, armageddon is easily
the biggest word in the script.
</P>
<P>
   As produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay
with trademark expensive bombast, ``Armageddon'' tries to tell a
coherent story of guts, young love and space travel. (``Everybody
hang on. This could get a little rough.'') Though it means to be
inspiring, it has quite the opposite effect. There's not a
believable moment here (unless you count some boyish carousing in a
strip club). The actors mark time, and the gung-ho heroics on
display are embarrassingly hollow. (They will be even more so when
this show of ersatz patriotism plays overseas.) A real movie about
courage in space is ``Apollo 13,'' in which fear and sacrifice have
meaning. This jingoistic, overblown spectacle is about whistling in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   First seen chipping golf balls spitefully at a Greenpeace
vessel, Bruce Willis stars as a bullying oil tycoon who is called
Harry S. Stamper and lives up to the name. For the same reasons
that Willis perhaps had the biggest trailer on the set, he
monopolizes the noblest moments in the movie, but he has to
establish Harry's boorishness first. So as the action begins, Harry
noisily tries to shoot A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), the story's nice
young man, for sleeping with Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler), the big
man's beautiful, sheltered daughter. Though marooned on an oil rig
in the South China Sea, Grace has a silky Asian wardrobe that shows
up nicely at NASA headquarters later in the story.
</P>
<P>
   After a team of experts led by Dan Truman (a strong, no-nonsense
Billy Bob Thornton) determines that the planet faces imminent
destruction, both Stamper and Frost are recruited by the U.S.
government for instant heroism duty. Much is made of what
incredible drillers these guys are. They become part of a rascally
group assembled for an ultradangerous special mission, a group in
which Steve Buscemi provides comic relief as the team member with a
pulse. The idea is to train up, go to space, drill into the
asteroid, obliterate it with a nuclear device and be home in time
for the finale. Piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of global annihilation, the characters
in ``Armageddon'' still manage to horse around during basic
training and enjoy the chance to play with NASA's fanciest new
toys. Much of the film's lightheartedeness is supposed to come from
Affleck, whose manner is appealingly game but whose romantic scenes
with Ms. Tyler are hopelessly overstaged. He is expected not only
to croon a verse of John Denver's ``Leaving on a Jet Plane'' but to
play a love scene involving the cute use of animal crackers. And he
must mist at the eyes when realizing what a stand-up guy Harry
Stamper happens to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bay, whose background in making commercials keeps his feature
films (``Bad Boys,'' ``The Rock'') looking like advertisements for
themselves, never lets such moments occur gently. Even without its
periodic explosions ``Armageddon'' is desperately frenetic, and it
would have been more enveloping without such furious overediting or
strident cues. The story needn't be followed closely, since the
music constantly informs viewers whether to be happy or sad. Colors
are beer-commercial bold, sometimes with an emphasis on
patriotic-flag accents, sometimes in the blues and greens of video
screens. The pitch is so unvaried that it grows monotonous and
finally exhausting. But when a story has been constructed as if it
were shish kebab, each mood must be wildly overstated if it means
to show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Armageddon'' forges ahead on two and a half hours' worth of
autopilot, it proves itself an action potboiler with more of a
political agenda than most. American military uniforms and badges
are studied lovingly. Non-Americans are reduced to faceless
stereotypes, mostly seen in large crowds. Prayers are as heavily
emphasized as they are understandable under the circumstances.
(Harry: ``C'mon, God. Just a little help. That's all I'm askin'.'')
Antinuclear protesters get the Greenpeace treatment. A bumbling
Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare) is presented as if somebody
wanted to restart the Cold War.

`SMALL SOLDIERS,' BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(NOTE: A CORRECTION IN THE BYLINE.) 
By JENIFER KNIGHT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Think small, think real small.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makers of the new Universal Studios summer
attraction did when they put together ``Small Soldiers'': Behind
the Scenes, which is based on the upcoming film.
</P>
<P>
   According to its makers, the Universal/DreamWorks venture, which
opens Thursday at the theme park, boasts the first ever
walk-through of a Hollywood movie set coupled with an interactive
experience that promises to be ``more kid-friendly than the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The digitally enhanced action-adventure film, directed by Joe
Dante (``Gremlins'') and set for release July 10, tells the
life-and-death struggle between two sets of toys _ the
monstrous-looking yet people-loving Gorgonites and the power-hungry
Commandoes, who are accidentally implanted with military
intelligence chips and start an all-out war in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's video guided tour of the movie set opens into a
``prep room'' (a clinical name for such a gritty movie) and is
meant to provide background for those who haven't seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio's Sound Stage 36 is the original set as it
appears in the movie. The tour of the small postwar suburban house
is narrated by the film's co-stars, Kirsten Dunst and Denis Leary,
and includes scenes tied to two special effects: a puff of smoke
cued to a movie clip and an action figure twirling down a garbage
disposal coupled with sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want it to be a lecture. We wanted it to be a little
more hands-on,'' said David Weiss the project manager for the
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But the hands-on part of the tour comes when the set
walk-through dumps out into an arcade room, which offers several
venues, including about three dozen play stations that give kids a
choice between three different games.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a station where anyone can become part of the
movie magic by joining the character Chip Hazard in a chase scene
that is inserted into the movie version.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop is one that might make parents cringe _ the toy
store, the attraction's obvious ploy to get a leg up on
merchandising before the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the movie anymore, it's about the marketing.
And more than that, it's about the timing,'' said Norman Kahn, vice
president for Universal's entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the film features spectacular special effects
paired with radio-controlled puppets with digital enhancement from
Industrial Light and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is that audiences are smarter now _ they expect
more,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   But the interactive quotient in this attraction relies less on
the technical and more, well ... on the retail.

HUMBLE BIRD ACKNOWLEDGES HALL OF FAME HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Bird was equal parts awestruck and humbled Tuesday, 24
hours after learning he had been inducted into the Hall of Fame. He
used words like ``unbelievable'' and ``the ultimate'' to describe
the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But did it make up for the 24-year-old snub of not being named
Mr. Basketball in Indiana?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Hoosier, always a Hoosier. For the record, the Mr.
Basketball award was shared in 1974 by Steve Collier and Roy
Taylor. Bird, despite averaging more than 30 points and 20 rebounds
a game for Springs Valley High, did not even make the Associated
Press All-State team.
</P>
<P>
   Bird will be inducted Oct. 2 and said Tuesday, in a news
conference from Market Square Arena, that he wants Bill Fitch, his
first pro coach, to be one of his escorts. Inductees are allowed
two, one of whom must be a member of the Hall of Fame. Fitch is
not. Bird said he'd think about the matter over the summer. But
although he'll go in as a Boston Celtic, he may not automatically
select a Boston Hall of Famer as his other escort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Boston days are over,'' he said, adding he'd be in town for
about a week this summer for some appearances. ``I had some great
times there, but it's time for me to move on. I'm back here (in
Indiana) now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird also revealed he would be back to coach the team next
season, not that there was much doubt. He said the Pacers have the
necessary ingredients to go all the way ``and I'm going to give it
another go'' to see if he can bring a title to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame notification came early Monday and Bird said,
``I didn't have to tell anyone. They all knew.'' He relayed a story
from a few days ago when his son, Conor, saw his father on the
cover of a Wheaties box.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said his son thinks of him as a coach. ``Why are you on the
Wheaties box?'' Conor asked his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Conor may be one of the few people who don't know. Bird was a
mortal lock to make it on his first try. He did say that he
benefited from being on good teams, championship teams, with great
teammates. ``Even Danny Ainge was there,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``it's one of the greatest things to happen to a
sports figure. I guess it means my career is offically over, which
is good.''
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding, of course. There were a number of times this
season that Bird was asked if wished he could have gone in and
bailed out his team.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he was disappointed not to be going in with
Magic Johnson. That would have been the case had Magic not made his
ill-advised return to the Lakers in 1996. Magic now must wait until
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. I beat him there. I'm there and he's not,'' Bird
said. Then, seriously, he said, ``it would have been nice, but
there are four other people who are going in with me who also are
deserving. I'm happy to be in the company I'm in. I'm sure in a
couple years, Magic will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bird will be there to show him the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought much about the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``When
I was growing up, I was always told that I wasn't big enough,
wasn't strong enough, wasn't quick enough and couldn't jump. I
fooled them, didn't I?''

CELTICS CUT EDNEY LOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven months ago, Rick Pitino called Tyus Edney his best point
guard. Now the 5-foot-10-inch Edney is looking for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that surprised no one, the Celtics chose not to
exercise their option on Edney's contract Tuesday. That means one
of the heroes of UCLA's 1995 championship team is free to sign with
anyone he chooses. The Celtics did retain Bruce Bowen, a 6-7
defensive specialist who can play small forward and shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino spoke highly of Edney publicly but was often frustrated
with the guard, who spent a total of 10 months in Boston. The coach
said he wanted a point guard with a more vocal court personality,
and that was not Edney's style. When the team acquired Kenny
Anderson in late February, Edney became less of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the point guard, who many believed the Celtics signed as
part of the Chris Mills deal (Mills and Edney have the same agent
in Arn Tellem), has the unenviable task of looking for work when
the entire league is shut down for the summer. The NBA lockout,
which officially began today, makes it illegal for any team to
contact free agents. Another reason this is not a great time for
Edney to go job hunting: His wife is expecting a child next month.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout isn't helping the Celtics, either. The team would
like to monitor the progress of Anderson and his sore knees. Word
is that Anderson is not healing as quickly as he or the team would
like. But the guard cannot be treated by the team's medical staff
until the lockout is lifted.

TEXAS HAS TROUBLE GETTING TEEN ANTI-CIGARETTE MESSAGE OUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ First, the good news for health officials:
Hundreds of tobacco industry billboards in Texas are coming down
this month, to be replaced by ads discouraging teen-agers from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the not-so-good news: For starters, only six billboards in
the state will carry the anti-cigarette message.
</P>
<P>
   A new state law may try to crack down on teen smoking, but
getting the message out is not an easy matter, health officials
admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to buy a whole lot more (billboards) if the
funding comes in,'' said Ed Rivera, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Health's office of tobacco prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program has never had a whole lot of money for these
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   That will change if the state's $15.3 billion settlement with
the tobacco industry becomes final and the Legislature follows
Attorney General Dan Morales' recommendation to set aside $200
million of the first-year tobacco payments for the anti-smoking
education program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot with $200 million,'' said Morales spokesman
Ron Dusek.
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, health officials are relying largely on free
public service announcements on television and radio and on space
donated by billboard companies. They hope to have six billboards up
within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first went up in Austin, on a major thoroughfare a few miles
from the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're under 18, tobacco has serious side effects,'' the ad
warns. Just beneath the headline is a large image of a teen-ager's
driver's license with the word, ``suspended,'' stamped on it in
bold, red letters.
</P>
<P>
   A new law, which went into effect Jan. 1, provides that minors
caught smoking or possessing tobacco products can be fined as much
as $250 or have their driver's licenses suspended for as long as
six months.
</P>
<P>
   They also can be required to take a tobacco education course.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tobacco settlement, which was announced only a few
weeks after the crackdown on teen smoking went into effect,
cigarette companies are to remove the remainder of their billboards
in Texas by July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 1,000 billboards the industry had in Texas
when the settlement was negotiated already have come down, Dusek
said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Huang, chief of the state health department's bureau of
chronic disease prevention and control, said the removal deadline
will mark a ``major milestone in the reduction of marketing tobacco
products directly or indirectly to Texas children.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang said the health department's anti-smoking campaign ``can't
hope to stack up against the hundreds of millions of dollars that
the tobacco industry spends marketing products to Texas children.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the state program was an important step in
``educating young Texans about this new side effect of tobacco, the
possibility of losing their driver's licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said the health department's current annual budget for
fighting youth smoking was about $300,000. He said much of the
money was spent earlier this year on paid radio spots, the
production of a TV public service announcement and ``grass-roots''
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco payments to the state, which could significantly boost
funding for the effort, have been delayed by a dispute over
lawyers' fees in the tobacco case and efforts by counties and
hospital districts to share in the settlement proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they didn't know how many teen-agers have
been ticketed for smoking since the new law went into effect
because the Department of Public Safety doesn't track that offense.
But the DPS reported that 26 teen-agers had had their driver's
licenses suspended by the end of May for failing to successfully
complete a tobacco education course.
</P>
<P>
   Health department officials said more than 900 youths have taken
the course, which is usually ordered for teen-agers cited for
smoking.

CROATIA DEFEATS ROMANIA, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France -- Croatia is a small country with big people.
Since the average height of Croat males is about 6 feet, it is
unsurprising the country has produced some impressive basketball
players.
</P>
<P>
   But for every Drazen Petrovic and Dino Radja there are dozens of
high-level, high-salaried, soccer players. And they helped unify a
large and vocal part of the country by taking a 1-0 victory over
Romania Tuesday. The Croats will meet Germany in the quarterfinals
in Lyon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small country but we have a good team and we play for
our country,'' defender Slaven Bilic said. ``We had a lot of
respect for Romania. But the whole team decided to sit back because
we knew how dangerous (Gheorge) Hagi can be.''
</P>
<P>
   They had the support of thousands of Croat fans at Parc Lescure,
who celebrated their relatively recently reacquired national
identity with an impressive ode to ``Hrvatska.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Section Virage began singing ``Oh, Oho, Volim Te
Hrvatsko!'' (``I Love You Croatia'') with 20 minutes remaining in
the match. It was an impressive expression of affection for their
country, but it was also a successful attempt to overcome the
Argentinian fans' 15-minute homage during Argentina's 1-0 victory
over Croatia last week.
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive, the Croat fans continued the chant for
another 10 minutes after the game, overcoming amplified strains of
Kool and the Gang and Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats were rambunctious, but good-natured, unlike the
Yugoslav supporters who battled in Toulouse the previous night.
Neither group had complaints about the refereeing. In fact, the
Croats might offer honorary citizenship to Argentinian Javier (The
Sheriff) Castrilli, who awarded a penalty after a questionable
clash between Croatia's Aljosa Asanovic and Gabriel Popescu,
converted by Davor Suker in the 45th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute before the penalty, Popescu had been
cautioned for a foul on Mario Stanic. Castrilli made a dramatic
demonstration of the yellow card as Popescu waved him away in
disgust. After the game, two Romanian players briefly confronted
Castrilli in the center circle before being led away by substitute
goalkeeper Florian Prunea.
</P>
<P>
   Popescu then was marking Asanovic just inside the penalty area
as a pass was dummied through the penalty arc. Asanovic fell with a
flourish and Castrilli signaled the penalty. Suker twice converted,
the first time negated by Stanic encroaching into the penalty arc.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians struggled both with the Croats' size and their
defensive compactness, plus the style of Castrilli. They were
unable to capitalize on their quickness, and the creativeness of
Gheorgi Hagi seemed to bog down, stifled by the heat and
physicality of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hagi, the Istanbul-based midfielder whose relatives own a
Northern California pizza parlor, departed early in the second half
as Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu grasped the desperateness of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Iordanescu, whose next assignment is to coach the national team
of Greece, went to four attackerws early in the second half,
substituting Hagi in the 12th minute. In the 32d minute, Romania
went to two defenders, and began creating chances.
</P>
<P>
   But the gamble failed as Croatia remained organized in defense.
Croatia might have increased the lead, as Zvonimir Boban and Petar
Krpan had point-blank chances on the edge of the goal area stopped
by Bogdan Stelea in the 47th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians had captured imaginations by defeating England,
then created even more interest by peroxiding their hair, keeping a
promise that they would match their heads to a color of their flag.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia had no such gimmicks, just solid play from defensive
midfielder Krunoslav Jurcic, and enough danger in attack with
Boban, Suker and Goran Vlaovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are going to play even better,'' Bilic said. ``We have
to play better against Germany; they will be the favorite because
they are Germany. Two years ago we lost to them in England but we
were the better team.''

REP. FRANK, COMPANION, SPLITTING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat who is a homosexual and an active supporter of gay rights,
has ended his relationship with Herb Moses, his longtime companion.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has been candid about his personal life and often
referred to Moses as his ``spouse,'' confirmed reports of the
breakup in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be separating. ... We'll be selling our house in the
near future,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank disclosed his homosexuality in 1987, saying, ``I have
nothing to hide, nothing to advertise.'' He and Moses often
appeared together at congressional functions and White House social
events. They told journalists that they thought of themselves as
married.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in
1973 and to Congress in 1980, Frank has worked hard to dispel
stereotypes about gays. He spoke in public about his 10 1/2-year
relationship with Moses, and defied criticism from Senator Jesse
Helms of North Carolina and other conservative foes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Quarterly's authoritative guide, ``Politics in
America 1998,'' says Frank was the first member of Congress to
announce his homosexuality. In interviews, Frank and Moses also
said they wanted to be role models for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Frank said, members of Congress had been afraid to
say they were gay, and so they invented excuses when they were seen
with partners. ``These were people who had you believe that they
were heterosexual and became homosexual when they were drunk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, a potter, worked as an economist at the Department of
Agriculture before the two met. The separation is amicable, Frank
said.

 &HT;    Expert wants vaccine to aid infected
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva
</P>
<P>
   A long-sought vaccine against AIDS could not only protect the
uninfected against acquiring HIV _ it also could keep those who are
infected with HIV from developing the symptoms of AIDS, a leading
researcher said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New
York told the 12th World AIDS Congress that vaccine compounds now
being researched could have the additional benefit of restoring
immune function in HIV-infected people, allowing them to reduce the
highly toxic, virus-suppressing drugs they take.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategy is to give these individuals candidate vaccines
... to see if they could be brought into remission,'' Ho said.
``The spread of the virus, upon activation, would be well
controlled by heightened immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A trial of the concept has already been designed using an
experimental HIV vaccine in development by Pasteur Merieux
Connaught, said Ho, who declined to specify when it might be
launched.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, Ho said, would be to use the potent but toxic
multi-drug cocktails to reduce the levels of virus in a patient's
body; then, when that goal is achieved, to strengthen that
patient's resistance to HIV by inoculating him with a vaccine.
Theoretically, the immune-strengthening action of the vaccine would
allow the patient's system to keep the reduced levels of virus at
bay without help from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, which comes from one of the best-known and also
most-outspoken AIDS scientists, theoretically answers two problems
in HIV treatment: how to fight the virus once it retreats into
hiding places in the body, and how to sustain patients through the
many years of therapy with highly toxic, hard-to-take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of a working HIV vaccine is at least a decade away,
AIDS vaccine experts and advocates say, but more than 40 candidates
are in various stages of testing.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the potential of an immune-based approach to
dealing with HIV, Ho cited the few documented patients, including a
German, who have stopped anti-viral drug therapy yet remain in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the apparent remission of these patients, Ho said,
``It is a state that is achievable, naturally, although rare.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and another prominent AIDS researcher, Dr. Anthony Fauci,
stressed that the absence of detectable HIV in some patients,
whether on drug therapy or not, does not mean they are cured. All
HIV-positive people have viral reservoirs, from which HIV could
again conquer the body.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution to this problem is to intensify drug
regimens, Ho said. But the extreme toxicity of these drugs may make
that difficult for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci emphasized that despite the promising outlook, he does not
recommend that patients with undetectable levels of virus quit
taking their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence right now that you can stop therapy,''
Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher called for
televised condom commercials. ``In a country where sex is happening
everywhere _ movies, TV, everywhere you can imagine _ when it comes
to addressing it, frankly, we have some way to go,'' he said.
Satcher emphasized the need to ``deal with AIDS in a realistic way,
not just stress the need for abstinence.''

100 BEST FOREIGN FILMS  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE FRIDAY, JULY 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I used to tell people my top-10 list had 40 movies
on it. It's a common problem. We all like to make lists, but
there's never enough room.
</P>
<P>
   So when the American Film Institute recently decided to list the
hundred greatest films, they restricted it to American films _ or
at least they say they did. Somehow, a few English films made the
list. But no foreign language films did.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves us a whole universe of movies not eligible,
including some of the best ever made.
</P>
<P>
   So, this week, in response, we are providing the list of 100
best foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these films are established classics, and if you worry
that the list has too many of the ``usual suspects,'' I hope I have
included enough eccentric personal choices to give everyone
something to talk about. That, after all, is the purpose of such a
list.
</P>
<P>
   The movies on this list were chosen for several reasons. Some
are among the greatest artistic creations of our civilization.
Others are on the list because of their enormous influence on other
filmmakers. Still others are just such fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me, if you think all foreign films are dreary and
boring, you haven't been watching the right ones. Admittedly,
French or German films are more likely to investigate the outer
reaches of alienation and philosophy than Hollywood films, but you
will never find better battle scenes than in Akira Kurosawa's
``Ran.'' You will be hard pressed to find more suspense than in the
last half-hour of Georges-Henri Clouzot's ``Diabolique.'' And if
it's blowing things up you are after, check out Clouzot's ``Wages
of Fear,'' in which Yves Montand and a bunch of toughs drive a
truck full of nitroglycerine 300 miles over unpaved South American
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I don't want to gloss over the difference between American
and foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   I have always made the distinction between what I call
``Hollywood films'' and ``real movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The real movie is about being human, about relationships,
character, moral issues and historical and philosophical meaning.
Hollywood movies are about blowing things up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are foreign-made Hollywood movies by my definition,
and Hollywood-made real movies: One thinks of spaghetti Westerns on
one hand, and of Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Conversation'' or
John Ford's ``The Searchers'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   At least one film manages to play both sides of the field: AFI's
No. 1 film, ``Citizen Kane'' manages like nothing else I know, to
join seamlessly the slick Hollywood side with the depth and
character development of a ``real movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As critic Pauline Kael has said, it is one of the few great
movies that is also great fun.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, foreign filmmakers play out their creativity
in a larger world, with more possibilities and fewer hidebound
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hollywood (begin ital) earned (end ital) its
reputation as the manufacturer of the shallow happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   My list of the 100-best foreign films is a very personal list,
drawn from a lifetime of watching movies. I expect you have your
own films to nominate. But these are the ones I came up with.
</P>
<P>
   First on my list is ``Children of Paradise,'' which is more like
a full-length novel than any other film I know. It has a rich cast
of characters and follows them over many years. And as in
``Brothers ``Karamazov,'' each character also embodies a different
philosophy. It is a very full movie.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the Paris of the 1840s, it tells the tale of Baptiste
Debureau and the theatrical world in which he lived. It is also
about love, art and social class.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Kane'' manages to mix high and low successfully, so does
``Children of Paradise,'' in its own way. It has something of the
sweep of ``Gone With the Wind,'' the passion of ``From Here
</P>
<P>
   to Eternity'' and the wit of ``Ninotchka''.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a film you can grow with rather than out of. When I
was fresh out of college, I identified with the idealistic
Baptiste; after a few marriages, I took the practical Frederick
Lemaitre's attitude toward relationships; nowadays, I uncomfortably
find myself more in the cynical Pierre-Francois Lacenaire.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Renoir's ``Rules of the Game'' might just as well claim the
top spot. No other film is as deft at showing the disjunction
between what our impulses are and what society demands of us.
</P>
<P>
   Cocteau's ``Orphee'' is also a great deal of fun, playing with
all the tricks of cinema to create visual magic. What you see is
likely to remain in your memory forever.
</P>
<P>
   Fellini's ``8 1/2'' begins with the same kind of magic, a dream
sequence that you can't get out of your mind, but it continues on
to be about a film director that doesn't know what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Samurai'' is a pure action film, the model for the
Western, ``The Magnificent Seven,'' but much, much better. You
actually care about these characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potemkin'' is one of those seminal films that invent the
language of cinema. What is all the more astonishing is that this
Soviet propaganda film actually plays down the more sensational
aspects of the affair. If it had been truer to history, it would
have felt more simply propagandistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Passion of Joan of Arc'' is not the most consistently good
film. It has stretches of languors, but when the camera is on the
face of Maria Falconetti, in the only film she ever made, the
intensity is literally unbearable. It is the face of human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's ``Ran'' is a Japanese retelling of Shakespeare's
``King Lear,'' and shows the director at the absolute peak of his
powers, with the best battle sequences ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dietrich sings ``Falling in Love Again'' in ``The Blue
Angel,'' which makes ``Cabaret'' look
</P>
<P>
   like ``Gidget Goes to the Weimar Republic.'' Steamy, smoky,
atmospheric, its director, Josef von Sternberg _ an American _
never did anything so good again.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a serious commitment of time and attention to sit
through Andre Tarkovsky's ``Andrei Rublev,'' but you will know you
have experienced something worth your effort, as the director takes
us through a brutal vision of life and the place in it for both art
and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, almost any of the next 25 or 30 could legitimately
make it to the top 10, but I'll stand with the ones I have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like ``Jules and Jim'' or ``Amarcord'' are pure pleasure
to watch. Others, such as ``Rashomon'' or ``Wild Strawberries''
have at their core a moral vision. And still others, such as ``The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and ``Metropolis'' are simply visionary.
</P>
<P>
   You will find intensity, passion, intellect, visuals, acting and
directing the equal or better of anything from Hollywood. What you
will not find are giant lizards and serial car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   A few, such as ``Henry V'' and ``The Mahabharata'' are
unabashedly theatrical, using their staginess as a style.
</P>
<P>
   There are few British films on my list: AFI threw me a curve and
included several on their list. So, ``Third Man,'' ``Dr.
Strangelove'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia'' are not here, although
they would have been.
</P>
<P>
   You will discover that a handful of directors made the majority
of these films. I cannot apologize for that. I made the list
without considering authorship. As it turns out, Ingmar Bergman
shows up a dozen times; Kurosawa, 10. Francois Truffaut and
Federico Fellini follow up with seven and five films.

   Does this mean Bergman is the greatest director? No. He has made
many great films, but he is more prone to self-parody than any
other important director and when he is bad _ as in the miserable
Elliot Gould film, ``The Touch,'' he comes close to rivaling Ed
Wood.

 &HT;    Expert wants vaccine to aid infected
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva
</P>
<P>
   A long-sought vaccine against AIDS could not only protect the
uninfected against acquiring HIV _ it also could keep those who are
infected with HIV from developing the symptoms of AIDS, a leading
researcher said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New
York told the 12th World AIDS Congress that vaccine compounds now
being researched could have the additional benefit of restoring
immune function in HIV-infected people, allowing them to reduce the
highly toxic, virus-suppressing drugs they take.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategy is to give these individuals candidate vaccines
... to see if they could be brought into remission,'' Ho said.
``The spread of the virus, upon activation, would be well
controlled by heightened immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A trial of the concept has already been designed using an
experimental HIV vaccine in development by Pasteur Merieux
Connaught, said Ho, who declined to specify when it might be
launched.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, Ho said, would be to use the potent but toxic
multi-drug cocktails to reduce the levels of virus in a patient's
body; then, when that goal is achieved, to strengthen that
patient's resistance to HIV by inoculating him with a vaccine.
Theoretically, the immune-strengthening action of the vaccine would
allow the patient's system to keep the reduced levels of virus at
bay without help from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, which comes from one of the best-known and also
most-outspoken AIDS scientists, theoretically answers two problems
in HIV treatment: how to fight the virus once it retreats into
hiding places in the body, and how to sustain patients through the
many years of therapy with highly toxic, hard-to-take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of a working HIV vaccine is at least a decade away,
AIDS vaccine experts and advocates say, but more than 40 candidates
are in various stages of testing.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the potential of an immune-based approach to
dealing with HIV, Ho cited the few documented patients, including a
German, who have stopped anti-viral drug therapy yet remain in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the apparent remission of these patients, Ho said,
``It is a state that is achievable, naturally, although rare.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and another prominent AIDS researcher, Dr. Anthony Fauci,
stressed that the absence of detectable HIV in some patients,
whether on drug therapy or not, does not mean they are cured. All
HIV-positive people have viral reservoirs, from which HIV could
again conquer the body.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution to this problem is to intensify drug
regimens, Ho said. But the extreme toxicity of these drugs may make
that difficult for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci emphasized that despite the promising outlook, he does not
recommend that patients with undetectable levels of virus quit
taking their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence right now that you can stop therapy,''
Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher called for
televised condom commercials. ``In a country where sex is happening
everywhere _ movies, TV, everywhere you can imagine _ when it comes
to addressing it, frankly, we have some way to go,'' he said.
Satcher emphasized the need to ``deal with AIDS in a realistic way,
not just stress the need for abstinence.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Max Lager's among best of brew crew
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Max Lager's, the new brewpub in Atlanta, opened last
spring, it almost immediately invited worldwide criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after its opening, the International Craft Beer Conference
brought a thousand or more people to Atlanta, many eager to compare
notes on the city's brewpubs. Not everyone who came to Max Lager's
for a hospitality night was impressed, although most had the good
sense to realize it was too early to judge. Like any other
restaurant, a brewpub needs a few weeks to iron out the inevitable
wrinkles, whether they're in the kitchen, the brewery or the
service.
</P>
<P>
   But now a couple of months have passed, and no one says it's too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   That won't hurt Max Lager's in the least. The wrinkles are gone.
By any standard but parking, Max Lager's is one of the two or three
best brewpubs in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at brewpubs in three ways,'' says Phil Doersam,
the publisher of Southern Draft Brew News, a trade paper based in
Canton, Ga. ``How good is the beer? How good is the food? And how
comfortable is the atmosphere?''
</P>
<P>
   The beer might be better at one place, but the food tastier at
another. In still another, the atmosphere might be cozy, but the
beer disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that will disappoint at Max Lager's _ only the
parking. The food is good and the two-story red brick structure has
a funky proletarian feel (upscale grunge?), with an informal bar
upstairs and a casual dining area downstairs. ``It's like a place
you'd find in Seattle,'' says Doersam.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but John Roberts and his assistant, Chris
Terenzi, are brewing assertive beers like those in the Pacific
Northwest. And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   The hoppiest beer on tap, the pale ale, is one of the hottest
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same experience that Doug Nace has had as head brewer
at Percy's Fish House, where the intensely hoppy pale ale sells out
with nothing but word-of-mouth advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a lesson here. At many brewpubs, the limpest
offering on tap is the house leader, a fact that usually
embarrasses the brewer. Sometimes it can be attributed to
demographics, but other times it's just a failure of nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nace, Roberts and Terenzi don't believe in dumbing down
their beers or patronizing their customers. ``John and I are
hopheads _ no question,'' Terenzi says.
</P>
<P>
   They've got enough confidence to turn a brown ale, a
traditionally subdued style, into something you might come upon in
hop-happy Oregon or Washington. A brown ale, in fact, isn't a style
that much interested me until I found what Roberts and Terenzi
could do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Roberts is a part-owner tells you he's not some
rogue brewer mindless of the bottom line. But he believes there's a
market for more adventurous beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target market,'' he says, ``is the convention people
staying in the hotels downtown and the downtown business people who
come for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, you could see customers of another kind,
20-somethings _ male and female _ who were into sampling different
styles. A beer getting a strong response from that crowd was the
Belgian White Ale, an aromatic, dryish, faintly citrusy beer
designed by Terenzi. ``You gotta taste this,'' one woman was
telling another.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to note the irony of their taking to ales in a
place whose name suggests lagers. The name originated with Allan
Leblanc, one of Roberts' partners. ``I was working in Boston last
year and he called me up one night and said, `Tell me if you like
this _ Max Lager's.' He thought it had a strong sound, and I said,
`Yeah, I like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later Roberts, who once worked at Atlanta Brewing
Co., was back in Georgia laying the groundwork for downtown's first
brewpub. Now all he and his partners need to do is find a way for
people to park. The tiny lot in the back has fewer than two dozen
spaces, and each costs $3.50 during the day and $4 at night.
</P>
<P>
   If Max Lager's can solve its parking problems, people who might
have spent the evening in Midtown or Buckhead will be heading
downtown. Some already are.

 &HT;    America loves ice cream so much, it can't get enough flavors.
Garlic, anyone?
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flavor of the day is beer. That's right, beer. A restaurant
called wanting beer ice cream for an all-beer dinner promotion. The
cream-meisters at Greenwood Ice Cream didn't flinch; after all, the
Atlanta company was making uncommon ice creams long before Ben met
Jerry. A rich vanilla base, some Guinness stout and _ voila! _ beer
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Mitchell Williams, Greenwood's president,
asks his production manager as they huddle over a sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tastes like vanilla to me,'' says Jackie McGhee.
</P>
<P>
   Williams dips into the carton and tries it himself. ``Yeah,
that's subtle,'' he agrees, ``but it could have been hideous. It
just goes to show that there's no such thing as a bad ice cream
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's right, judging from the way Americans scarf down ice
cream. This nation, founded on the pursuit of happiness in all its
flavors, is the undisputed ice cream capital of the world.
According to the International Ice Cream Association, a trade group
based in (where else?) Washington, the average American eats almost
5 gallons of ice cream a year, 1 1/2 more than any other
nationality. The eating peaks in July, the season of our
independence, also remembered for the Baskin-Robbins bicentennial
flavor of the month, Valley Forge Fudge.
</P>
<P>
   Apple pie, my eye. Ice cream is the real national dessert. It's
as American as French vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks America invented ice cream. We didn't. We just
made it better than anyone else,'' says Ed Marks of Lancaster, Pa.,
who founded a national ice cream fan club called the Ice Screamers.
(The highlight of their annual convention last weekend was a
banquet with palate-twisters such as roasted garlic ice cream.)
</P>
<P>
   True, Americans didn't invent ice cream. The Italians, Chinese
and others had been making something like it for centuries by the
time George Washington bought a ``cream machine for ice'' in 1784.
But the country he parented took to the frozen dessert with
ravenous ingenuity. Americans invented one of the first ice cream
makers (1842), the first ice cream soda (1874), the first ice cream
scooper (1878), the first ice cream sundae (1881), the first ice
cream cone (1896), the first soft-serve ice cream (1938) and, for
all we know, the first Guinness stout ice cream (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Changing with America
</P>
<P>
   Americans love ice cream so much that they seem to view almost
anything edible as an eligible flavor. This democratic belief in
giving every taste a chance ripples through our history. More than
a century ago, Delmonico's restaurant feted the well-heeled of
Manhattan with flavors like asparagus and pumpernickel rye.
Fast-forward to the 1920s, and there's Howard Johnson churning 28
flavors under his first orange roof in Massachusetts. Another half
a century, and Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are in Vermont
throwing everything from candy bars to trail mix into ice cream,
dreaming up names like Chubby Hubby and Rainforest Crunch. No
wonder David Letterman did a Top Ten list about the flavors they
supposedly rejected, including ``Rocky Roadkill'' and ``Cookies 'n'
Crack.''
</P>
<P>
   The craving for ever more flamboyant ice cream flavors has only
accelerated as more ice cream makers turn up in homes. Americans
buy between 1 1/2 million and 2 million units a year, most of them
electric, meaning we don't even have to turn a crank anymore to
customize frozen desserts according to our every whim and dietary
requirement. ``I make it with goat milk, and I don't use so much
sugar,'' says Gail Damerow, who lives on a farm in Gainesboro,
Tenn., and wrote the book ``Ice Cream! The Whole Scoop''
(Glenbridge, 1991).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, culinary professionals titillate their customers with
herbs and spices that are unexpected in a frozen dessert. Sarah
Koob, the pastry chef at Van Gogh's restaurant in Roswell, Ga.,
does lavender peppercorn ice cream. Kathryn King at Hedgerose in
Buckhead makes an opal basil. Out of a Flower, a Dallas-based
boutique ice cream maker, specializes in potpourri flavors such as
Rose Geranium Blossoms and Ginger Spiced Tea (its products are sold
locally at Pano's Food Shop). ``Rosemary ice cream tastes better on
apple pie than vanilla,'' says co-owner Michel Bernard Platz.
</P>
<P>
   More than 31 flavors
</P>
<P>
   But no one has taken the flavor chase further than
Baskin-Robbins, the international ice cream shop chain whose ``31
flavors'' sign (one for each day of the month) doesn't begin to
tell the story. Baskin-Robbins has been churning out flavors for
more than 50 years, from the classic (French vanilla, introduced in
1945) to the trendy (Coffee Biscotti Chocolately, 1997) to the
topical (Lunar Cheesecake, 1969) to the regrettable (Dirt 'n'
Worms, a recent kiddie flavor with gummy worms candy). Years ago,
when ice cream lover Fidel Castro boasted that Cuba would soon
create more flavors than America, Irv Robbins took patriotic
offense and phoned El Supremo's minister of information to tell him
that Baskin-Robbins alone had 290 varieties. Now there are 856
entries in the company's flavor guide, a bound volume that must
read like the encyclopedia of instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The job of dreaming up a dozen or more new flavors a year falls
to the Baskin-Robbins flavor committee. At company headquarters in
Glendale, Calif., 15 employees meet twice a month at a conference
table strewn with pink plastic spoons. They toss around ideas drawn
from taste trends, pop culture, commercial tie-ins. Then it's fun
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of tasting,'' says John Anderson, a marketing exec
who just finished a stint as committee chairman. ``We conceptualize
a flavor and give it to the R&AMP;D department. They bring back several
versions, and we taste them all to agree on a direction. Then R&AMP;D
takes it back to the drawing board. It might take six months to get
it to the store.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds a bit like engineering a new car, remember
the end product. Anderson proudly claims credit for last July's
flavor, Stars, Stripes and Exploding Bites, a multichromed
confection that included Pop Rocks candy (but no cherry bombs).
Fire Ants _ with red hots candy _ never made it out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   A testing committee
</P>
<P>
   The flavor engineering is more informal at Greenwood, Atlanta's
premier maker of fine and unusual ice creams. ``We grab whoever's
around for tasting,'' says company president Williams. ``A truck
driver's opinion is as valid as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood doesn't sell retail. It makes ice cream for
restaurants, private clubs and a well-known local chain of ice
cream parlors that used to make its own. The lemon custard ice
cream at the Varsity comes from Greenwood. So does much of the
green tea, ginger and Azuki bean ice cream you find in Asian
restaurants around town.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood makes some 200 varieties at its small plant. Make that
201. A worker was mixing a batch of raspberry-vanilla recently and
picked up some banana flavoring by accident. ``Banana-raspberry,''
Williams considered when the mistake was brought to his desk.
``That should be pretty good.'' It was.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1952 by Charles Greenwood, a
candymaker from Philadelphia who didn't like the local ice cream
when he moved south to retire. His family sold out during the
1980s. Williams, a wiry, tightly wound 36-year-old MBA who freely
admits that he's never milked a cow, bought into the business with
a friend and has run it for the past seven years. No flavor request
surprises him anymore. Chefs have asked for clove, prickly pear,
blackberry beaujolais black pepper _ you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one request made him cringe. A Florida nursing home called
to see whether Greenwood could make creamed corn ice cream. ``That
one,'' Williams says, ``might have been pushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to basics
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks the fascination with novel flavors is a good
thing. At the Four Seas on Cape Cod, one of the most famous ice
cream stands in New England, owner Dick Warren refuses to play the
Ben &AMP; Jerry's game. ``When you put candy in ice cream, it tastes
like candy,'' he says. ``All these ripples and chunky monkeys _ you
don't need them.''
</P>
<P>
   He abruptly stops the speech to take a call from another part of
his brain. ``Of course, Ben and Jerry have made millions doing
that, so maybe I'm the stupid one.''
</P>
<P>
   They're even more fundamentalist at Doumar's Cones and Barbecue
in Norfolk, Va., a drive-in with a special place in ice cream
history. Abe Doumar was a Lebanese immigrant who was among the
first to make ice cream cones, at the turn of the century. The
restaurant still uses his 90-year-old, propane-powered griddle
conemaker. And it still serves, as always, only six flavors of ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for having so few varieties are both practical and
philosophical, says Abe's nephew, Albert Doumar. ``My curb
waitresses don't write down orders. If I started piling on flavors,
there'd be trouble in the parking lot because they can remember
only so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he adds, ``vanilla is the only real ice cream. All
that other stuff is fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans apparently concede the point. For as long as the
industry has kept track, the nation's favorite flavor _ and it
isn't close _ has been vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   They never say which kind of vanilla.

 &HT;    Art on Wheels - Birmingham Museum of Art
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   There's new magic in Alabama's ``Magic City,'' supplied not by
glowing steel mills as in earlier decades, but by some fun
attractions that will enhance Birmingham's appeal to vacationers
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the landmark iron statue of Vulcan atop Red
Mountain, you can survey the forested urban valley and pick out
your prime destinations: a sprawling new theme park, a space-age
science center carved from an old department store, and a big,
sleek art museum that vies with the High in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   -- VisionLand, which opened May 28 in suburban Bessemer, is 35
acres of thrill rides and an elaborate water park, a Disney-style
village of shops and restaurants with touches of old steel mill and
mining decor. I found the Rampage wooden roller coaster to be a
white-knuckle couple of minutes, with a steeper first dip (120
feet) and a smoother track than the Great American Scream Machine
at Six Flags Over Georgia. A delegation from American Coaster
Enthusiasts ranked it among the nation's Top 20, impressed by its
``air time'' _ those moments when riders feel as if they're going
to fly out of their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Financed as a public corporation, VisionLand is aptly named, for
without the persistent, nine-year ``vision'' of Larry Langford,
mayor of suburban Fairfield, the $65 million park would still be
abandoned U.S. Steel scrubland. Langford wheedled $5 million in
seed money from Birmingham and 10 other municipalities in Jefferson
County, enough to persuade the state Legislature to authorize a $60
million bond issue to build Alabama's first major amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   A religious man whose next vision is to be the first black
president, Langford likes to quote the Bible. ```Where there is no
vision, the people perish.' _ Proverbs 29:18. That's my motto.
That's why VisionLand became a reality.'' And, as chairman of the
West Jefferson Entertainment Authority, Langford already wants to
triple the size of VisionLand to more than 100 acres, adding an
aquarium, a civil rights museum, an antique car museum, an outlet
shopping center, a movie complex and more rides.
</P>
<P>
   Which are the best of the present 20 rides? (Six Flags, by
comparison, has 32.) Besides the Rampage, try the Sky Wheel, a
106-foot-tall Ferris wheel that looms over the piney woods; Marvel
Mania, a steel roller coaster scaled down for children; and Cahaba
Falls, a tricky glide-and-splash down a log flume.
</P>
<P>
   Even more popular is the water park, known as Steel Waters (pun
alert!), where kids of all ages float on fat yellow inner tubes
down an Oz-like version of the nearby Warrior River, through caves
and past exotic islands. Squeals of delight come from Tower Works _
full of pumps, geysers and water gags _ when a huge bucket
overturns to splash swimmers below.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the admission price _ $21 for adults, $18 for
children _ that has kept weekend attendance somewhat below the
expected 10,000 a day. But Langford isn't worried. He says that
daily crowds of even 4,000 would be a ``payload.'' And visitors
seem to think the park is worth it. ``This is great!'' said
11-year-old Chuck Ramsey of Mountain Brook, Ala., emerging from the
Warrior River ride. ``We don't have to go to Six Flags or White
Water (in Georgia) any more.''
</P>
<P>
   VisionLand, I-20/59 west, Exit 108 and follow the signs. Open 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Admission $21 adults, $18 senior citizens
and children under 48 inches tall. Season passport (to Nov. 1) $60.
Parking $4. Call 205-481-4750.
</P>
<P>
   -- The McWane Center will be one of the South's largest science
and technology museums when it opens July 11, in a
gleaming-like-new art deco landmark, the old Loveman's Department
Store. It's billed as the anchor attraction needed to revitalize
downtown Birmingham, just as Discovery Place boosted Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The McWane's star attraction is sure to be the IMAX Dome
Theater, with a jumbo movie screen (83 feet wide) and grand
circular lobby. The first show will be the critically acclaimed,
44-minute adventure film ``Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of the smaller Discovery 2000 museum a mile away,
the 150,000-square-foot McWane Center includes the ultimate in
breathtaking exhibits: the HighCycle. It allows you to test gravity
by riding a bicycle on a cable high above the grand lobby. (Don't
worry; wires and weights prevent the cycle from tipping more than
45 degrees.)
</P>
<P>
   Other wonders, laid out on three floors, include Science Quest,
with state-of-the-art, hands-on stuff (feet, too). You're invited
to test the theory that you can walk on a bed of nails without
feeling pain. You can also create your own animated movie, launch a
tennis ball into orbit, build a seven-foot arch and lift yourself
on an air cushion. Nearby is ``Lightning Strikes!'' a 45-minute
show that sends electricity crackling across the room.
</P>
<P>
   In the Challenger Learning Center, youngsters can simulate
blasting into space, with control panels and TV monitors aglow.
``Just Mice Size'' invites small children to explore and build in a
world as viewed by a mouse. The World of Water boasts tanks of sea
creatures, plus exhibits showing river, marsh and ocean habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the late James R. McWane, a local steel baron whose
family donated $10 million to spark the project, the center
preserves a touch of the Loveman's store nostalgia. You can take
the original store escalator to the glittering art deco mezzanine,
which once housed a popular restaurant and beauty shop. It's now
museum offices.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, the McWane will open with a daylong Adventure
Festival and street party, with free museum admission, live music,
a climbing wall, science demonstrations and roving characters from
history.

   -- The Birmingham Museum of Art, which has presented blockbuster
shows such as ``The First Emperor: Treasures of Ancient China,'' is
hosting a summertime treat. ``Art on Wheels,'' through Sept. 6, is
an exhibit of 25 classic motorcycles from Barber's Vintage
Motorsports Museum, Birmingham's world-renowned collection of
motorcycles. Included are such rare bikes as a Ducati and an MV
Agusta, both from Italy in the 1970s; a 1920s Indian Factory Racer
from the United States; a 1960 BMW R50 from Germany and a 1996
Britten V1000 from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   With 150,000 square feet of exhibit space, the museum has
world-class collections of Wedgwood pottery and modern Chinese
paintings. The new rooftop sculpture garden is considered a work of
art in itself. Through the winter of 1999, children are encouraged
to touch paints, easels and other materials in ``The Artist in the
Studio'' exhibit, which includes typical Renaissance and
21st-century studios. Another show due July 12-Sept. 6 is the
paintings of Tuscaloosa native William Christenberry. Unlike his
previously exhibited works, many of these paintings are startling,
large-scale abstractions that were hidden in Christenberry's attic
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham Museum of Art, 2000 Eighth Avenue North. 10 a.m.-5
p.m. Tuesday-Saturday, noon-5 p.m. Sunday. Admission free. Call

<P>
   A little mood music for ice cream making: Listen to Kathryn
King, pastry chef at Hedgerose restaurant in Buckhead, explain why
she loves the stuff so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, we'd visit my grandparents in Decatur.
They'd go to the pick-your-own farms and always had the best
peaches. We'd go in the back yard with their ice cream freezer _
one of those old hand-crank models with a wooden bucket that looked
like a barrel _ and we'd start churning. I could hardly stand to
wait. I'd serve ice cream with every dessert if I thought I could
get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it: The secret ingredient of great ice cream is
memory. Think back on the summers of your childhood, and get out
the churn.

   Silky Smooth Ginger Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 10
minutes
</P>
<P>
   This ice cream, an example of the eggless ``Philadelphia
style,'' comes from ``CookWise'' (Morrow) by Atlanta food scientist
Shirley Corriher. She credits food testers Susan Mack and Andy
Armstrong for coming up with the idea of using ginger preserves,
adding to the smooth texture.
</P>
<P>
   2cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1cup heavy or whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/8teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons ginger preserves
</P>
<P>
   In a medium-size saucepan, heat the half-and-half and cream to
just below a boil (175 degrees). Remove from heat. Stir in the
sugar, vanilla, salt and preserves. Refrigerate 4 to 12 hours, then
place in the refrigerator freezer for 5 minutes. Process in ice
cream maker following manufacturer's instructions. _ From

</P>
<P>
   It's July, it's Georgia _ isn't there some state law that says
you have to make peach ice cream? Here's a light version; we say
light because it uses honey, not sugar, and buttermilk, which,
despite its name, is lower in fat than whole milk.

</P>

   1quart half-and-half

</P>
<P>
   1/4to 1 teaspoon finely ground pink peppercorns, or to taste

</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks. Set aside. Fill another large
bowl with ice and set aside. In a stainless steel saucepan over
medium heat, scald half-and-half, sugar and vanilla. Slowly pour
hot liquid into the bowl with the yolks, whisking constantly to
avoid scrambling the eggs. Return the mixture to the saucepan and
continue to cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until the
mixture coats a spoon. Place saucepan over the bowl of ice and cool
about 15 minutes, whisking occasionally. Strain and refrigerate.
When ready to make the ice cream, add the ground pink peppercorns
and freeze according to your ice cream maker's manufacturer's
instructions. Garnish with whole peppercorns and accompany with
fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Pink peppercorns are aromatic but not very hot; even 1
teaspoon is quite subtle. The whole peppercorns make a great
garnish and taste good, too. This is a very rich ice cream;
servings should be small.

   Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2/3 quart Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 70
minutes
</P>
<P>
   India's favorite frozen dessert is a subtle ice cream that gets
its flavor from saffron, cardamom and bits of nut. Street vendors
in India sell it in cone-shaped tins or on a stick. In Atlanta,
diners can find kulfi at most Indian restaurants, where it cools
the heat of a spicy meal. This version comes from Jogi Singh, a
Dunwoody resident who grew up in New Delhi, where kulfi was as much
a part of summer as peach ice cream in Georgia. She tops it with
cornstarch noodles and rose-flavored syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of saffron
</P>
<P>
   7cups plus 2 tablespoon whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1green cardamom pod
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   10almonds, blanched and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   10 pistachios, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Soak saffron in 1 tablespoon cold milk. Set aside. In a nonstick
pan over high heat, bring 3 cups of milk to a boil, stirring
constantly. Reduce heat to medium-high and continue to stir about
30 minutes until milk thickens to consistency of mayonnaise. Set
aside. Dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon cold milk. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add cardamom seed to remaining 4 cups milk and bring to a boil
in a nonstick pan, stirring constantly, until the milk reduces to 3
cups. Add dissolved cornstarch to milk. Continue to stir until
mixture thickens to custardlike consistency. Remove cardamom. Add
sugar and dissolved saffron. Stir well. Remove from heat. Add
thickened milk and whisk until well-blended. Mix in almonds and
pistachios. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming
and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Process in ice cream maker if you want a lighter texture like
American ice cream. Indians prefer a more solid consistency, which
they get by placing the kulfi in a pan in the freezer, stirring a
couple of times while it sets.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Be sure to get green cardamom (which Indians use in
desserts), not the more common brown cardamom (used in savory
dishes). It's available at Indian markets.

</P>
<P>
   This is as close as you can get at home to making those lemon
ices that wowed Atlanta during the Olympics. The secret to making
creamy sorbet is not letting it freeze all the way through. The
sugar and vodka lower the freezing point and give the sorbet a
smoother texture.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's was the first to put raw cookie dough in ice
cream, and it became its most popular flavor.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   5large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2/3cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH:
</P>
<P>
   5tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   5tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon water
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1cup (6 ounces) miniature semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the ice cream: Heat the milk and cream to about 150
degrees in a large saucepan until it is hot and a few bubbles begin
to form. Do not boil. Put the egg yolks and sugar in the large bowl
of an electric mixer and beat at medium speed until the mixture
thickens slightly and lightens in color, about 45 seconds. Decrease
speed to low and slowly add the hot milk mixture. Return the
mixture to the saucepan and cook the custard over medium-low heat,
stirring constantly, until it reaches 170 degrees. Stir the mixture
often where the side and the bottom of the pan meet. The mixture
will thicken slightly and leave a path on the back of the spoon
when you draw your finger across it. A little steam will just begin
to rise from the custard mixture. Do not boil. Strain the hot
mixture into a bowl and stir in the vanilla. Cover and refrigerate
until very cold, about 5 hours or overnight. Stir the mixture
several times while it is chilling.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the cookie dough: Put the butter, sugars and salt in
the large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on low speed until the
mixture is smooth. Mix in the vanilla and water just until it is
incorporated. Mix in the flour just until it is incorporated. Stir
in the chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe makes 2 cups cookie dough. If you are preparing one
recipe of ice cream, you will use only 1 cup of the dough. To
freeze the remaining cup of cookie dough, put it in a plastic
freezer container and press plastic wrap onto the dough. Cover the
container. Label with the date and contents. Refrigerate up to 3
days or freeze up to 2 months. Defrost the frozen dough in the
refrigerator about 3 hours before using it.
</P>
<P>
   To double the ice cream recipe and use both cups of cookie
dough, double the ingredients for the ice cream mixture.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the ice cream: Transfer the chilled custard to an
ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's directions.
During the last 2 minutes of churning, add 1 cup of the cookie
dough, breaking the dough into pieces as you add it.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze the ice cream: Transfer ice cream to a chilled
container. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the ice cream and
cover tightly. Label with date and contents. Freeze overnight or up
to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Soften the ice cream for about 10 minutes until it
scoops easily and has a creamy texture. _ From ``Bake and Freeze

place the metal bowl on top to prevent its moving. Gradually pour
the milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Return the
mixture to the same saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook,
stirring slowly and constantly with a wooden spatula, until the
custard thickens and leaves a path on the back of the spatula when
a finger is drawn across it, about 6 minutes; do not allow to boil.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the custard through the medium-mesh sieve set over a clean

and 1 tablespoon custard. Stir until powder dissolves. Combine with
remaining custard. Refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.

<P>
   Transfer the custard to an ice cream maker and process according

 &HT;    ``Armageddon'' follows action movie formula to the letter
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's huge, destructive, unstoppable, and it's certain to blast a
hole in the United States _ at the box office, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the Texas-sized asteroid aimed at earth in
``Armageddon,'' but about any movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer:
``Bad Boys,'' ``Con Air,'' ``Days of Thunder,'' take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by guys (Tony Scott, Simon West, etc.) weaned on the
surging, flashing rhythms of music video and commercials, these
movies are basically an excuse to blow up cars and fire off
thousands of rounds of ammo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' takes the formula into orbit, turning the cars
into shuttles and space stations and swapping lethal meteorites for
bullets. While ``Deep Impact'' treated the same story (asteroid
menaces earth) with a sobriety that left some audiences squirming
for more action, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Willis plays Harry Stamper, renowned deep-core oil driller,
whose daughter Grace (Tyler) has grown up on the rig and fallen for
Dad's employee A.J. (Affleck), a guy Harry disdains as a
``roughneck.''
</P>
<P>
   After flaming space rocks lay waste to Manhattan (in a
spectacular scene that still feels familiar, thanks to ``Godzilla''
and ``Independence Day''), Harry gets tapped by NASA to join a
mission to fly into space, intercept the big rock, drill a hole in
it and nuke it. Yeah, the same thing happened in ``Deep Impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the mission is a chance for director Michael Bay
(``The Rock'') to shoot a chipper, funny montage of Willis and his
hand-picked crew training to be astronauts in an impossibly short
time. The crew includes Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, William
Fichtner and Will Patton, bringing good comic relief to the flick.
And Billy Bob Thornton turns in a strong, gravelly performance as
the Houston-based NASA man who oversees the mission from Earth.
Willis is Willis, Affleck maintains his hot-new-thing status, and
Tyler pouts a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Bruckheimer films, ``Armageddon'' is really a form of
superior product placement. But we're not talking Coke or Nike or
Blockbuster. The product being sold here is a corn-fed, corny
self-image of an America that doesn't really exist any more. It's a
landscape of rugged white churches on long green lawns, little boys
trapped in a 30-year time warp as they frolick with toy rockets and
lanky lovers stretched out under ancient trees. Everything is shot
through filters that bind these hokey images in a gold light as
thick and gooey as honey.
</P>
<P>
   When it's not being sappy, though, the flick is about toys: The
rockets, the outer space drills, the loud things the actors get to
play with. The movie is the usual Bruckheimer mix of Hallmark and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Its gee-whiz, let's-blow-something-up momentum helps you
overlook the enormous holes in the movie's plot and logic. The
rhythm kicks in early: Our heroes come close to saving the world,
but then something bad happens. They fix that problem ... then
something else happens. It's a series of starts and stops for
adrenalin junkies, a throwback to Buck Rogers cliffhangers, only
without the hanging part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is another of those flicks that likes to remind
us it's a movie. It throws in self-referential references to ``Star
Wars,'' ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``Apollo 13,'' and it borrows plot
points from ``The Abyss'' and other flicks. Then there's the pug
dog that looks like the one in ``Men in Black,'' attacking a stand
of inflatable Godzillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick. And
it's an improvement over last year's insultingly broad, incoherent
``Con Air.'' You'll see the reported $165 million budget on-screen
in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good
for you? Probably not. It translates the notion of global
destruction into the quick-thrill rhythms of a video game you
probably won't even remember the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck. Directed
by Michael Bay. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
(a young woman is found in her boyfriend's bed), some profanity. 2
hours, 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The world interpreted as a video game.

 &HT;    Turner documentry looks at film pioneer Oscar Micheaux
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first instinct people have when you show them a snapshot is
to look for themselves in the picture. Failing that, they look for
someone who looks like them.
</P>
<P>
   For black moviegoers in the early 1900s, a trip to the
neighborhood theater was painfully disappointing: there were few
black actors onscreen, and most of them were playing roles that
were buffoonish and insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Oscar Micheaux, a novelist and bootstrap entreprenuer
whose stated goal in life _ and on film _ was ``to teach that a
colored man can be anything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies is celebrating Micheaux's work and the
films of the other African-American pioneers with the documentary
``Midnight Ramble'' (8 EDT, tonight) that looks at what used to be
politely called ``race films.'' It's the first installment of the
cable network's weeklong salute to black films billed as ``A
Separate Cinema'' _ and it's a great way to start.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by James Avery, we learn that Micheaux had the crazy
notion that his books about long-ignored everyday aspects of black
life could be turned into feature films he could distribute
himself. Except it wasn't so crazy and his first effort ``The
Homesteaders'' was an instant hit with black audiences, and the
white South Dakota farmers who had been his neighbors. He went on
to make 39 others before he died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Fax, an illustrator who worked on some of the early race
films says they were significant because the characters ``weren't
always rolling their eyes, they weren't always shooting craps,
stealing chickens or turning white when they saw ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   With Micheaux's success, other black production companies
quickly popped up. More than 500 race films were made between 1910
and 1950, including everything from interracial melodramas about
``mixed marriages,'' to low-budget musicals, to wild west cowboy
adventures . They become so popular that moviegoers in large cities
like Chicago would flock to ``midnight rambles'' that lasted until
2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary also examines the influence of another kind of
race film, D.W. Griffth's ``Birth of a Nation,'' an epic paean to
the Ku Klux Klan that portrayed blacks as violent, sex-crazed
savages.
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks were outraged recently when the American Film
Institute listed ``Birth'' as one of the 100 greatest films ever
made. But in 1915 when it was first released, Griffith's film
stirred black boycotts, and even race riots.
</P>
<P>
   Well-researched and and engaging, ``Ramble'' includes interviews
with author Tony Cade Bambera, film archivist Pearl Bowser, and
actor Herb Jefferys who became a box office idol playing a Tom
Mix-type character known as ``The Bronze Buckaroo.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when black independent films are enjoying a
mini-renaissance with movies like ``Hav Plenty'' and ``Love
Jones,'' TCM's documentary brings viewers a much-needed perspective
about the history of black cinema _ proving that it didn't start
with Spike Lee. It also shows how much Hollywood has changed since
then in its portrayals of black life. And how much it hasn't.

SOAP STUDS: ASPIRING ACTORS AUDITION FOR ROLES ON NBC DAYTIME
PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRY LEE GOODRICH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ A muscular young man, clad in a tank top and
standing in a long line, flagged a woman entering Grapevine Mills
mall, then flashed her a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss? Do you have a mint in your purse?'' he asked. ``I had
tuna fish this morning _ and if I make it as far as a casting
interview, I don't want to be breathing that out.''
</P>
<P>
   No mint. But the woman proffered a small tube of toothpaste to
Jerome Johnson, a 25-year-old from Los Angeles, whose stage name is
J. Jonason.
</P>
<P>
   He squeezed some toothpaste onto his finger, swished it around
in his mouth, thanked the woman profusely and moved forward in
line.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was among nearly 900 men who congregated at Grapevine
Mills this week for an NBC-TV casting call _ and a long shot at
landing a role in a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Some men were nervous. Louis Reina, 20, of Arlington, Texas,
said he got little sleep the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Sawyer, 21, of Arlington was more laid-back. He slapped
the Post-it bearing his number _ 95 _ onto his forehead as he stood
in line, drawing chuckles from those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in theater since junior high,'' said Sawyer, a
performing arts major at the University of Texas at Arlington.
``But I just started a job waiting tables at Razzoo's. Now that's
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   A few men, such as Johnson, had acting experience (he's been in
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and in commercials), publicity photos and
resumes. Others, strolling past while shopping, got curious,
decided to take a number and try for their minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had tremendous success with casting calls at malls,''
said Annamarie Kostura, vice president of NBC Daytime's programs,
which include ``Sunset Beach,'' ``Another World'' and ``Days of Our
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this about a year and a half ago, when we launched
`Sunset Beach.' We went to five cities, and that's how we found
Jason George, who plays Michael, the sexy, hunky lifeguard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostura said Grapevine is the second of seven cities _ from
Chicago to San Diego _ that NBC is visiting to find folks who have
``the right look'' and the ability to emote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a specific role or roles in mind. But we do have
a new soap coming on the air early next week _ `Passions,' '' she
said. ``And we're constantly trying to find fresh faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The men strode in pairs up the steps and across the stage,
stopping and turning around in front of a camera ``just so we can
see how they move,'' one casting director explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then they sat at a table with casting directors for a
pre-screening, a brief chat in which they gave their names and said
why they were there. The few who got the nod went on to the next
table, where they talked a bit more, were given a script of a soap
scene and assigned a time to return to the mall's taping room.
</P>
<P>
   The men attracted plenty of attention from shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look,'' said Mindy Arthurs, 23, of Edmond, Okla. ``I'm
married.''
</P>
<P>
   That established, she noted, ``the guy with the long hair and
the suit _ he's the best one so far. And the guy in the white on
the right? He's a doll.''
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., 859 men had been through pre-screening. Fifty-one
made it to the taping room.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Compotaro, 28, of Arlington has had great luck at
so-called ``cattle calls.'' He landed a role in ``Born on the
Fourth of July,'' playing the young soldier accidentally killed by
Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise).
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't handed a script Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fared better.
</P>
<P>
   He and others who made it to the taping room were ushered in,
one by one, directed to stand between two strips of green tape and
rehearse once.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mess up, don't make a face and don't say, `Can we start
over?' '' taping supervisor Peter Sime directed. ``It's not a big
mistake to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was ``Rolling ...'' and ``Action!''
</P>
<P>
   The videotapes will be viewed later, along with those from other
cities, and a few prospective actors will be flown to Los Angeles
for screen tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really figure I'm too short, too brown and too old,'' said
Scott Latham, 40, of Dallas, who has acted in productions at Stage
West in Fort Worth and Theatre Three in Dallas. ``You don't see
much of that on the soaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figure there's always got to be that guy that runs the
coffee shop they go to, or who runs the surfboard shop and is a
little weird.''

CLINTON TAKES CASE FOR DEMOCRACY TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI -- In the heart of China, President Clinton launched
into an American-style campaign schedule Tuesday, shuttling from a
roundtable meeting to a radio talk show to a political reception _
all in an attempt to bring his case for freedom and democracy
directly to the people of China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared so much in campaign mode that by Tuesday night
he actually repeated the slogan from his 1996 reelection victory to
a gathering of dignitaries. ``In Shanghai, you are building that
bridge to the 21st century, and we want to build it with you,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton displayed the same considerable
charm that has helped him win two terms as president of the United
States. He talked on radio of using the Stairmaster to stay in
shape and predicted that the Brazilians would be difficult to beat
in the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from what Clinton and his aides believe was a boffo summit
performance in Beijing, the president traveled to this city of 14
million people commonly regarded as China's economic engine to
focus on the national economy and business climate.
</P>
<P>
   Here, glittery skyscrapers -- many of them empty -- stretch
across a vast skyline. American-style restaurants like Tony Roma's
and the Hard Rock Cafe populate new shopping malls. An
eight-year-old stock exchange, housed in an elaborate complex, is
booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that there is a new China emerging in the
world that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic,''
Clinton told a gathering of intellectual and community leaders at a
roundtable discussion in the city library.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his most significant policy pronouncement of the
day at that event, where he declared in his most explicit language
yet that the United States opposes independence for Taiwan. The
policy has been repeated in the past by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Clinton's national security adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger, but never by Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy which is that
we don't support independence for Taiwan, or `two Chinas' or
`one-Taiwan, one-China,''' Clinton said at the roundtable. ``And we
don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization
for which statehood is a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Clinton had previously defined the US-China policy in
vaguer terms, prompted in part by the many Republican champions
Taiwan claims in Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   When communists took control of China in 1949, nationalists fled
to the island of Taiwan. In 1979, the US transferred official
recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing, but maintained
unofficial contact with Taiwan, including an office on the island
similar to an embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, White House officials braced Tuesday for an
onslaught of negative news, as Linda Tripp, the woman who taped
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, made her first
appearance before the Whitewater grand jury in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the hour-long radio show, Clinton sat with Shanghai Mayor
Xu Kuangdi and fielded questions on education, sports, the Chinese
monetary system and the potential for pollution from a glut of
automobiles from callers who began their comments such as, ``Hi, my
name is Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   One caller asked, ``Do you have enough courage when you go back
to the United States to convince the people, the nonbelievers, that
what you're doing is right?''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller told Clinton, ``You seem to be very healthy, and
you seem to have a very nice figure, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   To that caller, Clinton said, ``Well, when I was in college, I
liked to play basketball, which is very popular in America, and I
liked to jog. I am a runner, you know, and I did that for most of
the last almost 30 years. Then, about a year and a half ago, I hurt
my leg, and I couldn't run for several months, and I began to work
on the Stairmaster. I do that quite a lot now because it's quicker
than running.''
</P>
<P>
   To another questioner who wondered how to create better exchange
programs between the United States and China, Clinton resurrected
his campaign promise to connect all schools and libraries to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get home, I will ask the people who are in charge of
our major libraries, the Library of Congress and the New York
Public Library and perhaps one or two others, to get in touch with
the Shanghai Library to see whether we can establish a deeper
partnership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, Clinton appeared thrilled with the show. ``I
thought the people were terrific,'' he told reporters. ``I wish we
could do it for two more hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Clinton sat with a group of Shanghai
intellectual leaders discussing China's future. At one point, he
tried in jest to solicit a job from the vice dean of the East China
University of Politics and Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping you would offer me a job here,'' Clinton said,
when Zhu Lanye asked what he planned to do in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't speak Chinese,'' Zhu replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'll be about 54 when I leave office and I don't plan to
retire,'' Clinton continued. ``But I haven't decided what to do yet
or where to do it, except I will always have a home in my home
state, in Arkansas, and I intend to build a library there to house
my presidential papers and to tell the story of the time in which I
served as president. But beyond that I have not made any final
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The academics talked about rule of law, consumer protections and
human rights. At the end of the meeting, Clinton told the group,
``The forces of history are driving us toward a common future. We
have to build a common future. And so it's important that we be
able to discuss these things in an open way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Hillary Clinton who offered the most memorable line
at that event. Asked by a panelist whether she felt restricted in
her personal life, the First Lady shot a hard look toward the media
gathered in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often refer to my life before the White House as when I was
a real person,'' she said, ``because when you are in a position
like this, people, particularly all of these people with their
pencils and their cameras, try to record everything you do and then
they try to put meaning into it, whether you intended meaning or
not.''

REP. FRANK, COMPANION, SPLITTING UP 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat who is a homosexual and an active supporter of gay rights,
has ended his relationship with Herb Moses, his longtime companion.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has been candid about his personal life and often
referred to Moses as his ``spouse,'' confirmed reports of the
breakup in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be separating. ... We'll be selling our house in the
near future,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank disclosed his homosexuality in 1987, saying, ``I have
nothing to hide, nothing to advertise.'' He and Moses often
appeared together at congressional functions and White House social
events. They told journalists that they thought of themselves as
married.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in
1973 and to Congress in 1980, Frank has worked hard to dispel
stereotypes about gays. He spoke in public about his 10 1/2-year
relationship with Moses, and defied criticism from Senator Jesse
Helms of North Carolina and other conservative foes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Quarterly's authoritative guide, ``Politics in
America 1998,'' says Frank was the first member of Congress to
announce his homosexuality. In interviews, Frank and Moses also
said they wanted to be role models for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Frank said, members of Congress had been afraid to
say they were gay, and so they invented excuses when they were seen
with partners. ``These were people who had you believe that they
were heterosexual and became homosexual when they were drunk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, a potter, worked as an economist at the Department of
Agriculture before the two met. The separation is amicable, Frank
said.

BARGAIN PRICES PREVAIL AT VIETNAM'S NEW HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 5)  
 (JT)  
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ The great Vietnamese tourism boom,
which turned this into one of the most fashionable destinations in
Asia in the early 1990s, has begun to evaporate. The drop-off in
tourism to Vietnam offers travelers an opportunity to see this
beautiful, long-isolated nation at a bargain price _ and at a level
of comfort that would once have been unthinkable here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese tourism industry is being battered by the Asian
economic crisis, which has cut off the flow of tourists from other
Asian countries, and by dramatic overbuilding in the hotel
industry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has also suffered because Vietnam, unlike Thailand and
some of its other neighbors, has not seen a major devaluation of
its currency over the last year, which has created at least the
impression that other Asian nations offer a better value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, 410,000 tourists visited
Vietnam, a drop of about 5 percent from the same period a year
earlier. The drop is especially significant when measured against
the explosive growth in tourism since 1990, when only 250,000
foreign travelers arrived in Vietnam during the entire year. Last
year there were 1.7 million foreign visitors, who spent an
estimated total of $560 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of tourists began to decline just as dozens of new
hotels, many of them financed by American and other foreign
investors who were encouraged to put their money here after the
lifting of the American economic embargo in 1994, began to open in
Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as
Saigon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, thousands of hotel rooms go empty each night, with
many new luxury hotels reporting occupancy rates as low as 20
percent. The glut will worsen in coming months, as a Marriott opens
in Ho Chi Minh City and a Hilton opens a block from the French
colonial opera house in Hanoi (managers at the latter are girding
themselves for a rash of unfunny jokes comparing their hotel to the
``Hanoi Hilton,'' the jail for American prisoners during the
Vietnam War). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished after decades of war, Vietnam had no resources to
build new hotels until the Communist government decided to end its
isolation and to allow foreign investors to return here in large
numbers in the early 1990s. It took years for supply to catch up
with demand; as recently as 1996 a tourist looking for only the
most basic accommodation in Hanoi would need to reserve a room
weeks in advance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But today a visitors can walk up to the front desk of several
five-star hotels in Vietnam's major cities and find check-in clerks
eager to negotiate a budget rate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fabled Caravelle Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, a haunt of
foreign correspondents during the war, has undergone a
multimillion-dollar renovation that has turned it into a
marble-draped palace complete with rooftop swimming pool. It is
offering rooms for $89 a night, including all taxes and a full
buffet breakfast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city's most modern luxury hotel, the New World Saigon, is
offering rooms with a spectacular view out toward the Saigon River
for $95 a night, taxes included, which is less than half the basic
rate it was charging a year ago. Budget travelers will find even
better bargains at the hundreds of small family-run inns that dot
the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the restaurant offerings in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City were slim. Most restaurants were government-run, the food
often inedible. But the arrival of a semblance of a free market in
Vietnam in the early 1990s has resulted in hundreds of new
privately owned restaurants. And like the hotels, restaurants are
suffering badly. One pays budget prices for delicious, often
spectacular Vietnamese and Western meals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two at the luxurious newly opened Mandarine
restaurant, which specializes in classic Vietnamese cuisine and is
set in a renovated French colonial villa on Ngo Van Nam Street near
the river, is about $35 for two, including wine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city is crowded with French restaurants _ no surprise given
Vietnam's colonial ties _ and among the best is Le Mekong on Dong
Du Street, which offers a daily set lunch for $6.95. The New World
serves a luncheon buffet for $4.95, a favorite among backpacking
tourists during the steamy summer here because of the hotel's
hyperefficient air-conditioning.

TRIMBLE TAKES A STEP DOWN UNIONIST ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ For all the roads he has traveled, David Trimble
cannot get off the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   A prickly law professor and passionate lover of opera who has
led reluctant Protestants to compromise with their Catholic
neighbors, Trimble is expected to be elected leader of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But his triumph is marred by the specter of what may happen on
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Protestants will gather at the town's Drumcree
Church, the place where Trimble proved his unionist mettle three
years ago. Trimble was elected leader of the Ulster Unionist Party
based on his defiant stance at Drumcree in 1995, when he helped
persuade the Orange Order, the society of which he is a member, to
march down the Garvaghy Road for its annual parade despite
opposition from the Catholics who live on it.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many mainstream unionists felt their traditions
and influence were threatened, Trimble was judged the man to lead
them. But now many former supporters accuse him of selling out.
They say his acceptance of the Good Friday agreement, which gives
the Irish government a role in governing Northern Ireland, amounts
to capitulation to a government determined to drag them into a
united Ireland with terrorists who used bombs and bullets for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and his supporters counter that the agreement they
negotiated provides safeguards to maintain the union with Britain.
They say it marks the first time that all strains of Irish
nationalism have accepted the legitimacy of Northern Ireland, and
that it will remain part of Britain as long as a majority of people
living here desire. It also returns local government after 26 years
of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made the union secure,'' Trimble insisted in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern and President Clinton are among the world leaders who have
praised Trimble's courage and vision. Some 71 percent of voters in
Northern Ireland, including a slim majority of Protestants,
supported the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But here on the streets of Northern Ireland, compromise can look
like surrender, and it is hard to escape one's past. To some,
Trimble has evolved from a sectarian tribalist to a secular
statesman. But there also are those on both sides of the divide who
accuse him of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, once an ally and now Trimble's arch enemy,
says Trimble's past stances on the Garvaghy Road were stunts to
dupe Protestants into thinking he was a hardliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all part of a pattern of treachery,'' said Paisley, a
fundamentalist preacher who leads the rival Democratic Unionist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   But if Paisley considers Trimble a poseur, the vast majority of
Catholics do not. Their views of him are colored by his actions in
Portadown in 1995 and 1996. In 1995, after local residents agreed
to let Orangemen march down the Garvaghy Road, Trimble crowed about
a ``victory'' to the TV cameras, which then recorded him and
Paisley doing an impromptu, triumphant jig.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when police initially prevented Orangemen from
marching, Trimble was photographed consorting with thugs whose
threat and use of violence led police to back down and club
nationalists off of the Garvaghy Road. Those scenes touched off the
worst rioting here in years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Catholics find themselves in the awkward position of
needing the enigmatic Trimble. To them, he is the only unionist
leader capable of bringing an increasingly skeptical Protestant
community toward greater accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Garvaghy Road now looms large for Trimble. On Monday,
the Parades Commission banned the Orangemen, whose Protestant
organization is named for William of Orange and celebrate each year
his victory over Catholic forces in the seventeenth century. They
vow to defy the ban and gather in large numbers until they are
allowed to march.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, whose rhetoric has softened noticeably since the Good
Friday agreement, wrote residents to let the Orange parade pass in
the spirit of accommodation. Trimble said that while nationalists
might find it ``distasteful,'' the parade is meant to commemorate
the soldiers of Ulster, both Protestant and Catholic, who died in
the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Breandan Mac Cionnaith, leader of the residents group, said
Trimble's refusal to meet with residents is illustrates the larger
problem: ``David Trimble is the MP (member of Parliament) for this
area and he won't meet with his own constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Diffident, arrogant and pragmatic, Trimble is a tough read. In
1974, he helped wreck the last power-sharing government and ended
the political career of Brian Faulkner, the Ulster Unionist leader
to whom he is now most often compared. Many of the loyalists who
caused mayhem in 1974 are now among Trimble's staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   John McQuillan, a member of the Progressive Unionist Party, is
among the working-class loyalists who admire Trimble, despite what
McQuillan calls his dour disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the warmest of people,'' McQuillan said, ``but he cut
the best deal possible for his people, knowing that five years from
now he couldn't get as good a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his truculence, Trimble has also displayed a remarkable
degree of realism. In 1995, hoping to dispel the stereotype of
intransigent unionism, he became the first unionist leader in 30
years to meet with an Irish prime minister in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   When he was prime minister, John Major depended on the Ulster
Unionists to maintain his slim parliamentary majority, and Trimble
refused to enter all-party negotiations with Sinn Fein. Three
months after Blair was elected with the biggest parliamentary
majority in two centuries, Trimble led his party into the
negotiations, but still refuses to talk to Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics lead Paisley and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to
denounce Trimble from opposite directions and for different
reasons. Paisley vows never to make peace with Trimble. Adams, who
is assured a position in a cabinet headed by Trimble, is more
sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, David Trimble will talk to us,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated new era of Northern Ireland politics, David
Trimble may need Gerry Adams more than he ever needed Ian Paisley.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that Trimble, like Richard Nixon before him,
needed unalloyed hardline credentials to open a dialogue with sworn
enemies. Nixon went to China, as Trimble went to Stormont on Good
Friday. While many politicians might find being compared to Nixon
less than flattering, Trimble had no such problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a soft spot for Nixon,'' he said a few years
ago in Boston.

FANCY FACADE HIDES POT FARM
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA NYT Regional Newspapers c.1998 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUMBOLDT COUNTY, Calif. _ At first glance, it looked like a
family's country dream home. There were early summer flowers in
front and a child's swing set and swimming pool out back.
</P>
<P>
   But the flowers were plastic and behind the two-story facade was
not the interior of a new house but a custom-built indoor
greenhouse where more than 9,000 pot plants were found growing.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground level, there were even special windows that made
it appear ``you were looking inside to a bathroom,'' said Sheriff
Sgt. Steve Knight.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was all an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we got through, we felt like we had wandered
around a Hollywood set,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three people have been arrested in what Knight described
as the state's biggest bust of an indoor marijuana growing
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's raid by local and federal drug agents uncovered an
indoor dope-growing operation that they estimated was capable of
producing an estimated $500,000 worth of processed marijuana every
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sea of green inside,'' said Knight of the 12,448
marijuana plants found growing in a cluster of four buildings
located on a heavily wooded site in a rural area. Humboldt County
is about 225 miles north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,600 of the plants, ranging in size from a few inches
high to 3 feet tall, were found inside the 4,000-square-foot house.
</P>
<P>
   Agents also found a marijuana nursery, drying room and numerous
rooms containing plants in varying stages of growth. The pot was
being grown under nearly 250 1,000-watt lights powered by a
generator hidden in a nearby creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sophisticated operation, set up to grow
marijuana on a continuous cycle year-round,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects arrested so far include 29-year-old Shaun Turner, a
resident of England; Lori Handy, 44, of Arcata; and Jeromy Shull,
23, of Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said the trio are believed to be part of a larger group
of people, ``mostly local,'' who were behind the pot-growing
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects are in custody in San Francisco, where they
face federal marijuana cultivation and manufacturing charges that
could lead to prison sentences of 20 years to life, if convicted.
They also faced possible fines totaling $4 million each, Knight
said.

FOES OF FLAG BURNING AMENDMENT LAUNCH AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foes of the proposed constitutional amendment to
ban flag burning announced plans Tuesday to target TV ads in
Washington, Oregon and North Dakota to persuade U.S. senators there
to oppose the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The television commercial sponsored by the People for the
American Way Foundation (PFAWF), a liberal group, features former
Vietnam War POW Jim Warner criticizing the proposed amendment on
the basis that it would limit freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Warner recalls an episode from his five-and-a-half years as a
POW.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, during an interrogation, an officer showed me pictures
of American kids burning a flag,'' he recalls in the commercial.
```This proves that your country is wrong,' (the officer) said.
`No,' I said, `those pictures prove that we're right and that our
country is strong. We're not afraid of freedom even when we
disagree.'''
</P>
<P>
   Warner told reporters Tuesday that he opposes the amendment
because it would limit freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time in the history of the Constitution since
adopting the Bill of Rights in 1791 that there has been a direct,
constitutional assault on the Bill of Rights,'' he said. ``The Bill
of Rights protects a seamless fabric. Freedom is freedom. We ought
not to qualify it.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which states that ``the Congress shall have power
to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States,'' was passed last year by the House and is expected to come
up in the Senate before Congress quits for the year in October.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement targets four senators, Sens. Kent Conrad,
D-N.D., Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Patty Murray, D-Wash. and Ron Wyden,
D-Ore, because they formerly opposed the amendment but now are
wavering under pressure from amendment supporters, according to
Michael Lux, vice president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lux, 64 senators clearly favor the amendment, three
short of the required two-thirds majority of 67, if all 100
senators are voting. If the Senate approves it, the amendment would
then be sent to the states for ratification. A three-quarters
majority of the states, 38 states in all, would have to ratify the
proposal before it became part of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Dana McCallum, a spokesman for Dorgan, said the senator believes
that protecting the flag should be done statutorily instead of
through an amendment to the Bill of Rights. Conrad has expressed
similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Scott, a spokesman for Murray, the senator
opposes the amendment. Wyden was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning flag
desecration were unconstitutional under the First Amendment
protection of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overcome that decision, Congress enacted a
federal law banning flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court then threw out that law on the same First
Amendment grounds
</P>
<P>
   That led to the push by Rep. Gerald R.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., for a
constitutional amendment that would, in effect, overturn the
court's decision. The amendment passed the House 312-120 in 1995
but failed by a slim margin in the Senate.

   &UR; European Beaches Get Yearly Report Card &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission's annual beach report _ always a year
behind _ has just been published, providing information about
bathing conditions at European beaches in 1997. Beaches are
organized in categories that reflect the levels of chemical and
biological pollutants in the water: high quality, minimum quality
or substandard quality. In some cases beaches remain unrated for
lack of information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, freshwater sites in Europe's interior, while
showing ``cautiously encouraging'' results for the first time,
remain more polluted than sites along the coast, mainly because
they provide better environments for bacteria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost 90 percent of French coastal beaches meet minimum levels
of cleanliness or better. The western coast of France, with 90
percent of its beaches given a superior rating, fares better than
the Mediterranean coast, where only 73 percent of the beaches were
granted superior bathing status by the commission.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The beaches of vacation hubs in Spain, Portugal, Germany and
Britain are on a par with France's overall performance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece did considerably better. About 95 percent of
Italy's 4,836 beaches passed minimum standards. Greece's shore did
even better, with over 98 percent of its 1,704 beaches, including
those of the islands, in compliance with minimum standards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report, in English, is accessible on the Internet at
europa.eu.int/water/.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Mini-Philadelphia At Morris Arboretum &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Train buffs and garden lovers may rub shoulders at the Morris
Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania this summer, where
model trains travel through a miniature re-creation of historic
Philadelphia _ all made with plant material. Large-gauge model
trains traveling on tracks set throughout a scale model of the city
will be on display through Oct. 4.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 550 feet of track run past intricate reproductions of
landmarks that include Independence Hall, Congress Hall and the
Betsy Ross house. In addition to living plants, including flowers
and mosses, the layout incorporates acorns and other seeds, hollow
logs, bark and twigs, water and stones.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit was designed by the landscape architect Paul Busse.
The tradition of garden railways dates to late-19th-century Europe
when scale models of projects were produced by railroad builders to
attract investors and test layouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Arboretum, begun in 1887 as a private estate, was
transformed into a public garden and education center in 1932 by
the University of Pennsylvania. It has 92 acres of public gardens
set in a Victorian landscape of winding paths and streams, with
thousands of rare plants, including many of Philadelphia's oldest
trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum is open daily. Admission is $5, $4 for those over
64 and $3 for students. Children under 6 are admitted free. The
arboretum is in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, at 100
Northwestern Avenue, between Germantown and Stenton Avenues. More
information: (215) 247-5777 or www. upenn.edu/morris. The Web site
has a coupon good for a discount on admission: call up ``How to get
here'' for the cybercoupon.

<P>
   &UR; Fame Goes to Her Head So Liberty Clips Access &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to give a lady a headache _ and a lot of tourists
heat exhaustion. Crowds wanting to climb to the crown of the Statue
of Liberty have become so large in recent summers that the National
Park Service has restricted access to the crown _ 22 stories up _
to passengers on the first ferries of the day from Battery Park in
Manhattan and Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those ferries leave at 8:30 a.m., and visitors who want
to be on them should arrive at the ferry terminals by 7:30 a.m. The
restrictions, which took effect on Monday, were imposed to reduce
the lines in the statue's stairwell, where summer temperatures can
exceed 100 degrees. The heat, combined with a wait of up to three
hours, caused 160 visitors to be treated for heat-related illness
last July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new restrictions, all visitors on the first two
ferries receive passes allowing them to get in line for the
354-step climb to the diadem until noon, when access is cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else will still be able to enjoy the view from the top
of the statue's pedestal _ and will have more time to do so.
Liberty Island will stay open an extra two hours a day, with the
first ferries leaving an hour earlier than the usual 9:30 departure
and the last ferries leaving the island at 7 p.m. instead of 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions are in effect through Labor Day. For ferry
information, call (212) 269-5755.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Dialing System For Italian Telephones &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions come in all sizes. In Italy, June 19 marked a
mini-revolution in the national telephone system. People calling
from abroad must now dial the country code (39), then a 0 in front
of the old city area code. Someone calling Venice from New York,
for example, must dial 011-39-041 and then the local number. Even
telephone calls made within a city must now be prefaced by that
city's area code. A Roman calling another Rome number must dial 06
before the local number. The system has been introduced to allow
for the addition of 140 million telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Artists' Retreat Opens in the Berkshires &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshires have a new attraction: the Frelinghuysen Morris
House and Studio, next door to Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., opens
Thursday. The Bauhaus--inspired structure, preserved as it was in
the early '40s, houses paintings by Picasso, Braque, Leger and
Gris, as well as American Cubist art.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Frelinghuysen and George L.K. Morris, both key members of
the American Abstract Artists Group from its beginnings in 1936,
championed Cubism long after it went out of vogue. They also
collected European abstract art, often buying direct from the
artists, many of whom they knew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen both painted and sang soprano for the New York
City Opera, and her works are in the collections of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
among other places. Morris painted and wrote criticism, often for
the Partisan Review, and the museums where his works can be found
include the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Corcoran Gallery
of Art in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They lived most of the year in New York and Paris, but spent
summers in Lenox. Morris co-designed the modernist house (which
shocked conservative neighbors) with the architect John Butler
Swann to be an integration of art and architecture, and it reflects
the Frelinghuysen-Morris marriage and artistic dialogue as well. He
painted the frescoes, which incorporate industrial-glass materials,
in the living room; she painted the ones in the dining room with
musical motifs. Many of their paintings hang on the walls, along
with ``Still Life with Guitar,'' a major work by Juan Gris,
Picasso's ``Dinard'' and Braque's ``Fruit Dish and Glass,'' to name
a few from their collection. In the 46-acre woodlands surrounding
the house is Gaston Lachaise's monumental sculpture ``The
Mountain,'' a reclining woman that Morris commissioned from his
friend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morris died in 1975, and Frelinghuysen in 1988. Since then, the
house has been home to their foundation, whose director is their
nephew, the artist Kinney Frelinghuysen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission, which includes a one-hour guided tour, costs $7.50
and allows access to the woodlands' walking trails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Frelinghuysen Morris House and Studio is at 92 Hawthorne
Street, Lenox, Mass. For information, call (413) 637-0166. Hours
through Labor Day are Thursday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
(last tour at 3). Also open June, September and October Thursday
through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

COMMENTARY: HOLLYWOOD'S MENTAL BLOCK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may not be a writer in America in a more delicate spot
than Chris Gerolmo. He is the Hollywood screenwriter (``Mississippi
Burning'') and director who had completed the script of ``Laws of
Madness,'' the Michael Laudor story, and was prepared to start
shooting it when Laudor, a schizophrenic who became an academic
star at Yale, was charged with the brutal stabbing of his pregnant
fiancee, Caroline Costello.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Costello was murdered, the reigning assumption was that
``Laws of Madness,'' a project of Ron Howard's Imagine
Entertainment, had died as well. It was no longer a movie with an
inspirational Hollywood ending. It was no longer ``a Ron Howard
movie.'' Or, as Gerolmo put it when I interviewed him this week,
``People who want to finance this movie want to make money, and
overcoming affliction is a genre which Hollywood is comfortable
with. It's harder to get a movie made that ends with a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I still think there is a great story to be
told, though it's gotten more complex and doesn't have the kind of
clear message it had before.'' He wondered, though, if the
mental-health community, which had looked at Laudor as a ``poster
boy,'' would welcome the idea of a revised, tragic version any more
warmly than might bottom-line-driven Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The answer could be yes _ if Gerolmo can bring off the
complexity to which he aspires. In mass culture, where so many
battles are fought for American public opinion, no one may fare
worse than the mentally ill. The National Alliance for the Mentally
Ill is desperate to get accurate stories out _ the sad ones too _
because it knows that as long as mental illness is stigmatized,
public policy will be backward and discriminatory, whether
administered by the government, corporations or HMOs. Of the two
million-plus schizophrenics in the United States, more than half
get inadequate treatment, according to a study released in March.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, the mentally ill are more likely to be exploited for
slash-movie cash or hammed up for Oscar-seeking performances than
dramatized accurately. Otto Wahl, a psychologist who wrote ``Media
Madness,'' a study of mental illness in entertainment, points out
that ``Halloween,'' with its homicidal maniacs, remains the
hardiest Hollywood perennial. The ``positive'' alternative is often
a movie like ``Shine,'' which blurs the nature and causes of mental
illness while tacking on a simplistically triumphant denouement.
``The happy ending in which you go off to life in the suburbs with
your Ford Explorer and your wife and your dog is also a tremendous
disservice,'' says Peter Weiden, who has long treated
schizophrenics at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A true story is much more nuanced. ``There's so much more to
treating schizophrenia than a doctor's visit and a pill, no matter
how good that pill is,'' says Rona Purdy of the National Alliance.
Though new medicines have brought huge advances to schizophrenics,
they are not a cure. Ms. Purdy feels that people should ``see the
horrible pain of Laudor's mother and fiancee as they tried to get
him care in the last days'' when he abandoned his medication and
may have been forcefully resisting any kind of medical
intervention. ``There's no such thing as a simple intervention,''
she says. ``In the end, it's the moms that are left with these
great big sick sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing his script, Chris Gerolmo screened every movie he
could about mental illness, from ``The Snake Pit'' on, and found
just one, ``The Madness of King George,'' that wasn't ``hokey'' or
``unreal.'' He also spent time with the then-thriving Laudor last
year. ``Michael had difficulties all the time,'' he recalls. ``He
told me that on a good day it took 40 percent of his mental
energies to keep his hallucinations off to the side _ on a bad day,
90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone who knew Laudor, Gerolmo is in a state of shock.
``Laws of Madness'' is, as it must be for now, in ``moral and
creative limbo,'' he says. But he doesn't want to walk away from a
story that might help pull mental illness ``out of the darkness in
which it has always resided in the American consciousness.'' To do
so, though, he'll need the support of Imagine Entertainment, which
just this spring announced its intention to remake ``Psycho.''

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-LAWN (Undated) _ ``The American Lawn: Surface of
Everyday Life,'' a corker of a show at the Canadian Center for
Architecture in Montreal (through Sept. 27), begins with a ride on
a lawn sprinkler. Back and forth the camera swings, scanning the
archetypal patch of grass, oscillating between peripheral glimpses
of equally iconic neighbors on either side: the no-nonsense lady
trimming her hedge to clipped perfection, the cool kids hanging out
by the garage. In the background, water hisses. The video is
projected onto the floor, and you hesitate to step on it. Your
shadow might block the projection. Thus the show stylishly connects
two kinds of transgression: one associated with land, the other
with museums. Keep Off. Don't Touch. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GESHER-THEATER (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ Making theater in Israel
would seem a daunting task, what with a history more intense than
any drama, a potpourri of cultures that have resisted melding and a
life forever mired in crisis. Yet these are the very ingredients
that Yevgeny Arye has conjured to propel his Gesher Theater to a
predominant position in Israel in less than seven years, a troupe
that has received raves both inside the country and beyond. By
Serge Schemann.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater Reviews of ``Side Man''; ``You
Never Can Tell'' and ``Love's Fire.'' By Vincent Canby. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``Dr. Dolittle'';
``Armageddon'' and ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   WILL-PATTON-FILM (Undated) _ For Will Patton, it's the end of
the world. Again. In the course of some 30 films, the actor has
endured post-apocalyptic mail carriers, squishy parasites from
outer space and the wrath of God, so this weekend's scourge _ an
asteroid the size of Texas, headed straight for Earth _ should be
no trouble. Patton is appearing in ``Armageddon,'' which stars
Bruce Willis and is the summer's second doomsday adventure movie.
By Justine Elias. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HILDEGARD-MUSIC (Undated) _ We should all be as lively and
robust in our 900th year as Hildegard of Bingen. Unless you've been
dwelling under a rock, the name of this 12th-century German abbess
should at least ring a bell by now. Though never canonized,
Hildegard has achieved an eccentric sort of sainthood, having been
adopted as an icon by partisans of such renegade causes as Creation
Spirituality and feminism. By Cori Ellison. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIE-FANTASTIQUE (New York) _ Basil Twist's underwater
puppetry, currently at work in the Here theater complex in
Manhattan. Twist's exercise, called simply ``Symphonie
Fantastique,'' manipulates objects and light within a 500-gallon
tank of water, one side of which, 30 by 40 inches, is visible to an
audience of about 100. ``Symphonie,'' performed to an old
Philadelphia Orchestra recording led by Eugene Ormandy, has its
halting moments and flashes of extraordinary beauty. It plays until
July 26. By Bernard Holland. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-ALBUMS (Undated) _ On too many internationally released
albums by African stars, guest vocalists are enlisted to break the
language barrier; American or European producers tweak the rhythms
to sound more like funk or reggae or whatever else they think will
reach the unconverted. It sounds as if the international labels
that sought out African bands went on to second-guess themselves,
deciding that their African talent may know what plays to the folks
at home but needs help overseas. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUTCH-ART (Washington) _ Dutch artists pursued subjects among
their immediate surroundings, painting Dutch men and women, their
everyday lives and the Dutch landscape. They gave genre painting
its first definition and painted so many depictions of objects that
the term ``stilleven'' _ still life _ was coined. Perhaps the most
vivid reflection of this worldliness _ this inclusive embrace of
knowledge, experience and beauty _ was the kunstkamer, or art
cabinet, the often encyclopedic arrays of art, artifacts and
natural specimens assembled by prosperous Dutch or Flemish
burghers. So argues ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' a pocket-size show
at the National Gallery of Art. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-TIES (Undated) _ Considering the general flood of
television shows, it's startling to realize that at the height of
its popularity in the 1980s, ``Family Ties'' ranked as one of the
most-watched shows not just of the moment but in the history of
television. Watching four episodes just released on videocassette
by Columbia House, one might wonder why but there is no doubt how
well a top sitcom can serve its era before passing on. By Peter M.
Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WENTWORTH-WOODHOUSE-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ What is a country-house
auction without the house? The answer: a mirage of marketing. That
is the case with the sale on Wednesday at Christie's in London
dedicated to Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, the biggest house in
Britain. By Mitchell Owens.

THIS KIDNEY DISEASE IS A COMMON KILLER THAT'S BARELY KNOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An adult kidney, normally the size of a fist, can swell to the
size of a football in a person with polycystic kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   PKD is the most common life-threatening genetic illness _ as
common as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia,
Down syndrome and hemophilia added together _ but most people have
never heard of it, says Tanja Heinen, vice president of the
Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Heinen was in Fort Worth recently to help organize the North
Texas Friends of the PKR Foundation, a family support group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a developing fetus, a polycystic kidney can grow so large
that it squeezes out the heart and lungs. Half the babies born with
the recessive form of PKD, known as autosomal recessive polycystic
kidney disease (ARPKD), die before they get out of the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 600,000 adults with autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), only about 100,000 know they
have it.
</P>
<P>
   PKD can cause high blood pressure, strokes, infections, severe
back and side pains, blood in the urine and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cysts can range from tiny ones the size of a pinhead to
some as large as grapefruits,'' Heinen said. ``Most people who have
it are unaware until it reaches advanced stages. More than 60
percent of those with PKD eventually will develop kidney failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Erma Bombeck died of complications from the kidney transplant
she underwent after ADPKD shut down her kidney function, requiring
her to undergo daily dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Sereboff, regional coordinator for North Texas Friends,
underwent a kidney transplant for his severe PKD in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant restored normal kidney function, but he says he
still has a lot of pain from the disease, which he describes as
feeling ``like a screwdriver jabbed through your back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PKD was just recognized as a separate disease since 1982,''
Sereboff said. ``It used to be called Bright's. You look normal on
the outside while it's ravaging the insides. People were dying of
kidney cyst infections before anyone knew what PKD was.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually there are no symptoms with the dominant form of the
disease until about age 40, said Sereboff, 57. In recent years many
women have coincidentally discovered they have PKD while undergoing
routine ultrasound scans during pregnancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have nothing to stop the cysts from developing, but
we have antibiotics for the infections, and medications to help
people with PKD to get the blood pressure under control. And we
know some diet modifications, such as avoiding caffeine, help
retard the growth of the cysts,'' Heinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers identified the gene that causes 90 percent of the
dominant form of the disease in 1994, and in April a team of
researchers produced a genetically altered mouse that develops the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   There now is hope for a treatment to curb cyst formation and
ultimately halt progression of the disease within five to 10 years,
Heinen said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about PKD, call the Polycystic Kidney
Research Foundation at (800) PKD-CURE or Sereboff at (972)
241-5639.

HEARINGS OPEN ON NEW ENGLAND FISHING REGULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushed by a new federal law requiring more conservation at sea,
New England fishing regulators this week began what are likely to
be contentious hearings on new restrictions on what fishermen can
catch from flounder to herring to scallops.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Georges Bank, once the breadbasket for New England's
fishing fleet, has been closed since 1994 when years of overfishing
caused a collapse of cod populations. As fishermen have searched
for new places to fish, regulators say they have depleted
additional fishing grounds, even putting pressure on former
``trash'' species such as the monkfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a balloon. If you squeeze the air on one side, it
goes to the other side of the balloon ... There's a real problem
with overcapacity (of fishing boats) out there,'' said Teri Frady,
spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, which must
approve the new limits now being proposed by the New England
Fishery Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen at the kickoff hearing in Fairhaven, Mass. on
Monday complained that some of the new limits are both excessive
and sure to drive some of them out of business. In particular, they
objected to a crackdown on scallopers who would be reduced to an
average of 77 fishing days a year from the current 142 days.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kendall, executive director of the New Bedford Seafood
Coalition and a member of the New England Fishery Management
Council, said he opposed the scallop limits because he believed
fishery analysts had undercounted the scallop population. He said
the prime scallop fishing ground, within the closed area of Georges
Bank, is far more abundant than analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that some of the 250 scallop permit holders in New
England will have to leave the business, hurting New Bedford, the
scallop capital of the region, the most. Kendall also said proposed
limits on groundfishing and a cut in the daily catch of cod in the
Gulf of Maine, adopted last week, will hurt the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we really find a better way of managing than this
slash and burn approach,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators concede that some fishermen likely will be driven
from business by the new restrictions, which apply to the Eastern
seaboard as far south as North Carolina. But the underlying problem
in the industry, they say, is too much ``fishing power'' pulling
fish from the sea, something that is especially true among scallop
boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the size of the (scallop) stock that's out there, all
those vessels ... can't continue to operate,'' said Frady, noting
that the Fishery Management Council is considering programs to help
displaced scallopers.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong hearings _ which resume Wednesday in Ellsworth,
Maine, and Gloucester, Mass. _ follow congressional passage of the
Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996. The law answered longstanding
criticism that regional management councils were dominated by
fishing interests that could delay or weaken strong actions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new act, the New England Fishery Management Council
had to redefine ``sustainable'' levels of fishing and be prepared
to take action if the levels are exceeded. And the council must
protect the fishery even if that hurts business.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed measures are a ban on so-called
``streetsweepers,'' a new kind of trawling equipment that
regulators fear could greatly increase fishing power. The council
also wants new protections for fish spawning grounds that could
affect all forms of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that the fishing limits adopted since 1994, while
painful, are beginning to show results as stocks of cod, flounder
and haddock in Georges Bank show signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Doug Hopkins of the New England Fishery
Management Council, ``We can sustain more jobs from the resource in
New England waters if we rebuild these stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for fishermen already beset by regulations, the new rules
are infuriating. ``I don't think they know what they're doing,'' Al
Cottone, owner of the 45-foot Sabrina Maria in Gloucester, told the
Associated Press. ``Every time they lower an existing limit, or add
another species, it's another nail in the coffin.''

TV NOTES: `60 MINUTES' II; CABLE CULTURE; EXCLUSIVE SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only Don Hewitt knows for sure exactly how involved
he will be in supervising the production of a second version of
``60 Minutes,'' the granddaddy of news-magazine programs.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports during the last week have been at odds in
describing a second night of the popular Sunday night program,
which CBS executives dearly want because they believe it will give
their weeknight prime-time lineup the same ratings boost that
``Dateline'' gives NBC and ``20/20'' gives ABC. But the varying
reports of the nature of Hewitt's involvement seem to be a matter
of semantics.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News President Andrew Heyward has beseeched all involved in
the debate over a second ``60 Minutes'' to refrain from speaking to
the press. So Hewitt, who created the program in 1968 and has been
its executive producer ever since, wrote one all-purpose statement
and authorized its release to any interested reporters and will say
no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to burst upon the scene with a news magazine
that's every bit as different and worthy as `60 Minutes' was 30
years ago,'' his statement said. ``I'm not interested in a rip-off
of `20/20,' `Dateline' or `60 Minutes.'''
</P>
<P>
   This latest attempt to clarify Hewitt's role in a program that
is still in development set off a new wave of tea-leaf reading.
</P>
<P>
   Some think Hewitt's statement means he would refuse to cooperate
with creating a cloned version of his program, but would go along
with producing a completely new type of news magazine. This theory
is backed up by the nickname for the program among members of the
CBS News staff _ ``60 Minutes Jr.'' _ and by the fact that some
junior producers have already been assigned to work on it. In this
view, the program would have a new format and feature some young
noncelebrity correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Others think the program will resemble ``60 Minutes'' closely,
but with different producers and correspondents. Whatever its shape
or format, everyone who speaks about the program, on or off the
record, is certain it will have the magic words ``60 Minutes'' in
its title _ and that's the crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   More Culture on Cable
</P>
<P>
   New York's public television station, WNET on Channel 13, is
close to getting a new outlet on cable television, people close to
the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Media, the programming arm of Cablevision, the largest
provider of cable television in the New York metropolitan area,
will soon announce a new package of cable channels for its 2.6
million subscribers, and one will be partly programmed by Channel
13. It will be called MetroArts, the sources said, and will operate
six hours daily, between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. EDT, starting in late
summer or early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs will be jointly produced with New York-area arts
institutions, giving many of them their first cable exposure. WNET
has been busy signing production agreements with institutions
including the city's major art museums, the 92d Street Y, the
American Theater Wing and the Emelin Theater in suburban
Mamaroneck.
</P>
<P>
   WNET President William F. Baker was traveling and unavailable
for comment Tuesday, but he has spoken in recent months about his
plans to develop a cable channel with a suitable distribution
partner. Last fall he hired an executive producer for local
programming, Michael Fields, from Pittsburgh's PBS station, and
said he intended for Fields to develop ideas for the cable arts
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Baker emphasized that the proposed channel would be
noncommercial and nonprofit, in keeping with a PBS station's
mandate, and would seek underwriting support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the reverse of our slogan, `If PBS doesn't do it, who
will?' because we think if we don't do this, somebody else might,''
Baker said a few weeks ago. ``It's also a new side of Thirteen.
We're one of the biggest national producers for PBS, but now we're
saying our community deserves special attention, because of its
great cultural attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Snagging an Exclusive
</P>
<P>
   Every self-respecting news-magazine program has to have its
share of exclusive interviews, known in the business as ``gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Fox is joining the Big Three broadcast networks in
producing a prime-time news magazine, the network naturally had to
trumpet its big ``get'' for the program's premiere episode: an
exclusive interview with the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales.
The program, ``Fox Files,'' will have Catherine Crier and Jon Scott
as co-anchors, and will appear on Thursdays from 9 to 10 p.m. EDT,
making its debut on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crier was in England last weekend to interview the Princess'
brother, Earl Spencer, who also made available some home movies and
still photographs not previously seen, and had Ms. Crier tour the
gardens, estate and museum at Althorp, the Spencer family's estate.
The museum opens to the public Wednesday, the Princess' birthday.

SANCHEZ VICARIO FINDS THE WAY IN THE SECOND TWO SETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario seems to be getting the hang of
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   She lost the first set but rallied to eliminate Dominique Van
Roost, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, Tuesday in their fourth-round match at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario, the fifth seed, has lost the initial set in
three of her four matches thus far, but she may be living more than
dangerously if she keeps up the trend in her quarterfinal match
today against No. 1 seed Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I raise my level when I am down a set, and I know
it shouldn't be like this, but that's the way it's been
happening,'' said Sanchez Vicario, who fell behind, 5-0, in the
first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just come back and at the end play better and win the match.
Obviously, the first set I play normally, it's supposed to be like
this, but it seems like I've been a very slow start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Sanchez Vicario grabbed a 5-1 lead before
holding in the ninth game. In the decisive set, Sanchez Vicario
broke in the first game before taking the last three games,
including another break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level I was playing was very strong, so I couldn't
continue and I got a bit tired,'' Van Roost said. ``You don't have
to have the same precision than when you're very fresh, so she
started to get into the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second set, she didn't miss one ball and I started to
miss a few, which is normal with my game. She was very confident.
In the third set, I was tired and she was just running and playing
incredibly good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario doesn't have a reason for her slow starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't prefer to be in that situation, but I think that
it's important that I play well at the end and to be able to win in
the situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Sanchez Vicario is delighted with her play. ``I think
that each match has been better and I've been playing a lot lately
and each match is more difficult,'' she said, ``But I feel good
with myself and my game, too. I keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive play has paid off for Sanchez Vicario, who was a
Wimbledon finalist in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to move the ball as well (in the first set), and
she attacked really well and she's a dangerous player,'' Sanchez
Vicario said. ``You have to play and go for your shots, and I
realized that after I lost the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if I wanted to win I'd have to do that and that's
why I came back doing it better and I was able to stay in the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, however, is an entirely different matter. The reigning
Wimbledon, US Open, and Australian Open champ is 5-1 against
Sanchez Vicario, who is not a grass specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I have nothing to lose,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
``She's the favorite and that can help me. I'm just going to go on
the court and try to start well at the beginning if I can and play
as well as I did these matches, to be aggressive, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Hingis some time to get going before she defeated
Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6-3, 6-2, in an 11 a.m. match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still sleeping in practice (before the match),'' she
stated. The turnaround came in the seventh game of the first set,
when Tanasugarn was up, 40-0, and Hingis came back to take the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the feel at the beginning of the match; I had
problems getting the rhythm,'' Hingis said. ``I had to get to know
what she dislikes, and in the second set it was much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Long rallies dominated the match. ``I knew she was going to like
my game pretty much because she's playing very flat and she doesn't
mind the speed at all,'' said Hingis. ``So the harder (I hit), the
better.''

   Monster grosses lead to monster sequels. So after the first two
``Jurassic Park'' films generated more than $1.5 billion in
worldwide box-office revenue, Universal Pictures and Steven
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment are joining forces to hatch a
third. Spielberg will produce but not direct. Michael Crichton, who
wrote the best-selling novel that led to the first ``Jurassic
Park'' film in 1993, is developing the story. Listen for heavy
footsteps around the summer of 2000.

<P>
   Update
</P>
<P>
   Russian musicians bested an international field to walk off with
the top honors at the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow. The judges
awarded Denis Matsuyev the prize for the piano, Nikolai Sachenko
the prize for violin and Denis Shapovalov the prize for cello. The
competition has been held every four years since 1958, when Van
Cliburn of the United States achieved instant fame by winning the
prize for piano.
</P>
<P>
   Art to Go
</P>
<P>
   With gifts of works by Degas, Pissarro and Dufy to museums in
the Netherlands, England and France, the Sara Lee Corp. is
continuing the dispersal of its renowned art collection. In the
Netherlands, works by Pissarro, Giacomo Manzu and Dufy are to go,
respectively, to museums in Amsterdam, The Hague and Laren. In
England the National Gallery gets a Degas, and in France the Musee
des Beaux-Arts in Lyons gets a Pissarro.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patti LuPone and the architect Rem Koolhaas are to
take part in ground-breaking ceremonies Wednesday morning for a
second home for New York's Second Stage Theater. Koolhaas, who
designed the Dutch Parliament building, and Richard Gluckman, the
architect of the Whitney Museum expansion, are collaborating on
transforming an unoccupied bank building on the northwest corner of
43rd Street and Eighth Avenue into a new home for the Second Stage,
which is beginning its 20th season in the fall. The company will
maintain its current space in a 100-seat theater upstairs at
Broadway and 76th Street, but the new home, with a 299-seat
theater, more generous stage and backstage area, as well as
rehearsal and office space, will allow the Second Stage to mount
more ambitious, larger-scale productions. The new space should be
ready in February.
</P>
<P>
   Arrival Time
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jennifer Jason Leigh will join the cast of
``Cabaret'' on Aug. 4, replacing Miranda Richardson in the role of
Sally Bowles in the Roundabout Theater Company's Tony Award-winning
production at the Kit Kat Klub. Ms. Leigh, who has appeared onstage
at the Circle Rep in New York and the Ahmanson Theater in Los
Angeles, will be making her Broadway debut. Ms. Richardson, who won
the 1998 Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards for her
performance, twice extended her commitment to the show and will
continue as Sally Bowles through Aug. 2.

ON CHINESE TALK RADIO, POLITE QUESTIONS ON SAFE TOPICS FOR
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Talk radio is still new in China, so good
behavior counts.
</P>
<P>
   Callers are generally polite, not confrontational. A host would
never hang up on anybody, the way Howard Stern likes to do. And the
idea of trying anything as risque as voicing a contrary political
opinion is altogether foreign, though maybe the vigilant screeners
just make it seem that way.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton turned up Tuesday at the studio of
Shanghai Radio 990 to make his first appearance on a talk radio
show outside the United States, he fielded such questions as the
need for library exchanges, requirements for joining the World
Trade Organization, and the benefits of better education. One
caller even asked about auto emissions. Clinton seemed thrilled.
``One of the things you need to know,'' Clinton replied, ``is that
when a car, an automobile, burns gasoline, about 80 percent of the
heat value of the gasoline is lost in the inefficiency of the
engine. But they are now developing new engines, called
fuel-injection machines, where the fuel goes directly into the
engine and it is about four times more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I hope that within a matter of just a few years, in the
U.S., in China and throughout the world, all these engines will be
much, much less polluting. And that will be very good for the
health of the people of China and for the health of the world
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Zuo Anlong, the host of the show, ``Citizens and
Society,'' could not resist a segue into mass transportation and,
after a sip of Diet Coke, Clinton was off and running again. Here
was a chance to delve deeply into policy without obnoxious hosts to
cut in unexpectedly or resort to gotcha questions.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of sex, violence or drugs. And certainly no
allusions to Monica Lewinsky. It was an inveterate talker's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing Clinton to answer questions from callers on live radio,
uncensored, might have seemed unthinkable only a week ago. The
media in China are tightly monitored, and broadcasting is generally
kept within the narrow confines of approved programming.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke about sensitive political topics like the
Tiananmen Square massacre and Tibet in a nationally televised news
conference Saturday with President Jiang Zemin, then addressed
students at Beijing University on Monday, having him on Shanghai
radio reinforced the signals of greater openness in China, at least
symbolically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reality of Tuesday's program illustrated the firm limits
that also remain on public discourse in this country. As long as
the radio station could screen its callers, even Clinton's presence
could not move the discussion past a collection of safe topics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here was one typical question, from Li, in Shanghai: ``As far as
getting the Shanghai Library and American libraries going for
better and better exchanges, what can we do to increase the amount
of exchange and cooperation between them?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's answer was too long to print here, but suffice it to
say: start with more Internet use, then we will ask someone at the
Library of Congress to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   Another question, from Yu, in Shanghai: ``As far as promoting
cooperation in science and technology between the United States and
China, what are you planning to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The president kept it innocuous, citing earthquake prediction
and spina bifida research, and then asked that anyone wth an idea
write it down and mail it to him. There seemed to be no need to
mention nuclear or satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   There was one question with a little juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem very healthy, and you seem to have a very nice
figure, Mr. President,'' from another Li from Shanghai. ``When you
were in college, which sports did you like to play? That's the
first question. The second question I'd like to ask, if you could
answer, Mr. President, is how do you maintain your energy in your
work? And then the third thing is: Can you predict who's going to
win the World Cup?''
</P>
<P>
   The short version: He played basketball in college, started
jogging later, and finally settled on golf. ``It's my favorite
sport. Even though it doesn't burn a lot of calories, it makes my
mind calm. So I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he threw caution to the wind and predicted that Brazil
would be ``hard to beat'' in the world soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's host in Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi, was also in the
studio to answer questions and he could almost hold his own with
the president, talking at length about auto emissions and the
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a question from Wang, in Shanghai: ``Can you both talk
about education exchanges and the future for them between the
United States and China?''
</P>
<P>
   Education seemed to be the favorite topic for each man, so they
were off like horses, taking turns racing in the lead. Clinton
spoke for several minutes about the need for computer literacy,
affordable education and exchange programs, concluding with a
typically innocuous ``and I think it will only grow more important
as we move into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu came back with a lengthy discussion about the need for
Chinese teachers to consider introducing elements of the American
teaching system in order to foster greater individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chinese education, we talk about the filling of information
into the student, whereas in the United States, they try to make
students more able, they try to teach you how to have the ability
to do things,'' Xu said. ``So Chinese are very good at tests, but
not necessarily when it comes to scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``Well, actually, here's a case where I think we
would greatly benefit from working together, because there is no
perfect system. If you just start with the issue of discipline and
order in the classroom, it's impossible for learning to occur. We
also know that if there is too much order, where everything is
structured, the child may close up and not be open to information
and to learning. So we have tried all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now on the second matter,'' and he went on for a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   It was only toward the end of the hour that Clinton found a way
to sound his sole note of political imperative, similar to what he
said at the news conference with Jiang and at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, as I have said repeatedly, that high levels of
personal freedom are quite important to the success of a society in
the information age,'' he said, ``because you need people who feel
free to explore, to state their views, to explore their own
convictions, and then live out their own dreams, and that this will
add to the stability of a society by enriching it. That's what I
believe.'' &QL;

CRIME STOPPER (Phoenix) - Alvin Moses says Phoenix cops' new
crime-fighting approach has worked in his neighborhood. Since
police stopped arresting drug dealers, gang members, and armed
robbers one at a time and attacked the dens from which they dealt
death and dope, life has become a lot more peaceful. Police say
that, in fact, crime has gone down 31 percent in three central
Phoenix neighborhoods where they fought crime by taking a tough
stance against the apartments from which the crime emanated. It's
part of a nationwide crimefighting stragegy. By WILLIAM HERMANN.
Story will move in the ``A`` category.  &QL; 
STAMPOUT (Tucson, Ariz.) - Tucson grocers worry the fireworks could

plastic debit cards for 20,000 people in Pima County. With
STAMPSIDE. By PAT KOSSAN. RESCHEDULED FROM TUESDAY. Story will move

reimbursed. By PAT KOSSAN. RESCHEDULED FROM TUESDAY. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

to put together an advisory board that works. By JANE LARSON. Story
will move in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOREIGN (Undated) - The AFI list of the top 100 movies left out, on
purpose, many of the greatest films ever made. To counter this
ommission, we have our own list of the top 100 Foreign films. This
is not a scientific survey, but a one-man-one-vote case, where the
one man is ``Republic'' critic Richard Nilsen. Among the top 10
are: ``Children of Paradise,'' ``Rules of the Game,`` ``Seven

BOOK-AUTHOR (Undated) _ Sanjay Nigam's first novel, ``The Snake

REPORTER ASSIGNED TO COWBOY REUNION IN '36 TO LEAD ITS PARADE 62
YEARS LATER

By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ When 84-year-old Harry Holt first saw the Texas
Cowboy Reunion in Stamford, Texas, it was 1936 and the Dust Bowl
days still hung over the vastness of West Texas. Holt was a pup
reporter then, running behind the chutes in the sweltering heat,
trying desperately to get a story.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he will be comfortably up front in the 68th reunion,
serving as grand marshal of the parade that kicks off four days of
celebration Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is more than just a rodeo,'' explained Gary Mathis,
manager of the Swenson Ranches and organizer of the event. ``This
is a Texas cowboy reunion, and Harry has been in this part of the
country a long time. It is an honor for us to have him be a part of
this year's event.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt worked for 15 years as a reporter and columnist for the
Abilene Reporter News. He left the paper in 1953 and began a weekly
TV program called ``West Texas This Week'' and a daily ag report on
Abilene radio. They continue today.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the heyday of the reunion, which began in 1931; he
has seen the difficult times as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year before I started covering it was 1935, the year that
Will Rogers was there,'' he said. ``Rogers came to Abilene with his
pilot, Wiley Post. Post once lived just outside Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, Rogers got a taxi and went to Stamford, unannounced,
and sat up in the bleachers in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt remembered that John Selman was foreman of the Flat Top
Ranch of the Swenson Land and Cattle Co. back then and that when
Selman recognized Rogers, he called him down to the arena, gave him
a horse and turned him loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogers did his rope tricks and put on a show for the crowd,''
Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Post and Rogers were killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Holt had the painful job of informing Post's wife of her
husband's death. It was, he said, the hardest thing he ever had to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that Will Rogers touch, his presence, that put the
Cowboy Reunion over the top,'' Holt said. ``That, and the fact that
it was a pet project of Amon Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's first publisher, and
Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers made his appearance at
Stamford, 40 miles north of Abilene, Carter began dispatching
reporters to West Texas to cover the Fourth of July weekend event.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Mabel Gouldy, C.L. Richhart and Frank Reeves blanketed
the Cowboy Reunion, Holt said. The Abilene and Wichita Falls papers
then boosted their coverage, and the media attention made the event
irresistible to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last governor I remember coming was Preston Smith,'' Holt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Cowboy Reunion has always been a ranch rodeo. Although
the neighboring ranches didn't enter as teams, the cowboys would
travel to Stamford together and camp together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reunion was unique in that way,'' Holt said. ``The
contestants were real working cowboys. They would enter the wild
cow milking contest because they were used to roping cows out in
the pasture. Some of the cowboys today have never seen a wild
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who participated were ranch hands, too, Holt said.
Riders like Ardeth Copeland, Fern Sawyer and Christine Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   The first approved and sanctioned American Quarter Horse
Association show was held at the Cowboy Reunion. ``The King Ranch
was big then. Mr. Bob Kleberg came himself,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also a lot of good cutting horse competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Money was never really the object at Stamford, Holt said. It was
an amateur rodeo. First prize was only $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they gave away saddles and people would spend a lifetime
trying to win one of those saddles,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the reunion dwindled. The crowds and entries
shrank. It was, Holt said, simply a sign of the times. Every small
town now has its own rodeo and the competition for competitors is
tough.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathis said the Texas Cowboy Reunion is holding on. ``The
last four to five years we've really been coming back,'' he said.
``We've brought back some of the old activities like the wild cow
milking and a ranch horse competition. There has been interest in
the bit and spur show, the trade show and the chuck wagon cook-off
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now give six trophy saddles, 13 buckles and last year we
handed out $53,000 in prize money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the tradition, he said. No one wants to lose the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Information on schedules and ticket prices for the Texas Cowboy
Reunion is available at (915) 773-3614 or (915) 773-2411.

   _ In answer to the question ``How safe is sex on the beach?''
Glamour magazine warns that contact with rough sand ``can cause
tiny tears in condoms or diaphragms.'' On the other hand, salt
water kills bacteria, so sex in the water may reduce one's risk of
contracting a bacterial disease.

DRUG-RESISTANT AIDS VIRUS SEEN AS TRANSMITTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ AIDS specialists had hoped it wouldn't happen, but now,
they say, they know that strains of HIVthat are immune to the most
potent triple-drug treatments can be passed from one person to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The news, reported here Tuesday at the 12th World AIDS
Conference, sounded an alarm to researchers and treatment
specialists, who fear that more such multidrug-resistant cases are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the tip of an iceberg,'' said Dr. John W.
Mellors of the University of Pittsburgh, who chaired a session on
AIDS-drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In reports presented here, researchers disclosed that one man in
San Francisco and another individual in Geneva recently became
infected with HIV mutants that cannot be suppressed by the widely
used AIDS drug ``cocktails'' that have given thousands of patients
a new lease on life since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss scientists have also documented a handful of other HIV
infections by strains resistant to protease inhibitors alone _ the
most potent ingredient in multidrug HIV treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mellors said, researchers at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention have discovered that two Americans
were infected by an HIV mutant resistant to virtually all other
drugs in a class known as nucleoside analogues, another key
ingredient in the anti-HIV cocktail. Nucleoside analogues, which
jam the assembly of new viral DNA, include the widely used agents
AZT, 3TC, ddC and D4T.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cases of protease inhibitor-resistant virus,
transmission of a multiply nucleoside-resistant strain represents a
first, Mellors said. The report was presented last week at a
meeting in Italy on AIDS drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that HIV, which causes AIDS, can
rapidly lose susceptibility to any drug in a given patient. The
only way around that _ and the key to success of triple-drug
therapy _ is to hit the virus simultaneously with several different
drugs at once, suppressing its replication to such a low level that
it cannot acquire resistance mutations.
</P>
<P>
   What is new in the recent reports is that the multidrug
resistant strains, and those that have escaped the effects of
protease and nucleoside drugs alone, have been passed from one
individual to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of why this is important is that many have speculated it
would be very difficult to transmit a protease inhibitor-resistant
HIV,'' said Dr. Frederick Hecht of the University of California at
San Francisco, who is scheduled to present a report this morning on
one case. ``Many hoped it might not be possible at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis, now proved false, was that the multiple
mutations required for HIV to resist protease inhibitors would make
it less ``fit,'' or infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco man was infected through unprotected anal
intercourse with a man who harbored a viral strain resistant to six
of the 11 anti-HIV drugs on the market, encompassing all three
classes of such drugs. The virus became resistant, researchers
said, through sequential treatment with many different AIDS drugs,
as well as interruptions in his treatment for reasons beyond his
control.
</P>
<P>
   Current HIV therapy stresses simultaneous, uninterrupted
treatment with at least three drugs to prevent resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 16,000 people who become infected by HIV each day
around the world, many already acquire strains with built-in
resistance to AZT, the first AIDS drug. In San Francisco, for
instance, about 16 percent of new infections involve AZT-resistant
virus.
</P>
<P>
   While the circulation of AZT-resistant virus is troubling,
doctors have had other arrows in their quiver to treat such
patients. Now AIDS specialists worry those options may eventually
disappear. The development carries big implications, many
researchers said. To name just a few:
</P>
<P>
   --- Doctors must make sure they prescribe the most effective HIV
therapy to avoid giving rise to infectious mutants. Right now, 42
percent of US patients being treated for HIV are on less than
optimal regimens that doctors say are certain to give rise to
resistant strains, according to a report presented here by US
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   --- People on anti-HIV treatments must take their drugs
religiously to suppress the emergence of resistant strains, and
also practice safe sex to avoiding infecting others. ``We need to
put more energy into supporting patients' adherence to their drug
regimens,'' Hecht said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   --- A new push to extend HIV treatment to developing countries
must not ``unwittingly become a factory for resistant virus,''
warned Margaret Chesny of the University of California. This could
happen, she said, if HIV-infected individuals could obtain only the
cheaper two-drug regimens certain to give rise to resistant
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Cohen, a Boston AIDS specialist, cited a recent
decision by South African health insurers to pay for HIV therapy _
but only for less expensive two-drug regimens. ``They're about to
make a big mistake,'' Cohen said.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Talk radio is still new in China, so good
behavior counts.
</P>
<P>
   Callers are generally polite, not confrontational. A host would
never hang up on anybody, the way Howard Stern likes to do. And the
idea of trying anything as risque as voicing a contrary political
opinion is altogether foreign, though maybe the vigilant screeners
just make it seem that way.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton turned up Tuesday at the studio of
Shanghai Radio 990 to make his first appearance on a talk radio
show outside the United States, he fielded such questions as the
need for library exchanges, requirements for joining the World
Trade Organization, and the benefits of better education. One
caller even asked about auto emissions. Clinton seemed thrilled.
``One of the things you need to know,'' Clinton replied, ``is that
when a car, an automobile, burns gasoline, about 80 percent of the
heat value of the gasoline is lost in the inefficiency of the
engine. But they are now developing new engines, called
fuel-injection machines, where the fuel goes directly into the
engine and it is about four times more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I hope that within a matter of just a few years, in the
U.S., in China and throughout the world, all these engines will be
much, much less polluting. And that will be very good for the
health of the people of China and for the health of the world
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Zuo Anlong, the host of the show, ``Citizens and
Society,'' could not resist a segue into mass transportation and,
after a sip of Diet Coke, Clinton was off and running again. Here
was a chance to delve deeply into policy without obnoxious hosts to
cut in unexpectedly or resort to gotcha questions.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of sex, violence or drugs. And certainly no
allusions to Monica Lewinsky. It was an inveterate talker's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing Clinton to answer questions from callers on live radio,
uncensored, might have seemed unthinkable only a week ago. The
media in China are tightly monitored, and broadcasting is generally
kept within the narrow confines of approved programming.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke about sensitive political topics like the
Tiananmen Square massacre and Tibet in a nationally televised news
conference Saturday with President Jiang Zemin, then addressed
students at Beijing University on Monday, having him on Shanghai
radio reinforced the signals of greater openness in China, at least
symbolically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reality of Tuesday's program illustrated the firm limits
that also remain on public discourse in this country. As long as
the radio station could screen its callers, even Clinton's presence
could not move the discussion past a collection of safe topics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here was one typical question, from Li, in Shanghai: ``As far as
getting the Shanghai Library and American libraries going for
better and better exchanges, what can we do to increase the amount
of exchange and cooperation between them?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's answer was too long to print here, but suffice it to
say: start with more Internet use, then we will ask someone at the
Library of Congress to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   Another question, from Yu, in Shanghai: ``As far as promoting
cooperation in science and technology between the United States and
China, what are you planning to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The president kept it innocuous, citing earthquake prediction
and spina bifida research, and then asked that anyone wth an idea
write it down and mail it to him. There seemed to be no need to
mention nuclear or satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   There was one question with a little juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem very healthy, and you seem to have a very nice
figure, Mr. President,'' from another Li from Shanghai. ``When you
were in college, which sports did you like to play? That's the
first question. The second question I'd like to ask, if you could
answer, Mr. President, is how do you maintain your energy in your
work? And then the third thing is: Can you predict who's going to
win the World Cup?''
</P>
<P>
   The short version: He played basketball in college, started
jogging later, and finally settled on golf. ``It's my favorite
sport. Even though it doesn't burn a lot of calories, it makes my
mind calm. So I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he threw caution to the wind and predicted that Brazil
would be ``hard to beat'' in the world soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's host in Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi, was also in the
studio to answer questions and he could almost hold his own with
the president, talking at length about auto emissions and the
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a question from Wang, in Shanghai: ``Can you both talk
about education exchanges and the future for them between the
United States and China?''
</P>
<P>
   Education seemed to be the favorite topic for each man, so they
were off like horses, taking turns racing in the lead. Clinton
spoke for several minutes about the need for computer literacy,
affordable education and exchange programs, concluding with a
typically innocuous ``and I think it will only grow more important
as we move into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu came back with a lengthy discussion about the need for
Chinese teachers to consider introducing elements of the American
teaching system in order to foster greater individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chinese education, we talk about the filling of information
into the student, whereas in the United States, they try to make
students more able, they try to teach you how to have the ability
to do things,'' Xu said. ``So Chinese are very good at tests, but
not necessarily when it comes to scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``Well, actually, here's a case where I think we
would greatly benefit from working together, because there is no
perfect system. If you just start with the issue of discipline and
order in the classroom, it's impossible for learning to occur. We
also know that if there is too much order, where everything is
structured, the child may close up and not be open to information
and to learning. So we have tried all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now on the second matter,'' and he went on for a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   It was only toward the end of the hour that Clinton found a way
to sound his sole note of political imperative, similar to what he
said at the news conference with Jiang and at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, as I have said repeatedly, that high levels of
personal freedom are quite important to the success of a society in
the information age,'' he said, ``because you need people who feel
free to explore, to state their views, to explore their own
convictions, and then live out their own dreams, and that this will
add to the stability of a society by enriching it. That's what I
believe.'' &QL;

THE CURIOUS, THE PRESS CROWD TRIPP VISIT TO GRAND JURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tourists ambling between the Washington Monument
and the Capitol Tuesday added an unlikely destination to their
rounds: the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse, where Linda
Tripp spent six hours Tuesday testifying to a grand jury about an
alleged presidential affair and coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of reporters and camera crews jostled for prime places in
front of entrances on all four sides of the grey, six-story
building. Out-of-towners paused to watch Tripp enter the courthouse
shortly after 9 a.m. Or, more precisely, the tourists stopped to
watch the journalists watching Tripp's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who secretly taped about 20 hours of conversations with
her friend and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, is the
star witness of the most-covered White House scandal in more than
two decades. Her public appearance Tuesday was her first in months.
Since January, Tripp has become the woman everyone opines about,
even though she has barely said a word and has not revealed her
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark pantsuit and escorted by Federal Protective
Service Police, Tripp got out of a van with her daughter, son, and
lawyers and headed to the third floor of the courthouse where the
grand jury convened by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr waited.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras clicked. Reporters scribbled. ``Tripp is in the
building, Tripp has arrived in the building,'' an Associated Press
television cameraman announced into his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists along Constitution Avenue were far outnumbered by
the reporters and photographers who came prepared to stake out days
of Tripp testimony. They brought folding chairs, umbrellas,
stepladders, binoculars, laptop computers, telephones, pagers,
telephoto lenses, crossword puzzles, paperback books, and bottled
water.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a 48-year-old Pentagon employee and former White House
aide, ignored reporters' shouted questions. At the end of the day,
her lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, gave a morsel to the reporters. By
his account, when Tripp left the grand jury room, she said, ``I
find it very easy to truthfully answer the questions posed to me by
the prosecutors and the grand jury.'' Tripp will testify again on
Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's long-anticipated testimony is the centerpiece of Starr's
probe of President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice
in connection with his and Lewinsky's testimony in the
now-dismissed Paula Jones sexual harassment case. Tripp's
appearance could put pressure on Lewinsky to make an immunity deal
with prosecutors and testify to the nature of her alleged
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, the scene said a lot about the story
that has captivated Washington since January. Several tourists said
they were repelled by the story, disgusted by the details, and
bored by the repetition and speculation. And yet something about
the spectacle at the courthouse lured them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of having all this on the news with my kids at the
dinner table,'' said Susan Bucci, from Norfolk, Mass., who stopped
by the courthouse with her parents and her daughter, Mary, 13, and
twins, Allison and Laura, 11. At school, Mary said, ``No one talks
about it, and no one cares about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The family was making the rounds of Washington's better known
sites, including the National Gallery, the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt Memorial and the Museum of American History. But the
commotion at the federal courthouse was worth a quick look.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an impressive sight as far as the technical part,''
said Steve Permut, a patent attorney from Detroit, gesturing at the
line of trucks topped by satellite dishes beaming images to
television stations across the country and around the world. ``But
as far as the substance of it, I think China is more important,''
said Permut, who described his politics as ``independent tending
more toward Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Mueller and his wife, Irmi, retirees visiting from Munich,
snapped pictures of the mass of journalists, but they were not
impressed. ``In Germany, the chancellor would be allowed to have
his privacy,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has been pilloried as a friend who used Lewinsky to
embarrass Clinton. But she does have her fans, such as Steve and
Cindy Curtis of Dayton, Ohio, who think Clinton has besmirched the
office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, they stopped by the six-floor courthouse with
their four children to take a picture of Tripp. But just as she
stepped out of the dark minivan, their camera ran out of film.
</P>
<P>
   Having made their Tripp sighting, the Curtis family continued on
to the White House. ``We can't skip the White House just because
Clinton lives there,'' Cindy Curtis said.

DRUG-RESISTANT AIDS VIRUS SEEN AS TRANSMITTABLE

<P>
   GENEVA _ AIDS specialists had hoped it wouldn't happen, but now,
they say, they know that strains of HIVthat are immune to the most
potent triple-drug treatments can be passed from one person to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The news, reported here Tuesday at the 12th World AIDS
Conference, sounded an alarm to researchers and treatment
specialists, who fear that more such multidrug-resistant cases are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the tip of an iceberg,'' said Dr. John W.
Mellors of the University of Pittsburgh, who chaired a session on
AIDS-drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In reports presented here, researchers disclosed that one man in
San Francisco and another individual in Geneva recently became
infected with HIV mutants that cannot be suppressed by the widely
used AIDS drug ``cocktails'' that have given thousands of patients
a new lease on life since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss scientists have also documented a handful of other HIV
infections by strains resistant to protease inhibitors alone _ the
most potent ingredient in multidrug HIV treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mellors said, researchers at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention have discovered that two Americans
were infected by an HIV mutant resistant to virtually all other
drugs in a class known as nucleoside analogues, another key
ingredient in the anti-HIV cocktail. Nucleoside analogues, which
jam the assembly of new viral DNA, include the widely used agents
AZT, 3TC, ddC and D4T.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cases of protease inhibitor-resistant virus,
transmission of a multiply nucleoside-resistant strain represents a
first, Mellors said. The report was presented last week at a
meeting in Italy on AIDS drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that HIV, which causes AIDS, can
rapidly lose susceptibility to any drug in a given patient. The
only way around that _ and the key to success of triple-drug
therapy _ is to hit the virus simultaneously with several different
drugs at once, suppressing its replication to such a low level that
it cannot acquire resistance mutations.
</P>
<P>
   What is new in the recent reports is that the multidrug
resistant strains, and those that have escaped the effects of
protease and nucleoside drugs alone, have been passed from one
individual to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of why this is important is that many have speculated it
would be very difficult to transmit a protease inhibitor-resistant
HIV,'' said Dr. Frederick Hecht of the University of California at
San Francisco, who is scheduled to present a report this morning on
one case. ``Many hoped it might not be possible at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis, now proved false, was that the multiple
mutations required for HIV to resist protease inhibitors would make
it less ``fit,'' or infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco man was infected through unprotected anal
intercourse with a man who harbored a viral strain resistant to six
of the 11 anti-HIV drugs on the market, encompassing all three
classes of such drugs. The virus became resistant, researchers
said, through sequential treatment with many different AIDS drugs,
as well as interruptions in his treatment for reasons beyond his
control.
</P>
<P>
   Current HIV therapy stresses simultaneous, uninterrupted
treatment with at least three drugs to prevent resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 16,000 people who become infected by HIV each day
around the world, many already acquire strains with built-in
resistance to AZT, the first AIDS drug. In San Francisco, for
instance, about 16 percent of new infections involve AZT-resistant
virus.
</P>
<P>
   While the circulation of AZT-resistant virus is troubling,
doctors have had other arrows in their quiver to treat such
patients. Now AIDS specialists worry those options may eventually
disappear. The development carries big implications, many
researchers said. To name just a few:
</P>
<P>
   --- Doctors must make sure they prescribe the most effective HIV
therapy to avoid giving rise to infectious mutants. Right now, 42
percent of US patients being treated for HIV are on less than
optimal regimens that doctors say are certain to give rise to
resistant strains, according to a report presented here by US
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   --- People on anti-HIV treatments must take their drugs
religiously to suppress the emergence of resistant strains, and
also practice safe sex to avoiding infecting others. ``We need to
put more energy into supporting patients' adherence to their drug
regimens,'' Hecht said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   --- A new push to extend HIV treatment to developing countries
must not ``unwittingly become a factory for resistant virus,''
warned Margaret Chesny of the University of California. This could
happen, she said, if HIV-infected individuals could obtain only the
cheaper two-drug regimens certain to give rise to resistant
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Cohen, a Boston AIDS specialist, cited a recent
decision by South African health insurers to pay for HIV therapy _
but only for less expensive two-drug regimens. ``They're about to
make a big mistake,'' Cohen said.

is still a relatively new form of communication. So when President
Clinton turned up Tuesday at the studio of Shanghai Radio 990 to

first anniversary of its return to China on July 1, but Loon
Wai-ting is in no mood to celebrate. Loon has spent the year
without a job. Of course, Britain's exit from Hong Kong has had
little to do with the economic downturn of its former colony, but

<P>
   PG-13 90 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas' movie adapts the Hugh Lofting stories and the 1967
film with Rex Harrison. As a child, John Dolittle (Murphy) enjoyed
the unusual talent of being able to talk with animals. Once he
became a doctor, he suppressed his gift, but to his horror it
resurfaces involuntarily after he nearly kills a dog with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Although his wife (Ms. Wilson) has him temporarily committed, an
owl puts the word out among the animals of San Francisco that he
can understand them and thus treat their illnesses and injuries.
Performing death-defying surgery on an ailing circus tiger, the
doctor comes to re-evaluate his ``weirdness'' and actually revel in
it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Except for the near-miss with the dog, none. &QL;

   AGES 5-10 There is the language to consider, but despite the
film's slow start, small children should take to the idea of
communicating with animals. &QL;

   AGES 11-14 They may find the idea corny, but the film may
pleasantly surprise them. And they'll no doubt get the message:
everyone has a difference of some sort that makes them special. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP They'll consider themselves too sophisticated for
such fare, but Mr. Murphy's fans will find some laughs. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York it's already raining meteors the size of
Volkswagens, and in 18 days a space rock as big as Texas should hit
about mid-Pacific Ocean, piling up a three-mile-high tidal wave
that will wash up in Denver and otherwise spelling finis for
human-kind. ``What do we do?'' asks the president.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you pull up your socks and hire Harry S. Stamper (Willis)
and his oil-drilling crew to fly out there in a couple of space
shuttles, drill an 800-foot-deep hole in the asteroid and plant a
nuclear device that will blast it to pieces before it reaches
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A can-do spirit abounds as Harry and his roughnecks, characters
all, train for the big mission. Out in space, though, it's one
confirmation of Murphy's Law right after another as the crew battle
nasty surprises and one another. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Once again in a major action film, cities are destroyed
but no one is shown getting hurt. On the mission, people come to
bad ends, but aside from a splash of blood here and there, nothing
is grisly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX A young woman (Ms. Tyler) having a liaison with her

<P>
   Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh) is just a happy, flirtatious teen-age
Southern belle until she learns that the dashing man she loves,
Ashley Wilkes (Howard), is going to marry his cousin Melanie
Hamilton (de Havilland). Then Scarlett's world is truly turned
upside down: by the Civil War, which destroys the Old South she has
grown up in, and by Rhett Butler (Gable), a handsome blockade
runner who has, as he says, ``a way with the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett marries three times, is widowed twice, volunteers as a
war nurse, saves her family's plantation, grieves for loved ones
and generally scandalizes everybody in Atlanta before realizing
where her happiness lies. The classic 1939 film is back, restored
and re-released for yet another generation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Scarlett shoots a Yankee soldier in the face. A man is
pushed out of a wagon and over a bridge. Though a war is going on,
there are no real battle scenes. &QL;

<P>
   SEX A few passionate kisses. The closest thing to a bedroom
scene is Rhett carrying Scarlett, in her dressing gown, up a
staircase. &QL;

CELLUCCI SAYS STANDARDS, NOT POLITICS, RULE TEACHER ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acting Governor Paul Cellucci sounded a note of
defiance Tuesday in the face of accusations that he botched the
teacher testing issue, leading to the resignation of Education
Commissioner Frank W. Haydu 3d.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am not concerned about the political fallout, I'm not
concerned with the personnel fallout,'' Cellucci said. ``I believe
we have to do the right thing, and the right thing is to hold the
line on standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, Cellucci had suffered perhaps his
stormiest day as acting governor, savaged by opponents in both
parties for indecisive and opportunistic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci and his board have provided no direction, no
leadership and no stability,'' said Patricia McGovern, one of
Cellucci's Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents in Massachusetts and our studtents have a right to
direction and stability. This has become a bit of a joke and its a
bad joke because we've become a laughingstock and I don't think
it's very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy ignited by massive failures on the teachers'
test reached the governor's race Tuesday, further politicizing what
had already become a hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   With voters showing little passion for the red-meat issues of
yesteryear such as crime, welfare and taxes, politicians have
seized on education in a bid to bond with voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's long four days of silence on the teacher testing
issue before springing into action late last week, came back to
haunt him by giving his opponents an opportunity to bash him for
inaction.
</P>
<P>
   They said Cellucci had been in favor of not counting the test
results, then for counting them, then had argued for one passing
grade and then another.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Scott Harshbarger was the first to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At his press conference last week, Paul Cellucci said he took
a walk and came to the realization of how important teacher testing
is,'' Harshbarger said at a press conference. ``I say that for the
last seven years Paul Cellucci has taken a walk on education.''
</P>
<P>
   What Harshbarger did not mention is that Haydu has contributed
to his campaign. Haydu and his wife each contributred the legal
maximum of $500 to Harshbarger last year, according to campaign
finance reports, and hosted a fundraiser for the campaign that
raised about $7,000. Haydu also contributed $150 to Harshbarger in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger and his aides denied that the attorney general
played any role in Haydu's decision to quit Monday, though the two
men did talk after he announced his decision, the Harshbarger camp
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern came to the State House and challenged Cellucci to take
the test himself. She also renewed her call for the abolition of
the Board of Education. She said she will, if elected, replace with
a board of broader ideological diversity - a panel that can rise
above what she said is its current practice of squabbling over
minor issues.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly she blasted Cellucci for failing to make a policy and
stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, Cellucci's rival for the
Republican nomination, said he supports testing, but not Cellucci's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to everyone that Paul Cellucci's lack of
leadership has caused a crisis in our pubic education system
today,'' Malone said.

COULDN'T GURUS HAVE PREVENTED COMPUTER CRISIS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 2000, something really, really awful is going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dire forecast that neither Nostradamus nor the psychic
hot line ever anticipated. There's been a lot of talk about the
2000 compliance catastrophe for several months, but I wasn't sure
what all the whoop-de-do was about. Since everyone else seemed to
be in on the big secret, I inched my way over to Deke's house one
starless night for a little enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor Deke sits in a small room at the back of his garage
listening to a CB radio all day. I figured if anybody knew what the
heck was going on, it would be Deke, or Donkey Breath, the name he
uses on his CB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deke,'' I said during a lull in trucker traffic, ``what's all
this talk about year 2000 compliance? I'm totally in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Deke took off his headphones and spun around on his milk crate.
He spit out a stream of tobacco that killed two mosquitoes
innocently flying by. He peered at me through his eyeglasses with
no lenses and said, ``Well, Moe, as far as I know, Congress has
passed a bill that says in the year 2000 all you liberated women
have to stop nagging 24 hours a day and keep the fridge full of
cold brews and beef jerky.''
</P>
<P>
   I was at a loss for words. Finally, I said, ``Deke, when
lightning struck that big antennae on your roof last month, were
you on the CB?''
</P>
<P>
   Deke just laughed like a hyena and howled at the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Well, after doing a bit of research on the Internet, I finally
figured out what the fuss is all about. Most computer programs
cannot tell the difference between the years 1900 and 2000. Most
computers use a six-digit date field and to a computer 01-01-00
could mean Jan. 1, 2000, or Jan. 1, 1900. The problem will be worst
for financial systems where date calculations are vitally
important.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I understand that computers are rapidly evolving electronic
marvels. In 1953, there were only about 100 in the entire world! In
the 1960s and 1970s, huge million-dollar computers were commonly
used in business. In the 1980s, we witnessed an explosion of
personal computer use when Macintoshes arrived in almost every
school and became the computer of choice for home use. Now,
computers are almost as commonplace as stereos.
</P>
<P>
   That brief and boring history was necessary before I posed this
simple question. Why didn't someone anticipate this problem? We're
talking 15 or 20 years of personal computer popularity and it never
occurred to anyone that this would happen? Either we've got some
very pessimistic engineers who didn't think we could avoid a
nuclear war until the turn of the century or some folks with a lot
of foresight have stock in the expensive software we'll have to buy
to upgrade our computer systems to make them 2000 ready.
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, if it ain't one thing, it's two. Maybe we should
just trade in our computers for CBs. Deke says they're as good as
the Internet. Of course, Deke thinks pigs should be on a leash, so
I'd take that suggestion with a grain of salt if I were you.

OUTGOING EDUCATION CHIEF CITES `DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The outgoing interim education commissioner said
Tuesday the state Board of Education is fractious, highly
politicized, and sliding dangerously toward top-down education
reform with little input from the most important stakeholders _
teachers and principals.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday in his office, in suburban Malden,
Interim Education Commissioner Frank Haydu III, who quit Monday
after only four months on the job, called board Chairman John
Silber ``autocratic'' and said that having two Boston University
leaders on the board creates ``a difficult environment at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber is chancellor of Boston University and board member Edwin
Delattre is dean of the university's School of Education. Delattre
also oversees the team that manages the university's school
partnership with Chelsea. Others on the nine-member board include
academicians, as well as a union leader, high school student, and
conflict resolution expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were staffing this board, I would take John Silber and
four of the best teachers in the Commonwealth and four of the best
principals and say, `You are the state Board of Education,' as
opposed to having a group of academics,'' Haydu said. ``You would
get a very interesting outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber Tuesday said that it would be a conflict of interest to
have teachers and principals as board members, given that they
would be setting standards for themselves. He also said Haydu was
naive if he ever believed that becoming interim education chief in
an election year would somehow be a job free of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to have anything to do with politics, I
don't understand how you would look at a job like this,'' Silber
said. ``It has a political dimension and will be held up to
political scrutiny. We have had to make very important decisions in
an election year. We are bound to be sitting ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Haydu said he resigned over what he considered Governor Paul
Cellucci's overtly political interference with the teacher test
standards. Cellucci had called on the board to reconsider its vote
on how strictly to score the state's first teacher certification
test; he also urged the state to test all teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the board is meeting Wednesday to vote on whether
to raise the passing score on the certification test to one
originally set by a panel of educators.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the board had voted to follow Haydu's
recommendation that the score be lowered for those taking the test
in April because they had not received adequate notice that the
test, described by Haydu as one of the nation's hardest, actually
counted. Those taking the test in July 11 would also have had the
lower score, but Haydu had agreed to return to the panel's standard
by the October test.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Haydu predicted the board would vote in favor of
Cellucci's demand for the higher test score. The higher score means
that 260 candidates who passed under the lower standard will fail.
Overall, 59 percent of the 1,800 would-be teachers who took the
test failed under the higher standard, while 44 percent failed
under the lower one.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even Haydu's most ardent supporters Tuesday expressed
surprise and even anger at his decision to leave, despite a
hard-won promise that he stay on until after the November election.
Haydu, a businessman from Dover, is widely seen as a
consensus-builder and calming presence at often heated board
meetings. He has been working for free, donating his $140,000
salary to various schools and programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain puzzled and distressed by Mr. Haydu's action,'' said
board member Roberta Schaefer in a statement Tuesday. ``He is
certainly experienced enough in public affairs to know how
unrealistic it is that an issue so controversial as education
reform can be addressed without reference to political debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Delattre, meanwhile, said that Haydu should leave the post
immediately. ``He has declared the board dysfunctional and in
principle is opposed to everything that is going on,'' Delattre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haydu, a board member from 1992 to 1996, has said he would stay
on until September, but would leave earlier if the board asked him
to.
</P>
<P>
   Several observers and board members have privately said that
David Driscoll, a longtime deputy commissioner, should become the
interim chief until a permanent one is selected.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among most educators is that few potential
candidates for the commissioner's post, particularly people from
out of state, would consider taking the job until it becomes clear
who will run the Commonwealth and how the education board will
fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank brought much needed rationality and an attitude of calm
deliberation to the Board,'' said Representative Harold Lane Jr.
(D-Holden), cochair of the Legislature's education committee. ``My
concern is that he has not just quit on John Silber and the board,
but on kids.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We see music better than we write about it. This is
no surprise. The eye and ear are first cousins, sensory organs on
an equal footing. Writing is something the intellect thought up
later, a concocted set of symbols to put perceivers and perceived
in contact.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Basil Twist's underwater puppetry, currently
at work in the Here theater complex in SoHo. The sights with which
it accompanies the ``Symphonie Fantastique'' tell us more about
Berlioz's sounds than The New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Words fail. Some music lends itself to geometric dissection, and
tacking stories onto music is a device that comes and goes, but
intervals and rhythm have proved pretty much bulletproof when it
comes to descriptive language.
</P>
<P>
   Twist's exercise, called simply ``Symphonie Fantastique,''
manipulates objects and light within a 500-gallon tank of water,
one side of which, 30 by 40 inches, is visible to an audience of
about 100. ``Symphonie,'' performed to an old Philadelphia
Orchestra recording led by Eugene Ormandy, has its halting moments
and flashes of extraordinary beauty. It plays until July 26, and I
suggest that you see it.
</P>
<P>
   Water fascinated Romantic composers and their offspring. Debussy
described its reflected light and orchestrated a day in the life of
the sea. Liszt and Ravel wrote about fountains; Respighi, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ives followed the course of a river through Stockbridge, Mass.
Smetana had his Moldau to celebrate. Handel wrote the ``Water
Music,'' but his piece seems more about being on the water than in
it. So, too, Schubert's ``Auf dem Wasser zu Singen.'' More examples
exist, and I know that I shall hear about them.
</P>
<P>
   Water is legato, and so is the overriding spirit of Romantic
music. Water lets us hear with our eyes the extended melodic
phrase: continous, undulating, devoid of sharp corners and
rectangular shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Twist's scarves and strands of tinsel swim like fish and come
very close to singing like songs: diving, twisting, darting. The
movements, even to the erupting bubbles, are synchronized to
Berlioz's music. A lot of us like to emphasize the uniqueness of
music as an expressive art, but here the parallels between hearing
and seeing won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Berlioz's detailed story for this piece is not told. What we see
is how music moves. Some kinds of music, sonata form in particular,
move horizontally through time; we follow them as would our eyes
the path of a car. Contrapuntal music seems to expand in all
directions; advanced telescopes tell us that similar things are
happening in the universe. Twist illustrates both arts in three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Twist is not a classical musician, but he doesn't have to be.
The other metaphors are too natural to miss. Low and resonant music
is dark; high ranges and prickly textures are bright. Shrillness
and stabs of intense light are two different weapons inflicting
similar wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness worries us. Light is optimistic; indeed, photosynthesis
identifies it as a source of life. Associating minor keys with
sadness doesn't always work, however. Haydn can make minorness
sound funny; Dvorak, comforting. The German word for minor,
``moll,'' means soft, referring perhaps to the smoother, rounder
harmonic resolutions of the undoctored minor scale.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning colors to sound is no science, but a number of
musicians have been impelled to do it. For some, the associations
are as instinctive as the gift of absolute pitch. But if Scriabin
and Messiaen had their private and surprisingly precise palettes of
red, blue, yellow, no one seems to have arrived at a universal
vision of, for example, F major. (Scriabin heard/saw it as red.) D
major, on the other hand, tantalizes. For Scriabin it was a bright
yellow light; Haydn's eight-measure sunrise in ``The Creation'' is
in D major, too.
</P>
<P>
   The recorded sound for ``Symphonie Fantastique'' was not
exceptional, but it didn't matter too much. More important, Twist's
presentation made the ears stay wide awake, when it could just as
well have distracted their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Spending an hour in the dark looking at this strange little
proscenium also rearranged one's sense of scale. The most startling
moment of a relatively brief evening came after it was over, when
the four backstage operatives came out to take their bows. They
looked huge, like giants.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your point of view, ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is an
intriguing failure or a flawed success. The performance I went to
left lots of visual wrong notes and bad sonorities for all to see.
Some of the screens dropped awkwardly. Horizontal beams of light
and dancing vertical columns did not have the portent and sense of
the ominous that I think were intended. But some of the flashes of
movement and contrasting sheets of light took the breath away.
</P>
<P>
   This is a collateral art of music that needs more stage
technique and more inspiration to fill in the sagging moments.
Animated cartoons and Disney movies have the means but rarely the
vision.
</P>
<P>
   An important exception may be an old Bugs Bunny episode called
``Rhapsody Rabbit,'' an exercise in musical sophistication and
visual imagination that tells the truth by stretching it. Rarely
has hyperbole been used with such exactitude.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I doubt that a piano teacher charging $75 to $100 an
hour could teach a student as much as these few minutes do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is more vital than most animation,
because it gives us real people in real time, a live performance
featuring a cast of abstractions. I don't know if Twist and his
crew improvise from time to time, but I hope they do. At any rate,
they are onto something.

THE POP LIFE: OZZY OSBOURNE, SETTLED SURVIVOR
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo of Ozzy Osbourne is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or -1927.)

 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He has battled addictions to drugs, alcohol and
cigars. He has been kicked out of bands, barred from the offices of
his own record company and forced to submit to rabies shots. He has
been charged with inciting teen-agers to suicide, with the
attempted murder of his wife and with urinating on the Alamo. Yet
somehow through these events both tragic and ridiculous, the heavy
metal magnate Ozzy Osbourne has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, when he began the loud, violent reaction against
hippie peace and love with Black Sabbath, perhaps the archetypal
heavy metal band, his career has been pronounced finished time and
time again. And time and time again he has rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Now against all expectations, Osbourne has become one of the
biggest money makers on the road. Last year, in the face of scanty
media exposure, his Ozzfest package tour made over $10 million,
becoming one of the most successful festival tours of the summer,
second only to the all-female Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The third annual Ozzfest, which begins with performances on
Friday and Sunday at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., is
likely to have another good year. In addition to Osbourne, the tour
features Tool, Megadeth, Motorhead, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber, the
Melvins, Soulfly and other hard-rock acts as well as a carnival
sideshow called ``Never Never Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Osbourne called from a tour stop in Zurich to
discuss his Ozzfest and other pressing matters. Every question
asked produced a litany of angry responses, quasi-denials and
rants. Here's what Osbourne had to say:
</P>
<P>
   OZZFEST '97
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was doing last year was I was smoking loads of cigars
and it was messing my chest up and my voice was getting bad. Plus
I've suddenly developed allergies and asthma. But this year I've
been working on it. For me the audience can lift me up out of
anything: they're better than Prozac or a shot of whisky.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARON OSBOURNE, WIFE AND MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is my biggest fan and my biggest adviser and the one I
love. Half of Ozzy is Sharon. I don't come up with these fantastic
ideas and get all the logistics together. I have the easy job: I
just go up there and entertain and do interviews and walk around
hotel rooms all day long. She's a workaholic. She hasn't got a
figure like Pamela Anderson, but I don't care because she's my wife
and I love her more than anything in the world and we've got three
great kids.''
</P>
<P>
   UNSUCCESSFUL LAWSUITS ON THREE TEEN-AGE SUICIDES
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching this lawyer that was suing me being interviewed
on VH1. He said that he could honestly hear me say on the record,
`Get the gun, shoot, shoot.' I can put my hand on my heart and
swear on my children's lives that those words were never said.
`Suicide Solution' was about me drinking myself to death just after
a friend of mine, the original signer from AC/DC, died from
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE HEARINGS ON OBSCENE LYRICS
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, by having these hearings in the Senate you're
going to get some garage band that thinks it'll get successful and
noticed in the Senate if it writes a song called `Kill Your Mother
Twice.'''
</P>
<P>
   `OZZMOSIS'
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded that album twice. It became a job. You can't make
records like that. All the songs I liked, the record company
didn't. I've still got a load of stuff that will probably never see
the light of day, unless I get struck by lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   HIS NEXT SOLO ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying to my wife, `When am I going to make a record?'
It's a painful process for everyone because I am my own worst
critic. When I make a record, I very rarely play it again because
I'll find a fault in it 10 years later and think, `Why did I put
that there?'''
</P>
<P>
   REUNITING WITH BLACK SABBATH
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week the four of us recorded two live shows which were
spectacular and wrote two new studio tracks, `Psycho Man' and
`Selling Your Soul,' and they came together relatively quickly. I'd
like to do another studio album with them, but I'd like to continue
my own solo career first.''
</P>
<P>
   AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND FILM DEALS
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do is go around to a lot of old friends and ask
them to jog my memory. If I have one regret it's not keeping a
daily journal because I've been messed up all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   FANS
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I say at my concerts most nights is, `Make sure
you go out and get home safely, because I want to see you next year
and rock you again.' If my intention was to do songs that anyone
would harm themselves with, why would I say that?''
</P>
<P>
   Yanni, Business Guru
</P>
<P>
   Concert promoters and booking agents complained this spring that
the New Age composer Yanni was cutting them out of the business.
They griped that he was not honoring business protocol and working
with the concert companies that helped him (sometimes at a
financial loss) earlier in his career. Now that Yanni is a
superstar, they continued, he is bypassing them, arranging concerts
through his management and keeping more money for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yanni's manager, Danny O'Donovan, said this was the most
efficient way to run a major tour in his client's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Now concert promoters and booking agents might have even more
reason to complain. According to midyear statistics released by the
concert industry journal Performance, Yanni has made more money
touring in North America than any other act this year. This
curly-haired Greek soothsayer has taken in $40 million since
January, followed by the George Strait Country Music Festival with
$33 million and Eric Clapton with $28 million. The only 90s band to
appear in Performance's midyear Top 10 of top-grossing tours is the
Dave Matthews Band, which has taken in $9 million on its tour so
far, all of which provides more evidence that the album-buying
audience and concert-going crowd are two very different beasts.

TESTIMONY REFUTES WOMAN'S CLAIM TO $21 MILLION LOTTERY TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The dispute between convenience-store owner Nick
Havan and Watertown widow Paraskeve Kantges over a winning $21
million lottery ticket shifted again Tuesday when one of Havan's
steady customers said Kantges told him she hadn't won the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a state Lottery Commission hearing, salesman
James P. McGoldrick Jr., said he approached Kantges in Havan's
store the morning after the Feb. 5 drawing and asked if her ticket
had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Are you our newest local millionaire?''' McGoldrick,
44, told the commission. ``She said, `No, I am not.''
</P>
<P>
   When cross-examined by James Merberg, Kantges' lawyer,
McGoldrick insisted he wasn't joking. ``I humored my question, but
my interrogatory was sincere,'' McGoldrick replied.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges claims she telephoned the winning Mass Millions bet to
Coolidge Provisons, but Havan, the store's owner, said he kept the
winning ticket for himself after Kantges called back later to
cancel the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges, who has records to show she played the same number
every day for years, denies she canceled the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts Lottery executive director Samuel M.
DePhillippo ruled in favor of Kangtes, but Havan appealed. &UR;  &LR; Retired
Superior Court Judge Robert Steadman is hearing evidence and will
make a recommendation to the full lottery commission.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Joseph Malone, commission chairman has disqualified himself
because he has said he believes Kantges. The dispute is likely to
end up in the courts, however.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  On Monday, a third person, Sonia Bardakjian of Watertown also
claims the jackpot. Like Kantges, Bardakjian said she phoned in a
bet on the winning number. The lottery rejected her claim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Prior to Bardakian's appearance, Havan testified that he did
not come forward and publicly claim the jackpot for several days
because he feared Kantges would cause dispute his claim. But
Kantges has claimed the winner was among about 90 lottery bets she
made that day _ and the only one Havan did not turn over to her.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Tuesday, McGoldrick, a traveling salesman, said
he's a frequent lottery player like Kantges. He said he knows her
from seeing her playing the lottery at various locations in
Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   McGoldrick said he spent between 20 minutes and a half hour in
the store with Kantges that morning and ``she seemed calm _ not
like her usual self.'' Normally, he said, Kantges is
``confrontational, verbose, vociferous, argumentative and
hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   After she said she didn't hold the winning ticket, McGoldrick
said he suggested that ``it would be nice if someone local won. She
said, `Yes, it certainly would,'' McGoldrick testified.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hrach ``Richie'' Abrahamian, Havan's employee in the variety
store, corroborated the conversation between Kantges and
McGoldrick.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahamian, who was partners with Havan before selling his share
of the store, said Kantges came into the store three times that
day. He said Kantges paid for the bets she had phoned in the night
before and even purchasing more lottery tickets, but never claimed
that she owned the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahamian said when he came to work that morning he immediately
recognized the winning Mass Millions number as the one Kantges
usually plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick was nervous that Ms. Kantges would come to the store and
claim what she is claiming now,'' Abrahamian said. ``I suggested
that he call his lawyer.''

IVANISEVIC SQUEAKS INTO THE QUARTERFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ First of all, the big upset: no rain at Wimbledon. The
celebrated strawberries Tuesday weren't mildewed and the champagne
less watered down than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Upset No. 2: Goran Ivanisevic, the Croat Croaker, got out-aced
by his opponent, yet actually won the match. This was like somebody
pitching a 30-hit shutout. Doesn't happen. ``I'm not only aces,''
he says after losing the zinger race to Todd Martin, 23-15,
nevertheless striding into the quarterfinals, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 3-6,
7-6 (7-2). ``I do other stuff. Double faults.'' He did beat Martin
there, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Upset No. 3: Martina Hingis overslept past her starting time but
didn't get bounced. ``I had to get up at 8:30 to practice, then
play at 11,'' she yawns. ``Pretty early. I never played that early
here.'' It had to be because downpours intruding on five of the
first eight days stacked up the schedule. ``I slept through the
first set'' _ it looked that way _ ``but woke up for the second.''
That completed a drowsy 6-3, 6-2 win over Tamarine Tanasugarn for
the champ portraying Sleeping Beauty. ``OK,'' Martina opens her
eyes, ``I realize most people in the world have to be at work by
8:30, but I'm glad the final starts at 2.'' She intends to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Upset No. 4: The sister-brother act of Helena Sukova and Cyril
Suk, mixed doubles champs in 1996-97, lost their crown in the first
round at dusk. Mixed doubles? Picaresque Sam Silverman, the bygone
Boston boxing impresario, always thought that meant a martini in a
very tall glass.
</P>
<P>
   Why would thousands hang around until dark to watch mixed?
Because a very tall young lady, 6-foot-2-inch Venus Williams, was
making her Centre Court debut. She and her even taller accomplice,
6-5 Justin Gimelstob, won, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. As Australian and French
victors, the pair kept breathing their designs on a mixed Grand
Slam. Only one other team has done it, Aussies Margaret Court and
Ken Fletcher in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam? Silverman would have told you that's what Rocky
Marciano did to Jersey Joe Walcott to win the heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Upset No. 5: Looking to be the heavyweight champion of tennis,
6-4, 210-pound Mark Philippoussis roared into today's quarters
against Pete Sampras by winning the battle of the Good Aussie vs.
the Bad Aussie over Jason Stoltenberg, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, the party of the second part, has alienated the
Australian public by refusing to play Davis Cup (a huge matter Down
Under), playing the Lamborghini-driving playboy and declaring after
a first-round loss at Queen's Club three weeks ago that he had no
interest in entering Wimbledon, a shrine in the minds of his
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Party of the first part, Stoltenberg, the farm boy off a way-out
New South Wales cotton plantation in Wee Waa, is everything that
city boy Philippoussis from Melbourne isn't. Earnest and
hard-working, devoted father, ready to do or die in Davis Cup at
any time. How they must have groaned at home by the telly-watching
Stolts get beat by the balloon head.
</P>
<P>
   The upset belongs to Gavin Hopper, Philippoussis's
coach/trainer, who has suffered through numerous brain failures by
his pupil, but is slowly shaping him up physically and mentally.
``I've done some rash things,'' the lately improving 21-year-old
giant says. ``But Gavin has stuck with me, and I think I'm together
now. There are people at home who want me to do well. I've beaten
Sampras before (Aussie Open, 1996) and I can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper also coaches Monica Seles. ``Two rather different
cases,'' he smiles, as though talking about Dagwood and Blondie.
``Two different outlooks. But she's been on top. She knows what she
wants and how to get there. She'll do the work. Mark takes a little
more attention. I'm just there to help both.'' A Hopper double
wouldn't be a bad bet _ Seles and Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Upset No. 6: Davide Sanguinetti is in the quarterfinals. Here is
an Italian guy who played No. 6 for UCLA when he ran away from home
five years ago to sample the classrooms and fleshpots of Los
Angeles. Though he hasn't beaten anybody you've heard of, Davide
has shown a fine Italian volleying hand in crawling through holes
at the bottom of the draw, afforded when the seeds Marcelo Rios and
Karol Kucera (2d and 15th) vanished in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   He made it fun for the Italian journalists out on Court 18,
raising their voices in somewhat unseemly manner for Sanguinetti
while he beat Rios's conqueror, Francisco Clavet, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, no cheering in the pressbox!'' said a straightlaced
American reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, yourself,'' replied Ubaldo Scanagatta of Florence's
Nazione. ``We haven't had a quarterfinalist since Adriano Panatta
in 1979. I guess I can scream every 19 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. That's about as frequently as rain ignores
Wimbledon.

VOLUME MAKES REDISCOVERING THOMAS MANN MUCH EASIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Mann is a towering figure in world literature, but is
somewhat forbidding for readers who do not warm to a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the two major works by which most Americans know Mann _
``Buddenbrooks'' and ``The Magic Mountain'' _ he is a master of the
German ``Bildungsroman,'' the ``novel of education'' or of
``development.'' Such a work treats the social and intellectual
learning experience of an individual, often a youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddenbrooks,'' published at the century's turn when Mann was
25, offers a sprawling canvas of characters, but its substance
reflects Mann's own early life and experience and announces a
strongly individual style.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Magic Mountain,'' Mann's alter ego is Hans Castorp. At
a tuberculosis sanitorium in the Swiss Alps where Hans has gone to
visit a sickly friend, he develops his own malady and stays there
seven years _ mainly, however, because of his odd attraction to the
Haus Berghof whose international clientele represents a cross
section of European society in the years preceding World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Mann produced many other works formidable in both size and
scope. Surely his most ambitious project was the tetralogy
collectively titled ``Joseph and His Brothers,'' elaborating on the
narrative in the Book of Genesis. The valedictory novel ``Doctor
Faustus'' (1949) artfully second-guessed Adolf Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
   But in a writing marathon that spanned a half-century, Mann also
created miniature works that adhere to the theme of duality, or
dualism, the artist's struggle between reality and the aesthetic
dimensions of his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few critics have contended that Mann's most
significant achievement is in these less distended works, which are
addressed to Mann's characteristic themes but are more accessible
to the lay reader and less mortgaged to symbolism. Now the best of
these narratives are brought together in a single volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in Venice and Other Tales,'' new in hardback from Viking
($25.95), collects eight stories and four larger compositions,
including the great novella alluded to in the title. (''Death in
Venice'' also was a splendidly tragic film, with Dirk Bogarde as
Aschenbach.)
</P>
<P>
   The other novellas are ``Little Herr Friedemann,'' Mann's first
published work (1898); ``Tristan,'' (1901), one of the author's
frequent excursions into mythology; and ``Tonio Kroger'' (1903),
clearly representing the author's own conflict between ``life'' and
``spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in Venice,'' though, is the piece de resistance here. At
the time of its publication (1912), the author disclaimed any
personal connection to his protagonist _ Gustav von Aschenbach,
author of world renown _ who, while visiting in Venice, falls
desperately in love with a frail but incredibly beautiful
adolescent Polish boy named Tadzio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aschenbach looked forward every day to Tadzio's arrival, and
sometimes he pretended to be busy at the moment and to ignore the
beauty strolling by. But at other times he did look up, and their
eyes met. Nothing in the elderly man's cultivated and dignified
expression so much as hinted at any emotion; but Tadzio's gaze was
filled with questioning, with reflective wondering ...''
</P>
<P>
   The proudly heterosexual Thomas Mann may have denied such a
fixation, but recent Mann biographers _ he has lately been one of
the most written-about classic authors _ have decoded the author's
literary legacy and have documented Mann's continuing devotion to a
young man whom he met in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in Venice'' and all the other components in the Viking
volume are newly translated by Joachim Neugroschel (previously a
translator of Franz Kafka), who also provides the introduction.
Restored are controversial passages that were excised from the
first English translation with which American readers have been
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say Thomas Mann is here _ and there _ to stay.

LIBERTY MUTUAL TO BUY FLORIDA WORKERS' COMP INSURER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual Group, an insurance and financial services firm,
agreed Tuesday to acquire Summit Holding Southeast Inc., a workers'
compensation insurance company in Lakeland, Fla., for nearly $223
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Liberty Mutual, A Boston company that is already
the nation's largest workers' compensation insurer, a greater share
of that competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual, with $51 billion in assets under management, has
expanded through acquisitions in recent years. Its Liberty
Financial Cos. Inc. subsidiary includes Colonial Group Inc., a
bond-oriented house, Chicago investment firm Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham,
Asian equities firm Newport Pacific Management, and Keyport Life
Insurance Co. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Summit will become a wholly owned independent subsidiary of
Liberty, whose insurance unit is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. The
insurance company is owned by policy holders and is not publicly
traded.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tuesday's transaction, which values Summit at a 28 percent
premium above its closing price on Monday, Liberty will pay $33 per
Summit share. It will also redeem $17 million worth of Summit
preferred stock as well as assume $14.3 million in Summit debt. The
deal is expected to close in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Summit is the third-largest workers' compensation insurer in
Florida and has 7 percent of the state's market. Tuesday's deal is
evidence of a consolidating financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The highly-regulated workers' compensation market varies greatly
according to state. In Massachusetts, insurers have complained that
rising compensation claims and a backlog of cases are eating up
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Summit rose 23 percent on Monday's close to finish Tuesday at 31
7/8 in heavy over-the-counter trading.

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If you've stepped inside a health-food store in the
past few years, you've no doubt seen ``tonics'' and ``elixirs''
popping up next to the natural sodas.
</P>
<P>
   The New Age soft drinks come in hues of orange, yellow, red and
green and fruity flavors such as raspberry//tangerine, peach//mango
and lemon//ginger. But most dispense with the fizz and pack more
than a simple caffeine punch.
</P>
<P>
   Sold under names such as Tribal Tonics and SoBe, they're part of
the emerging ``nutraceuticals'' trend _ foods and beverages that
include medicinal herbs like:
</P>
<P>
   - Ginseng _ A mild aphrodisiac believed to enhance memory,
learning, productivity, physical stamina and immune function.
</P>
<P>
   - Echinacea _ The purple coneflower is used for prevention and
treatment of colds and flu.
</P>
<P>
   - Guarana _ A berry that grows in the rain forest and contains
caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   - Ginkgo _ A healing herb associated with the treatment of
stroke, heart disease, impotence, blindness and memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   - St. John's wort _ Touted as ``nature's Prozac,'' it is used to
enhance mood and uplift spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient cultures have relied on medicinal herbs for thousands of
years; they are thought to boost the immune system, relieve stress
or improve mental alertness.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Food and Drug Administration prohibits herbal
beverage makers from making health claims, the labels do sound
healthier than the typical high-fructose lingo found on a
mainstream can of cola.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a label on Tribal Tonics' Peach//Mango Energy
Elixir with ginseng and guarana says the herbs ``enhance energy,
stamina and endurance.'' But it also adds the following disclaimer:
``This product is not intended to treat, cure or prevent any
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Gallup poll found herb use among American adults had
increased by 70 percent since 1996. Now herbs are going mainstream
in the supermarket beverage aisle and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that medicinal herbs are showing up in cutting-edge
herbal tonics and are working their way into snack foods _ such as
Robert's American Gourmet, a line of St. John's wort tortilla chips
and vegan chips with ginseng, bee pollen and honey _ has at least
one local herbalist alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something to fool with, and making snack foods and
putting herbs in it is ridiculous,'' says Bonnie Woods, who
recently taught a six-part course at Johnson County Community
College on the use of medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving people a mixed message, even if it is a
teensy-weensy bit of echinacia, which is not so bad. Still, you
give people the idea that you can't overdose on herbs ... and you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone interested in herbal medicine, Woods advises a
healthy dose of common sense. Always thoroughly research herbal
remedies before trying them. And it doesn't hurt to remember that
herbal manufacturers are trying to sell a product, so she never
takes more than half the manufacturers' recommended dose until she
sees how her own body reacts to the drug.

HONG KONG PLANS MUTED CELEBRATION OF ITS REVERSION TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-NOTEBOOK, CHINA-TAIWAN,
CHINA-PEONY, ASIA-RUBIN) 
(ps) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ His hometown is marking the first anniversary of its
return to China on Wednesday, but after spending the year without a
job, Loon Wai-ting is in no mood to celebrate. On a recent
sauna-like afternoon, in the teeming neighborhood of Mong Kok, he
stood before a government labor office, fruitlessly searching a
bulletin board for job listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the British were here, there was a lot of business in
Hong Kong,'' said Loon, a 51-year-old merchant seaman, whose deeply
lined face bespeaks both a life at sea and a worrisome year as the
unemployed father of four. ``When the British left, the business
left with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Britain's exit from Hong Kong has had little to do
with the economic downturn of its former colony, which sits at the
crossroads of a becalmed Asia and has suffered along with its
neighbors. But Loon speaks for many Hong Kong people, who have been
ravaged by rising unemployment, a 20 percent drop in the stock
market, and a 40 percent decline in the property market in the last
six months.
</P>
<P>
   For this embattled outpost of commerce, celebrating the passage
of a year under Chinese rule seems almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is staging a flurry of events, including a
flag-raising, a cultural pageant, and back-to-back visits on
Wednesday and Thursday by the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, and
President Clinton. But the government has scrapped the gaudier
elements of last year's celebration, like the laser show and
fireworks display, because they seem ill-suited to these hard
times.
</P>
<P>
   The subdued tone of Hong Kong's anniversary is all the more
notable because until six months ago, the government here would
have had much to crow about. Politically, Hong Kong has scarcely
changed in the year since this capitalist bastion became part of a
communist empire. Defying the predictions of experts here and in
the West, Beijing has left Hong Kong largely untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Since last July 1, Hong Kong voters have turned out in record
numbers to elect a new legislature, enjoyed a lively news media,
and marked the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre
with a huge, candlelight vigil _ one of more than 1,400 protests
against everything from human rights abuses in China to the
plummeting value of apartments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are rumors that Chinese officials are seeking to
influence Hong Kong's leaders through hints delivered in
back-channel conversations. And the government recently raised
fears about the integrity of Hong Kong's legal system by amending
laws in ways that seem to favor Beijing. But fears about wholesale
meddling or the muzzling of the media have so far proven
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is a graveyard for political prognosticators,'' said
Daniel R. Fung, the solicitor-general of Hong Kong and a defender
of the government. ``Everybody predicted we'd have a bumpy ride
politically, but the economy would take care of itself. Exactly the
opposite has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Fung said Beijing delivered on its promise of ``one country, two
systems,'' a political arrangement that guarantees Hong Kong a high
degree of autonomy as a special administrative region of China.
That agreement was secured after years of often-rancorous
negotiations between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
   But while the British colonial government was laying the
groundwork for Hong Kong's political future, it was also presiding
over a spectacular inflation of the colony's property market _
creating an Asian Xanadu with more billionaires and Rolls Royces
per square mile than any other city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When the financial crisis tore through Asia last fall, it
devastated Hong Kong's exports and humbled its stock market. While
Hong Kong fought off the symptoms of the malady longer than its
neighbors, it finally succumbed _ slipping into a recession for the
first time in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   If economic collapse was not enough, Hong Kong has also been hit
by several calamities, including a deadly outbreak of bird flu last
December, a string of cholera cases, and a creeping red algae tide
in its coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The flood of bad news has left people traumatized. And it has
prompted them to question Hong Kong's government and its chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa, the conservative shipping magnate who was
chosen by Beijing to lead the territory. Such dissent is
uncharacteristic for Hong Kong, where the British colonial governor
historically ruled in close cooperation with the business elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic prosperity was the major connecting thread between
the old Hong Kong and new Hong Kong,'' said Michael DeGolyer, a
professor of government at Baptist University who studied public
attitudes toward the transfer to China. ``Now Hong Kong people are
getting very irritated.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger may have been one reason people voted in record numbers in
Hong Kong's legislative elections last month. In a gesture of
defiance to the local government and Beijing, the voters elected
pro-democracy candidates to a majority of the popularly elected
seats. Many of those politicians had been sent into political exile
when Beijing dissolved Hong Kong's last democratically elected
legislature before the transfer and replaced it with a hand-picked
body.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy politicians say that Hong Kong's people are even
more committed to a pluralistic political system than they were
before the transfer, when the city's political independence under
China seemed tenuous. Being a part of China, they say, has made
democracy seem more precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 1.2 billion people in China, we _ the 6.6 million
people of Hong Kong _ are the only people who have the vote,'' said
Martin Lee, the head of the Democratic Party who regained his
legislative seat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lee admitted that concerns about civil rights and
individual freedoms are being overshadowed by economic issues.
Indeed, the Democratic Party teamed up with pro-business and
pro-Beijing parties to mount a coordinated assault on the policies
of Tung. The group is calling on the government to use its massive
financial reserves to lessen the burden on people by cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure, the government last week announced a package
of measures, including a one-time tax rebate, to stimulate the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   For all the noise generated by the newly elected legislators,
Hong Kong is still firmly controlled by Tung. Though Lee and his
colleagues won more than half of the popular vote, they will hold
fewer than one-third of the seats in the legislature. And the
legislature does not have the power to introduce bills on major
issues without the acquiescence of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is demanding that the government accelerate the timetable
calling for voters to elect all legislators directly in 2007. But
given that the chief executive and the National People's Congress
in China would have to approve such an amendment to Hong Kong's
constitution, Lee's crusade seems quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing concern for some pro-democracy politicians is
the rule of law in Hong Kong. Although the territory has retained
British common law as the foundation of its legal code, some
critics say the government is making subtle changes that may
whittle away the rights of Hong Kong citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the government last April granted the Chinese
government the same immunity from local laws that the British Crown
had enjoyed in colonial days. The trouble is, Hong Kong's
authorities defined the Chinese government broadly enough to
include Xinhua, the New China News Agency, which has historically
functioned as Beijing's eyes and ears in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua still inspires fear among pro-democracy leaders here, and
the prospect that it will enjoy immunity from local laws is doubly
frightening to them. ``The last year has been little short of
hair-raising,'' said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and pro-democracy
politician who was also recently elected to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their qualms, even pro-democracy politicians credit
Beijing with masterful public relations. After marching into Hong
Kong at midnight on June 30, the People's Liberation Army troops
retreated into their barracks and have been confined there since. A
single forlorn soldier stands guard outside the garrison in central
Hong Kong, which is still called the Prince of Wales building.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China's conduct has given Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians a
keen sense of vindication. Tsang Yok-sing, a former high-school
principal and avowed Marxist who heads the main pro-Beijing party,
said Jiang had been scrupulous in maintaining the principle of
``one country, two systems,'' even discouraging pro-Beijing people
in Hong Kong from airing criticisms of the territory while in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   For people here who are intent on reaffirming their Chinese
identity, however, China's low profile poses some ticklish
problems. Hong Kong's top civil servant, Anson Chan, said in a
recent speech in Washington that she had felt an ``emotional and
spiritual connection'' in seeing the Chinese flag hoisted over Hong
Kong to celebrate the national day of the People's Republic on Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Chan's speech was greeted with ambivalence at home,
where symbols of official China are rare and Ms. Chan herself lives
in a stately home on the Peak, known as Victoria House. Lee, whose
family fled to Hong Kong from neighboring Guangdong Province, said:
``How can I feel warm when I see the flag go up when so many of my
people are deprived of basic human rights?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even staunchly pro-Beijing people are not ready to predict that
Hong Kong will never again clash with China. Though few believe
that the Chinese government will clamp down on Hong Kong over
political issues, a growing number of politicians and business
executives worry that Hong Kong's languishing economy might provoke
China to take a more intrusive approach.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Beijing on Saturday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, said
that senior Chinese officials had expressed fears to him about the
state of the Hong Kong economy during a discussion of the region.
Rubin was in China as part of President Clinton's state visit.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's financial stake in Hong Kong is vast and growing. Hong
Kong's stock exchange is the primary means for Chinese companies to
raise capital. With Prime Minister Zhu Ronji pushing to privatize
state-owned enterprises, Hong Kong will become an even more vital
window between China and the global market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The social contract between Beijing and Hong Kong is predicated
on a simple idea: as long as Hong Kong makes money, Beijing will
leave it alone. If Hong Kong stops making money, people here say,
all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China has to bail out Hong Kong, why should they give these
6 million decadent people special privileges?'' said Vincent Lo, a
leading property developer who has extensive business ties in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the noted Hong Kong author and publisher Louis Cha, puts
it: ``Suppose Hong Kong Bank lends me $1 million and I run my
business well. They will leave me alone. But if I run my business
poorly and can't repay my loans, it's very possible they will send
somebody to look at my books.''

CAN'T STAND THE SUMMER HEAT? GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Can't stand the summer heat? Get out of the kitchen.
Just be ready for steamy encounters of the food kind.
Kitchenware from a garage
</P>
<P>
   In 90-plus-degree heat on a recent Saturday afternoon my
4-year-old son and I ventured out to inspect just what our
neighbors were trying to clear out of their attics, basements,
garages _ and kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Our brief but rather steamy outing served as a reminder of just
how inexpensive it can be to outfit a kitchen with bargains gleaned
at neighborhood garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Consider my Cuisinart food processor. My grandmother found it at
a yard sale a few years back. It was still in its unopened box and
a quarter of the department store price.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, an inveterate garage-saler, also has found an
impressive array of items for my kitchen in recent years:
</P>
<P>
   - French press ($1).
</P>
<P>
   - Clay Romertopff pot ($2) and garlic roaster (50 cents).
</P>
<P>
   - One dozen 10-ounce Crown Corning dessert dishes (still in the
box, $4).
</P>
<P>
   - An unused sake set with ``Made in China'' stickers affixed
($3).
</P>
<P>
   - Glass tumblers to match the set I bought at Home Place a year
ago (10 cents each).
</P>
<P>
   - A clear glass tea kettle identical (except for the packaging)
to my beloved Museum of Modern Art-designed tea kettle that I
bought two years ago at a San Francisco dim-sum restaurant ($5).
</P>
<P>
   For herself, she has nabbed a Tupperware steamer (50 cents),
Corningware pots (50 cents to $1.50) and pressure cookers ($1).
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 copy of The Children's Step-by-Step Cookbook by Angela
Wilkes was in pristine condition, the spine never cracked, for $1.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that I sometimes need props for photo shoots, Mom also
has begun collecting such oddities as mismatched pieces of china.
One of her more unusual finds: a cornucopia of papier mache fruits
and vegetables. But I'm hanging on to them. I figure someday
they'll make a great Carmen Miranda costume.
Rhizome riddle
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a rhizome riddle?
</P>
<P>
   What knobby root has a peppery, slightly sweet aroma and is
essential to the cuisines of Asia and India?
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Americans adore using this spice to make
``(fill-in-the-blank)bread'' people at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I was checking out at the local supermarket recently when the
young checker held the brownish root up, wrinkled her forehead and
was at an utter loss as to how to key it into the register.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this? Rawhide?''
</P>
<P>
   As in dog bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ginger,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it looks like rawhide,'' she shot back.
 &LR; brk:Rice-Krispies Rage
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard of road rage. But here's a twist.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned onto Metcalf Avenue the other morning, I stopped at
a light, and I was transfixed by the vision in my rearview mirror.
The guy behind me was eating cereal _ with milk!
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, in a bowl!
</P>
<P>
   With a spoon!
</P>
<P>
   The light changed and he proceeded to drive down the road,
sucking down his cereal. I couldn't help but continue to stare in
my sideview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Was he driving with his knees? An automatic, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had the nerve to pass me.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Rice-Krispies Rage!

CASE OF THE TEHRAN MAYOR: REFORM ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a high-ceilinged courtroom under the heat and
glare of television lights, the mayor of Tehran is on trial,
struggling to keep his job and clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   But his trial, which at times resembles a shouting match, is
more than an attempt to uncover and punish financial corruption. It
is the most prominent part of a campaign by clerical conservatives
to thwart the reformist administration of President Mohammad
Khatami, which they fear will dilute the rigors of the 19-year-old
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi is a close ally of the president
and a member of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I stand before the law, my neck is thinner than a hair,''
Karbaschi told the packed courtroom Tuesday, using a Persian
expression that means he is prepared to accept any verdict. But he
blended defiance with his meekness, saying in his four hours of
testimony: ``I believe whatever I have done is within the law. It
is an attack on our system to say that billions of rials have been
wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi insisted that he is a loyal servant of God and
country.
</P>
<P>
   Even his supporters fear that Karbaschi, a gutsy 45-year-old
former cleric who has run Iran's capital of 10 million people for
more than eight years, will be convicted on some counts. He is
charged with embezzling nearly $5 million, receiving bribes,
influence-peddling, financing political campaigns and misusing
official funds, charges that may keep him in jail for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom, which is used to try public officials, is filled
with icons of the Islamic republic. Huge portraits of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the revolution, and of Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, his successor, hang on each side of the stage. A
banner strung along one side of the courtroom reads, ``Prayer
clarifies the heart.'' And Tuesday's session began with salutations
to the prophet Mohammed and a five-minute reading from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi was a staunch supporter of Khatami in the presidential
election in May 1997 that swept him to power, and Karbaschi's
supporters have accused the judiciary of using the case to
discredit the president.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Khatami supports Karbaschi while battling the
conservatives on another front: About 10 days ago, the Parliament
dismissed one of Khatami's closest allies, Interior Minister
Abdollah Nuri. Khatami swiftly retaliated by naming Nuri a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi's trial has ignited a debate over Iran's convoluted
system of justice, in which the prosecutor, a cleric, also serves
as judge and jury. Until about a year and a half ago, the roles of
prosecutor and judge were filled by two people. But the judiciary
ruled that it was more Islamic to have one person fill both roles,
even though that was not the case in early Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi challenged the credentials of the first judge, who has
been replaced, and he has charged that some people who testified
against him had been coerced.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began three weeks ago and could last weeks more.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four sessions so far has been broadcast on national
television at 11 p.m., offering most Iranians their first inside
glimpse at a trial of a public official. The trial, part civics
lesson and part soap opera, has captured record audiences and is
debated in detail in Iran's politically diverse press.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's session had been postponed for five days because the
media-savvy mayor asked that the trial not coincide with Iran's
participation in the World Cup soccer matches, which was broadcast
in the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding itself was largely a heated debate _ at times a
shouting match _ between the bearded white-turbaned judge, who sat
behind a vast bench on a giant stage with gold colored drapes, and
Karbaschi, who stood several feet below behind a lectern.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Karbaschi demanded that the judge, Gholamhussein
Mohseini Ejei, clarify the charge that the municipality had bought
the land that had once been the Tehran Zoo and resold it to some
city managers at less than market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges were clarified!'' the judge shot back. ``You must
answer, or say that you do not want to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You did not let me finish!'' Karbaschi shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give me the runaround!'' the judge replied. ``I do the
asking and you do the answering.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Karbaschi asked that the judge allow others to
testify on his behalf regarding a charge that he had ordered
employees to buy gold coins and give them as a farewell present to
a minister who had been removed from his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the regulations in the law, we can't have
witnesses,'' Karbaschi said. ``We want witnesses!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give me a reasonable answer, I'll drop the charges and
there will be no need for witnesses,'' replied the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi got a boost Tuesday from the testimony of Ali
Besharati, a conservative who served as interior minister during
some of Karbaschi's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the activities of the municipality every day and I
was supporting them,'' Besharati said, adding that the charges
might be of ``neglect and omission by the Tehran mayor and not,
heaven forbid, any bad intention.''
</P>
<P>
   The only role for Karbaschi's two lawyers, who sat at a desk to
his right much like an American defense team, seemed to be to
explain intricacies of the penal code when called upon by their
client.
</P>
<P>
   The section where an American jury might sit was reserved for
four dozen photographers and reporters. Iran's state-run television
strategically placed four cameras in the court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has exposed the lax system of bookkeeping in Iran, a
country that has thrived on favors and gifts regardless of whether
the country was ruled by clerics or by kings.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no concrete evidence, at least not yet, that
Karbaschi is personally corrupt, he exploited the lax system,
moving money from one account to another, trading favors,
encouraging employees with bonuses and benefits and pressuring
businesses to contribute to his various beautification schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he bulldozed apartment buildings and office
buildings built without city approval, removed revolutionary
graffiti from walls, planted thousands of trees, banned much of the
private traffic in central Tehran and opened more than a hundred
parks _ all in the name of transforming Tehran into a city that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   When Karbaschi was briefly arrested after the charges were
leveled against him, many shopkeepers hung a caricature that had
appeared in one of the newspapers showing Karbaschi in a prison
cell chained to a plant.
</P>
<P>
   But Karbaschi also made enemies, angering bazaar merchants by
raising taxes and contributing to the city's soaring real estate
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in the holy city of Qom as a cleric, Karbaschi spent
time in Evin prison for his political activities before the
revolution and holds the same clerical rank as the judge who is
trying him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he loses, he could be made a political martyr and
eventually re-emerge as an even more important political figure.
Asked in an interview in 1995 about his reputation as ``the most
loved and hated man in Tehran,'' he replied, ``Great people in
history are like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial resumes on Sunday. &QL;

AIRMAN'S IDENTIFICATION RELIEVES FAMILY AFTER YEARS OF
UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A 26-year mystery was resolved Monday when the Pentagon
said the remains of a serviceman in the Tomb of the Unknowns are
those of a St. Louis airman.
</P>
<P>
   That ends years of uncertainty for the family of 1st Lt. Michael
Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, 1972, Blassie's A-37 was shot down over Vietnam. For
years, loved ones were told that his body had never been recovered.
But earlier this year, a TV report presented new evidence that
Blassie's remains were in the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington
National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's family said Pentagon officials told them a formal
announcement would be made today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy about what's happened,'' Blassie's sister,
Judy Cozad, said Monday night by telephone from Chesterfield, Mo.
``I think it's going to bring a feeling of closure for everyone,
especially my mom. We still want to wait to hear it officially,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Four siblings plan to gather in the Florissant, Mo., home of his
mother, Jean Blassie, Tuesday morning to receive a phone call from
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa family had hoped that the remains belonged to Capt.
Rodney Strobridge, an Army pilot who also was shot down over
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Althea Strobridge, said that Pentagon officials told
her Monday that the remains were Blassie's.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery had grown to become more than just a struggle for
two families. It also was a delicate political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomb of the Unknowns remains a treasured place for American
veterans, containing one soldier killed in each of the nation's
major wars since World War I. Defense officials were reluctant to
disturb the tomb so Blassie's body could be exhumed for DNA tests.
But they did so.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's family was invited to Arlington last month for the
exhumation. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the tests were
done ``with the hope that the heavy burden of doubt may be lifted
from a family's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's family was devastated when they received word of his
death. After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1970, Blassie
was accepted to flight school. From there, he was called into duty
in Vietnam in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie flew 132 missions in his A-37. On May 11, 1972, as part
of what was later known as the Easter Offensive, Blassie's plane
and another A-37 swooped in to bomb An Loc in southern Vietnam.
There Blassie's plane was hit by an anti-aircraft gun and crashed
into a jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Because of enemy troops, it was six months before American
forces could reach the crash site. Near there, searchers found a
man's remains along with Blassie's ID card, dog tag, money and
wallet. The findings were shipped home, but the remains became
separated from Blassie's belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Tests to identify the body were inconclusive, but the Pentagon
said the remains were ``believed to be'' Blassie's. In 1979, the
``believed to be'' designation was removed from the remains, which
then were reclassified as unidentifiable. In 1984 the Pentagon sent
the remains to represent the Vietnam War dead in the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jean Blassie couldn't even talk about her oldest son.
A marker in a secluded corner of a St. Louis cemetery had been an
incomplete tribute. Now the family hopes for a proper funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's siblings still remember the words of their mother when
they asked her whether she wanted to pursue the case after the
initial television report. She didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring Michael home,'' she told her children.

`TOWN BALL' DISGUISED AS TOP-FLIGHT PROFESSIONALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ We went out to the stadium the other night to
watch a game of town ball.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're unfamiliar with the term, ``town ball'' is what's
played on summer evenings in places like Elysian and Waterville,
Minn., by men who get off work at the feed store, the filling
station and the plant that cans sweet corn.
</P>
<P>
   They're pretty good, some of those fellows. They're almost, but
not quite, good enough to play the game for money.
</P>
<P>
   Things might have been different if they'd gotten a break
somewhere along the line _ had the chance to go to college and been
noticed by a scout, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all in the past. You can't feed a family on
might-have-beens. So now they heave sacks and pump gas and go out
under weak lights to play the team from the town just down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher's curve ball hangs more often than it breaks, and
his fast ball comes in fat and straight, big as a cantaloupe to the
batter's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while one of the town boys will make a play so
spectacular it takes the breath _ the kind you'd expect to see in a
highlight film.
</P>
<P>
   But they also boot ground balls fairly often, and make bonehead
plays, like throwing to the wrong base or getting doubled-up on a
pop fly because they forgot how many outs there were.
</P>
<P>
   What can you expect, though? These aren't professionals, getting
the big bucks to perform. They're just a bunch of ordinary guys who
can't quite leave boyhood behind, and so they play the game for
love.
</P>
<P>
   As I've said, we spent a recent evening at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers for the home club pooled their ineffectiveness in
surrendering 19 hits, two of which left the premises. The opponents
gave up only 10 hits, but committed three errors.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium was more than half-empty. The loudest cheers were
for fans who caught foul balls. No real spirit could be detected on
the diamond or in the dugout. Shoulders slumped. There was, about
it all, a sense of leaden inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, neither team was much good, a fact to which the
men on the field appeared resigned. Granted, they were more skilled
than the population at large. But so are most town ball players.
</P>
<P>
   And this wasn't really a town team we were watching. In name, if
not in fact, this was big-league baseball. These were lads who
receive a ludicrous wage for something they do not do exceptionally
well.
</P>
<P>
   You think back to the quality of the game before the era of
willy-nilly expansion, and it's plain that in those days a good
many of today's players would have been punching the clock and
holding down regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the notion took hold that every city which meant to
be anyplace at all had to have a major-league baseball team, the
talent inevitably began thinning out.
</P>
<P>
   There still are stars, of course _ still players with prodigious
gifts. There just aren't enough of them to go around. What you get,
as a consequence, is something that resembles town ball, but
without the homespun enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   I'll say this, though: The stadium is a beauty! The lights are
bright. The hot dogs are good, if a little pricey. All that may be
worth the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And the grass...well, the grass is an absolute wonder. They
don't grow turf like that on the lumpy fields of Waterville and
Elysian, Minn.

FAIR FOUNDER SAYS MUSIC FEST HAS GAINED FUNDING, FOLLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Even the most popular novelties in pop music
have a shelf life of about nine months, so you might figure that
the second Lilith Fair would be less of an attraction than the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the popularity of the 1997 fair, one of the
year's most successful tours (it grossed $16.5 million), had more
to do with the talent it showcased than with its maiden principle:
There's no chromosome better than an X chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, this year's festival has grown from 37 to
57 shows and is expected to do even better than last year's. Maybe
it's because the 1998 lineup is more diverse and star-studded than
last year's, which was a relatively homogenized blend of melodic
pop-folk singers//songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were new and unknown, it was difficult to get
everyone we wanted last year,'' the festival's founder and
headliner, Sarah McLachlan, told The Star recently. ``This year,
more people are asking to be part of the show. Last year we
featured 81 artists; this year we'll feature about 120.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 40 new artists will make Lilith much more diverse,
ethnically and stylistically: women like Missy ``Misdemeanor''
Elliott, Queen Latifah and Erykah Badu (hip-hop), Neneh Cherry
(jazz//hip-hop), Me'Shell Ndegeocello (funk, rock, hip-hop), Beth
Orton (techno-folk), Emmylou Harris (country) and Luscious Jackson
(pop funk//hip-hop).
</P>
<P>
   Of those artists, only Ndegeocello will perform Thursday at
Sandstone Amphitheatre, but the local lineup also includes
second-stage acts like Mono, a techno-pop band, and Sister 7, a
rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten bigger, and bigger is better _ primarily because
it increases the money that will go to charities,'' McLachlan said.
``We have grown, but primarily in the amount of corporate
sponsorship we'll get and in the number of shows we'll do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the venues where the festival goes, our space is
restricted. We can't add any more stages, and we don't want to cut
into each artist's performing time. So to allow 40 more artists
into the show, we've added 20 shows. Everyone will do join the tour
for about two weeks, except Bonnie Raitt and Natalie Merchant, who
will do about 20 shows each.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's tour raised $750,000 for local and national
charities, McLachlan said. Like last year, $1 from each ticket sold
this year will go to a local women's shelter. McLachlan said she
expected this year's tour to raise about $1.5 million, thanks in
big part to the 10 corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most gratifying part of every stop is handing over a check
for $20,000 to a women's shelter and hearing how important that
donation is to them,'' she said. ``The festival is about more than
just music. We give organizations like Life Beat (an AIDS awareness
group) and Planned Parenthood space to set up booths and inform
people _ without preaching, I might add. I really like being able
to provide those platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it'll still be a charm, McLachlan is already
committed to a third Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this with a three-year plan,'' she said, ``and
we'll carry that through and then reassess things. Maybe we'll put
it to bed for a year, or maybe we'll start something altogether
new. Whatever we do, I want Lilith to remain fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she might try to freshen things by adding some
seemingly appropriate ``sensitive male'' songwriter types _ guys
like Ron Sexsmith, Elliott Smith or Rufus Wainright _ to the
agenda, McLachlan said very quickly: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Then added: ``I could very easily see putting together a
different festival with men, and Ron Sexsmith would be the first
one I'd ask. But for Lilith? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year to the date after the first Lilith Fair began _ a
year nearly filled from start to finish with touring _ McLachlan
said she was eager to get the second fair on the road (it opened
June 19 in Portland, Ore.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the entire month of May off, so I'm ready,'' she said.
``Lilith is like summer camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, is the poison ivy hiding in the woods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, but _ the media,'' she said, laughing. ``Most of the
press we got last year was positive. But there were lots of times,
especially at some of the press conferences we held before the
shows, where the media focused hard on the negative, on what the
fair wasn't. And I spent a lot of time trying to justify the whole
thing. We kept repeating ourselves: `No, it's not perfect and not
everyone is going to like this. But ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people had a hard time accepting that things were going
well and (that) the fair was a big success. So they looked hard for
flaws and problems.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, they'll have to look even harder. In 1998, the Lilith
Fair has shed its reputation as a novelty _ as Gal-a-palooza or
Estrogen Fest.
</P>
<P>
   And having discarded a stereotype it never wanted, Lilith II can
focus on living up to something it inherited from its predecessor:
a lofty reputation.

BLEACH BRINGS NIRVANA TO GUYS WHO WANT TO GO PLATINUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHERINE L. DYKSTRA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It could be the influence of movie and TV
stars, guys like Drew Carey, Jason Priestley and Bruce Willis. Or
maybe it's art, a bold personality statement. Or maybe they're just
looking for a good time _ after all, blonds have more fun, right?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, more and more young men _ yes, men,
Caucasian, African-American, Asian _ are coming down with a serious
case of blond ambition, soaking their hair in bleach and peroxide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Briar, 19, of Olathe, Kan., bleached his a couple of
weeks ago. So did Eric Rice, 20, of Overland Park, Kan. Dan Hunter
of Kansas City turned his naturally brown locks into a blinding
white pate nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get comments on it all of the time,'' Hunter said. ``Most of
the people at my store get a kick out of it.'' Hunter is owner of
Pretzel Time at the Town Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   They're hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's been in Rolling Stone magazine lately,'' said
Tina Steele, a hair colorist at Blondie's Studio of Hair Color and
Design in Kansas City. ``I don't know if they're seeing it on TV
and in the magazines, and that's where they're getting it or
what.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the fascination? Why turn your head into a white,
short-piled rug?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it to be noticed,'' Hunter said. ``It's like an art.''
</P>
<P>
   For Briar, his dye job was more of a labor of love: When his
girlfriend colored her own hair and hated it, Briar proceeded to
bleach his hair in an effort to show her that it is, in fact, just
hair.
</P>
<P>
   When and where the fad began is hard to say. In Kansas City the
towheaded trend has gently rolled in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to a local salon began Hunter's quest for blond. He
watched the hairdresser bleach a customer's hair and decided he
could save money by doing it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what they did and knew that I didn't need to spend $80
on it,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a bleaching kit from a local drugstore, which can cost
$7 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   At Blondie's, 39th and Roanoke, a bleach starts at $65, then the
price increases with the hair length, said colorist Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter began by bleaching his cropped hair a natural blond shade
but quickly moved to a stark white. He is most satisfied with his
hair two weeks after a bleach _ yes, when his dark roots peek
through the blond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys that do it seem to wear very short hair, and
they want it as light and as white as you can get it,'' Steele
said.
</P>
<P>
   Every three weeks Hunter takes three hours out of his day to
bleach his hair. He admits it is a big hassle but thinks the visual
effect and the attention he receives is worth the time he spends.
</P>
<P>
   Rice usually has his girlfriend bleach his hair for him. But be
careful whom you trust with your hair, he said: Once a friend
failed to bleach Rice's hair evenly and he turned out looking like
a ``leopard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although younger men seem to have embraced the fad most
fervently, Steele said more older men are choosing to go platinum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is a bigger trend now than when I started
bleaching mine, two years ago,'' Hunter said. ``But I am a lot
older than a lot of the kids who are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, many adults just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first did it my parents didn't like it and didn't
understand,'' Rice said. ``But, you know, they don't have to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Women don't seem to be as excited about the trend. Steele thinks
they realize how much upkeep is involved, while the men tend not to
understand the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the trend also may be more popular among men because
women have more to risk when bleaching their hair. After only four
applications, Hunter's hair becomes so dry that the ends crackle
off like nested linguine.
</P>
<P>
   So he just shaves his head and begins again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bleaching damages a woman's long hair, she has much
more to lose,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the hair that light and that white, you can't have any
length, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I didn't like my hair, it's just that I wanted
to be different, different from anyone else,'' Hunter said. ``I
don't think that anyone is ever really satisfied with their hair.''
</P>
<P>
   So do blonds really have more fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls really seem to like it,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   That just might be answer enough.
</P>
<P>
   Going blond
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about transforming your tresses into the blondest of
blond? Here's some inside advice from platinum guys Dan Hunter of
Kansas City and Eric Rice of Overland Park, if you're going to dye
yourself:
</P>
<P>
   - Covering your head with plastic after applying the chemicals
will help speed up the bleaching process and help make the color
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   - Applying heat, such as a hair dryer, also speeds things along.
</P>
<P>
   - Keep water nearby. If the chemicals start to hurt your scalp,
pour on the water to relieve the burn. Hunter said he uses
lemon-lime soda.
</P>
<P>
   - The bleach will bleach anything it lands on _ carpets, towels,
skin _ so be careful!
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure you cover your hair evenly or you'll end up with
stripes!

PRODUCER TED HOPE KNOWS ANGST, ART OF INDEPENDENT FILMMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: This is Ted Hope's Gospel of Independent Filmmaking:
</P>
<P>
   ``The quintessential rule of no-budget filmmaking is that the
budget is the aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know what you can do with the money you have and
shape your production around it. You have to boil down the essence
of what each scene is about and make sure that if you get nothing
else, you have that essence on film.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope knows a few things about making good movies with little
money. As a founding partner (with screenwriter//producer James
Schamus) of New York-based Good Machine Productions, he has
encouraged and nurtured some of the most important directors in
independent films.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-born Hope produced early efforts by indie stalwart
Hal Hartley. Since the founding of Good Machine in 1991 he has
produced all of Ang Lee's movies, including the Civil War drama
``Ride With the Devil,'' currently filming in the Kansas City area.
He also produced works by Ed Burns (``The Brothers McMullen''),
Todd Haynes (``Safe'') and Todd Solenz (whose ``Happiness'' was the
sensation of the Cannes Film Festival this year).
</P>
<P>
   Hope practices what he preaches. When ``Ride With the Devil''
completes principal photography later this week, it will be on
schedule and within its $38 million budget, he said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The producer will share some of his insights in a seminar this
weekend at the Tivoli theaters in Westport (see box for details).
</P>
<P>
   ``These seminars are a natural outgrowth of what we do,'' Hope
explained during an interview in the austere trailer he shares with
co-producers James Schamus and Bob Colesberry on the ``Ride With
the Devil'' set. ``In the past it's always been in conjunction with
film festivals where our movies have been shown. In this case I
wanted to do something for the Tivoli Theatre, which I've visited
several times while I've been in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``But also I always feel strange when I'm filming on location.
Granted, you bring in money, but I always feel like a carpetbagger
who's somehow exploiting the community. I've found these seminars
are a way of getting across a sense of who we are, of sharing what
we've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Details magazine, Hope's company, Good Machine,
``has become New York's pre-eminent independent production company
by attracting talented young directors and helping them make their
movies on the leanest budgets possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hope said, ``The biggest role of a film producer is to
help directors understand their choices and the repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you find a first film that's right for you as a
director? One of the things we do as producers is give our
directors reality checks. Sometimes we advise against making a
certain movie now. We'll suggest that this is a topic the director
should tackle as a third or fourth movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope is a boyish-looking 35-year-old who talks in a voice that
his partner Schamus has described as ``crossing a Canadian goose
with a South Boston fishmonger.'' He noted that in Good Machine's
seven years the stakes for low-budget movies have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that if you made $1 million off your low-budget
film, it was a success. Now you've got to make $5 million.
Moreover, even many distributors of independent films are only
looking for the more mainstream work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Ang suffered from that. He won an award for making the
best student film at NYU, but it took eight years for him to make
his next movie. His agents wanted him to have a big Hollywood
career; they rejected two offers we made to produce Ang's films.
Finally Ang got so frustrated that he came to us with money he'd
raised in Taiwan and asked us to produce `Pushing Hands.' He said
he'd die if he didn't actually make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope practically lives on the telephone _ understandable since
Good Machine always has several projects going at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently we have two projects in development from first-time
directors. We're shooting one director's first film, and we're in
post-production on another first film. We have four scripts in
development with directors whose first films we produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course we're filming `Ride With the Devil,' which is
the biggest project we've ever been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping directors understand their options, a
producer's job breaks down into several key functions, Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   - Funding: ``Money can come from lots of sources. You can find
private money, make foreign pre-sales, shop your idea to the
studios _ or you can chop down the budget so you can make the film
on that inheritance your aunt left you. It's always a different
story. One of our directors raised all his money from his
relatives. Another took four years to assemble his money from many
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   - Post-production: ``A good example is `The Brothers McMullen.'
Ed Burns had it shot and cut when we first got a look at it. It was
a two-hour movie that was closer to melodrama than comedy. Every
distributor who saw the film passed on it. But we saw something
there, and we spent lots of time, lots of nights at an editing
machine, working with Ed to reshape the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that happened even on `The Ice Storm''' _ Ang
Lee's last film. ``The first cuts of that movie played like a
comedy. We realized we couldn't have a film where people laugh for
an hour and then we kill off a character they love. So we had to
eliminate some very funny stuff to better serve the overall tone of
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another thing about being a good producer _ you have to
always look at the movie with the eyes of a first-time viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   - On the set: ``Typically, I'm a hands-on producer. We're not
the kind of deal-making producers you see depicted in movies. James
and I got into this out of our love of film. We really admire what
it takes to get a director's vision out onto the screen. We want to
be available as a sounding board, to help the director do that. If
you see one of our films, we hope you will say that it couldn't
have been made by any other director.''
</P>
<P>
   Good Machine isn't going it alone on ``Ride With the Devil,''
its most expensive effort so far. Universal Pictures has
underwritten much of the film in return for the U.S. distribution
rights. It's a slightly different environment than what Hope and
company have been used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more people to work with, and more people watching
over us,'' Hope said. ``Because there's so much money at stake, you
need more visible actors. As a producer, you then have to deal with
them and their agents to a much greater extent than you might on a
low-budget project. The chain of communication grows with the
budget _ studio people, agents, bigger crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a smaller film I'll know everybody on the set by their
first names. Can't do that here.''

NOISY STORMS CAN PUT PETS IN A PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The winds begin to pick up. Boiling clouds
turn daylight into night. They are nature's signs that a storm is
coming _ a storm that can sometimes turn an otherwise calm animal
into a frenzied fur ball.
</P>
<P>
   Instinct tells them they need to move. Run. Hide. Some pace,
some pant. Some begin to tremble.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a dog, cat, horse or even a giraffe, severe
thunderstorms such as those that rumbled through the area this week
can truly frighten animals _ even to death.
</P>
<P>
   During storms, dogs have thrown themselves through plate-glass
windows trying to get inside a house, or ripped their teeth out
trying to break free of a chain, said Chris Duarte, a dog
behaviorist and owner of K-9 Connection, a training school for dog
owners in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a client with a golden retriever who would literally
try to hide in the smallest space possible,'' Duarte said. ``One
day the owners came home and found him with his head stuck in a
small plastic toy. He had suffocated.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just domestic animals that are afraid of storms. At
the Kansas City Zoo Tuesday morning, the giraffes wouldn't leave
their stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were leery of coming out,'' said Agelon Jones, zoo area
supervisor. ``They don't like storms. I guess it was too much for
them. We didn't force them to leave. When an animal weighs 1,400
pounds and stands at least 15 feet tall, if they decide they don't
want to come out, they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Other animals accustomed to life outdoors also may panic _ even
domestic livestock.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, one loud ``BOOM!'' jolted awake horsewoman
Tammy Kesemann, owner of TnT Equine Center in Odessa, Mo. Cruiser,
her stallion, was in the pasture. ``I had to go get him,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she found him in the field, Cruiser was trembling and
nervous. ``He was ready to come in,'' she said. ``I've known about
horses and cattle that have been struck by lightning. I didn't want
to take any chances with him. He's too valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dog and cat owners also feel their animals are valuable _
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   So they'll coo to pets to calm their whining. They'll hug them
to stop their trembling. They'll pour out attention to them. And,
in the process, they unwittingly teach their pets to fear even
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let your dog in bed with you, you're reinforcing his
fears,'' said veterinarian John Cousins, of Animed of Blue Springs,
Mo. ``It feels like you're helping him, but what happens when
you're not there?''
</P>
<P>
   An animal running in a frenzy to escape or hide can harm itself.
But crating a dog is not a good way to keep it calm either, Duarte
said.
</P>
<P>
   One trainer he knew put a dog on an airplane without first
acclimating the animal to the loud noises it would hear during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the plane landed, the dog ripped itself out of its
cage, hurting itself in the process, sending blood everywhere,'' he
said. ``It ripped up the suitcases and clothes. By the time they
opened the cargo hold it was a nightmarish scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately the dog lived.
</P>
<P>
   There are things that pet owners can do to help animals cope,
Cousins said, primarily through drugs or desensitization.
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptions ranging from a mild form of Valium to a
longer-lasting drug, Tranxene, are available from veterinarians.
The drugs should be administered hours before a storm begins, to
help ease the pet before stress sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with drugs is that sometimes the owner isn't there
to give it to the dog,'' he said. ``But an animal behaviorist can
often help the dog to be less afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching owners how to help their dogs is Duarte's speciality.
One technique he uses is the systematic playing of a tape of
thunderstorms for storm-phobic dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell owners to play it softly at first and gradually turn
the volume up,'' he said. ``But even then, the success depends on
how diligent the trainer is, and how the dog takes to it. Rarely
does a bad case ever go away completely, but it can be lessened.''
</P>
<P>
   Storm phobia is a strong fear. Sometimes even a hunting dog
accustomed to gunshots still panics during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lyons of the Lyons Den Kennel in Kingsville, Mo., trains
hunting dogs. A dog can learn to accept loud noises, Lyons said, if
training begins early.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never seen a storm-phobic dog lose its phobia,'' he
said. ``If a dog likes birds, I can teach it to ignore gunshots,
because it's focused on a bird. But if it doesn't like storms,
that's a lot deeper. I don't believe that a phobia can be changed.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell owners to go for the drugs if you want to help a
storm-phobic dog. Its life will be much better. And if your dog is
scared of loud noises, board it far away from the city during the
Fourth of July. You'll both be happier.''
Tips for frightened animals
In the face of fear, here's help Although some cats get anxious
during storms, the majority of family pets that are storm-phobic
are dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of do's and don'ts for anxious owners trying to
help, adapted from local pet experts:
</P>
<P>
   _Don't be afraid to call your vet for help. Veterinarians have a
wide assortment of drugs that can calm a nervous dog.
</P>
<P>
   - During a storm do not give your dog praise or cuddle him when
he is afraid. That reinforces his behavior. However, don't punish
him; that will make him more fearful.
</P>
<P>
   - Provide a safe place for your dog to hide, a small den that is
dark and shielded from sound. Encourage your dog to go there if you
are around him during a storm.
</P>
<P>
   - Do not force him into a crate. Fearful dogs can hurt
themselves trying to leave a space where they feel trapped.
</P>
<P>
   - Consult an animal behaviorist; your vet may know of one. Be
aware that training is a long-term time commitment and that some
dogs' fears can only be lessened, not eliminated.

SCI-FI SCRIBE IS THE HOTTEST WRITER ON (AND OFF) THE PLANET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the interstellar pantheon of speculative fiction, you
couldn't ask for a more connected writer than Kevin J. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Author of three novels based on ``The X-Files,'' as well as the
bestselling ``Star Wars'' Jedi-Academy Trilogy, Anderson already
has a foot in two of the most obsessive science-fiction fan legions
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But his latest book, ``Ai! Pedrito!: When Intelligence Goes
Wrong,'' a novelization of a screenplay by the late scientology
guru (and occasional deity) L. Ron Hubbard, along with his upcoming
prequel trilogy to Frank Herbert's ``Dune'' stories, elevate
Anderson to a position of sci-fi superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheek twist of ``Pedrito!'' may seem like a
departure from the grim supernatural stylings of ``The X-Files'' or
the epic otherworldliness of his ``Star Wars'' adventures, but
Anderson says the similarities are more surprising than you might
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Written shortly before Hubbard's death in 1985, ``Pedrito!'' was
originally intended as a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a cross between James Bond and `Raiders of the
Lost Ark,' with Carl Hiassen and Elmore Leonard thrown in,''
Anderson said. ``It's a laugh-out-loud spy-vs.-spy thriller set in
the South American jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson was contacted by Hubbard's publishers to adapt the
piece into novel form, it seemed like a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My skills are playing around with somebody else's characters
and stories. It's something I've become sort of an expert at doing,
thanks to my work on the `X-Files' and `Star Wars' books,'' he
said. ``It's like borrowing somebody else's toys in a sandbox; it's
still lots of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Researching the book took Anderson south of the equator to
Ecuador, where he wandered the Andes Mountains and explored Incan
ruins. ``There are a lot of authors who are sort of armchair
researchers who think all they need to do is watch a National
Geographic video and they've got all the information they need,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His devotion to research was also put to good use on his
``X-Files,'' novels. Anderson worked closely with the FBI, soaking
up the atmosphere at the agency's best crime labs.
</P>
<P>
   Has working intimately with fictional FBI special agents Mulder
and Scully prompted Anderson to try scripting an episode?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really good at writing novels. I've taken a stab at
writing scripts and things, but it really is a different artform,''
Anderson said. ``You know, the best gynecologist in the world is
going to be a pretty poor brain surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the author is ``The Prelude to Dune Trilogy,'' the
first book of which _ ``House Atreides'' _ is due out next year
from Bantam. He's writing it with original ``Dune'' author Frank
Herbert's son, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that people's expectations are going to be so
incredibly high when they pick up this book _ it says `Dune' on the
cover, so they're going to expect it to be in the same league with
the bestselling science-fiction book of all time. Those are some
pretty big shoes to fill,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans live in these worlds. They know `Star Wars'
inside and out, and they know `X-Files' inside and out. And that
sort of intimidating pressure keeps me honest.''

   UNDATED: If you have an e-mail account, you may have chuckled
over one of these ditties.
</P>
<P>
   Call them Web witticisms if you will, because there's really no
name for them. They're amusing little electronic tidbits that
ricochet all over the Internet as recipients guffaw and e-mail them
on to their pals.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they come from? Who knows? Where did the first
``knock-knock'' joke come from?
</P>
<P>
   So in case you've missed them, or if you're not yet part of the
computer revolution, here are some especially wacky ones:
</P>
<P>
   - You can't trust dogs to watch your food.
</P>
<P>
   - If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?
</P>
<P>
   - Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead
of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either, just
leave me alone!
</P>
<P>
   - Time is what keeps everything from happening at once.
</P>
<P>
   - When you find yourself getting irritated with someone, try to
remember that all men are brothers _ and just give them a noogie.
</P>
<P>
   - Puppies still have bad breath after eating a TicTac.
</P>
<P>
   - Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one?
</P>
<P>
   - Follow your dreams! Unless it's the one where you're at work
in your underwear during a fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   - Never hold a Dustbuster and a cat at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   - Give me ambiguity or give me something else.
</P>
<P>
   - If you don't like my driving, don't call anyone. Just take
another road. That's why the highway department made so many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   - Never sneeze when someone is cutting your hair.
</P>
<P>
   - What was the best thing before sliced bread?
</P>
<P>
   - This land is your land, this land is my land. So stay on your
land!
</P>
<P>
   - Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   - Never ask your 3-year-old brother to hold a tomato.

CLINTON TO OBSERVE CHANGE IN CHINA HOUSING POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Here in an unremarkable, pink-trimmed, five-story
apartment complex that President Clinton visits Wednesday, a
revolution has begun that will likely transform China's economy,
culture and politics in ways its communist founders wouldn't
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday in a policy to be phased in by the year's
end, the government will no longer provide virtually free housing
to urban workers, and families will have to purchase homes or lease
state-owned apartments at much higher rents. But that also means
that for the first time since the founding of the People's Republic
in 1949, between 200 million and 300 million urban Chinese will be
able to live wherever and as comfortably as they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, we were assigned homes by our work units and
it was sometimes unfair. Powerful people in the unit got better
homes'' and people could not move or change jobs because they were
tied to assigned housing, said Fan Xiaoyang, a 37-year-old futures
trader who recently bought an apartment with the help of a mortgage
loan, a new concept in China. ``Now, however good or bad our house
is depends on our ability. We can finally control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Home ownership has long been central to the American Dream, but
in China the implications go far beyond the notion of family
security and the chance to accumulate equity. Housing reform,
perhaps more than any other change to the planned economy, will
fundamentally alter life in China by giving people control over
their lives at the most basic level.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the picture is not entirely rosy. Millions of workers
are so poor that they can barely manage higher rents, much less
buy. Countless others who are being forcibly relocated far from
soon-to-be-demolished state apartments to make way for shiny new
developments for the rich. Even so, for most people, housing reform
will mean more living space and better facilities than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For China's economy, the implications are tremendous. Housing
reform, which began first in Shanghai in 1991, is expected to give
the biggest single boost to gross domestic product this year. It
should set off a boom in housing-related industries and services.
All told, the ripple effect on the economy from housing could fuel
one percentage point of growth this year _ a key to creating jobs
for millions laid off from state-owned enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages will bolster China's fragile banks, by injecting more
reliable credit into a system bogged down with 20 percent
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
   Private housing will also lift an enormous burden from the
shoulders of flailing state enterprises, by excusing them from the
biggest cost of cradle-to-grave welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the establishment of private housing will also
accentuate class differences and create more rich and poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton tours Jin Hui Gardens, a collection of modestly
landscaped, middle-income housing in the booming financial capital
of Shanghai, he will see the winners of China's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   One is Xu Yaosheng, a 38-year-old broker who bought his
four-bedroom, 160-square-yard Jin Hui apartment for his family of
four last year for around 650,000 yuan ($78,313), with the help of
a mortgage loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like in America now. Not everyone can buy a
house; you can rent if you don't have the ability to buy,'' said
Xu. ``But no matter whether you have money to buy a house or not,
housing conditions for almost everyone have gotten better in the
last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes people like Fan, the trader whose new apartment is
a far cry from the state-owned 15-square-yard home in which he grew
up with three other family members. They had access only to a
shared public toilet. Today, he has two living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Fan and Xu are the lucky ones. The average price of a
three-room home in Shanghai is $66,000 _ while the average worker
in Shanghai earns less than $120 a month, Ren Xiaobing of the China
Construction Bank told China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   That staggering ratio between housing prices and wages of 46 to
1 is many times greater than the average of 6 to 1 in developed
countries, according to the Shanghai Housing and Land
Administration. The high price of housing here has created a
massive glut in unsold apartments _ 6 million square yards of
vacant residential space, the Shanghai Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to remedy that by offering low-interest
mortgages and subsidized prices and setting up housing funds to
which both employers and employees must contribute. But still not
everyone will be able to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Housing reform will also bring wide-ranging cultural changes. In
a nation with one of the highest savings rates in the world _ but
where many people's savings are still quite small _ home ownership
will force people to borrow and spend more. It will also hasten the
break-up of the extended family unit.
</P>
<P>
   At the no-frills Buo Wen Yuan complex in the Pudong business
district, Li Xiaofeng and his wife Huang Haiyan came to look at a
flat Tuesday, but quickly turned away when they realized the price
was too much.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Li and his wife live with his father, his brother and his
sister-in-law in a two-bedroom, 60-square-yard apartment that will
soon be torn down to make room for a highway. The government has
assigned them a new apartment, but it is too far away. The
government will compensate the family 230,000 yuan ($27,710), which
they will split three ways _ and get three separate homes, a
stunning break from the tradition of living with one's elderly
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Housing reform will also have political ramifications, by
limiting people's dependence on their work unit, and thereby
removing the government one step further from their lives. It &UR;  &LR; will
enable people to change jobs, even marry someone from another city.
The mere fact of ownership is likely to breed a sense of
responsibility and personal freedom that could prompt demands for
things such as legal rights to hold property developers
accountable. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As proof of the mobilizing effect of livelihood issues, large
demonstrations in the last couple of years have not been over
democracy and human rights, but over real estate ripoffs, forced
relocations and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from Buo Wen Yuan is an ancient block of housing in
which some 100 residents are still squatting, even as a wrecking
ball hangs in the air, having demolished most of the units. These
last holdouts are resisting efforts to move them to make way for a
shopping mall, even though the government has offered new, bigger
units an hour away.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-year-old saleswoman who gave her name as Fang said she
preferred her dilapidated warren, because she could not afford the
50,000 ($6,024) &UR;  &LR; yuan fee for the additional space, or the money
needed to put in fixtures. ``If the government orders us to leave,
I have no choice. But I feel cheated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But across town, in another crumbling block where residents have
no heating or toilets, Guo Guiqing, a 42-year-old resident and real
estate agent, says it is a good thing for the government to
relocate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we only worried about food and clothing,'' Guo said.
``Now that those are taken care of, we can think about better
housing for our people.''

EARLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN FILMMAKERS GET THEIR DUE ON TCM SERIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Separate Cinema'' will feature 29 black-made movies, plus a
documentary on race films, on the five Wednesdays in July,
beginning at 7 tonight, on Turner Classic Movies.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Do the Right Thing,'' there was ``The Symbol of the
Unconquered.'' Before ``Mean Streets,'' there was ``Dark
Manhattan.'' Before ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert,'' there was ``Boy! What a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The early black cinema of the 1920s through the '40s not only
provided an alternative for black audiences disappointed by
demeaning Hollywood stereotypes, but also set the precedent for the
modern independent film movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Separate Cinema,'' a 29-film series starting tonight on
Turner Classic Movies, showcases the work of Oscar Micheaux (who is
buried in Great Bend, Kan.), Spencer Williams and other
African-American filmmakers who thrived in Tinseltown's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The series runs each Wednesday in July on the cable channel,
with each edition devoted to a different theme (see schedule). It
offers insights into a parallel movie universe that escaped the
notice of the American Film Institute and its recent list of the
country's 100 greatest films.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large portion of the public, both black and white, is not
aware that before Spike Lee there were film directors who were
African-American,'' said John Kisch, founder of Separate Cinema, a
film archive devoted to black cinema. TCM licensed the firm's name
for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of people that need a lot of help in
understanding both the history of a race on film and film itself,''
he said. ``It's like finding something you never knew existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Micheaux, whose body of work stands out for the scholarly and
critical attention it has attracted, serves as the focus of
tonight's programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a true pioneer,'' said Laurence Kardish, curator of the
Department of Film and Video at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York. ``A committed individualist, whose works have a particular
energy and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the series' first installment is Micheaux's
``Symbol of the Unconquered,'' a 1921 silent drama attacking racism
and the Ku Klux Klan. The film is regarded as a response to D.W.
Griffith's epic ``The Birth of a Nation'' of six years earlier,
which depicted Klansmen as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies and the Museum of Modern Art worked
together on a reconstruction of the film, which recently was
discovered in a Belgian film archive. The cable channel
commissioned a score by jazz luminary Max Roach.
</P>
<P>
   Micheaux lived in the Dakotas and financed his first feature,
``The Homesteader,'' by selling stock to white settlers there. He
persuaded black theater managers in Harlem to show the film.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the picture was solid, and his career was launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two distinct Micheaux periods,'' said Jane M.
Gaines, director of the Film &AMP; Video Program at Duke University in
North Carolina and co-founder of the Oscar Micheaux Society. ``The
one from 1918 to around 1931, which is the silent period, and then
there's the sound period, which runs around 1931 to 1948.''
</P>
<P>
   From an aesthetic standpoint, Gaines said, Micheaux's silent
films are arguably superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, they're exquisitely beautiful: They're very
well shot, they do really well on the big screen. They're most
interesting because they have quite complex subplots _ fascinating
stories within stories within stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Micheaux's work commands attention as much for its social
and historical significance as for its artistic merits, Kisch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any pioneer, it's not really so much the quality of
their work, or the quantity of their work _ it's the direction of
their work,'' he said. ``His films are not great films in the big
picture, but they are unique in the sense that they are among the
only films of their kind during that period _ the early days _ that
were uplifting to a race.''
</P>
<P>
   During Micheaux's 30-year career, Gaines said, ``he probably
made 50 features.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, between 1910 and 1950, black independent films _ also
known as ``race movies'' _ found appreciative audiences among
people hungry to finally see their own stories on the screen. They
were exhibited in theaters in black urban communities and in
segregated rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   An early player in the emerging industry was the Lincoln Motion
Picture Company in Omaha, Neb., run by two brothers, George and
Noble Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The race films embraced standard Hollywood film genres, such as
the gangster film, the musical and the Western. But they gave them
a new spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black filmmakers' works were a lot grittier, and they
weren't as polished,'' Kardish said. ``But I think that simply had
to do with matters of economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that in terms of treating the genres there was
much of a difference: In the Westerns there were good guys and bad
guys; in the mysteries there were femme fatales.''
</P>
<P>
   The race films, which had low budgets by Hollywood standards,
also featured actors who subsquently found success in mainstream
cinema, such as Paul Robeson and Lena Horne.
</P>
<P>
   If Micheaux adhered to the strategy of working within familiar
Hollywood genres, his films also documented the quirks of language
and behavior of their time, Gaines said. Nor did he shrink from
unflattering portrayals of the black community if the story
demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that Micheaux really worked hard to show a
full range of types, he still was criticized by the black press,''
she said. ``They criticized him for using the pejorative types _
madams, card sharks, lowlife thieves. But he was portraying the
black community top to bottom, so there would be good people and
bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures Micheaux faced didn't come only from his own
community.
</P>
<P>
   As an editor, Micheaux ``cut his films again and again between
towns, because he had censorship problems in almost every town.''
That was because of the racial politics of Micheaux's times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within Our Gates,'' a 1920 drama being shown tonight, was
censored because of its subject: lynching in the post-Civil War
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1920 when it premiered in Chicago,'' Gaines said, ``it was
just unacceptable to white and black communities alike. Very
terrifying, really, for a Chicago community which had just had
racial riots that summer before. So that film just disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of any negative reaction to race films, black
audiences could see more of their lives on the big screen than they
ever had before. And they could strongly identify with those
big-screen fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hollywood's tales of the ``race problem,'' such as the
films ``Pinky'' and ``Intruder in the Dust'' (both 1949), the black
independents rarely made blackness an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, competition from the ``problem'' pictures, along
with the erosion of racial segregation, ultimately resulted in the
collapse of the black film movement by the coming of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But not before the filmmakers had made their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found very interesting about many of the films,''
Kardish said, ``is that they picture a self-contained black world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many of the films in which there are simply no
whites. The policemen are black, the lawyers are black, everybody
in the film is black. It's just a given. It's the world.''

`I WENT DOWN' HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I Went Down,'' a comedy//drama, is rated R for pervasive
strong language, some sexuality and violence. Running time is 1
hour 48 minutes. Two and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   The long post-``Pulp Fiction'' shadow of Quentin Tarantino
extends even across the Big Pond, as evidenced by ``I Went Down,''
an Irish road movie about two hapless blokes dispatched by a
gangster to abduct and bring back an old acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   The film is populated by quirky, scuzzy characters, but unlike
numerous Tarantino wannabes in this country, director Paddy
Breathnach and screenwriter Conor McPherson find their own voice,
one that relies more on an unhurried, loping style and sly humor
than in-your-face violence.
</P>
<P>
   Git (Peter McDonald) is a mopey young man who hasn't been out of
prison for 24 hours when he runs afoul of a local gangster, the
coolly menacing French (Tony Doyle). To even things up, French
gives Git a job _ to travel across Ireland and bring back one
Grogan, an old partner in crime who, French says, owes him a goodly
sum of money.
</P>
<P>
   Git's assigned partner is an old hand, Bunny (Brendan Gleeson),
a beefy leprechaun with orange hair, Elvis sideburns and a
reputation for thuggishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Went Down'' follows two plot threads. First there's the
relationship between the inexperienced Git and the presumably
hard-core Bunny. As it turns out, Bunny isn't quite the tough case
he appears; though he thinks nothing of robbing a gas station when
he's short of cash, he's genuinely morose about the failure of his
marriage and terribly misses his young daughter. As he gradually
warms up to his young colleague, he attempts to share with Git his
criminal know-how, much of which is patently foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The second plot element centers on just what French is really up
to.
</P>
<P>
   The two bumblers do manage to locate Grogan (Peter Caffrey), but
their captive swears not to know anything about owing French money.
On the other hand, he readily admits to having an affair with
French's wife. Now Grogan muses in a nonstop barrage of blarney,
the jealous husband no doubt will kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever make love to a gangster's wife?'' he quizzes his
two captors from the back seat. ``Jeez, you really can't enjoy
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Git is reluctant to turn over the chatty Grogan for slaughter;
Bunny advises him to do what he's told and not even think about the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately a third possibility develops _ that French wants
Grogan back so that they finally can complete a crime scheme
initiated before the two pals fell out years before. But are Git
and Bunny essential to this caper, or are they disposable messenger
boys?
</P>
<P>
   ``I Went Down'' somehow manages to be funny and morose at the
same time, with its sad-sack personalities and atmosphere of cheap
pubs and plastic motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the heavy accents make a good deal of the dialogue
indecipherable to American ears, and there's nothing like the sense
of resolution you'd get from an American mainstream film.
</P>
<P>
   But the performances, especially from McDonald as the
perpetually depressed Git and Gleeson as the thick Bunny, make ``I
Went Down'' enjoyable if not exactly compelling.

 &HT;    Research offspring may seed technology growth
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with GATECH-CLOUGH, GATECH-QNA, GATECH-GTRI.)By
Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If metro Atlanta is going to grow a high-tech garden,
then someone has to tend the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Filling that roll is the Advanced Technology Development Center,
which was established 18 years ago and funded by the state in the
hopes of nurturing seedling companies. The idea is that the green
growth will in turn produce both roots and its own off-shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations _ especially the Georgia Research Alliance _
exist to encourage links between academia and the corporate world.
And other efforts to move technology from lab to market are under
way in other settings, including Emory University which is poised
to launch a center focused on biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the ATDC has the longest history, the widest reach
and the most numerous successes sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   So far, graduates of the center _ companies ready to set off to
fresh patch of soil on their own _ include 50 companies that
account for 2,000 employees, more than $250 million a year in
revenue and several high-profile offerings of stock, including that
of Internet provider MindSpring Enterprises. The $2 million ATDC
budget is a line item in the budget of Georgia Tech, which
administers the money. The center itself is formally a part of the
state's university system with three locations that provide the
soil to about 40 companies.
</P>
<P>
   One recent graduate, communications company Media4, grew from
its three founders to a workforce of about 35 in its three-year
incubation, according to Jim Stratigos, co-founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which specializes in data compression for video,
audio and multimedia, started with 500 square feet and moved into
larger space as it grew. Most leases of prime real estate in a
crowded area permit much less flexibility than a start-up gets from
the ATDC, Stratigos said. ``They are much more than a landlord, but
that function is extremely valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting fledgling companies with researchers and students is a
formula for constant growth, he said. ``I don't think people
recognize how valuable that is to the high-tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 of the 50 graduates have been merged or acquired by
larger companies. Only two of the 50 have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time director Dwight Holter, who leaves at the end of this
month, said the key may be in screening candidate companies,
accepting only those entrepreneurs who seem ready to do what it
takes to succeed. ``We will kind of draw the line. If it's the type
of person who wants to talk about it and wants someone else to do
the work, we direct them to the Web site and they can see that we
will not do all the work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also means looking for entrepreneurs who have the right
ideas, he said. ``We are looking for companies that have the
potential for rapid growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Once accepted, a company can look to the center to help in a
number of ways. Holter says the word incubator isn't broad enough,
since it conjures up the image of a place that merely shares its
electricity, phones and staples. With a $2 million budget and about
15 employees, the center offers aid in five basic ways, Holter
said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding money to get off the ground. .
</P>
<P>
   _ Making contact with the people who may assist with the steeper
funding needs down the road.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding employees, since skilled workers can be scarce _ and
hard to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shaping a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Networking in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to send a company hurtling out of the center with
momentum _ already succeeding in the market, in possession of the
financial resources it needs to keep growing, Holter said. ``We
like to think that we are helping to accelerate companies and our
staff people think of themselves as venture catalysts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its budget is relatively small _ less than what IBM
spends on research every five hours _ the ATDC must justify its
expenditures in economic terms for the region. Holter says that for
each $1 in the state's investment, $12 is returned to the
government as successful companies start paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holter believes the ideal program would be more
extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have sort of a research park environment, so
that when a company graduates from our facility, it wouldn't have
to go ... out to the Perimeter. They could retain their proximity
to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   By staying close to Georgia Tech, a company could make use of
part-time student help, as well as having closer contact with
research done by the faculty, he said. ``And if you have that kind
of hot environment, you'd have the kind of buzz that stimulates
mature companies as well as an entrepreneurial company.''
</P>
<P>
   To create that kind of situation would take about $8 million and
a commitment of continued funding for up to a decade, he said.

``ARMAGEDDON'' IS A BLAST THAT SHOULD LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Armageddon,'' a sci-fi thriller, is rated PG-13 for sci-fi
disaster action, sensuality and brief language. Running time is 2
hours 24 minutes. Two and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   For its first hour ``Armageddon'' appears to be that rarest of
animals: a genuinely smart summer blockbuster. If director Michael
Bay and company can't consistently deliver the goods over a
too-long 2-hour 24-minute running time, at least audiences won't
leave the theater thinking they've been insulted.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in ``Deep Impact,'' a heavenly body (this time
an asteroid the size of Texas) is headed for Earth. If it hits,
nothing will survive. Not even bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   NASA chief Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) realizes the asteroid
can be destroyed only from the inside _ by planting nukes deep
below its surface. He goes looking for the world's best deep-core
drillers and comes across Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his crew
of roughnecks.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet Harry he's on a drilling platform on the South
China Sea, driving golf balls at the Greenpeace protesters bobbing
nearby. He discovers that his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), has been
having a secret romance with his protege, A.J. (Ben Affleck). The
ultimate roughneck, Harry strongly disapproves of Grace getting
involved with people like himself.
</P>
<P>
   But personal concerns go on the back burner when the world needs
saving. NASA realizes there's no time to train astronauts for a
drilling job in outer space; would Harry and his crew do the
honors?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the so-serious ``Deep Impact,'' ``Armageddon'' (which
credits writers Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams, Tony Gilroy, Shane
Salerno and Robert Roy Pool) balances its grim end-of-the-world
scenario with some very amusing characters. By now Willis' patented
sardonicism is a movie institution, but here he's surrounded by
rugged _ and amusingly twisted _ individualists who practically
turn him into a straight man.
</P>
<P>
   These range from Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), a genius with a
mile-wide womanizing streak, to Oscar (Owen Wilson), a chatterbox
with a gee-whiz attitude; Max (Ken Campbell), a gentle giant; Bear
(Michael Duncan), a musclebound African-American; and Chick (Will
Patton), a sensitive guy who hopes to redeem himself in the eyes of
his estranged wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there's A.J., who continues to woo Grace in spite
of Harry's objections.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are unlike anything NASA has ever worked with
(although of course we recognize them from dozens of war movies),
and much of the fun comes in contrasting these cocky wild men with
the spit-and-polish military types training them.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the last hour that ``Armageddon'' runs into problems. In
his films ``Bad Boys'' and ``The Rock'' director Bay exhibited a
flair for action, racking up remarkable body counts. But how do you
film the killing of a small planet?
</P>
<P>
   Bay's answer is to present these outer space sequences with the
same breathless editing and kinetic fury he has brought to
shoot-'em-ups. The results often verge on the incomprehensible and
incoherent and will doubtless leave many viewers feeling worked
over by this daze-inducing barrage of images and special effects.
Not to mention some really blatant emotional manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is likely to prevent ``Armageddon'' from being a
huge hit, the sort of movie that will sell lots of tickets and lots
of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   And while nobody goes to movies like ``Armageddon'' for the
acting, a couple performances are really good. In his work here and
in ``Primary Colors,'' Thornton is showing himself to be an actor
of remarkable range, subtlety and humor. Affleck (``Chasing Amy,''
``Good Will Hunting'') establishes himself as a charismatic
presence with the makings of a classic leading man.

 &HT;    SPECIAL FOCUS: Georgia Tech
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with GATECH-QNA, GATECH-ATDC, GATECH-GTRI)
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Clough, president of Georgia Institute of
Technology, is a nearly perfect Georgia story. He is a native of
Douglas, Ga., a graduate of Tech, and now the school's first
alumnus-president. He knows the state and its history from the days
when agriculture was king, as well as Tech's past, when its pride
was in turning out engineers.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia has changed, and fortunately Clough, whose name
rhymes with tough, has had an educational sojourn over the last two
decades that gives him a broader view and a better informed
mission. He wants to speed the state along the new paths toward
technological advances and firmer footing in the high-growth
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Clough, who trained as a civil engineer at Georgia Tech, moved
to northern California in the middle 1960's to earn his doctorate
at the University of California at Berkeley. He witnessed firsthand
much of the collaboration between universities and the cluster of
innovative companies that became known as Silicon Valley, where
theoretical expertise joined entrepreneurship to spark the growth
of a global industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That critically important and fascinating nexus has instructed
the nation in ways to grow,'' said Clough. ``It is not an accident
that the high-growth spots, including here in the Southeast, are
where good schools and aggressive, growth-minded communities come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he cited North Carolina's Research Triangle, where
Duke, North Carolina and North Carolina State universities
collaborate to foster industrial innovation, as well as the growth
area around the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Georgia it has been more serendipitous than a matter
of strategy,'' Clough said, ``but we are beginning to put together
strategic plans here for cooperating in ways that can accelerate
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, he said, ``we all need to do as Stanford did, and
organize more vigorously, more explicitly, to get results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford example, said Clough, was to foster growth in
technology companies by locating them nearby and stimulating a loop
that has the best academic ideas deployed where needed in high-tech
companies, and communication with the companies about the needs,
challenges and hurdles they face so that long-term research can
address them.
</P>
<P>
   There was a private and public partnership fostered between
Stanford and Berkeley, where the schools put aside their rivalries
to contribute their strengths to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Such a partnership grew between Duke and the Carolina
universities, he said, and in Atlanta, Georgia Tech and Emory are
embarking on a landmark joint effort to establish on the Tech
campus a center for biomedical and bioengineering studies, as well
as scholarship in environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will bring together Tech's top engineering minds
and Emory's medical and life sciences programs to generate ideas
that can advance learning _ and turn into successful businesses.
Don Giddens has been hired by Tech to head the joint effort.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the mission of the biomedical partnership, business
incubators will be located in each of the buildings in the complex,
Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   The other component of the Stanford plan, Clough said, was to
use ``judiciously'' land nearby to locate growth industries so that
interaction with the faculty could be made easier and more
convenient. Thus the foundation was laid for Stanford's association
with Hewlett-Packard, National Semiconductor, Intel and others.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of Stanford and Hewlett-Packard has been a
spectacularly productive one. The company has earned a worldwide
reputation for its innovation, and Clough said it is no accident
that H-P can boast that some 60 percent of sales last year were
from ideas developed over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, sir, is innovation,'' Clough said. He is proud of the
fact that H-P will be a partner in the microelectronics program
that Tech is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity is a key word in Tech's plans for the future. In terms
of buildings, the plan draws together departments that need to
cooperate in the interest of learning and helping economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the $140 million BEM Complex for Tech and Emory,
as well as for Medical College of Georgia and others will be housed
in a cluster of buildings for bioengineering and biosciences,
biomedical engineering, environmental science and technology as
well as molecular/materials sciences and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   That cluster of buildings, now under construction on 10 acres of
land, will be steps away from a new $40 million advance computing
technology building. That building will be adjacent to the existing
quarters for the college of computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned is that today's major problems are seldom
within the sphere of one department, but are interdisciplinary in
nature,'' said Clough, ``and so we need to encourage a new level of
cooperation between the departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, a distinctly urban school, with the backdrop of
the downtown and Midtown office towers as part of its environment,
does not have Stanford's wide open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   However, school officials have plans to develop land across
North Avenue southwest of the main campus. They are also looking to
land across the Downtown Connector artery for future development of
a center to train executives, a site that would not require them to
come to the campus where parking is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``And though the Atlantic Steel site (north of the campus) may
be devoted to retailing, we hope some of the land can be devoted to
small high-tech enterprises,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very desirable to get relatively high-paying jobs
there, hopefully with suitable downtown housing for those who work
there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The teamwork needed to foster economic development encompasses
not only cooperative centers of higher learning, but also
partnership between academics and public policy-makers, including a
strong state component through such organizations as the Georgia
Research Alliance, Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tech's plan, the school must redouble its efforts to be
more of a research institution, a process that began in the early
1970's under President Joe Petit, another former Stanford man. In
so doing, he said, the school can tap into plans by industry to
farm out more long-term research, and also qualify for new research
dollars for health and other high priority areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also want to encourage more of an entrepreneurial spirit
among our students,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Stanford, where I taught for a decade, engineering students
thought of themselves as potential entrepreneurs. Some do so at
Tech, but many aspire to the world of work in the corporate ranks.
That's fine, but we need to achieve more of a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tech will be recruiting its own alumni for such
important roles as venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hope to align ourselves more closely with people like
Charles Moseley and Bill Green, who have proven their skill in
those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Charles D. Moseley Jr., founder and partner of Noro-Moseley, is
widely recognized for his work as a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley said Clough's knowledge of technology is especially
welcome. And clearly it will be helpful to both Moseley and Tech to
maintain close ties for the benefit of companies in the Tech
incubator programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's representation and Tech's representation will be a big
help in attracting technology companies,'' Mosely said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a partner in Craven, Green and Wahlen, is a prime mover
in one of the busiest investment firms in the Southeast and has
assembled a $278 million buyout fund the Wall Street Journal says
is the largest of its kind in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clough not only has the personal expertise but also the contacts
that could aid Tech in its growing role as a stimulator of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   He serves locally on the executive committee of Central Atlanta
Progress, the board of directors of the Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, as a trustee of the Georgia Research Alliance and
nationally as a trustee of the National Council of Competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long as we work in partnership,'' said Clough, ''I think we
can advance toward this community's dreams to excel in
technological innovation.''

 &HT;    Wearable computers present opportunities and challenges
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with GATECH-CLOUGH, GATECH-QNA, GATECH ATDC)
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coming to a grocery store near you: Chicken inspected
by Robocop.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with computers attached to their waists and heads, poultry
workers soon will be able to inspect chickens and transmit
information without removing their rubber gloves, touching a
clipboard or leaving the plant floor.
</P>
<P>
   A small laboratory at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, an
applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology, is
designing the hands-free, wearable computer system. At least two
Georgia poultry plants are interested in it; one, Cagle's in South
Georgia, may turn their inspectors into cyborgs within the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't invent the idea of a wearable computer, but we have
worked on the question of what these are useful for,'' said Chris
Thompson, senior research engineer in the Intelligent Machines
Branch of GTRI. His lab, called the Multimedia Information in
Mobile Environments, or MIME, has been working on wearable
computers for several years. ''We study the human issues, like
comfort, and how to present information on the monitor without
distracting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech Research Institute is tied to the Georgia
Institute of Technology, but not involved in instruction. Most of
GTRI's research is for the military and the defense industry, but
the MIME lab, while sometimes engaged in defense work, also
supports manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
   The wearable computer system has a headset worn like a miner's
lamp around the crown of the head, outfitted with a computer
monitor that slides over one eye, a camera lens, and a microphone
for voice-recognition data input. The actual brain of the system
has as much power as a notebook computer, and is worn around the
waist. Optional is a keyboard strapped like a biker's glove around
one wrist.
</P>
<P>
   A clean solution
</P>
<P>
   The wearable computer solves a lot of literally messy problems
in the chicken industry. Poultry plants are wet, greasy places, and
taking notes on a clipboard forces a worker measuring temperature
or looking for disease to pull off and on rubber gloves every time
he writes. These systems have voice recognition, so a worker can
talk into a microphone attached to a visor. The computer screen
slides in front of one eye, leaving one eye free to look at breasts
and thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the real issue is data is accumulating on clipboards all
over the plant, and it has to be taken to the office and put on a
computer, probably not until the end of a shift,'' said J. Craig
Wyvill, who heads the Agricultural Technology Research Program at
GTRI. ''It takes a while for a supervisor to notice a trend, for
example, of contamination. And with the new food safety
regulations, there will be more data and more problems that will
have to be dealt with quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress isn't cheap
</P>
<P>
   The system, like any new technology, is costly: Although the
hardware is commercially available and would cost about $5,000 per
system, the software will cost tens of thousands to develop and
use, Wyvill said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyvill's office, which is state-sponsored and responsible for
supporting the various food industries in Georgia, is working with
MIME to bring the wearable computer system to other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire food industry is becoming very
information-intensive,'' Wyvill said.
</P>
<P>
   And the computers are ideal for on-the-job training, Wyvill
said. Software could be designed to update workers on any changes
in the machines they maintain, for example. That possibility peaked
the interest of Delta Airlines, which is looking into wearable
computers that carry electronic airplane manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''An airline's most expensive problems occur when a plane is at
the gate and causes delays,'' Wyvill explained. With a wearable
computer, a maintenance crew would not have to sprint back to the
office to look up repair information.
</P>
<P>
   There are military applications for the wearable computer.
Already the Army, independent of Georgia Tech, has been testing
computers soldiers could wear on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure where the idea for wearable computers was born,
or where it is headed. So far it has been the stuff of science
fiction _ in ''Robocop,'' a 1987 movie, the half-human cyborg
lawman wore a computer that fused together the virtual and real
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   GTRI is one of a handful of institutions developing wearable
computers; none of the major computer and software companies such
as IBM or Microsoft are investing much time in them.
</P>
<P>
   Its day will come
</P>
<P>
   But interest is growing. Another school at Georgia Tech is
working on clothing that has computers sewn into the fabric, for
possible use on the battlefield to measure a wounded soldier's
vital signs. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology are researching wearable computers for everyday use.
They envision computers as comfortable as a favorite pair of blue
jeans, that allow people to exchange e-mail while walking down the
street, or to have non-stop access to the Internet. The second
conference on wearable computer technology will be this fall in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread use is years in the future. The only real-world
use of wearable computers such as the one GTRI is developing is at
a Ford Motor Co. plant, where some workers wear them on the
assembly line. Cagle's may be one of the first industries in the
country to use wearable computer technology. Claxton Chicken
considered having their inspectors wear them, but decided instead
to install computers on the plant floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we would try that before we made a serious
investment,'' said Marcus Boyd, coordinator of the Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Points program at Claxton Chicken. ''We were
worried about the expense, and the discomfort workers might have
wearing a computer.''

 &HT;    Tech's leader wants to compete with pace-setters in economic
development
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Clough, president of Georgia Institute of
Technology, speaks with the precision and frankness one expects
from a man of science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks of his alma mater, which he now heads as the
first alumnus-president, his expressions are direct, analytical and
unsentimental. The school has a long ways to go, he said, to match
the top competition in the United States and, more importantly, his
lofty expectations and aspirations. He has set the competitive bar
very high.
</P>
<P>
   It may take time, he said, a lot of time, but he wants to catch
MIT, Stanford and Berkeley, the pace-setters, the schools who wrote
the book when it comes to strategies in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student at Berkeley and a teacher at Stanford, he
knows the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of his comments on that subject and others in a
recent interview:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you get your ideas about the roles of colleges and
businesses in fostering economic development?
</P>
<P>
   A: I learned much of it in the Bay area, where I was privileged
to witness firsthand how Stanford and Berkeley collaborated to help
build Silicon Valley. I met and got to know Fred Terman, dean of
engineering at Stanford, who brought to the campus his experience
at working with other scientists during World War II to help the
war effort.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the campus and succeeded in simulating that kind of
joint effort, that sense of team work, in the mission to develop
technology in the area around Stanford. Two of his students were a
guy named Hewlett and another named Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What were the essential ingredients to the success by Terman
and his Stanford collaborators?
</P>
<P>
   A: They worked with some of the best minds in science and
engineering at Stanford and Berkeley in the effort to foster ideas
for the technology industry. And the intensity of that
collaboration not only fostered exciting companies, but also
fostered work in science and math at the highest levels because so
many people wanted to be a part of the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Petit was there too, during the same period, and that's why,
when he became president of Georgia Tech in the early 1970s, he
began to focus the school on research.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Were there any other secrets to the success of Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, land. Stanford had, as a part of its original holdings,
some 12,000 acres of land nearby or adjacent to the campus that
allowed companies to form and keep constant communication with
professors and other experts on the campus. That's why companies
like Hewlett-Packard, Intel and National Semiconductor got such a
good start and maintained momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Well, we certainly don't have that land advantage, do we?
</P>
<P>
   A:No, we don't. More seriously, we also lack the strong
departments in pure science that have proved so beneficial, so much
a part of the success of schools like the Stanford-Berkeley team,
and MIT also. If you look at us as well as Emory and Georgia, all
rising schools, you find relative weakness in the sciences. It's
all part of our region's misunderstanding of the importance of
basic science.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why such a lapse, and has it been a factor in the lag in
economic development in the region until recently?
</P>
<P>
   A:We have focused, with success, on agricultural research and on
the development of engineers, but we have not fully appreciated the
relative importance of the sciences as the foundation for
advancement in world class technology.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do you turn that around?
</P>
<P>
   A:You do it with collaboration, just as Stanford did. And you
need the collaboration not only between schools, but also between
science and engineering departments within schools. Moreover, you
need collaboration between the educational establishment and the
schools at the highest levels in the form of distance learning
facilities that allow industry research departments to link
directly with the best minds on campuses. We need to continue the
important linkages between schools and public policy bodies like
the Georgia Alliance, and between industry and state leaders who
hopefully will follow Gov. Zell Miller's fine example of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Schools like Georgia Tech have an important resource in their
alumni, and there must be a role for them, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. Many of our best alumni are at work here in
Georgia and on the West Coast and elsewhere, and many are looking
for a chance to link with Georgia Tech and with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Many are experts as venture capitalists, skilled in spotting
initiatives that pay off, and we will look to them for that help
even more in the future than in the past. I think the secret for
success, just as in the Bay area, is for all of us to get in touch
and stay in touch with the aspirations of the community. That is
the best way to establish the kind of cooperation and teamwork that
will serve us in the coming years.

 &HT;    Delta to beef up fleet with used jets until new ones delivered
from Boeing
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with DELTA01)
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines has dipped into the used airplane market to buy
14 jets to help expand its fleet while awaiting deliveries of new
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the planes are Boeing 737-300s, a short-haul
workhorse. Nine were previously flown by Germania, a European
carrier, while four come from Western Pacific Airlines, a defunct
discount carrier based in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also is buying a 767 widebody from Asiana, a Korean
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig said the average age of the used
planes is 10.3 years, slightly lower than the average for Delta's
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The airline usually buys new airplanes, and it placed a massive
order with Boeing last year. But Gillig said the lag time until
deliveries prompted the carrier to seek used jets in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The first planes under the Boeing order, updated models of the
737, are to arrive this year. Next year Delta will take delivery of
new 777s, which will become the biggest planes in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Delta confirmed it will eliminate up to 200 jobs in
Frankfurt, Germany, by hiring contractors to perform ground
handling and other tasks. The move follows Delta's decision last
year to dismantle a Frankfurt connecting hub it bought from Pan Am
in 1991.

 &HT;    Southern plays role in two Asian power plant projects
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. is participating in two new major
electricity projects in China and Thailand, the first big Asian
deals announced by the Atlanta-based company since it took over a
Hong Kong-based power company 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company Monday announced its participation in a $500 million
power plant project in China's Shanxi Province and Tuesday outlined
an agreement to take a 28 percent stake in a major plant in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Electric Power Asia, the Hong Kong-based
independent power company Southern acquired for $2.3 billion, is
taking a minority stake in both projects. Company officials
emphasized both projects are in early stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said plans call for the Thai plant to be developed by a
consortium that also includes Saha Union Public Co., Thailand's
biggest garment producer; Tomen Corp., a leading Japanese trading
company; and Imatran Voima Oy, an international power company based
in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Southern purchased its interest from Saha Union, which reduced
its stake from 51 percent to 10 percent. Southern is paying $100
million in cash and financing an additional $236 million with bank
loans and bonds. IVO will also hold 28 percent and Tomen, 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400-megawatt coal-fired power plantwill be in Prachuab
Kirikhan, along Thailand's western coast about 270 miles from
Bangkok. Financing is expected to be arranged by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Construction would then begin next year and the plant would come
on-line in 2002. The plant will supply power to Thailand's
government utility under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand was the first Asian country last year to suffer a
currency crisis that has now swept across the region. Thailand's
currency devaluation made the deal a better value for Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new China deal involves construction of a
600-megawatt coal-fired plant 280 miles southwest of Beijing in
Shanxi Province, China's coal-mining region.
</P>
<P>
   The plant will be built near coal mines to alleviate railroad
bottlenecks in transporting coal long distances. It is one of the
first large-scale projects to be sponsored by China's coal
industry.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership that includes Southern and Johnston Development
Co., headed by former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), will own 49
percent of the $500 million project. Shanxi Enhua, which includes
the the Xishan Coal Mining Bureau and Shanxi Provincial Power Co.,
will hold 51 percent. Site preparation begins next year.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement in principle to build the plant was signed Monday
by Southern and its partners in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing. The ceremony was separate from a raft of agreements signed
in conjunction with President Clinton's state visit. The Thai deal
was signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   CEPA already operates a power plant in China's Guangdong
Province under anagreement that expires in 2016. The company ceded
management of a sister plant to local entities last October.

 &HT;    United, Delta start combining frequent-flier programs Sept. 1
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with PLANES)
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta and United airlines will begin merging their
frequent-flier programs on Sept. 1, taking the first step in a
planned marketing alliance that will later link their routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines said the initial move will enable passengers to
choose which mileage program they want credited for a flight on
either carrier. For example, a Delta passenger could have mileage
credited to a Delta SkyMiles account or a United MileagePlus
account. A United passenger could do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines said they are still working on a timetable for
cross-redemption benefits, in which SkyMiles could be used for
award travel on United flights and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Other important details remain to be worked out, including
whether fliers can pool mileage in both programs to obtain awards,
and whether the carriers will allow access to each others'
members-only airport lounges.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the frequent-flier partnership will apply only to
domestic flights, and it won't cover flights by commuter
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   United and Delta had originally said they expected to begin
combining frequent-flier plans by the end of the year. They are
pushing ahead to avoid falling behind two other alliances that plan
similar links _ Northwest and Continental airlines and American
Airlines and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more strategically important element of the
United-Delta alliance isn't likely to begin until next year. In
that part of the deal, the carriers would sell seats on each
others' flights, a practice called code-sharing. They hope to
attract more loyal passengers to their combined route network than
they could separately.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing must survive regulatory reviews and gain approval
of the two pilot unions, which view such arrangements as a
potential threat to job security and career paths.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Deane, spokesman for Delta's pilot union, said a union
committee is analyzing the effect of a code-share deal and has
hired consultants to help. The committee will probably make a
recommendation to union leaders this fall, he added.
</P>
<P>
   After that the union would negotiate the needed contract change
with management, possibly seeking a pay raise or other concessions
in return. Then the change would have to be ratified by the
membership, Deane said.

 &HT;    Market cools down as weather heats up
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market reached the midpoint of 1998 on Tuesday with
the busiest New York Stock Exchange session of the year and a mixed
bag of wins and losses. Big Board volume hit 758.8 million shares
as traders scurried to settle waves of end-of-quarter orders.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow Jones industrial average was closing out the
quarter with a loss, the Russell 2000, which includes smaller
stocks, and the Nasdaq composite rose. It was a fitting close to a
half-year that A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons strategist Alfred Goldman
described as a manic-depressive period in the market _ a
first-quarter with ``manic'' gains and a second quarter with
``depressive'' losses.
</P>
<P>
   Indexes that posted first-quarter gains of 11 to about 17
percent suffered declines during the second quarter ranging from 5
percent for the Big Board blue chip sector to 12 percent for
smaller-stock barometers. That left the Dow with a second-quarter
gain of just 1.7 percent after a climb of 11.3 percent in the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the dramatic turnaround to the perception
that Asia's financial crisis will slow the U.S. economy enough to
put a dent in profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Asia's depressed economy also gets some credit for
restraining the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest
rates, as some analysts have anticipated following reports of
still-strong economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Fed expected to alter that policy at its meeting that
began Tuesday and ends today. Inflation is still too low to justify
higher interest rates, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Investor anxiety about Asia was also strong enough to create an
atypical situation between stocks and bonds: the sharp drop in
30-year Treasury yields in the second quarter failed to stimulate
stock buying, as it ususally does.
</P>
<P>
   Falling yields make bonds less attractive as an alternative to
stocks, but this time stocks continued to decline as Treasury
yields dropped to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the stock market remains manic/depressive in the second
half depends on what happens in Japan, according to analysts who
see that nation _ with the world's second strongest economy _ as
the linchpin of Asia's financial rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the Japanese government takes decisive action to support
the yen and permanently cut taxes, the Asian markets can expect
troubled waters,'' said John K. Lynch, director of investment
strategy for Interstate/Johnson Lane.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the concern about Asia, mainstream analysts discount
the likelihood that the stock market will suffer anything more than
a correction _ commonly defined as a decline of roughly 10 percent
_ in the second half. They see neither a recession in the economy
nor a bear market in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing was that the (second-quarter) corrections
worked out excesses in the market and created buying
opportunities,'' said Goldman. There's a strong belief on Wall
Street that the bull market will not end as long as the economy
continues to expand. In the first quarter, the economy grew at a
torrid 5.4 percent annual rate without making inflation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe that growth rate slowed sharply in the
second quarter, but that the economy will continue to expand enough
to boost profits and keep the bull market alive.

 &HT;    Fox to be bought by Wolf By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wolf Camera has agreed to acquire Eastman Kodak's
450-store Fox Photo chain, which will more than double the
Atlanta-based retailer's size at the outset and catapult it to a
near-tie with the country's largest specialty photo retailer.
</P>
<P>
   With a post-purchase count of 790 stores, Wolf closes in on Ritz
Camera Centers, a Beltsville, Md.-retailer that has about 810
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, whose headquarters is in Alpharetta, Ga., is expected to
announce the transaction today. It is expected to close in
September. Terms of the Fox deal were not disclosed, but industry
sources, characterizing it as a ``fire sale,'' expected a price tag
far below Kodak's $110 million stake.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Wolf does not disclose financial data, but
industry estimates peg annual revenue at about $260 million.
Revenue figures are not available for Fox Photo, but the typical
mini-lab store similar to the Fox format generates about $250,000
in annual revenue, according to the Photo Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest moment of growth in our 24-year history,''
said President and Chief Executive Chuck Wolf. ``We used to say we
were a coast-to-coast company, but now we're truly national.'' Fox
Photo, which also operates stores under the names of CPI Photo and
Proex, spans 25 states and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf enters 19 new states and 50 cities with the Fox purchase,
in addition to doubling or tripling its presence in several
existing markets.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 120 employees at Fox's corporate headquarters in St.
Louis may move to Alpharetta. ``We're talking to each one of them
to find out the best fit,'' Wolf said. The metro Atlanta market,
Wolf's biggest with 65 stores, is not affected by the purchase of
Fox Photo, which has seen several ownership changes in recent
years. Wolf bought 20 Fox Photo stores in Atlanta in 1996 as part
of a 50-store purchase from St. Louis-based CPI Corp., then Fox's
corporate parent. That same year, Kodak acquired a 51 percent stake
in the chain from CPI and bought the remaining interest in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak initially bought the Fox chain as a laboratory for testing
new products and pumping up the Kodak name. It was also a vehicle
for the company's Image Center self-service photo-manipulation
machines.
</P>
<P>
   But it was difficult for the giant manufacturer to manage the
retail end of photofinishing, which remains an intimate, customer
service-oriented business. And that's the bread-and-butter of Wolf,
which has built a high-profile advertising campaign on the message,
``Our expertise is free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolf is one of the most aggressive marketers in the
business,'' said Jerry Johnson, Kodak's vice president and general
manager of consumer imaging for the United States and Canada.
``Wolf Camera is capable and qualified to take the Fox Photo stores
and grow their business.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chuck Wolf doesn't have specific plans yet for the Fox
Photo stores, he said he expects to relocate many stores to bigger
sites. The chain generates most of its business through film
processing and does not carry camera and photo equipment, which
presents a growth opportunity for Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any buyer would have to prune and consolidate this chain, but
it gets Wolf into markets where Fox has attractive leases and an
opportunity to upgrade,'' said Donald Becker, former CEO of Fox
Photo before it was sold to Kodak. While some stores have been
unprofitable, others _ such as the group in Hawaii _ are strong
performers, said Becker, now an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will also give Wolf a new service line through
the Proex stores, which specialize in portraits. Those stores are
based in Minneapolis, but Wolf said he'll consider rolling out the
service to other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the purchase was good for Wolf, which recently
moved into new corporate headquarters that can support 1,000
stores. Wolf already has surpassed its 600-store goal with the
acquisition and shows no sign of easing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few months, we'll make a few more acquisitions,''
said Wolf, who noted plans to open 50 stores internally this year
as well. ``We've got the infrastructure and systems in place that
make it a lot easier to do this.

A MOST QUOTABLE MAN COMES OUT IN THE `WILDE' WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wilde,'' a biography, is rated R for strong sexuality and
language. Running time is 1 hour 56 minutes. Two and a half out of
four stars.
</P>
<P>
   For moviegoers who know little about the Victorian wit,
playwright (``The Importance of Being Earnest'') and homosexual
icon Oscar Wilde, the new screen biography from England should
prove an enlightening introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Stephen Fry (familiar from public TV's ``Jeeves &AMP;
Wooster,'' among other hilarious imports) gives an utterly
believable performance as the flamboyant Irish aesthete, and his
world has been carefully evoked by director Brian Gilbert (``Tom
and Viv'') and screenwriter Julian Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   But a certain level of dissatisfaction creeps in when the viewer
knows a thing or two about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   This film takes a sort of formal ``Cliffs Notes'' approach to
Wilde that would be suitable for the classroom if not for its
matter-of-fact depiction of homosexual life and love in the 1890s.
For those already versed in Wilde, the film seems just a bit flabby
and unfocused. Instead of asking us to view his life with a
particular attitude or from a fresh perspective, it recycles the
usual facts.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in the Wild West of Leadville, Colo., where the
touring Wilde descends into a silver mine and delivers unto the
shirtless young diggers a lecture on the Renaissance silversmith
Benvenuto Cellini. Clearly he's inspired by all this sweaty young
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, Oscar hasn't admitted his homosexuality. He
marries the sweet, unassertive Constance (Jennifer Ehle),
explaining to his friends that ``I do need an audience.'' There's
genuine affection in the marriage _ at least enough to produce two
sons _ but one cannot shake the feeling that Oscar regards his wife
as a sort of life-sized doll; he even selects all her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of a family friend, Canadian Robert Ross (Michael
Sheen), forces Oscar to admit something unusual is going on. The
two men are drawn together, although for Ross it will be a case of
unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   Once he begins indulging his sexual fantasies, Oscar goes whole
hog, frequenting gay bordellos and fixating on Lord Alfred Douglas,
who will become the love of his life, as well as the instrument of
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Jude Law, Lord Alfred (or ``Bosie,'' as Oscar
affectionately refers to him) combines a rock star's leonine
sexuality with the petulant selfishness of a rich brat. Which
indeed he is.
</P>
<P>
   When the writer observes that Bosie's spendthrift ways are
ruining him, the young man throws a tantrum, accuses Oscar of being
middle-class and proclaims that ``no gentleman has the slightest
idea of what his bank balance is.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the libertine Bosie is as incapable of fidelity; it
becomes Oscar's sad lot to sit on the sidelines while his beloved
plays the field.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Bosie who brings about Oscar's downfall. Bosie's
father is the blunt, sadistic Marquis of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson
of ``The Full Monty,'' giving a fierce performance that melds
intellect and malevolence). When the marquis accuses Oscar of being
a ``somdomite,'' the vengeful Bosie urges Oscar to sue his father
for slander.
</P>
<P>
   But in the courtroom Oscar's own sexuality becomes the issue,
resulting finally in a two-year prison term at hard labor that
would break the writer's body and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde was, of course, one of the most quotable men who ever
lived, and Mitchell's screenplay has nearly as many famous bon mots
as genuine dialogue. The Oscarisms are everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie is a Canadian. You can tell by his youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall die a Catholic. I couldn't possible live as one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly monstrous the way people say things behind
one's back that are absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of ``Wilde'' seems emotionally remote and curiously
denatured, the film does achieve a sort of grandeur in its final
passages. Only when we witness Oscar's suffering in prison are we
genuinely moved; the pain of this gentle soul crushed by
institutionalized hypocrisy is achingly real.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ You say ``Madame le ministre,'' I say ``Madame la
ministre,'' the French government decreed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call the whole thing off, the Academie Francaise thundered
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The French Academy, a male bastion founded by Cardinal Richelieu
in 1635, is positively beside itself about proposals like making
``ministre,'' which is a masculine noun, feminine when the minister
in question is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the changes the Socialist-led government has
proposed to recognize the increasingly visible role women play in
all walks of French life.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea that has been suggested before and that both sides
have weighed in on before. The major stumbling block for the
Academy remains the requirement that the rules of French grammar
would have to be bent. All French nouns are either masculine or
feminine, a rule that is jealously watched over by the Academy's
guardians of linguistic orthodoxy, who are known as ``immortals.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 of the 39 members of the Academy are women, and the
Perpetual Secretary, Maurice Druon, whose tongue is as formidable
as his white mane and his walking stick, left little doubt where he
stood in an interview with the conservative daily Le Figaro
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialist ideology is making France go to pot, and the French
language with it,'' Druon said. ``The Academy in charge of this
language will meet this week to see if it is possible to appeal to
the Council of State or the Constitutional Council, because the
appropriation of a post by the person exercising it is contrary to
the principles of equality contained in the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministers come and ministers go, but ``ministre'' will always be
masculine if Druon and his colleagues have their way. Since they
often heap ridicule on what the ``politically correct'' movement in
the United States does to the English language and fiercely defend
French against all English or American linguistic inroads, they
seem doubly determined never to let it happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying to the cause, another immortal, Jean Dutourd, delivered
himself of a sentence that it is safe to say no American male
chauvinist, however hard-boiled, would ever let traverse his lips
these days, accusing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of linguistic
travesty:
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the results of polygamy by Jospin, who has
surrounded himself with sultanesses and, to please his harem, has
resurfaced an old idea,'' Dutourd said.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has five women in his Cabinet, and he explained to them
and their nine male ministerial colleagues four months ago that one
of his predecessors, Laurent Fabius, had tried in 1986 to feminize
titles and job descriptions where appropriate, but to little
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin vowed to do better, appointing a commission to study the
problem and pledging to start right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Jacques Chirac now calls me ``Madame la ministre,''
Dominique Voynet, the environment minister, said recently,
referring to the 65-year-old conservative politician who is
France's president. ``Older people resist, but you can understand
that,'' Mrs. Voynet, a scientist by training, said tolerantly.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely, two of her colleagues, Claude Allegre, the (masculine)
minister of education, research and technology, and Segolene Royal,
his (feminine) deputy, circulated a memorandum to educational
establishments on Monday explaining how to feminize grammatically
masculine titles or professions.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant of feminine gender becomes ``une assistante,'' a
word already commonly used in a society where 11.5 million of the
26 million people in the labor force are women. But in the
professions, where integration of the sexes has progressed more
slowly, an architect who is a woman can now, at least in academic
circles, be called ``une architecte.''
</P>
<P>
   The circular gives its blessing to calling a supervisor ``une
chef de service'' if she is a woman, though ``chef'' is
grammatically masculine, and a doctor who is female becomes ``une
medecin.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminizing the noun to make it ``une medicine'' would turn the
doctor into a drug, but other words don't pose the same problem.
Thus a storekeeper can perfectly well be ``une magasiniere,'' a
laboratory technician ``une technicienne'' and a functionary ``une
agente.''
</P>
<P>
   New, perhaps, to this kind of thing, the French ministers think
nothing of calling a female inspector ``une inspectrice'' or a
teacher ``une institutrice,'' particularly since, as they pointed
out, most teachers in France are women. And though French-speaking
purists refuse to say ``software,'' preferring ``logiciel''
instead, the education ministry says transforming ``programmateur''
to ``programmatrice'' where appropriate is OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating all sex discrimination remains a general legal
principle for which jurisprudence has for some years been insisting
on constant respect,'' the two ministers said in their circular to
school and university administrators. ``We attach particular
importance to effectuating these measures and will insist that they
be applied scrupulously in texts submitted for our signature. We
invite you to show the same vigilance in the services under your
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the Academy's attack, the ministry argued that
``mayoresses'' existed in France in the 13th century, and that
brave women like Joan of Arc were not called ``commandant'' but
``commandante'' in the 15th. And in 1701, the ministry said,
somebody even dared to use the word ``academicienne.''

 `LAND GIRLS' is `WOMAN'S PICTURE'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Land Girls,'' a romantic drama, is rated R for some
sexuality. Running time is 1 hour 52 minutes. Two out of four
stars.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it's the height of political incorrectness to label a
movie a ``woman's picture,'' but the British ``The Land Girls''
makes it almost impossible to avoid the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its frankness in sexual matters, this romantic drama
from director David Leland could quite easily have been made during
World War II as a tribute to the members of the Women's Land Army,
whose members took up agricultural work, filling in for the farm
workers in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Leland's screenplay (based on Angela Huth's novel) centers on
three young women who give up their city jobs for the mud and muck
of a Dorset farm.
</P>
<P>
   They are Pru (Anna Friel), a hairdresser with a working-class
outlook and an aggressive approach to sex; Ag (Rachel Weisz), a
very proper academic sort who at 26 is still a virgin; and Stella
(Catherine McCormack), who narrates the tale and who asked to be
posted to Dorset because it's near the naval base where her
upper-class fiance is stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Their hosts are Farmer Lawrence (Tom Georgeson) and his wife
(Maureen O'Brien). Lawrence is a crusty soul who resents being told
by the government how to use his land and who huffs that the three
young women in his attic regard farm work as ``just an excuse for a
lark.'' Mrs. Lawrence is a sweet, unpretentious woman who seems to
be working herself into an early grave.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand is their son, Joe (Steven Mackintosh), who talks of
enlisting as an airman but never quite gets around to it. Though
he's engaged to a local girl serving in the military, Joe is the
only young man around and so becomes the target of Pru's sexual
wiles _ not that he needs much enticing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the film is over Joe will have had relationships with all
three women. If Pru wants only a roll in the hay (literally), the
uptight Ag sees him as a sort of amorous teacher. She's fallen for
a sincere Canadian serviceman, and decides that she needs some
sexual instruction so as not to disappoint her true love when the
big moment comes. Joe is the logical _ indeed, only _ choice.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there's Stella, who observes these antics with wry
amusement. But as it gradually dawns on her that her naval officer
isn't the right fellow after all, the earnest but conflicted Joe
starts looking better.
</P>
<P>
   As a re-creation of a time and place, ``The Land Girls'' is just
about perfect. The patriotic attitudes of the young women, the days
of milking, plowing, planting and harvesting, the near-constant
rain _ all of it seems remarkably authentic. To the extent that
it's a tribute to the thousands of women who grabbed a pitchfork on
behalf of the war effort, ``The Land Girls'' works quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   As drama, though, it's pretty anemic, largely because Leland has
failed to give us fully rounded characters. These women lack
complexity; their motives and actions are unexplained and seem
aimed at fulfilling the story's narrative goals rather than at
revealing who these people really are.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a film beautifully photographed by Henry Braham
whose drama is never as fine as its striking images.

MCVEIGH LETTERS TO FAMILY ARE PORTRAIT OF ANGER AND ALIENATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By JO THOMAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Previously undisclosed letters by Timothy McVeigh to his younger
sister before the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City
portray him as deeply frustrated and at one point suicidal over his
inability to confide the extent of his anti-government activities
to his family.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh's letters, along with conversations at home, revealed so
much anger and alienation that when the bomb exploded on April 19,
1995, eventually killing 168 people and wounding 850, his family
suspected him almost immediately, they later told the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Jennifer McVeigh, told investigators she had an
``eerie feeling'' he was involved. His father, William McVeigh,
said he had worried that his son would do something to get himself
in serious trouble and added that his ex-wife, McVeigh's mother,
thought her son ``did the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Jennifer, written on Oct. 20, 1993, McVeigh said
he was tormented by not being able to ``tell it all'' about his
``lawless behavior and attitude.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he wrote, he had gone to the house of their
grandfather, who has since died, and considered killing himself
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an urgent need for someone in the family to understand
me,'' McVeigh told his sister. ``I will tell you, and only you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters and summaries of interviews by investigators were
obtained by The New York Times. They provide new insights into
McVeigh, who committed the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil.
The material was never presented at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews conducted by the FBI after the bombing show that
members of the McVeigh family differed in their beliefs about what
sparked that hatred. But they agreed it began before the raid that
ended with the deaths of the Branch Davidians at their complex near
Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993 _ an event that clearly exacerbated
his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   It was McVeigh's desire to avenge those deaths and start a
popular uprising against the government that led to the bombing
conspiracy, according to testimony at the trial last year in which
McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   His father speculated that his son's real troubles began with a
bad debt. In February 1993, the Department of Defense informed
McVeigh that he had been overpaid $1,058 while in the Army and
asked for repayment. The father said the episode had enraged his
son.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennifer McVeigh, who was her brother's confidante, thought
the breaking point came earlier, in 1991, at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
where he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Special Forces. Army
records show that McVeigh dropped out of the program after saying
he could not meet the physical demands.
</P>
<P>
   In his Oct. 20 letter, McVeigh wrote that he and nine other
soldiers had been taken to a private intelligence briefing at Fort
Bragg, where they were told they could be required to participate
in government-sanctioned assassinations and government-sponsored
drug trafficking. The government has always denied it carries out
such assassinations and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Tim (characteristically nondrinker),
super-successful in the Army (private to sergeant in 2 years) (Top
Gun) (Bronze Star) (accepted into Special Forces), all of a sudden
come home, party HARD, and, just like that, announce he was not
only `disillusioned' by SF, but was, in fact, leaving the
service?'' McVeigh asked his sister.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he wrote, lay in what he learned at Fort Bragg,
where he and the nine others were told they might be ordered to
help the CIA ``fly drugs into the U.S. to fund many covert
operations'' and to ``work hand-in-hand with civilian police
agencies'' as ``government-paid assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``Do not spread this info, Jennifer, as you could
(very honestly, seriously) endanger my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written on Christmas Eve of 1993, McVeigh hinted
that he might be breaking the law, telling his sister she might
need to ``re-evaluate your definition(s) of good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' McVeigh wrote, ``you would see the news and see
a bank robbery, and judge him a `criminal.' But, without getting
too lengthy, the Federal Reserve and the banks are the real
criminals, so where is the crime in getting even? I guess if I
reflect, it's sort of a Robin Hood thing, and our government is the
evil king.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss McVeigh later told the FBI that her brother once told her
he planned a bank robbery with others who carried it out and showed
her the large stack of $100 bills he said was his share. She said
he had given her three of the bills and asked her to give him $300
in smaller denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before the bombing, in a letter mailed from Caro,
Mich., McVeigh, who was moving from place to place around the
country, while keeping a mail drop in Kingman, Ariz., wrote his
sister: ``Of course you must realize, then, that I'm not living in
Arizona. You know how hard it is to get into that deep of a lie
with Dad? It's painful, especially how you have to look so
confident when telling stories (lies).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I running?'' he wrote. ``I am trying to keep my path
`cool,' so in case someone is looking to `shut up someone who knows
too much' I will not be easy to find. I have also been working, and
establishing a `network' of friends so that if someone does start
looking for me, I will know ahead of time and be warned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that `tip' ever comes, (I have `ears' all over the country)
that's when I disappear, or go completely underground,'' he wrote.
``Believe me, if that necessity ever comes to pass, it will be very
difficult for anyone to find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his claims of making such elaborate arrangements,
McVeigh was arrested shortly after the bombing by an Oklahoma
highway patrolman who saw that his car had no license plate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh's father said he was not surprised when the FBI told him
of his son's arrest two days after the bombing. He said he and his
son were at ``opposite ends politically,'' and that his son was
obsessed with the deaths of the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   William McVeigh portrayed his son as a bright person who, as a
boy, could never quite succeed either in school or at sports. As an
adult, his father said, Timothy McVeigh bounced from job to job
because he could not stand pressure, could not take orders and
could not handle the responsibilities of day-to-day work. His
father said his troubles really began when the government asked him
to pay back the extra salary he had been paid by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Documents gathered during the bombing investigation show that a
form letter from the Department of Defense Finance and Accounting
Service was sent to McVeigh at his home in Lockport, N.Y., on Feb.
15, 1993, two years after he had left the Army after serving in the
Persian Gulf War. The letter asked for the full $1,058 or a $50
installment within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh, whose frugality was legendary among his friends,
replied at the time: ``I have received your notice informing me of
my debt owed to you, as well as your threat of referring me to the
Justice Department (Big Brother).''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``In all honesty, I cannot even dream of repaying
you the $1,000 which you say I owe. In fact, I can barely afford my
monthly rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assets? The only thing which I own of any value is my car, a
1987 Chevrolet/Geo Spectrum,'' he continued. ``If you really want
the car, go ahead and seize it,'' he wrote, adding, ``My car is my
only way to get to work; to support myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess that's all irrelevant to you,'' he continued. ``Go
ahead, take everything I own; take my dignity. Feel good as you
grow fat and rich at my expense; sucking my tax dollars and
property, tax dollars which justify your existence and pay your
federal salary. Do you get it yet? By doing your evil job, you put
me out of work.'' &QL;

VENUS WILLIAMS MOVES INTO WIMBLEDON QUARTERFINALS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Venus Williams, spared the vexing task of
taking on her brash little sister in the Round of 16, made good on
her previously ``broken promises'' to attempt some snazzy
serve-and-volley maneuvers Tuesday during a 6-3, 6-1 dissection of
47th-ranked Virginia Ruano Pascual. The seventh-seeded Williams
reached her first Wimbledon quarterfinal by unveiling a complex
grass-court game, including 24 winners on 29 net approaches and the
conversion of six of eight break chances from the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   The power brokers were out in full force as clear skies
prevailed Tuesday and a full schedule of quarterfinalists in men's
and women's singles was determined. All 16 winners are scheduled to
whittle themselves into eight semifinalists on Wednesday if the
weather complies. The full schedule produced few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Only Williams' style against Pascual, the Spaniard who drove out
16-year-old Serena Williams in the previous round, was surprising.
``I was more diligent in coming in today and actually attacking,''
said Williams, 18. ``I think that with every match I'm able to play
smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will need all her precocious smarts when she faces
29-year-old Jana Novotna, a two-time Wimbledon runner-up whose
experience on grass outshines that of all contemporaries except the
seven-time champion Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience plays a huge role in this,'' said the third-seeded
Novotna following her 6-2, 6-3 dismissal of 10th-seeded Irina
Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
   There were no alterations to the grass-court playmaking
epitomized by top-seeded Pete Sampras against 117th-ranked
Sebastian Grosjean. Sampras, the defending champion, stayed on
course to collect a fifth Wimbledon crown and an 11th Grand Slam
title by winning 50 of his 55 prowls to the net. All told, Sampras
required just 14 aces to tame the baseline-bound qualifier, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to start a match and complete a match in one
day,'' said Sampras, who next faces a formidable server in
Australia's resurgent Mark Philippoussis. Sampras leads their
rivalry by 4-2 and beat the Australian here in 1996. But
Philippoussis entered this event with a new attitude and a new
haircut after almost cutting Wimbledon from his schedule because
his game had turned anemic. Tuesday, he reached his first Grand
Slam quarterfinal with a 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 comeback against Jason
Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tempestuous Goran Ivanisevic kept his nose to the
grindstone. The 14th-seeded Croat turned in a documentary-style 7-6
(7-5), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2) performance against Todd Martin. ``It's
the most important tournament for me,'' said Ivanisevic, who is 2-5
against his next opponent, 23d-ranked Jan Sirmerink. ``If I play
like this, I have nothing to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of the seeded quarterfinalists, Richard Krajicek, was
the most flustered of the bunch. Wimbledon's weak-kneed 1996
champion could not understand why, with the courts actually dry and
rain-free for the first time since opening day, he kept falling
down. But he won anyway and accomplished the victory with just 13
aces and inhibited mobility because of a second-set spill that
caused his surgically repaired right knee to seize up. The key,
Krajicek said, to his 6-3, 6-3, 7-5 elimination of South Africa's
Wayne Ferreira was in drawing an opponent even more infirm than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky that there was another invalid on the court, that he
couldn't serve, and I won in straight sets,'' said the ninth-seeded
Dutchman of Ferreira, whose chronically sore ankle was complicated
by a temporarily strained stomach muscle. ``It just wasn't his day;
he was struggling with his serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek was considerably more diplomatic about Ferreira, who
plopped out eight double faults Tuesday, than he has been about
other peers. The outspoken Dutchman attracted the ire of female
competitors here four years ago by referring to them as ``fat, lazy
pigs.'' And last week Krajicek drew a raised eyebrow from Sampras
when he remarked that the top-ranked defending champion has been
playing 10th-ranked tennis this year.
</P>
<P>
   In character, Krajicek said he didn't see any reason to be
tentative about facing his next opponent, Davide Sanguinetti, a
65th-ranked Italian who had never played a match on Wimbledon's
grass until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him play one game once: he's right-handed, he's got
double-handed backhands,'' Krajicek said. The 25-year-old
Sanguinetti reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal by downing
Francisco Clavet of Spain, 7-6(7-3), 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Williams was the only relative newcomer to
a Wimbledon quarterfinal cast that includes top-seeded Martina
Hingis, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, third-seeded Novotna,
fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, sixth-seeded Monica Seles,
16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva, the only unseeded
player in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, undefeated in her last 11 Wimbledon matches after
eliminating Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, 6-3, 6-2, Tuesday, has
a 5-1 record against Sanchez Vicario, who needed three sets to
sneak past 15th-seeded Dominique Van Roost, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.  &QL;

A FIERCE RUN ON THE RAND SHOCKS SOUTH AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic on how the rand has performed this quarter is
being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.) 
(nk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Speculators have given the South
African rand a nasty shock in the last few days, forcing the
nation's central bank to enlist help from the United States and
Britain and to raise interest rates sharply to stem the currency's
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Until the selloff began, the rand had been drifting slowly down
against the dollar, slipping about 12 percent since the beginning
of the year. Then, starting last week, it plunged 13 percent after
speculators who had been exploiting the turmoil in Asia turned
their sights on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's request, the American Federal Reserve Bank
and the Bank of England both intervened on Friday and Monday. The
lift for the rand was short-lived, however, after it became clear
that the two central banks were using the South African Reserve
Bank's dollars to buy the South African currency.
</P>
<P>
   Facing its worst currency crisis in years, the Reserve Bank
increased its overnight lending rate to commercial banks on Tuesday
to more than 20 percent, from 18.311 percent, prompting most banks
to raise their prime rates by two percentage points, to 22.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the tighter credit risked slowing South Africa's economic
growth, which has already been hurt by falling commodity prices, it
bolstered the rand by making rand-denominated assets more
attractive to international investors. The currency closed here
Tuesday at 17.04 cents, up from an all-time low of 16.26 cents at
midday on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the rand had actually outperformed the
currencies of Asia, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand with which
it is often compared because of similarities in the countries'
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some speculator must have noticed that on his computer and
decided that it was our turn,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, a
professor of political economy at Stellenbosch University. ``So the
Asian bug hit us _ a little belatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists universally expressed surprise at the fierceness of
the attack because the South African economy's fundamentals are
strong, whether compared with Asian economies or with the situation
here before the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   South African banks are very conservative, carry few bad loans
and are not in thrall to ruling families like the Suhartos in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign debt is low. State assets are being privatized, albeit
slowly. Until the run began, inflation was down significantly, to 5
percent, the Reserve Bank had reserves equal to three months'
imports, and the prime rate was high but stable at about 18
percent. Foreign bankers generally applaud the government's
economic policies, which focus on beating inflation and lowering
the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, before 1994, the African National Congress was
strongly socialist and talked about nationalizing the mines and
cutting unemployment with massive public spending; the budget
deficit was at 5 percent of GDP and foreign exchange was heavily
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what started this run on the rand. Chris Stals,
the governor of the Reserve Bank, has blamed selling by an
unidentified American hedge fund. But the background was in place.
To drive off speculators, the Reserve Bank had steadily raised the
overnight lending rate to nearly 24 percent. When it felt confident
enough to lower it to 17 percent to let commercial lending rates
relax a little, speculators leaped in.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, foreign analysts wrote some cautionary reports.
Particularly alarming, said Kevin Lings, senior economist for
Nedcor, a major bank holding company, was one from the Bank of New
York that raised the possibility of riots and food shortages. Local
economists scoffed at the report, since the first affected by a
weak rand are the rich, but it presumably encouraged speculators.
Another rumor making the rounds had it that the failure of a
Reserve Bank clerk to leave overnight orders with a bank in New
York was read as a decision by the bank not to defend the rand.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, however, the monetary crisis reflects the growing
maturity of the South African economy. The last abrupt currency
plunge, in 1996, was brought on by a false rumor that President
Nelson Mandela had had a heart attack. Administration officials
then cried racism, since the implication was that a black
government couldn't keep the country together without Mandela at
the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the markets seem content with the prospect that Thabo Mbeki
will become president next year and confident that the African
National Congress will continue to pursue conservative financial
policies. Indeed, economists say, the rand's latest slide results
less from political upheaval than from the mundane realities of a
developing country, notably South Africa's exposure to the fallout
from Asia and its vulnerability to currency speculators. In
addition, investors have become increasingly nervous about the
possibility that labor unions will put pressure on the government
to temper its economic austerity measures as the 1999 elections
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, because of apartheid-era sanctions, South Africa is
somewhat insulated against currency crises. Snubbed by the world,
it became self-sufficient in food, steel, chemicals, textiles and
other basics. It once produced a third of its own gasoline from
coal; that is down to 10 percent, but fuel prices are still
relatively low. Its biggest imports are unassembled auto parts,
computers and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The people immediately hit hardest _ and complaining loudest _
are the relatively small numbers of upper-middle-class and rich
people who buy imported clothes and take vacations abroad. However,
anyone with a variable-rate mortgage or car loan will soon be hurt,
too, if interest rates stay high, and so will the many stores that
sell to the poor on credit.
</P>
<P>
   The poor should not be hurt until high interest rates slow the
economy enough to cause more layoffs. That is already a problem _
the economy lost about 130,000 jobs last year while growing only
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a weak rand could stimulate the moribund
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rand is now ``clearly significantly undervalued by any
measure,'' said Nico Czypionka, chief economist for the Standard
Bank here. All the country's exports, from gold, platinum,
manganese, and zinc, to chemicals, paper pulp, fruit, and wine,
should benefit. Gold mines, which have been laying off thousands of
workers because gold is below $300 an ounce, may become profitable
again, because those workers are paid in rand.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing for the economy, economists say, is to
get South Africans to save. They have one of the world's lowest
savings rates.
</P>
<P>
   When the rand was created in 1962, it was pegged at two rands to
an English pound, back when the pound was worth about $5 _ giving
the rand a value then of $2.50. On Monday, it briefly hit 10 rands
per pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I studied in the United States in the late 1960s, I got
$1.40 for my rand,'' Terreblanche said. ``Now it's 16 cents. It's
hard to think we can be so degraded internationally.''

<P>
   ST. ETIENNE, France _ Glenn Hoddle hears the word in England _
``vendetta'' He calls it ``a horrible expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The English coach has had to live 12 years with the emotion of
being on the field when Diego Armando Maradona punched the ball
into the net for the cynical Hand of God goal that still haunts
England, unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than revenge, I dream of turning the score back to
zero,'' Hoddle said the other day. ``That was the most bitter
defeat in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Now England has another ghastly memory, the penalty-kick
shootout that ended with Argentina on top Tuesday night, 4-3, after
a 2-2 tie in the World Cup. As it was, the spirit of Maradona
hunkered down over the foothills of the Alps. The cynical chicanery
and the glittering skill of Maradona was renewed in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   One goal per side was produced by egregious flops, but then
there was a dazzling 50-yard run and a crisp goal worthy of the
stubby old master _ committed by an 18-year-old boy with a big
grin, Michael Owen, playing in his first World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Owen dominated this game for a half, and might have won it with
his natural moves and unnatural poise. However, he was effectively
taken out of the game by a teammate, who drew one of the more
stupid red cards in this World Cup of mandated mass ejections.
</P>
<P>
   In the second minute of the second half, with the score already
tied, Diego Simeone, the Argentine captain, fell heavily on David
Beckman, grinding his hand into Beckham's back, as soccer players
are wont to do. Beckman, on the ground, retaliated with a backwards
kick, but he foolishly did it with Kim Nielsen, the Danish
official, standing right there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the referee missed the flailing left hand of Maradona
and permitted the goal that won a quarterfinal game. This time,
Nielsen, under orders to keep law and order, waved a red card,
tossing Beckham out of the game. A yellow warning card would have
more than sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   The display of authority meant England would play virtually one
hour and 15 minutes a man short. It also meant that Owen's
wonderful darts and dashes were finished, because he had to stay
home and help on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams wobbled to a 2-2 tie and then they indulged in the
only humane tie-breaker known to man, the penalty-kick shootout, as
haphazard as buying a lottery ticket down at the local stationery
store.
</P>
<P>
   The English fans went out into the dewy mountain night, outside
the walls and gates, where phalanxes of police and dogs and horses
and chemical sprays awaited any lager louts who crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   There was a history to this game, this rivalry, this resentment,
this ``vendetta,'' the word Hoddle hates. This was not just some
random soccer pairing, some Denmark-Nigeria game. This was a
reverberation of the nasty little episode in 1982 called the
Falklands War by the British and the Malvinas War by the
Argentines. Their soccer encounter came on June 22, 1986, in Mexico
City, when Maradona punched in one goal with his hand and scored a
second with a glorious hipper-dipper run through six or seven
British defenders. Gary Lineker later scored for England, but
Argentina would go on to win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine fans still chanted: ``Argentina without Maradona is
like a dance without women,'' but his drug and scandal-addled
career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be original,'' said Daniel Passarella, the
Argentina coach and Maradona's 1986 teammate. ``We won't do a
Maradona. We'll do our best to practice fair play.''
</P>
<P>
   The English coach also was on the field that day in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an even game until Maradona scored with a hand ball,''
Hoddle recalled this week. ``Without that, Argentina would not have
won. Sure, the second goal by Maradona was extraordinary, but he
never would have scored that killer goal if the score had been
0-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle also recalled how he and Maradona happened to be called
in for the random drug testing after the game: ``We didn't talk, as
I remember, but we shook hands. I remember standing next to me was
Terry Butcher, and he was in another state.'' Butcher wanted to
strangle Maradona, in fact, but somehow refrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two or three days before I could find any
serenity,'' Hoddle said. ``I was on vacation when Argentina played
Germany in the finals. I saw the game at the beach with 11 Germans,
and I don't have to tell you who I rooted for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle will have to watch the World Cup on the tube again this
year, thinking about the bit of mutual foolishness that took
Michael Owen and England out of the World Cup.

DANCE HONORS FOR BROTHERS WHO COULD TAP UP A STORM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Fayard and Harold Nicholas, the tap dancers who
performed professionally as the Nicholas Brothers in movies,
Broadway musicals, nightclubs and television shows, received the
1998 Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award on Monday
night in ceremonies at Duke University here.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 award, established in 1981 by the philanthropist
Samuel H. Scripps, is given annually at the American Dance Festival
to honor lifetime achievement in American modern dance. Modern
dance is broadly conceived by the selection panel as dance that
reflects a spirit of innovation rather than a specific technique.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicholas Brothers, whose careers began in 1930, developed a
style known as classic tap, notable for its rhythmic complexity,
acrobatic dexterity and elegant use of the arms and upper body. The
award citation praised them for ``strikingly original work which
has enriched our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fayard Nicholas, 83, received the award from festival directors
Charles L. Reinhart and Stephanie Reinhart. Harold Nicholas, born
in 1921, was prevented from attending by illness, as was the
cabaret entertainer Bobby Short, who had been scheduled to present
the award.
</P>
<P>
   Film clips showed excerpts from some Nicholas Brothers movies,
among them ``Stormy Weather,'' a 1943 production with routines
filled with spectacular leaps, slides and rushings up and down a
flight of stairs. Yet despite the acrobatic choreography, the
dancers always retained a sense of poise.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the tap routines he choreographed for himself and
his brother, Fayard Nicholas joked in receiving the award: ``I
can't do that anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. To tell you
the truth, it hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a small table at the side of the stage, he watched a
performance by the Nicholas Sisters: his two granddaughters, Nicole
Elizabeth, who is 12, and Catherine Victoria, 9.
</P>
<P>
   First came a brisk routine without music. Then generations of
tap artists were united. While the Nicholas Brothers were shown on
screen dancing a number from ``The Black Network,'' a film short of
1935, the Nicholas Sisters did the same jaunty dance onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the career of the Nicholas Brothers, who made
their last appearance as a team in 1985, Reinhart said: ``They were
not only ahead of their time 60 years ago, they are ahead of their
time today.''

 &HT;    U.S. FIRMS TRYING TO ATTRACT A CLINTON VISIT GET BYPASSED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With CHINA-HISTBOX 
 &HT;    EDS: We expect to top this story by 10:45 p.m. EDT with fresh
Clinton remarks from meetings with business leaders 
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ American corporations lobbied months for President
Clinton to visit their factories in China, but on Wednesday he will
bypass the chance to be photographed next to eager, low paid
Chinese workers making goods for export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies talked about trying to get the president to
do a whole host of things, visit their plants, visit schools that
they support, and a whole host of them,'' a top member of the
Clinton entourage, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley,
acknowledged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley said the closest he expects Clinton to get to any
American business is at a half-hour speech Wednesday morning to the
American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. As the day with the least
crowded schedule, Wednesday was the most likely target for a
factory visit.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said a ``symbolic visit'' to a U.S. factory wouldn't have
nearly the impact as Clinton's overall message ``of greater
cooperation'' between China and America.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America got several other disappointments from
Clinton's nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The White House waffled for weeks before finally deciding not to
include a business delegation as part of Clinton's official
entourage. That would have given commercial relations a high
profile role in Clinton's five-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Clinton and his administration achieve an agreement on
China's admittance to the World Trade Organization, which business
leaders listed as a number one priority of this summit. As a WTO
member China would have to reduce tariffs and loosen tough controls
over foreign firms doing business here.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors especially appealed hard for Clinton to stop by
its new joint venture factory that will turn out a version of the
Buick Regal here in Shanghai, a daring project that carries the
risk of falling flat for lack of big-car demand. GM was still
hopeful by mid-month, but a major strike in the United States made
a presidential visit a bad publicity risk.
</P>
<P>
   Daley also said at a briefing Tuesday that no progress had been
made on reducing China's trade deficit, with the American side
saying China sells about $50 billion more than it buys from the
U.S. New figures show the deficit has jumped by another 13-14
percent in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, our exports have not grown anywhere near
the degree that their exports to the United States have,'' Daley
said. And he said no ``concrete steps'' have been taken in the last
five days to shrink the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly shifted the mood of this trip from official
meetings to more informal visits with Chinese people as soon as he
got to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Clinton held a roundtable discussion with
intellectuals and sat through call-in questions during an hourlong
radio talk show. He walked in the lush Yu Gardens with his daughter
Chelsea, fed the fish and bought some ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the round table discussion Clinton made one comment in a
rather off-hand way that will make China's top leaders sit up and
take notice back in Beijing. It also caused dismay in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finally repeated specifically the ``three noes'' that
Chinese have wanted him to commit to upholding in regard to U.S.
policy on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In official meetings earlier in the trip, Clinton said, he had a
chance to reiterate the American policy, ``which is that we don't
support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one
China,'' he said. ``And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a
member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what China's President Jiang Zemin said he
wanted from Clinton, but did not get until Tuesday morning.
Earlier, without giving specifics, Clinton said vaguely that he
supports the existing U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Chinese communists have no rights and
are in no position to conduct bilateral negotiations on anything
related to our affairs,'' Taiwan foreign ministry spokesman Roy Wu
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House press spokesman Mike McCurry tried to downplay
Clinton's comment, questioning its significance as ``merely a
reiteration of longstanding U.S. policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no particular reason Clinton finally in
Shanghai made the comments Chinese leaders had called the most
important aspect of his trip. Clinton may have waited until leaving
the Beijing seat of government in an effort to diminish the impact
of his statement, and he also may have withheld it until seeing how
the Chinese would respond to some of the administration's desires.
</P>
<P>
   After getting two live televised appearances broadcast on
Chinese television, which had been a high administration priority,
Clinton delivered the sought-after statement that cements U.S.
policy as coming from the government's highest source.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai Clinton largely achieved the kind of informal
give-and-take he had hoped to experience in China, as part of his
effort to give Americans a better understanding of the country that
well may be the economic powerhouse of the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest talk show question probably was the query about
which team he thinks will win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert in soccer, but I think the Brazilians are
always hard to beat,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Show host Zuo Anlong wondered whether America couldn't adapt the
``ping-pong diplomacy'' that opened the door to China into ``soccer
diplomacy'' and open a route to better relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be possible,'' Clinton said.

 &HT;    Ivanisevic beats Martin
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Goran Ivanisevic has about a centimeter of
hair on his head and a matching goatee on his chin in his 1998
media guide picture.
</P>
<P>
   His hair hung to the middle of his neck Tuesday, as he reached
the Wimbledon quarterfinals by beating American Todd Martin 7-6
(7-5), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2). The hair was pulled off Ivanisevic's
face with a plain rubberband as a headband and set off by a full
beard.
</P>
<P>
   In his decade as a pro tennis player, the 26-year-old lefthander
also has worn a short waterspout ponytail, a long regular ponytail
and a handful of other styles.
</P>
<P>
   This week's beard, the 14th seed said, is just because he's lazy
and doesn't want to shave. But he feels obligated to change his
hairstyle frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people expect me to do always something new,'' he said.
``They always ask me, 'When is there going to be a new hairstyle?'
or ``Do something new.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, his tennis and his attitude are almost as
changeable as his hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I am on that court I can, when I play good, beat
anybody,'' Ivanisevic said. ''And I can lose, because my matches
are like horror thrillers. You cannot expect anything. Even me, I
don't know the end of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A top junior in Croatia, Ivanisevic turned pro in 1988. By 1989,
he was 40 in the world and two years later, he entered the top 10.
In 1992, he reached the French Open quarterfinals and the Wimbledon
final. He reached a year-end career-high ranking of No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, he has wandered off his straight-shot march to
the top, earning a reputation for cursing himself and anyone else
nearby when he loses.
</P>
<P>
   He never lost his talent, though, which includes the big serve
and all-around skill. Many experts still consider his mind to be
his biggest obstacle to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an erratic career, particularly in the Grand
Slams. He also reached the Wimbledon final in 1994, losing to Pete
Sampras in straight sets, but never consistently advanced in the
big events.
</P>
<P>
   The past 16 months have been the hardest. Before Wimbledon,
Ivanisevic had won just one match in a Grand Slam tournament since
the 1997 Australian Open. His 1997 year-end ranking was 15, his
lowest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very bad,'' he said. ''Five Grand Slams, one win.
(But) maybe this is the breakthrough. AfteThis year has been
especially difficult, when the normally unpredictable Ivanisevic
was predictably bad. He has won just one title and reached only one
other semifinal, in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last six months has been my worst six months ever in my
carelrhis week. ''I said, 'OK. The first half of the year is gone.
You cannot play worse than the first half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two months ago, he considered practice an
unbearable burden and hated hearing things about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not easnad he's never going to be back again,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of practicing or working out, he wanted to watch
sports or hang out with friends. He loves soccer and has been
discussing Croatia's World Cup progress after nearly every match.
When someone told him Croatia had just scored, he laughed and asked
for detaisl.
</P>
<P>
   He ended his bad patch a few weeks ago after a stern
conversation with himself.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'This is the end,' '' he said he told himself. '' 'You can
play better and improve and don't feel sorry for yourself.'
Sometimes I feel sorry for myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He has enough talent that he can turn it around with little more
than his will. A few weeks of grass-court practice after a
first-round loss to 144th-ranked Marziosvic reached the fourth
round in a Wimbledon warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happier to play. I have more fun on the court and more fun
practicing,'' Ivanisevic said. ''So I think I've passed that bad
time.''
</P>
<P>
   And although other players never know where Ivanisevic's head
will be, just the thought of the 6-foot-4 serve and volleyer on
grass concerns them. He has led the tour in aces four times in the
past six years, averaging 14.8 per match last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got one of the biggest serves ever,'' said top seed Pete
Sampras, who also advanced to the quarterfinals but could only meet
Ivanisevic in the final. ``He gets his mind into it, and he's very
much a threat.''

   WIMBLEDON, England _ Martina Hingis, Jana Novotna and Venus
Williams all reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday without
losing more than five games.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for the first time, Hingis and Williams will play seeded
opponents. Hingis meets Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who struggled
early before defeating Dominique Van Roost 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams _ who beat Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-3, 6-1 _ faces
Novotna, who defeated Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, 29, is the elder statesmen in this women's draw. She is
the oldest and the most classic serve-and-volley player, reaching
the final here twice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she lost to Hingis. In 1993, she led Steffi Graf
early before losing in three sets and then crying on the shoulder
of royalty during the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recently expressed interest in using more
serve-and-volley but has struggled to do so at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with every match I'm able to play smarter,''
Williams said. ``I'm able to come in more. I'm able to serve
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna doesn't mind, however, that Williams is far from
perfecting her grass-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happier that Venus is really not a serve-and-volleyer,''
Novotna said, ''because she really has a huge serve and if she
would be coming in all the time, it would be rather difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport also meets her first seeded
player, No.16 Nathalie Tauziat. No.6 Monica Seles is the only
quarterfinalist not to play a seed. But she is concerned about
playing Natasha Zvereva, who eliminated Steffi Graf in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has the best hands in the game,'' Seles said of Zvereva.
``So she'll be a tough match.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterfinals: Frequent rain last week could mean good things
for fans if it holds off again. All four men's and women's
quarterfinal matches are scheduled for today so fans could see both
top seeds, Williams, Davenport, Tim Henman and others with just a
few footsteps around the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the week, the women should play semifinals
Thursday, rest on Friday and play the finals Saturday. The men
should rest Thursday, play semifinals Friday and the finals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Gimelstob advance: Mixed double partners Venus
Williams and Justin Gimelstob upset seventh-seeded Cyril Suk and
Helena Sukova in their first-round match, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, continuing
their pursuit of a mixed doubles Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   The two Florida residents _ Gimelstob lives in Key Biscayne _
won the Australian and French mixed titles this year. Wimbledon
officials, however, chose not to seed them here, instead choosing
to follow doubles rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and partner Max Mirnyi also won, defeating Geoff
Grant and Catalina Cristea 6-1, 7-6 (11-9). The sisters can't meet
until the final.
</P>
<P>
   Lobs: Italian Davide Sanguinetti is the lowest-ranked
quarterfinalist at 65. He never has played Wimbledon, and this is
just his fourth Grand Slam tournament, by far his best result. ...
Simone Amorico, a Delray Beach resident, lost his first-round
junior boys match to Jerome Haehnel of France, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6.

CHALLENGER CRITICIZES BUSH DECISION ON HENRY LUCAS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies BC-LUCAS-STRANGEODYSSEY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry Mauro said
Tuesday that Gov. George W. Bush should not have halted the
execution of Henry Lee Lucas, contending that doubts about the
former Death Row inmate's guilt were based on thin evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who once confessed to some 600 killings, was scheduled to
be executed Tuesday night for the Halloween 1979 strangulation and
rape of a still-unidentified woman whose body was found near
Georgetown in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, a Republican who is seeking a second term in November,
commuted the sentence to life in prison Friday, citing reports
suggesting that Lucas was in Florida when the woman was killed.
Mauro questioned the validity of those claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve jurors and a judge found Henry Lee Lucas guilty and
sentenced him to death,'' said Mauro, a four-term Texas land
commissioner. ``Their decision was reviewed by 23 appeals court
judges, and they didn't find any reason to overrule them. Based on
that, I don't think the governor should have intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, suggested that Mauro
was seeking to score political points by taking shots at Lucas, who
is serving prison time for at least 10 slayings, including that of
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious doubts have been raised about Henry Lee Lucas' guilt
in this one particular case,'' Tucker said. ``The governor is
simply saying it would be wrong to execute someone for a crime they
may not have committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro on Tuesday backed away from a statement he made Monday to
the Austin American-Statesman suggesting that Lucas' other crimes
were so heinous that he should have been executed regardless of his
guilt in the Georgetown slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the impression I meant to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By hammering Bush on the Lucas issue, Mauro put himself at odds
with one of the most prominent Democratic office seekers who has
been willing to embrace his underdog campaign against the popular
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Jim Mattox, who is hoping to win back
the job he held from 1983 to 1991, publicly urged Bush to spare
Lucas. In 1986, Mattox's office released a report citing work
records that put Lucas in Jacksonville, Fla., during much of
October and November 1979, when the woman was killed.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush announced his decision to commute Lucas' sentence,
Mattox issued a statement saying he ``would defend Governor Bush
against any attack'' in the matter. Tuesday, Mattox did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Lee Lucas has done a number of reprehensible things, and
may deserve the death penalty for some of them,'' Mattox said.
``But it should not come on a crime he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garry Mauro or any other individual who criticizes the
decision is just wrong,'' said Mattox, who added that he will
continue to support Mauro's bid for governor.

   Fans, drivers, TV taking to NASCAR at night
</P>
<P>
   By Tom McCollister
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It's difficult to get an emotional
reaction from stoic Mark Martin, but even he admitted to getting
chill bumps when he flew over Daytona International Speedway
recently and saw its lights aglow, circling the 2 1/2-mile track
like a pearl necklace.
</P>
<P>
   And when Martin had the opportunity on the following day to test
his Ford Taurus under those lights, it was everything he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view from behind the windshield is spectacular, just like
daytime, only better,'' said Martin, a Daytona Beach resident, who
will race under the lights for real on Saturday in the Pepsi 400.
``It's spectacular. The job they've done here is so good. When you
leave the track it seems darker everywhere else, because your eyes
are adjusted to such excellent lighting out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin isn't alone in praising the the speedway's new lighting
system. The project began the week after last year's Pepsi race,
and Musco Lighting completed the construction just days before the
first test on June 8. Musco called it the world's largest lighting
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a challenging project for us,'' said Musco
President Joe Crookham. ``When designing the system, three factors
came into play _ the driver, the spectator and the television
audience. One of the challenges for that is that light by its
nature has to be intrusive on the object, but we don't want to put
it in anybody's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. Night racing seems to be knocking out everybody's
eyes, from the drivers to the fans to television producers. For
that reason, NASCAR scheduled six night races this season. And
while NASCAR officials say they aren't ready for the ``NASCAR at
Night'' logo, more are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Television likes night racing because of the ratings. Tom
Hughes of TBS said the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, televised at 6
p.m. on Saturday, May 24, carried a 5.0-plus rating, the
third-highest cable TV rating in history. The race carried 6.0
ratings during the last two quarter-hours. H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler,
president at Charlotte Motor Speedway, estimated that an afternoon
race would have drawn from a 3.8-4.0 rating.
</P>
<P>
   _ The drivers like Saturday-night racing because it would
provide more quality family time. ``I think they ought to light 'em
all up, so we can race Saturday night every week,'' Mike Skinner
said. ``Then we could have Sundays off and more time with our
families. Qualify Friday night, race Saturday, and then go on to
the house. Of course, I know that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The fans like night racing for obvious reasons _ 70-degree
nights offer more comfort than 103-degree days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saturday-night racing also creates a built-in rainout makeup
day. If it rains on Saturday, there's always Sunday for racing.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler predicts NASCAR will begin moving more toward night
racing, but he thinks it will keep its traditional Sunday dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday night is the highest HUT level (household usage
television) of the week,'' Wheeler said. ``It's the lowest on
Saturday night. If the TV money is enough, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans in the stands still outrank those in front of
their TV sets. It's going to be a long time before your television
revenue does more for you than your live gate. The gate is the most
important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Night racing came to NASCAR totally by happenstance, not because
of television, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was after The Winston, the week after the first night
Winston race,'' Wheeler said. ``Bruton (Smith) and I were going
through the stands after the Coca Cola 600 pre-race show. It was 95
degrees. The fans were yelling at us, 'Let's run at night! Let's
run at night!' They were miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to the top step, and I said to Bruton, 'I think the
people have spoken.' I don't know how much, or when, but, yes,
there will be more night racing.''
</P>
<P>
   For two-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, the issue may be
difficult to put in perspective, but he knows why fans and drivers
prefer the nighttime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the cars going around at night, they look faster,''
he said. ``The thing I like most about night-time is the
consistency in the track. The conditions are perfect, nice cool
temperatures. You don't have to deal with clouds and sunshine and
the track changing all the time. Another thing I really like is, I
usually get to sleep late in in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Jeremy Mayfield, who feels strongly in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it seems like there's a little bit more electricity
in the air for night races, but it doesn't really matter to me,''
Mayfield said. ``I just want to race. Temperatures can be an
advantage at night. It's a little cooler. Maybe you can't see quite
as well, but you never have to worry about the glare of the sun,
either. Really, just tell me what time to be there, and I'll be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Varying opinions aside, Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president of
competition, doesn't foresee a splurge of night races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona is understandable, considering the heat,'' Helton
said. ``Atlanta has installed lights, but with their two races _
March and November _ the weather is little severe for night racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston Cup racing is still a Sunday afternoon sport. There's
a long tradition of racing on Sunday afternoon, one that I believe
will continue.''

MAKING AFRICAN POP SAFE FOR WESTERN EARS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens too often. An African rock band comes to New York and
plays a brilliant set, turning listeners into dancers with complex,
scintillating grooves that billow and tickle and drive. Afterward,
full of anticipation, new fans track down the band's latest album,
only to find that it doesn't sound anything like what the band
played on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is bound to repeat itself after Africa Fete _ the
package tour with Salif Keita from Mali, Maryam Mursal from
Somalia, Papa Wemba from Congo and Cheikh Lo from Senegal _ takes
place Sunday at Central Park Summerstage. Parts of their albums
approximate their performances; Wemba's current album, ``Molokai,''
was recorded live in the studio. But other songs fall prey to a
mistranslation syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   On too many internationally released albums by African stars,
guest vocalists are enlisted to break the language barrier;
American or European producers tweak the rhythms to sound more like
funk or reggae or whatever else they think will reach the
unconverted. It sounds as if the international labels that sought
out African bands went on to second-guess themselves, deciding that
their African talent may know what plays to the folks at home but
needs help overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, eager to try something new and enticed by the
prospect of international sales, go along with the process. As a
result, band leaders who have spent years or decades refining their
music can end up sounding like sidemen on their own albums.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Baba Maal, from Senegal, played a superb set at Irving
Plaza. He meshed circling, rippling guitar lines, derived from the
kora (harp-guitar) parts of griot songs but with the blunt drive of
rock. Some of his vocal melodies started on off-beats like
responses to instrumental lines and continued in long, curlicued
phrases, as they do in traditional griot songs.
</P>
<P>
   In other songs, the vocal began on the downbeat and stayed with
the short lines that are catchier to rock-trained ears.
</P>
<P>
   Maal was easily straddling two musical worlds; he has been on
the international circuit for a long time. But on his album ``Nomad
Soul,'' which will be released this summer, Maal's own hybrid is
sidelined. The opening track starts with an Irish woman's voice, as
if Maal and a kora have wandered into someone else's session. It
takes a few songs before Maal steps forward on his own, and the
album finally rights itself.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a purist complaint. Purism is no way to deal with
African music, which draws strength from syncretism: latching on to
outside ideas and hooking them up to African esthetics. Rumba,
jazz, gospel, funk, reggae and rock have all been repatriated
across the Atlantic to rejoin their African kin.
</P>
<P>
   African musician have also found useful ideas in country, Middle
Eastern music and nearly everything else they hear. The title tune
of Cheikh Lo's album, ``Ne La Thiass,'' neatly ties in to flamenco,
positing an Arabic musical pipeline from Spain via North Africa to
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   The album was produced by Youssou N'Dour, the Senegalese star
who's no stranger to international crossover _ he wrote the theme
song for this year's World Cup competition _ and who has built a
modern recording studio in Dakar so that African musicians can
record in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Other producers aren't so musically diplomatic. Simon Emmerson,
who produced the latest albums by both Maal and Ms. Mursal, bides
his time on Ms. Mursal's album ``The Journey,'' ingeniously placing
her remarkable voice amid African instruments, clever samples and
seething electronics until, halfway through the album, he decides
to indulge himself with a long synthetic stretch intended as a
Somalian soundscape.
</P>
<P>
   Angelique Kidjo from Benin, a previous Africa Fete headliner,
has just released her album ``Oremi,'' and her Paris-based
producers have Westernized her rhythms so thoroughly that only an
occasional hint of African intonation breaks through backup tracks
aiming for lite-rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fundamental difference between what African musicians
accomplish on stage and what they're aiming for in the studio.
Stage shows set out to get people moving and participating,
something a band can do by creating an irresistible groove; albums
want to sell themselves, and the most direct way to do that is to
get a song played on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   African bands that can groove all night long, while a crowd
keeps getting happier, don't have to concern themselves with pop
concision. But a big part of their producers' job is to hone songs
for radio programmers who want something with simple, catchy hooks
and choruses, and something that's not too different from the rest
of their play lists.
</P>
<P>
   (In Paris, where many French-speaking Africans record their
international albums, producers are also fixated on sappy ballads
and thin, perky synthesizer tones, reflecting French bad taste.)
Many African pop albums lead off with their most homogenized, least
characteristic song; radio programmers may not look any further.
But programmers won't give much African pop a chance anyway,
particularly if it's not in English, so most of those attempts at
crossover are futile.
</P>
<P>
   Crossover ambitions aren't necessarily doomed. With dance music
ascendant in the West, African bands might be better off selling
the magnificent intricacy of their grooves than trying to mimic
Western pop.
</P>
<P>
   Dance-music producers could be the ones who will find a true
bridge between African rock bands and the Western public. They will
have to fight their first impulses, which are to flatten the
cross-rhythms into a house-music thump or a reggae backbeat; their
true job will be to sharpen the friction between all the
cross-rhythmic layers of a good African groove, helping Western
ears hear all the subtleties and share the intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not going to happen immediately. In the meantime,
African music fans who want to take the music home have limited
choices. They can seek out an occasional live album, like King
Sunny Ade's ``Live Live Juju.'' (His new studio album, ``Odu,'' is
also true to the band's live sound.)
</P>
<P>
   They can also look for albums made in Africa, where lower
budgets favor straightforward live sessions. Or the next time
they're at an African concert, they can sneak in a tape recorder.

 &HT;    On Deck: Braves vs. Devil Rays
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV, radio: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (5-2, 3.77 ERA;
first appearance vs. Devil Rays) vs. RHP Julio Santana (2-1, 5.11;
first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Smoltz is making his 11th start and his third since his
second stint on the disabled list. His ERA, at 3.77, is as high as
it has been this season because of the pair of two-run homers he
gave up against Toronto in his last start. Despite that 6-4 loss,
Smoltz remains encouraged about the condition of his right elbow,
which needed rest for a week in late May. He threw a season-high
111 pitches against the Blue Jays with no discomfort and has not
lost his fastball, striking out 18 _ including 10 Blue Jays _ in
the 14 innings he has pitched since coming off the DL on June 20.
Santana, a Texas castoff, is making his fifth start but already has
shown why the Rangers sent him away. A converted shortstop, he
continues to have control problems (24 walks in 49 1/3 innings),
which make him more vulnerable when he pitches over the plate (52
hits allowed, including eight homers).

   Once the corn-covered Back Forty of metropolitan Kansas City,
this affluent area booming with new subdivisions and retail centers
has become the state's political quintessence, at least for
Republicans, producing far more votes than even Wichita. And it is
these newer, distant suburbs that are now a crucial battleground in
the Republican primary for governor, between the incumbent, Bill
Graves, a social moderate, and David Miller, former Republican
state chairman and the leader of Kansas' anti-abortion forces.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans nationally, the fight is the latest in the
party's long and bitter struggle to define its chief mission:
balancing budgets or saving souls.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who has cut taxes four times since taking office three
and a half years ago and presided over the kind of prosperous
economy seen across most of America in recent years, would scarcely
seem likely to face a challenge from his own ranks. He enjoys a 75
percent approval rating, according to one recent poll, and most
political analysts say he will be tough to beat come the day of the
primary, August 4.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, a former state legislator who stepped down as party
chairman to run for governor, believes that Graves' support for
abortion rights makes him vulnerable. And while early polls give
the governor a big lead, analysts caution against discounting
Miller, a former leader of the Christian Coalition who can draw on
the organizational strength of evangelical churches and
anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think that the most popular governor in memory
would be challenged by a leader of his own party,'' said Burdette
Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas,
who noted that Graves won 102 of 105 counties in 1994. ``But David
Miller is a very good politician. He's not in this unless he thinks
he can win. He can get out all the evangelicals to vote. It's all
going to hinge on turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, Loomis said, could well depend on voters in
suburban communities like Olathe. Disputing the notion that
prosperous suburbanites shun the appeals of religious
conservatives, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a lot of these affluent subdivisions _ $200,000
earth-tone houses with three-car garages _ and you'll find that
many of these young families are strong fundamentalists. It's not
like these people wear a big X on their forehead. They look like a
bunch of other well-off, mostly white people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Loomis said, religious conservatives in highest
proportions can be found in the newer suburbs, with their winding
roads into uniform subdivisions and their isolated cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   So commanding is the early lead of the 45-year-old Graves, a
native of Salina in rural central Kansas, that a poll published on
June 21 by The Wichita Eagle found two-thirds of the state's
Republican voters supporting him. But low turnout makes primary
elections difficult to predict, and surveys have sometimes
underestimated the strength of evangelical voters like Cathy
Kinsella, who runs a business with her husband, has five children
and, as a strong opponent of abortion, says she will be working
hard for Graves' defeat. That the governor has signed a bill
outlawing the late-term procedure that opponents call partial birth
abortion does not change Mrs. Kinsella's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has neglected people like me,'' she said as she pushed a
cart across the lot of an Olathe shopping mall on a wilting recent
afternoon. ``He's ignored the family, the Bible, the moral issues
that are the most important thing facing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 48-year-old insurance salesman from Eudora, just west
of Olathe, recently held a campaign rally near Wichita that
featured the endorsement of James Dobson, head of the conservative
Focus on the Family, which reaches 28 million people through its
radio and television broadcasts. Between prayers and patriotic
music, Dobson stood before a giant American flag and hailed Miller
as ``a man of courage, a man of conviction and a man of faith.'' He
criticized Graves, calling him ``not pro-life, not pro-family and
not conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dobson has campaigned for several social conservatives this
year and has not been uniformly successful. His horse in the race
for the Republican nomination for Nebraska governor, U.S. Rep. Jon
Christensen, finished a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kansas is perhaps the most conservative Midwestern state _
its entire six-member congressional delegation, including the
former track star Jim Ryun, comes from the right end of the
Republican spectrum _ but analysts say the rosy economy and the
personal appeal of Graves should translate into bipartisan support.
Tom Sawyer, minority leader of the Kansas House, looks like a
shoo-in for the Democratic nomination, and among the Democrats who
choose to vote in the Republican primary, the governor is expected
to find strong backing.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Democrats, Charlie Bitts, said that while no one
could ignore social problems like out-of-wedlock births and drug
addiction, he would vote his pocketbook: for Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is awfully good right now,'' said Bitts, 63, a
retired landscaper from rural southeast Kansas. ``Our morality in
this country certainly needs to be changed. I just don't think
politics is the place for it.''

KINGS EXPECT TO BE ACTIVE IN FREE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the National Hockey League draft behind him,
King general manager Dave Taylor is about to get even busier.
</P>
<P>
   July has dawned and the start of the 1998-99 season is three
months away, but the start of the free-agency season began when
June ended, and the Kings are expected to be active.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on them turning themselves into Stanley Cup
contenders this summer. But the Kings are expected to try to find a
defenseman who can run a power play that was at best mediocre last
season, and a forward who can play on one of the top two lines and
spark an offense that sometimes was potent and other times was
maddeningly inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' Taylor responded when asked if he expected
any signings right away. ``It's a funny market the last few years,
really crazy. We're willing to spend money, but at the same time,
we're not going to waste it. There are some players we're
interested in, but if it gets out of hand, we're just going to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the year before the Kings' scheduled move from the Forum
to the glitzy Staples Center, a year before team management's
target for a Stanley Cup contender.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings did raise ticket prices for 1998-98 by 11 percent
last month, and at the time of that announcement, team president
Tim Leiweke said one reason for the move was an expected 40-percent
increase in the Kings' payroll, which was approximately $24 million
last season.
</P>
<P>
   A hunk of that payroll increase will be eaten up by one of the
Kings' own restricted free agents, Norris Trophy-winning defenseman
Rob Blake, who will get a hefty raise on last season's team-high
$3.15 million salary. Blake was the sixth-highest paid NHL
defenseman, earning about $1.2 million less than top-paid Scott
Stevens of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Who might Taylor try to sign? He has repeatedly said he's not
interested in making offers to restricted free agents whose teams
invariably match the offer and drive up pay scales (as was the case
with $28-million man Sergei Fedorov, who didn't get his riches
until Carolina signed him, forcing Detroit to match).
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of some of the unrestricted free agents, by
position, with their teams, ages, last year's salaries, and their
statistics:
</P>
<P>
   Left wings:
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Courtnall (St. Louis, 36, $2.5 million, 31 goals, 31
assists, 62 points); Wendel Clark (Toronto, 32, $2.3 million,
12-7-19); Benoit Hogue (Dallas, 32, $1.25 million, 6-16-22).
Comment:
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Courtnall, the Kings' nemesis during last season's
playoffs against the Kings, join his brother at the Forum would be
like seeing President Clinton hire Kenneth Starr as his press
secretary. On the other hand, Courtnall's brother, Russ, already
plays for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Centers:
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gilmour (New Jersey, 35, $3.55 million, 13-40-53); Ron
Francis (Pittsburgh, 35, $1.9 million, 25-62-87); Guy Carbonneau
(Dallas, 38, $750,000, 7-17-24); Marc Bureau (Montreal, 32,
$475,000, 13-6-19). Comment:
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, then with Toronto, was as big a villain as Courtnall to
King fans in 1993. He's got a lot of miles on him and a hefty price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Right wings:
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull (St. Louis, 34, $4.7 million, 27-45-72); John MacLean
(San Jose, 34, $1.65 million, 13-19-32); Brian Noonan (Vancouver,
33, $900,000, 10-15-25). Comment:
</P>
<P>
   Most speculation has Hull leaving the Blues, possibly for father
Bobby's former team, the Chicago Blackhawks, or to join ex-King
Wayne Gretzky with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duchesne (St. Louis, 33, $2 million, 14-42-56); Uwe Krupp
(Nashville, 33, $1.5 million, 9-22-31); Gary Suter (Chicago, 34,
$1.6 million, 14-28-42); Jyrki Lumme (Vancouver, 32, $1.735
million, 9-21-30); Fredrik Olausson (Pittsburgh, 32, $700,000,
6-27-33). Comment:
</P>
<P>
   The return of popular ex-King Duchesne has been the hottest King
rumor for months, and he would add some juice to the power play.
Tamper-proof Taylor for months has sprinted away from anyone
mentioning Duchesne's name. The Mighty Ducks also have been rumored
to be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter (Nashville, 32, $3.9 million, 21-31-15, 2.66
goals-against average); Curtis Joseph (Edmonton, $2.3 million, 31,
29-31-9, 2.63); John Vanbiesbrouck (Florida, 35, $2.2 million,
18-29-11, 2.87); Arturs Irbe (Vancouver, 31, $775,000, 14-11-6,
2.73); Bob Essensa (Edmonton, 33, $300,000, 6-6-1, 2.55). Comment:
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are seeking organizational depth, not a No. 1 or No. 2
goalie, so if they are interested in any of these guys, it's not
the first three listed above.

NEW ANTI CRIME TACTIC WORKS IN PHOE NIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Alvin Moses is running out of new bullet holes
around his central Phoenix home, and he credits a new
crime-fighting approach by Phoenix police that targets bad places
as much as bad people.
</P>
<P>
   Life has become a lot more peaceful, he said, since officers
started focusing less on arresting individual thugs and more on
attacking the places from which they dealt drugs and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, these three bullet holes in my house, those in my fence
. . . all were done during a two- or three-year period, which ended
last summer,'' said Moses, 72, standing in front of his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police hit those apartments, the trouble pretty much
stopped,'' he said. ``And the shooting pretty much stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police agree so much that they're expanding their use of
a nationally recognized crime-fighting strategy that they credit
with helping reduce crime in Moses' and other troubled
neighborhoods by as much as one-third.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the ``broken windows'' approach, and many
law-enforcement experts call it the key to saving crime-ridden
neighborhoods and preserving those threatened with decline.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Phoenix police and other city agencies took tough
action against landlords who owned an apartment complex and a small
mobile home park _ both infamous for harboring criminals _ near
Moses' home.
</P>
<P>
   One landlord sold his property to a buyer who has evicted the
drug dealers. The mobile homes were removed from the other
location.
</P>
<P>
   The police are so happy with the success of the strategy that
they are expanding the program citywide. And police in Mesa, Tempe
and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office are studying the approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix City Council recently approved five more detectives
for full-time ``crime abatement'' duties, which include
investigating ``nuisance'' properties blighting neighborhoods with
slumlike or crime-ridden conditions.
</P>
<P>
   South Mountain Precinct Cmdr. Mike McCort and Lt. Suzy Parra
said that, in many crime-plagued neighborhoods, a few properties,
typically rundown rentals, are host to the majority of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is, you close down the places that are wrecking
neighborhoods, the places with broken windows, couches and old cars
out in front, with crime going on inside and out, and you cut down
on crime throughout the neighborhood,'' Parra said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``broken windows'' phrase comes from a celebrated 1982
magazine article in which criminologists George Kelling and James
Q. Wilson argued that allowing one broken window in a neighborhood
home to go unrepaired meant another would soon be broken. And
another. Then an old couch would appear on a corner, a slum
dwelling would eventually evolve and crime would surely follow.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the broken windows, eliminate the slum properties and crime
decreases, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the theory in the New York City Police Department
credit that city's dramatic drop in crime during the past five
years to the ``broken windows'' approach. In Phoenix, McCort and
Parra decided to develop a program that would target problem
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Police worked with neighbors to learn which properties were the
centers of trouble. The officers then worked with the properties'
landlords to stop the crime and clean up blight.
</P>
<P>
   If the landlord refused to cooperate, legal action would be
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concept we've proved works, with just one detective and
one officer doing it,'' Parra said. ``Now the idea is to have more
detectives and officers doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Arizona Legislature passed a law that makes
knowingly allowing criminal activity continue on one's property a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, Wallace Dossie, 60, was the first
person to plead guilty to ``failing to abate a crime'' at his West
Monroe Street property that Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
called a crack house.
</P>
<P>
   Police had long known that some properties seemed the center of
a neighborhood's problems, Parra said, but their response had been
saturation patrols, search warrants, ``zero tolerance'' programs
and other traditional policing methods.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts often simply displaced the problems, McCort
said. And when an individual criminal was identified and arrested,
the activity was not curbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a new approach,'' Parra said. ``We needed to break
the cycle of crime on the property itself.''

U.N. REPORT ACCUSES CONGOLESE SOLDIERS OF KILLING HUTU REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The human rights investigation team that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was forced to withdraw from the Congo
in April on Tuesday accused Congolese soldiers and their allies in
the Rwanda army of killing unarmed Hutu refugees in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report, admittedly incomplete because of the difficulties in
gathering evidence, did not estimate the total number of Hutus
killed, but cited individual massacres of up to 500 people. It
called for more investigations and a tribunal to try those
responsible for the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   It also concluded that the Congolese government of President
Laurent Kabila, which blocked the work of the rights team, ``has
shown no interest in fulfilling its obligation, under international
law, to investigate responsibility for serious violations of human
rights and grave breaches of humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators stopped short of calling the massacres genocide,
but said that if it can be proved that ``a decision was taken to
eliminate this part of the Hutu ethnic group as such,'' the
killings would amount to genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese and Rwandan governments immediately criticized the
report, calling it biased and inconclusive. The Congo's document, a
32-page rebuttal to the 52-page report, argued that the
investigators had created problems of their own and could not blame
the government for the failure of the mission or any lack of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo government was not alone in withholding cooperation,
investigators said. Daniel O'Donnell, an American human rights
lawyer who was on the team, said at a news conference on Tuesday
that several nations with satellite photography and intelligence
information at their disposal were asked for help in gathering
evidence and did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has close ties with the Rwanda
government, was among those who did not respond to requests for
assistance, said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights
Watch and a former member of the secretary general's team in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. never provided us with information,'' he said in an
interview on Tuesday. ``When I was a member of the team we asked
Ambassador David Scheffer for information. Later official requests
were made for satellite photos.'' Scheffer is the Clinton
administration's ambassador-at-Large for war crimes issues.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said it was his sense that the investigators ``were
played with a bit'' by Congolese officials who appeared to fear no
reprisals. ``There were a number of obstacles that were
deliberately placed in our path by the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We have clear evidence that government agents
intimidated the population in the sense of going out and warning
people not to talk to us, systematically interrogating people who
did talk to us and in some cases making direct threats to people
who they knew had given information to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Demonstrations were organized against us in various cities,
including the capital,'' he said. ``In some case we have direct
evidence of government involvement in what they referred to as
spontaneous demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The team met the most serious protests in Mbandaka, a town in
western Congo where refugees had fled to escape pursuers from the
east. Brody of Human Rights Watch was one of those threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had interviewed priests who were eyewitnesses to the
massacre of innocent civilians in Mbandaka,'' he said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the government was always trying to keep us away
from Mbandaka is that most of the other incidents occurred far
away, out in the middle of the jungle,'' Brody said. ``The only
witnesses were the refugees themselves, who then scattered to the
four winds. In Mbandaka you had Rwandese and Congolese troops
massacring people in front of the populace. There are hundreds of
potential eyewitnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congo investigation was ill-fated from its inception more
than a year ago, when the U.N. Human Rights Commission asked its
special monitor for what was then Zaire, Roberto Garreton of Chile,
to look into charges that massacres had taken place during Kabila's
military advance late in 1996 on the government of the late Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels loyal to Kabila and the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army
emptied refugee camps in eastern Zaire populated largely by Hutus
and were accused of scattering and killing many of them. About
600,000 refugees were driven back into Rwanda, while others fled
deeper into Zaire. The United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees estimates that 180,000 people are still missing from a
refugee population around 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its rebuttal statement on Tuesday, the Tutsi-led Rwanda
government said that the civilian refugees were being held hostage
by Hutu militias and that it was ``the duty of the government of
Rwanda to rescue its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda condemned the investigators for taking testimony from
Hutu who fled Rwandan troops to neighboring countries, saying that
these Hutu led the 1994 genocide that left hundreds of thousands of
Rwandan Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda now admits that its troops were taking part in operations
in Congo but denies that soldiers committed human rights
violations. Witnesses have told the investigators that Rwanda army
troops took direct part in massacres, and that Hutu extremists were
not singled out as victims.
</P>
<P>
   After Kabila's forces captured the Zairean capital of Kinshasa
in May, 1997, the new president indicated that he would not allow
the U.N. investigation to continue under Garreton. In July,
Secretary General Annan _ to the consternation of human rights
groups _ decided to send a new team and slightly alter the scope of
its investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Months passed before it was able to begin work in the Congo.
Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative to the United Nations,
went to Kinshasa in October 1997 and extracted a promise from
Kabila to let the team in. Tuesday's report says that promise was a
sham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo had no
intention of accepting the mission of the Secretary General's
investigative team and the government merely made a show of
willingness to cooperate,'' the report says. Six months later, with
little of its field work completed, the team was withdrawn.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Woon Oh was waiting for answers Tuesday that might
explain his son's death. For Oh, the question was unfathomable. How
could a day care center owner forget a little boy in a van, lock
him inside, and leave him to die from the heat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened exactly,'' Oh said. ``I just can't
believe it. Probably she had something to do, but that still
doesn't explain it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Oh, 3, died Monday evening, about an hour after a worker
at his day care center found him unconscious on the back seat of
the van. For 2 1/2 hours, the little boy was alone in the van,
parked on the black asphalt of a church parking lot on a blistering
afternoon where temperatures reached 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's father wasn't the only one with questions. Tuesday
evening, Gwinnett County, Ga. police were still trying to arrange
an interview with Eun Shin Cho, owner of the Kids and Kids Academy
and the woman who they said left Samuel alone. And state regulators
and confused parents who showed up all day at the closed day care
center also had to wait for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Police tried to question Cho, 41, Monday night, but she was too
distraught to talk to them and had to be brought to the hospital.
She was released later that night.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives want to find out whether she ever knew that Samuel
was in the 15-seat van. She may have forgotten to drop the boy at
home, or Samuel may have climbed into the van without her knowing,
said Sgt. Jeff Sligar.
</P>
<P>
   Woon Oh, however, believes his son was supposed to be on that
van, because he is usually dropped off at home between 1:30 and 2
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't expect to charge Cho _ who also goes by her maiden
name, Suh _ but they will hand over their completed investigation
to District Attorney Danny Porter, who will decide whether to seek
an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know so little about the case, but there is potential here
as far as charges go,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, administrators in the office that regulates Georgia's
1,410 day care centers said Tuesday that there have been complaints
lodged against Kids and Kids Academy since the facility began
operating under a temporary license two months ago. But Marty
Rotter, director of the Office of Regulatory Services, declined to
reveal the nature of the complaints until after his office has
gathered more facts.
</P>
<P>
   The center _ known as Sae Sak Education Center until March _ was
closed Tuesday, and state regulators were unable to gather any
information about those complaints or Samuel's death, Rotter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some time to look at this whole thing and see what
we've got,'' Rotter said. ``It's a tragic situation but how it
relates to (what's contained in the) rules and regulations, I can't
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho left the van in the parking lot of the nearby Korean First
Presbyterian Church around 2:30 p.m. She borrowed the van from the
church because the center's own vehicle was having mechanical
problems. No one noticed that Samuel was missing until 4:30, when
his mother, Kim Choon, called to ask why her son wasn't home,
Sligar said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids and Kids employee Lisa Chang searched the center, then ran
across Lawrenceville Highway to the churchto look inside the van.
When she saw Samuel unconscious on the seat, Chang shattered one of
the van's windows with a brick and carried the little boy inside
the church to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics covered Samuel with ice packs to cool him down, but
it was too late. He was pronounced dead at Northlake Regional
Medical Center, from heart failure brought on by heat exhaustion,
Sligar said.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral was set for 4 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   His death stunned metro Atlanta's close-knit Korean-American
community, much of which is clustered in northern DeKalb and
southern Gwinnett counties. Friends of the Ohs stopped by their
apartment Tuesday, joining them for a traditional midday meal.
Reporters from the Korean Southeast News and local affiliate of the
Korean American TV Broadcasting Corp. joined the English-language
news crews on the parking lot outside Kids and Kids. Particularly
affected were congregants at Korean First Presbyterian, where both
Cho and the Ohs were members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is in a state of shock,'' said church spokesman
Warren Sams. ``They're trying to consolidate their efforts to find
out what's going on and console the family.''

NEW PEPSI DRINK TO USE NEWLY APPROVED SWEETENER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of an
artificial sweetener known as Ace-K in soft drinks on Tuesday.
About an hour later, Pepsico Inc. announced it would be rolling out
a new diet cola nationwide by October that will use both Ace-K and
aspartame, known to consumers as Nutrasweet or Equal.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of Ace-K, marketed by Hoechst AG as Sunett and
officially known as acesulfame potassium, had been eagerly awaited
for almost two years. The product, which gives diet soft drinks a
longer shelf life, is already used in baked goods, chewing gum and
other food products in the United States, and is a common
ingredient in diet beverages sold across Europe and Asia. In May,
the FDA approved another artificial sweetener, sucralose, for use
in beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have predicted that Ace-K's approval for soft
drinks would have a major impact on the $55 billion U.S. carbonated
soft-drink industry, and Pepsi's announcement of its new drink,
Pepsi One, seemed to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innovation is good,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``I'm glad to see that they are
focusing innovation on major categories, and not dilly-dallying in
sectors that don't have significant volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Diet soda sales have been slowing steadily over the last several
years, with market share declining from 30 percent in 1990 to just
23 percent last year, said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage
Digest, an industry newspaper. ``There are a thousand theories on
that,'' he said, including the ascendence of alternatives like
bottled water and fruit-based drinks. ``Certainly one reason is
that there has not been much news in the diet soft drink
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of Pepsico closed down 6.25 cents, to $41.1875.
Coca-Cola shares fell 50 cents, to $85.50.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Coca-Cola Co. would introduce a similar diet
product was not clear Tuesday. Last week, Coke's chairman and chief
executive, M. Douglas Ivester, told reporters that the company had
``no plans to change the formulation'' of Diet Coke, which it
rolled out in 1982. ``We know Ace-K, we understand it, and we have
supply relationships around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a spokeswoman more or less reiterated that, saying,
``We have no immediate plans.'' She added: ``It's nice to have
choices.'' Diet Coke's market share last year was 8.5 percent, down
from 8.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several analysts said Tuesday that Coke probably would
come up with a similar product before long. ``If Pepsi One is a
success, then you can expect Coke Light,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
beverage analyst with Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Diet Pepsi, which was introduced in 1964 and has been
reformulated several times since, had a 5.5 percent market share
last year, according to Beverage Digest data. That share had also
declined, from 5.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the name Pepsi One, they are clearly hedging themselves
by not giving up the name Diet Pepsi,'' noted Martin Romm, managing
director and a beverage analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pepsi executives hope that Pepsi One will enjoy a
coexistence with Diet Pepsi, as has happened in Britain. Pepsi Max,
a diet drink very similar to Pepsi One, has a 2.4 percent market
share there, while Diet Pepsi has a 3.2 share, and both are among
the 10 best-selling soft drinks in that market, Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged with a silver-colored label, Pepsi One was named for
its single calorie. Any double-entendre that might refer to the
outcome of the cola war was purely coincidental, a Pepsi spokesman
insisted.

ARGENTINA DEFEATS ENGLAND, 4-3, ON PENALTY KICKS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAINT ETIENNE, France _ It began as a game tense with history
and the possibility of violence and ended as the longest and most
compelling match of the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   From sly nastiness to cramping desperation, Argentina and
England played on valiantly Tuesday night through regulation,
through two 15-minute overtime periods, and extended their
second-round match as far as it could go with the score tied at 2-2
_ to the breathless drama of penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   British fans were singing the tune from ``The Great Escape,''
and for long stretches it appeared that England might somehow
prevail despite playing with only 10 men for the final 73 minutes.
Michael Owen was the youngest player on the field at age 18, but he
was also the most dominant, scoring a goal for England with his
brilliant speed and drawing a penalty that produced the other.
</P>
<P>
   But England has grown accustomed to heartbreakingly premature
exits. It had the potential winning goal disallowed in the 81st
minute because of a wickedly thrown elbow. And as this World Cup
advanced to penalty kicks for the first time, Britain again
succumbed, 4-3, just as it had lost on penalty kicks to Germany
both at the 1990 World Cup and at the 1996 European championships.
</P>
<P>
   The end Tuesday night came on the fifth round of penalty kicks
when midfielder David Batty telegraphed his attempt to slot the
ball inside the left post. Carlos Roa, the Argentine goalkeeper who
had not previously allowed a goal in the tournament, dived
confidently to his right and stopped Batty's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted and exhilarated, Argentine players began removing
their jerseys and windmilling them in their arms as they raced
downfield. Some tried to climb the fences that separated them from
their delirious fans. Argentina now advances to meet the
Netherlands in the quarterfinals on Saturday in Marseilles, while
England must again contemplate another devastatingly early
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a jinx,'' said assistant coach Raymond
Clemence. ``But we know what the rules are.''
</P>
<P>
   After the failed penalty kick, fighting broke out at the other
end of the field where English and Argentine fans sat in uneasy
proximity, but the disturbance appeared to be quickly contained.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to contain another outbreak of hooliganism, some
1,500 policemen were placed on duty in this industrial town in the
Loire Valley and the match was not shown on giant television
screens in the town squares. However, local bars did serve alcohol
until 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By that hour, the game was just edging into the tautness of
overtime. Players on both sides knew that this game might mean
everything in soccer terms. England prevailed over Argentina 1-0 in
the 1966 quarterfinals and went on to win the World Cup. Argentina
won 2-1 in the 1986 quarterfinals en route to a World Cup title as
Diego Maradona scored the famous handball goal known as ``The Hand
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's outcome was largely decided, not on the Hand of
God, but on the foot of English midfielder David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes after halftime, with the score tied at 2-2, Beckham
was shoved down from behind by Argentina's Diego Simeone. Still
lying on the ground, in full view of the Danish referee Kim
Nielsen, Beckham kicked Simeone in the back of the right leg,
drawing a red card and an immediate ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely distraught,'' said the English coach, Glenn
Hoddle. ``The sending off cost us the match. I'm not afraid to say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The kick was not vicious, but Nielsen had signaled in the first
10 minutes that he would tolerate no untoward play. Twice he
awarded penalty kicks on plays that arguably did not deserve
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In the 6th minute, England goalie David Seaman, rolled into
Simeone in the penalty area and Gabriel Batistuta converted the
penalty kick for his fifth goal of this World Cup and ninth
overall, one more than Maradona. Batistuta dedicated the goal to
his day-old son, Joaquin, and performed a rock-the-cradle dance in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, Owen went sprawling in the penalty area
after a slight collision with Roberto Ayala, but Nielsen awarded
another penalty kick. Alan Shearer converted for England and tied
the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   With Beckham gone, England was forced to constrict its defense
and play for penalty kicks or a counterattack by Owen. In the 16th
minute, the teenager had shredded the Argentine defense, taking a
pass with his right foot near midfield, running past the jostling
Jose Chamot, feinting to his left, moving to his right around Ayala
and slamming the ball back to his left into the net. It was a
breathtaking goal, but with 10 men, England reduced its risk-taking
and Owen's chances became limited.
</P>
<P>
   Still, England nearly won. Nine minutes from the end of
regulation, defender Sol Campbell headed in a corner kick, but the
goal was disallowed after Shearer clearly threw an elbow at Roa,
the Argentine goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Passarella, the Argentine coach, substituted for both
Batistuta and his other forward, Claudio Lopez, in the second half,
and went for the kill but Argentina stubbornly kept trying to
attack the middle of the English defense instead of exploiting the
flanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why we didn't score,'' Passarella said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina had tied the game cleverly at 2-2 only seconds from
halftime on a free kick. Batistuta stepped over the ball as a
decoy, midfielder Juan Veron pushed the ball around the defensive
wall and Javier Zanetti stunned England with a left-footed blast
into the net. But no additional goals were forthcoming until the
penalty-kick phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``With England on the defensive, the match didn't seem
winnable,'' Veron said. ``But our never-ending battle was finally
rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   And England was again sent home achingly early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' said forward Teddy Sheringham. ``We
played our hearts out. It's hard to believe we're done.''

IN FIRST FEW DAYS, WINDOWS 98 SELLING AS WELL AS WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and a puny
marketing budget compared with its relentlessly promoted
predecessor, Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a
legal cloud, as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust
suit against the Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, it seems, at least not in the first few days. Windows
98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it
went on sale, even slightly faster, according to PC Data, a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four days of sales, from last Thursday through
Sunday, retailers sold 530,000 copies of Windows 98, PC Data
reported Tuesday, based on daily sales reports from 20 chains with
6,000 stores. In its first four days on the market three years ago,
Windows 95 sold 510,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had sought to deflate expectations for Windows 98,
positioning the new operating system as a ``tune-up'' to its
predecessor instead of a ground-breaking new product. With the
low-key introduction, most analysts had expected Windows 98 sales
to build more gradually than was the case with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was wrong in saying there was no pent-up demand for
Windows 98,'' said Ann Stephens, president of PC Data in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the early results, analysts say, do not necessarily indicate
how well Windows 98 will do in the long run. The first few days of
retail sales tend to be to computer enthusiasts, who are but one
slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys who regard putting a new operating system
on their personal computer as a form of entertainment,'' said Chris
LeTocq, an analyst at Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of these computer enthusiasts has increased
sharply in the last few years as more and more people use
computers. By the end of this year, the number of personal
computers in use running some version of Microsoft's Windows
operating systems will be 376 million, Dataquest estimates. At the
end of 1995, the number of machines using Windows was 153 million,
according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   With more people using Windows machines, the potential market of
those who might spend $89 to upgrade to Windows 98 is far greater
than when Windows 95 was introduced _ making the initial sales of
Windows 98 somewhat less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 90 percent of all shipments of PC operating
systems come already installed in new machines instead of as
retail, shrink-wrap programs for upgrading an existing operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, estimates that Windows 98 will generate revenues for
Microsoft of $3.2 billion in its first 12 months from sales to both
computer makers and retail customers.

BALTIMORE, WASHINGTON TEAM UP IN BID TO WIN 2012 OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ Arlington, Texas' bid for the 2012 Olympics
picked up some tough competition Tuesday as Baltimore, Md., and
Washington, D.C., joined forces in a united campaign to win the
international games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington and Baltimore have come together to form the
strongest bid of any area in the United States of America,''
Washington Mayor Marion Barry said in announcing the regional
alliance. ``We're going to be hosting those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke joined business leaders
from both cities at a news conference in Annapolis, midway between
the two urban centers. The governors of Maryland and Virginia also
endorsed the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The strong cooperation between Washington and Baltimore, two
traditional rivals, contrasts with Arlington's efforts to bring
Fort Worth and Dallas into their Olympic campaign. Dallas, in
particular, has been lukewarm to the idea of a regional bid.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington submitted its preliminary plan to the U.S. Olympic
Committee Tuesday but declined to make the details public. Nine
cities, including Houston, are vying to host the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those cities released details Tuesday, including the
names of athletes and celebrities who will serve on their Olympic
bid committees. Houston, for example, has track star Carl Lewis and
other Olympic athletes on its roster. Cincinnati has former
astronaut Neil Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Luce, spokesman for the Arlington effort, said Arlington
won't release the names of its bid committee because the USOC asked
it not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to prove that they are a serious
contender,'' he said. ``We already are.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are trumpeting who they have on their committee to raise
corporate support, but Arlington doesn't need to do that to gain
support, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moran, a spokesman with the USOC, said U.S. bid cities can
release whatever information they want.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Schwieters, a leader of Washington's effort,
said officials in the nation's capital tried to learn from
Arlington's experience in putting together a regional campaign.
Washington and Baltimore had initially planned to compete for the
games, but joined forces after a series of talks between business
leaders and the two mayors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're going through, we were going through,''
Schwieters said of Arlington's effort. ``Let's hope they can solve
their problems. I don't mind tough competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee is expected to select the U.S.
candidate in 2002. The International Olympic Committee will make
the final selection in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Schwieters said he considers Seattle and New York the toughest
competition for the Washington area. Baltimore-Washington boosters
said their bid will be strengthened by the availability of 100,000
hotel rooms, three major airports and the tourist attractions of
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke said the issues that had to be resolved for the joint
effort included which city would get top billing. Washington won.

GM WORKERS EXPECTED A MUCH BETTER VACATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ The way Ryan Garland sees it, the two strikes
here that have shut down the General Motors Corp. and put his
father out of work are a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Before tensions erupted and 9,200 workers walked off their jobs,
the 10-year-old boy mostly fantasized about spending uninterrupted
days with his father, Dean. But now they are inseparable, their
twin smiles so bright that the two often seem out of place among
the throngs of more serious-looking strikers picketing outside the
sprawling stamping factory where the walkout began on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything together,'' Ryan said while holding a
picket sign and counting down the minutes before he and his dad
head to a local park. Their days are filled with water-skiing, boat
rides and intense father-son basketball games. ``We didn't have a
lot before. My dad was always working or sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his son, Garland talks quietly about his days with Ryan,
low enough to avoid stares from other strikers. After all, this was
supposed to have been the first week of a paid company-wide
two-week shutdown, a time that most GM workers set aside for family
outings and vacations. Now, only the company's salaried workers
will be paid for the time off.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes have already idled virtually all of GM's hourly
employees _ 162,700 as of Tuesday. Twenty-six of the automaker's 29
North American assembly factories are closed. GM said on Tuesday
that the strikes would cost the company $1.18 billion after taxes
in the second quarter. Most of that resulted from a loss of $890
million at GM's North American operations, the company said.
Delphi, GM's large auto parts subsidiary, lost $290 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad saying this, but I'm enjoying myself. It's like a
vacation,'' Garland, 45, said. ``I owe my son this time. We could
stay off the rest of the year and it still wouldn't be enough to
make up for what I've given GM and that plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland is married to a corporate lawyer and is not yet worried
about family finances, but many strikers say they are having
trouble making ends meet on the weekly strike pay provided by the
United Automobile Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On $150 a week with four kids to feed, your priorities get
focused real quickly,'' said June Cone, 40, a groundskeeper at the
second GM plant on strike in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than traveling to amusement parks as she had planned, Ms.
Cone, a single mother, said her family was spending the two-week
shutdown scouring their neighborhood for odd jobs. Her children
have found work mowing lawns, and she has helped a couple of
neighbors paint their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be careful how far I drive because I really can't
afford to waste money on gas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few bits of good news have emerged this week. GM backed off
its plan to cancel health care benefits for those workers idled by
the strikes. And the top national negotiators for GM and the UAW
have resumed talks for the first time since picket signs went up.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that has washed away workers' anger, or their fears
that the strikes will stretch into late summer and be followed
later this year by yet another crippling dispute at two parts
plants in Dayton, Ohio. Workers there, who staged a 17-day strike
in 1996, were scheduled to take a strike vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get this big or this bad,'' Robert
Harbin, 59, said. By now, he had planned to be in a rickety canoe,
floating on a river in northern Michigan. Instead, Harbin sat in a
lawn chair on the side of a dusty road, waving a picket sign and
talking about what might have been if not for the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time I've put in this year, it's hard to think that I
probably won't have a vacation,'' Harbin said, flipping the pages
of a recent issue of Backpacker magazine. Thirty-seven years of
working with loud press machines have left him not only dependent
on two hearing aids, but a big fan of quiet outdoor vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers are required to staff the picket line for only two
hours once a week, but Harbin said he did not feel comfortable
straying home the rest of the time because he was not sure how long
his ``strike savings'' would have to last. And even if he could
afford a trip, Harbin said, it would probably not alleviate the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on strike, your whole mind is on strike. You can't
just put it away and go play,'' he said. ``It'll end one day, but
nobody is going to win. We're all losing things we can't get
back.''

 &HT;    Two more cases tied to water park
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna and Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two more children have been added to the tally of
cases in the White Water E. coli outbreak, bringing the total
number of cases associated with the water park to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Division of Public Health on Tuesday confirmed
infection with E. coli O157:H7, the potentially life-threatening
strain of a common bacteria, in one child from Bartow County, Ga.
and one from Cobb County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases were known to authorities last week, but test results
confirming the infection as O157 took until Tuesday, said DPH
spokeswoman Joyce Goldberg. Neither has been hospitalized. Both are
believed to have been infected at White Water on June 11, the first
day on which the infection was spread.
</P>
<P>
   No new cases have surfaced from the additional days on which the
infection is believed to have been transmitted, June 12 and 17, and
none have appeared for June 13-16, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The count of the outbreak so far stands at 19 children in all:
12 in Georgia and seven in five other states (Alabama, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Arizona and Illinois). All have been confirmed by
laboratory tests as suffering from O157 infection, and five of the
cases in Georgia have been proved by genetic fingerprinting to be
caused by an identical strain.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests on the rest _ being performed by DPH and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention _ are expected to yield
results by the end of the week. The CDC has not officially joined
the investigation, but continues to consult with the state twice
daily and is also talking to health authorities in other states,
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The theoretical cause of the outbreak is still believed to be an
infected child, or several children, who contaminated a White Water
kiddie pool on at least three days. But as the outbreak goes on,
both parents and infectious-disease experts outside the
investigation are questioning that hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it highly unlikely that the same sick child is coming
back and contaminating the wading pool day after day,'' said Randy
Addison, father of the 3-year-old Kentucky victim Matthew Addison,
who is hospitalized in Louisville with hemolytic uremic syndrome
and has been on dialysis since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Addison family is being assisted by Dr. Marguerite Neill,
whose husband is a relative of Matthew Addison's mother, Lisbeth.
An associate professor at Brown University School of Medicine and a
former investigating officer with the CDC, Neill has studied O157
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   White Water officials have contended that chlorination in the
park's pools eliminated most of the pathogen, even though records
show chlorination in the kiddie pools dipped well below standards
on several days of the outbreak. But even if chlorination were
adequate, unsuspected faults in the system _ a buildup of mineral
buildup in a pipe, for instance, or a blind pipe in which water can
eddy instead of rushing through _ might blunt the chemical's
impact, Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have, for example, legionella (the bacterial cause of
Legionnaires' disease) that contaminates a plumbing system in a
building, you might chlorinate the water, but the flow of water
through the pipes may be unequal, and so diffusion of the chlorine
into them may be limited,'' she said. ``Or if you have legionella
hiding in plaque or scale _ or in plankton or algae in an outdoor
pool _ they can act as sponges that soak up free chlorine so that
it doesn't actually reach the bacteria at the molecular level.''
</P>
<P>
   And O157 may have additional tricks up its sleeve. Research
shows it has the ability to escape detection in standardized
testing of water, said Rita Colwell, a University of Maryland
micro- biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bacteria don't die. They go into a shutdown or dormant
state,'' Colwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory testing proved this, using a water sample tainted
with trace amounts of E. coli and looking for it under two testing
methods. While it did not show up using a culture _ the test
normally done to isolate a bug in a person's blood or stool or from
contaminated water or ground beef _ the strain did appear in the
same water sample using genetic testing. Even minuscule amounts of
E. coli bacteria can cause infection.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not mean E. coli is thriving in adequately treated
pool water, waiting to pounce and sicken thousands, though in
theory it could survive in small amounts and infect a child,
Colwell said.
</P>
<P>
   It does suggest that an outbreak such as at White Water can
occur if a variety of circumstances converge: A pool with low
levels of chlorine crowded with very young children, one of whom
had already contracted E. coli O157 and unknowingly exposed other
children to it. The only other known transmission of E. coli in a
pool was in South Georgia in 1996, when 11 children were infected.
</P>
<P>
   And investigators must be careful to look beyond surface
results, added Dr. Glyn Caldwell, the Kentucky state epidemiologist
tracking the Addison case. Not long ago he investigated a similar
swimming pool outbreak, of viruses that infected a swim team even
though their pool's chlorine levels were adequate. It turned out,
he said, that the pool's chlorinating equipment was broken; instead
of metering pool chemicals through the equipment, employees added
them to the water once a day by hand. Tests done in the morning
read within legal limits; but by evening, when the team swam, the
chemicals were almost gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wind up with pieces that don't fit the pattern,'' he
said, ``you have to ask whether they're part of what you're looking
at _ or whether there are other sources that you need to test.''

 &HT;    Pepsi rushes out new one-calorie cola on day artificial
sweetener is approved
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's called acesulfame potassium, and Pepsi-Cola Co.
is hoping the calorie-free sweetener will be its ace in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the
sweetener, also known as Ace-K, for use in soft drinks and other
liquid beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola greeted the news by rush-delivering 20-ounce bottles
of Pepsi One, a new Ace-K and aspartame-sweetened cola, to bottlers
and others in the soft drink industry. The company says a massive
national rollout of the one-calorie beverage will follow in 12 to
15 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that with Pepsi One, we have the opportunity
to re-energize the refreshment beverage category and reinforce
Pepsi's role as the industry's leading innovator,'' Philip A.
Marineau, president and chief executive officer of Pepsi-Cola North
America, said in a letter to bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Diet Pepsi will remain on the market ``because we believe that a
two-product strategy provides the best opportunity to make a
significant change in our long-term competitive position,'' said
Marineau, whose company trails Coca-Cola by 13 market share
percentage points in the United States and nearly 30 points
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said it has no immediate plans to
use the sweetener in the United States, despite Pepsi-Cola's
announcement. Coca-Cola began using Ace-K in Europe in 1991, and
now uses it in more than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   'Another option' for Coke
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of experience with Ace-K,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester said recently during an investors
meeting. ``We know it. We understand it. We have supply
relationships with those people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be ``a fairly simple thing'' to add Ace-K to
Coca-Cola's mix of sweeteners used in the United States, but called
it ``just another sweetener option.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited FDA approval is being hailed as a way to shore
up sagging diet soda sales in the United States, where the April
approval of sucralose was the first soft drink sweetener innovation
since aspartame was approved in 1981. Almost all U.S. diet soft
drinks use aspartame, which is sold under the brand name
Nutrasweet, though Triarc Co.'s Royal Crown Cola has now switched
to Splenda, the brand name for sucralose.
</P>
<P>
   Other soft drink companies haven't reformulated or introduced
brands using sucralose, analysts said, because it was assumed the
FDA would soon give its blessing to Ace-K.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like they were ready,'' Caroline Levy, a
beverage analyst with Schroder Wertheim, said regarding Pepsi One's
splash into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsi is looking very eagerly for a way to have an edge on
Coke because they're being beaten so handily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke will see how Pepsi does with it, and if consumers like
it, they'll do it, too,'' said Levy, who thinks the company might
be a little nervous about tinkering with its Diet Coke formula.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1988
</P>
<P>
   Ace-K, made by the Hoechst subsidiary Nutrinova and sold under
the brand name Sunett, was introduced in the United States in 1988,
when the FDA said it could be used in table-top sweeteners, chewing
gum and dry mixes for beverages, desserts and dairy products. It's
200 times sweeter than sugar, and is said to not have the
aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, in soft drinks, Ace-K is blended with other
sweeteners, such as aspartame. The resulting blend has a longer
shelf life than other sweeteners, and could shave a few pennies per
case off the price of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diet segment has long needed a healthy dose of news and
excitement, and I think this has the potential for reinvigorating
it,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. ``I'm sure
Coke is going to take a long, hard look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bellas, chairman and chief executive of Beverage
Marketing Corp., said soft drinks sweetened with Ace-K blends
compare more closely with sugar-sweetened drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the less than 100 percent sugar-sweetened category
will get a huge shot in the arm,'' Bellas said. ``It's not going to
set things on fire, though. It may take share away from the
existing diets or the existing colas. You have a much tougher
competitive environment.''

BUSINESS OWN ERS NEED ADVI SORY BOARD THAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Margaret Cook runs ION Inc. with her husband, Leroy,
but felt she needed her own circle of business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have an area of business that I could bounce ideas
off of from my point of view,'' said Cook, secretary/treasurer of
the Tempe-based company whose Investigators Anywhere Resource Line
is a referral service for private investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Lynwood Thomas, president of Pioneer Equipment Co. in Phoenix,
wanted to avoid that locked-in-the-office mentality and talk more
often with his peers in management about general business issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the mode of day-to-day working, that is when you
can make serious mistakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, Thomas and scores of other Phoenix-area entrepreneurs have
discovered that, contrary to popular belief, it need not be lonely
at the top. Having built successful businesses and wanting to do
more, they turn to round tables and other groups of outside
advisers to help them better manage their companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of us can say brilliance and success have solved our
problems? A whole new set comes up,'' Cleveland consultant Donald
Jonovic said at a meeting last month of the Family Enterprise
Institute's Greater Phoenix chapter.
</P>
<P>
   And as Valley of the Sun companies grow, so does the popularity
of advisory groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People recognize that the challenges are different, and it
doesn't hurt to be sitting across the table from each other,'' said
Tom Hartzler, whose accounting firm, Eide Bailly, recently set up
round tables for controllers of its client companies.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also are realizing that they need more than the
entrepreneur at different stages of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lift ourselves up by the bootstraps only so high,''
Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond-the-bootstraps advisory groups can assume a variety of
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Thomas are among the entrepreneurs who have turned to
presidents' round tables, collegial groups of their peers who
gather monthly to hear speakers or exchange ideas. Others use more
structured, and more expensive, coach-led groups like The Executive
Committee for Emerging Entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   An even more serious step is to set up an advisory board,
possibly including the company's lawyer and accountant, that meets
regularly to review the good and bad aspects of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Round tables are regular meetings of nine to 20 top executives,
typically chief executive officers or owners of small businesses,
chief financial officers or controllers, or local managers for
bigger businesses. Membership cuts across industries, ensuring
diversity and reducing any competitive worries. Some are targeted
at specific entrepreneurial groups, such as Cook's round table for
women in business, or at family-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Groups might hear an employment law specialist one month and
discuss a member's new marketing idea the next. Because the groups
are small, entrepreneurs can talk about tailoring solutions to
their businesses, said Georgann Crosby of the Family Business
Roundtable Inc. consulting firm and facilitator for a Phoenix
Chamber of Commerce round table.
</P>
<P>
   Round tables are best suited for entrepreneurs whose businesses
are big enough to face employment and management issues but haven't
grown to the point where professional management takes over, said
Brad Routh, chief financial officer of Edson Electric Supply in
Phoenix and facilitator for another Phoenix Chamber round table.
</P>
<P>
   Round-table members must be open to new information and other
people's perspectives, Crosby and Routh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear different ones, and sometimes a light goes on, or
you're encouraged to confront inertia,'' Routh said.
</P>
<P>
   Round tables aren't intended to be a networking opportunity or a
substitute for outside boards, Routh cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about things people want to bring to the table. Things
are shared in confidence, but that's different from sharing your
financials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More structured groups, like The Executive Committee for
Emerging Entrepreneurs, focus on personal effectiveness. Groups
bring in speakers, share expertise with each other and meet
one-on-one with the business executive chairing the group.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Denning, who heads two Valley groups for the San
Diego-based organization, said entrepreneurs usually turn to his
group for help coping with growth or decline in their companies.
Usually lacking a business-school background, they are concerned
about making decisions properly, anticipating change and being held
accountable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spouses, attorneys or accountants frequently bring their own
agenda to discussion of a problem, Denning said, but in his groups
the relationship is between fellow CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a commitment to share and participate on both
sides,'' Denning said. ``People are paying for the combined
intellectual capacity of the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary from group to group. For example, round-table
memberships at the Phoenix Chamber cost $150 a year plus basic
dues, and Emerging Entrepreneurs memberships cost $5,400 a year
with a $400 one-time enrollment fee.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to round tables and executive groups, advisory
boards are put together by a particular small business and focus on
it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic, a strong supporter of advisory boards, admits that just
a small percentage of small businesses have boards with five or
more outside advisers. The main reasons, he believes, are that some
entrepreneurs don't fully trust outsiders and are worried about
losing control of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies also aren't ready for advisory boards, he said. A
company might not have formalized ownership agreements or have
installed the proper accounting procedures for tracking progress.
Or owners might not have agreed on their goals and personal reasons
for being in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders have to come to these answers,'' he said. ``A
board can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But once those issues are settled, an advisory board can provide
strategic oversight for a business and be a prelude to actually
having an outside board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory role is often a new one for traditional advisers
such as attorneys and financial planners, Jonovic said. Pulling
them together into quarterly board meetings provides mutual
education about the company and controls conflict of interest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooks had an advisory board for two years until key members
moved away, Margaret Cook said. They are thinking of reinstituting
it because it helped give them new ideas, track the business'
progress and held them responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs get so many new ideas all the time. It helps
them get focused,'' she said of an advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever form an advisory board takes, entrepreneurs say they
value the sharing of ideas and the camaraderie they get from
connecting with peers outside their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people willing to share their experience, and
all you have to do is ask,'' Margaret Cook said.

 &HT;    More stolen Ford jewels found
 &HT;    By Val Ellicott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Investigators have found still more gems
hidden inside the home of a man who has admitted peddling jewels
stolen from Palm Beach heiress Kathleen Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and Palm Beach detectives recently found diamond
tennis bracelets and 131 strands of pearls stuffed inside an air
conditioning duct at Barry Marshall's home in Stuart, according to
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The find, made sometime in the last month, marks at least the
second time agents have discovered a hidden cache of jewels inside
Marshall's home. In January, Marshall's wife directed federal
agents to a hidden compartment under a stairway where about 500
gems were concealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep finding things,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Vorpe
Quinlan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rings, necklaces, bracelets and brooches are among millions
of dollars in jewels that agents have linked to Alvaro Valdez of
Margate, who is believed to have burglarized the jewels and then
sold them to Marshall. Both men have pleaded guilty to driving
across state lines with jewels stolen from Ford's Palm Beach estate
in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About $2 million worth of the jewelry recovered so far belongs
to Ford, and she is making it quite clear she wants it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There no longer exists any reason why her jewelry should not
be returned to her at this time,'' her attorneys said in a third
demand filed in court last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ford misses her diamonds so much she has offered to put up a $10
million bond to guarantee she will make the jewels available ``for
court and police use'' on 24 hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors say the jewels aren't going anywhere, at
least until Marshall and Valdez are sentenced Sept. 25, by which
time the government will have had possession of the jewels almost
as long as Marshall and Valdez had them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning over evidence to third parties while the investigation
and prosecution are ongoing would create numerous practical
problems,'' Quinlan wrote in response to Ford's latest demand.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that Ford is only one of 80 people whose burglarized
jewels are being held by the government as evidence in the case
against the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every victim has inquired when their property will
be returned to them,'' Quinlan said in court papers filed last
week.

GRAND JURY TESTIMONY PUTS TRIPP BACK IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by her son and daughter, Linda Tripp walked
into federal court Tuesday to testify before a grand jury, five
months after her furtive tape recordings of a confiding friend
turned Monica Lewinsky into a household name and turned the White
House upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black, with her hair pulled back in a thick ponytail,
Mrs. Tripp arrived and left without commenting on her testimony,
which is expected to resume Thursday. Her lawyer, Anthony
Zaccagnini, said that as she left the grand jury, Mrs. Tripp told
him: ``I find it very easy to truthfully answer the questions posed
to me by the prosecutor and the grand jury.'' He did not respond to
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer knowledgeable about the day's proceedings said that
the questioning before the grand jury covered a range of topics,
including how Mrs. Tripp met Ms. Lewinsky, a co-worker at the
Pentagon, and the chronology of their friendship. None of Mrs.
Tripp's tapes were played Tuesday, the lawyer said, but they may be
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who scores poorly in public opinion polls, is said
by associates to feel maligned by the press but to be convinced
that once her full story is told she will be vindicated. The
prominent appearance Tuesday of her children, Allison and Ryan,
seemed intended to demonstrate that she is a devoted mother, not a
slippery friend bent on writing a tell-all book and perhaps
toppling a president.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Tripp remained inside the courthouse after her
testimony, the Tripp siblings stood silently beside Zaccagnini as
he made his statement. Allison, who is 19, lost a fight with a
grin, while Ryan, 22, did not bother to fight a frown, his hands
thrust in his pants pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce to you Linda's
children, Allison and Ryan,'' Zaccagnini said. ``Allison and Ryan
have asked me to convey to all of Linda's supporters their sincere
appreciation for the messages of support that have been provided to
Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   As she walked down a courthouse corridor after her testimony,
arm-in-arm with her daughter, Mrs. Tripp answered only one
question. How was it to have her children with her? ``It was
great,'' she said, reaching out to pat her son's back.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp will probably not finish her testimony on Thursday,
according to one lawyer who spoke on condition of not being named.
But she may not appear again next week, he added, because Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, may choose to hear from other
witnesses before wrapping up with Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   For the jurors, Tuesday was the first chance for face-to-face
scrutiny of the source of the voice they have heard repeatedly on
some 20 hours of tapes that Mrs. Tripp secretly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Starr declined to comment on Mrs. Tripp's
appearance. The White House also had little to say Tuesday about
her testimony. ``We'll let the American people come to their own
conclusions about Linda Tripp,'' said Jim Kennedy, a spokesman. One
administration official expressed irritation that Starr chose to
call a pivotal witness during President Clinton's trip to China,
but another said that the public was not paying attention as
Starr's investigation dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The news media, after weeks of lower-profile witnesses parading
tersely past them to the grand jury, was transfixed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Speights, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, turned up at
the courthouse on what he called unrelated business and found
himself pursued by a pack of reporters idling in a hallway. Asked
when he expected to negotiate an agreement with Starr's office over
the testimony of his client, who was away on a trip to California,
he replied: ``Give us a month.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Away from the media glare at the courthouse, prosecutors and
lawyers representing President Clinton have secretly begun another
fight over legal privileges, this one involving a private
investigations firm employed by Clinton's personal lawyers. The
prosecutors have issued a subpoena to the firm, Investigative Group
Inc., and its top executive, Terry Lenzner, to see whether it has
dug up material about Ms. Lewinsky or prosecutors in Starr's
office.
</P>
<P>
   But two lawyers involved in the inquiry said that the firm had
resisted turning over material, citing the lawyer-client and
work-product privileges, two legal protections for the confidences
of lawyers and their clients. The lawyers said that Starr had asked
the federal district judge supervising the grand jury to enforce
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a look at Mrs. Tripp, who has been secluded at
her suburban Maryland home, swelled the already formidable media
encampment outside the courthouse. ``There are a bunch of people
here, probably very lost, saying, `Wow, this is a federal
courthouse,''' said Bob Franken, the CNN correspondent who has
provided regular courthouse bulletins during the furious five
months of the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Franken was seated on a director's chair on a two-foot stone
pedestal outside the courthouse. With a soundwoman in a crouch and
a cameraman at his lens, the elevated CNN crew, in still moments,
seemed a sculpture in fitting media-age counterpoint to the bronze
of Blackstone beside the courthouse entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of those in Washington to take in the sights also
stopped by. ``I just thought, what the heck, maybe we'll see
something,'' said Clint Meyer of Detroit. But, with his daughter,
Tara, he had staked out the Constitution Avenue entrance this
morning, but Mrs. Tripp came in via Third Street.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Tripp testified inside, Brian Wilson of Fox News
practiced his standup, declaring that ``witnesses'' had said that
Mrs. Tripp ``looked a bit nervous this morning, and rightfully so,
this is a very key moment in Ken Starr's investigation.'' David
Smith, of the British news service ITN, taped Wilson taping his
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here, the media zoo thing?'' asked Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Smith replied, ``Britain looks in and wonders what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As tourists photographed and videotaped the hundreds of
journalists, a self-mocking air took hold. ``OK, strike the set,''
called out Charlie Archambault, a photographer for ``U.S. News and
World Report,'' as Mrs. Tripp's van vanished into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   That, he added, was ``the First Amendment in action, kids.''

U.S. JET FIGHTER FIRES MISSILE AT IRAQI ANTIAIRCRAFT BATTERY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American F-16 fired a missile at an Iraqi
antiaircraft battery Tuesday because the Iraqi forces had aimed
radar at one of four British jets patrolling the ``no flight'' zone
over southern Iraq, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 was accompanying the British planes and five other
American jets on patrol just north of Basra. Its missile missed,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry said the missile
struck a drinking-water reservoir near Basra and accused the United
States of ``an aggressive and unjustifiable action,'' Reuters
reported from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the first American military action inside Iraq
since 1996, when American jets twice fired missiles at Iraqi
antiaircraft batteries that had aimed radar at them.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House and the Pentagon, senior officials said it
was not clear if the Iraqis were actually preparing to fire on the
British jets. Vice President Al Gore suggested the use of radar,
often an indication of an imminent missile firing, did not seem to
be ``a deliberate provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the American-led patrols consider aiming radar at
allied aircraft to be a provocation and thus a reason to strike.
</P>
<P>
   All the British and American jets returned safely to their bases
in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, the officials said, that the Iraqis were
testing the resolve of the American, British and French forces to
continue the patrols at a time of growing disagreement among the
allies over ending the sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's strike also came only a month after the United States
sharply reduced the size of American forces in the Persian Gulf,
forces that had been increased during last winter's confrontation
over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday that the patrols
over the ``no flight'' zone, which extends to the 33rd parallel
just south of Baghdad, would continue unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we should draw any conclusions from this
particular one incident,'' Cohen said. ``Obviously, if the
situation changes, then we would change our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   American, British and French jets have patrolled the ``no
flight'' zone over southern Iraq since August 1992, when Iraq used
air power to suppress Shiite Muslims rebelling against Saddam
Hussein's government. Within the zone, the allies prohibit the
movement of any aircraft or heavy weaponry on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft involved in Tuesday's incident _ four British
Tornado GR1s, four F-16s and two American EA-6B electronic-jamming
jets _ are among the nearly 200 that regularly patrol the zone,
flying 80 to 120 sorties a day.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Iraqi battery, equipped with SA-3
surface-to-air missiles, fixed its radar on the British jets long
enough for the American F-16 to fire its missile, which is designed
to follow radar beams to their source. Almost immediately after
firing, however, the radar stopped its transmissions and the
missile missed, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has in the past taken aim at the patrols, and the situation
in the ``no flight'' zone is, as one senior administration official
put it, ``always at a semi-boil.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's incident followed a period of relative calm, and
Cohen said Iraq had not recently moved its air defenses or taken
any other military steps that would suggest a new military
confrontation with the United States. The United States still has
20,000 troops in the region and 22 warships plying the Persian
Gulf. &QL;

 &HT;    BASEBALL COMMENTARY: Weiss not an all-star shortstop
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I have a question: Why Walt Weiss?
</P>
<P>
   Let me rephrase that: Why in the world Walt Weiss?
</P>
<P>
   Fine fellow.
</P>
<P>
   But an All-Star shortstop? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get into a Barry Larkin rant here, but on his
worst day, after he has gone 0 for his last 30 and pulled a
hamstring, Larkin is on my lineup card before Weiss. They are equal
defensively and in the runs-produced category (runs plus
runs-batted-in minus home runs), Larkin leads Weiss 71-50.
</P>
<P>
   We have been down this road of fans' All-Star voting before.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are neat little creatures who should be allowed in to see
Mark McGwire take batting practice, allowed to boo whomever they
choose and encouraged to return often.
</P>
<P>
   But I truly believe no fan should be given an All-Star ballot
without passing a test. It wouldn't be hideously difficult _ let's
just say 250 questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sample: ``Was Baby Ruth the candy bar named for Babe Ruth the
man?''
</P>
<P>
   Sample: ``What is the link between the names Tracy Stallard and
Sal Durante?''
</P>
<P>
   Sample: ``If a train carrying the Reds left Cincinnati traveling
west at 92 mph, and another train with the Astros on board left
Houston traveling west at 92 mph, would the Reds ever catch the
Astros, and why did neither team think of taking a plane?''
</P>
<P>
   (Answers below.)
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, Walt Weiss?
</P>
<P>
   I'd ask who were the 1,159,960 people who voted for Walt Weiss,
but the answer is self-evident. This is the perfect example of what
happens when you hand ballots to every man, woman, child or space
creature occupying a seat. Colorado leads the NL in home
attendance; Atlanta is next. Weiss played in Colorado for the last
four years and plays in Atlanta now.
</P>
<P>
   He is thus the perfect All-Star candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only retreat from reality in the NL's starting
lineup announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   How can you have an All-Star starting team in 1998 without Sammy
Sosa? The guy's got 33 home runs, 78 runs batted in and blows
kisses to the camera every time he gets back to the dugout after a
dinger. What other credentials does he need?
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that Larry Walker had an MVP season in 1997, but he is
a faint shadow of that player this year (9 homers, 33 RBIs). In
addition, he has missed 16 games and is on the disabled list. But _
oh, look _ he plays for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I question the validity of the entire starting
outfield. Barry Bonds (17 HR, 57 RBIs) is being outplayed by Greg
Vaughn (26 HR, 66 RBIs). And although I like Tony Gwynn, Brian
Jordan is having a better season. As is Moises Alou. As is Vladimir
Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing the NL shortstop voting tells us is the immense
gulf between the two leagues at baseball's most important position.
The American League has four legitimate All-Star shortstops _ Nomar
Garciaparra, Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Omar Vizquel. The NL
has Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   I have volunteered in the past _ every year, actually _ to be a
one-person selection committee to do away with the mockery. For
reasons unexplained, I've not yet been contacted by those in
authority.
</P>
<P>
   I assume that means they're still considering my offer.
</P>
<P>
   (Answers to baseball quiz: The candy bar was named for the
daughter of President Grover Cleveland; Stallard threw the pitch
that Roger Maris whammered for his 61st home run and Durante, a
19-year-old, caught it in the right field stands; and no, the Reds
won't catch the Astros in this decade, by plane, train or
automobile.)

GROCERS DECRY WELFARE DEBIT CARD AS COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Arizona grocers say the state's new program that
converts welfare checks and food-stamp coupons into a plastic debit
card is costing them money, and they want to be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it cost us money to do the work of the state?''
asked Dwayne Richard, president of Arizona Food Marketing Alliance.
``The state is saving money and the retailers are picking up the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona grocers say the program costs them in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   - Most large chains must train their floor and office staff to
handle the new debit card system.
</P>
<P>
   - Most say the one or two free debit card terminals the state
system is willing to provide are worthless in a store with five,
eight or 12 check-out counters.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure their customers are not inconvenienced, large
stores must be ready for food-stamp shoppers in all lines. That
means the state is forcing them to readjust their existing software
at a cost of up to $750 a store or $30,000 per large chain, Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   - Using the old food-stamp coupons is similar to a cash
transaction, with little cost involved. But the new state system
sharply increases debit card purchases, which costs retailers from
2 cents in the largest stores to 20 cents in the smaller ones each
time they swipe a card through their cash register computer,
Richard said. Some states have agreed to reimburse retailers,
including Maryland, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois. Arizona has
not.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely these new costs will be coming out of the grocer's
profits, which average a razor-thin 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of profit margin, any new costs will be passed
on to the customer,'' said Debra Albery, a spokeswoman for Safeway,
which has 10 stores in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers in Arizona and across the country like the concept of
debit cards for welfare shoppers, but similar complaints are being
heard around the country, said Carole Throssell, spokeswoman for
the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fairly widespread,'' Throssell said. ``We've been
frustrated by efforts of state and federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has not demanded uniformity in operating
systems from state to state, forcing some merchants to accommodate
two different systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a patchwork quilt system that is cumbersome,'' Throssell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, legislators failed to make the changes in the
program the grocers wanted but agreed to fund a study on the
program's financial impact on Pima County retailers, who begin the
program July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The state official running the program said he would support
legislation to give retailers a tax break for documented start-up
costs they incur, but he's not prepared to ``subsidize'' retailers
and deplete $300,000 annual savings for the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to enhance their revenue,'' Dayne Coffey, a
Department of Economic Security manager, said. ``If you don't want
to pay it, don't participate _ or use the state (computer)
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Grocers already absorb the cost of debit card use for other
customers, so they should do so for welfare customers also _ or
charge all customers a fee for using any debit cards, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting they raise prices,'' he said, ``but if they
provide a service to one class of debit card holders they should
provide the same service to all customers who present a debit
card.'' &QL;

TUCSON GROCERS FEAR WELFARE DEBIT CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (TUCSON, Ariz.) - Tucson grocers worry the fireworks could get a
little too close this Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third-busiest weekend for food retailers and it's also
the week that the state of Arizona chose to replace food-stamp
coupons and welfare checks with plastic debit cards for 20,000
people in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers fear the program could leave confused and embarrassed
food-stamp shoppers in front of checkout lines with no way to pay
for their groceries and people waiting behind them ready to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them it wasn't a good time, but they said it was too
late to change it,'' said Dwayne Richard, president of the Arizona
Food Marketing Alliance, who expects grocers to bear the brunt of
people's frustrations as the new card owners learn how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers and state officials say this switch from paper to
plastic is giving them the jitters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big change for many food-stamp shoppers who are
unfamiliar with plastic's personal identification numbers and
activation dates. And the state's system isn't simple.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients access both cash benefits and food benefits on the
same debit card. Cash benefits are available through the new card
Wednesday (July 1).
</P>
<P>
   But the July date to access food-stamp money is different for
each recipient, depending on the first letter of the recipient's
last name.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers fear this detail will not be clear to many food-stamp
shoppers until after they've stacked their carts for holiday
picnics, stood in line and had their groceries tallied by cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Cashiers are prohibited by law from asking a shopper how he or
she intends to pay for groceries until after the order is tallied,
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   So cashiers who suspect there may be a problem can't keep it
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare recipients in 32 states are already using the card
system, which government officials say saves taxpayer money, is
less vulnerable to fraud, and is more convenient for users.
Food-stamp shoppers in Maricopa County, the greater metro Phoenix
area - make the change in February, and the entire state will be
converted to plastic by August 1999. All states are expected to be
using the system for food stamps by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the new system's technical glitches, educating card
users has been the most common problem in all states, said Carole
Throssell, spokeswoman for the national Food Marketing Institute,
the grocers' lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Users frequently assume the debit card works like a credit card
and will permit them to exceed the amount the government credits to
their card each month, Throssell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona Department of Economic Security officials have
assured grocers that Arizona's technical system is well-tested and
sound and that 95 percent of Pima County's food-stamp shoppers have
visited their DES office to receive personal training, including a
12-minute video, before picking up their card.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona initiated the thorough, personal training after some
states experienced problems when they simply mailed debit cards to
each welfare and food-stamp user, said Dayne Coffey, DES program
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who got the card in the mail didn't realize they had
to call a number to activate the card or failed to understand the
importance of memorizing PINs and activation dates.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp shoppers in Pennyslvania, which began using debit
cards in November, received similar face-to-face training given in
Pima County. But Pennsylvania grocers report many of their
food-stamp shoppers are still lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our retailers have hired additional staff persons to stand by
and assist customers,'' said David McCorkle, Pennsylvania Food
Merchants Association president.
</P>
<P>
   And many new Pima County card owners who received their training
as early as May, immediately went out and tried to buy groceries
with their new but unactivated card, Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system also could leave some hungry people behind.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Pima County food-stamp recipients still haven't
responded to their letter instructing them to visit their DES
office to pick up their card, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little concerned with the inner-city homeless. We
didn't get a good show up,'' Coffey said. Some homeless could be
mentally ill, alcoholics or drug users, or just haven't been able
to collect their mail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to realize they're out of food stamps,'' Coffey
said, ``and go wandering into their (DES) offices sometime this
month.''

 EXCERPTS FROM McVEIGH LETTER OF OCT. 20, 1993  
(With EXCLUSIVE-MCVEIGH.) 
(th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a letter dated Oct. 20, 1993, and
written by Timothy McVeigh to his sister Jennifer McVeigh. The
idiosyncrasies in spelling and punctuation are McVeigh's.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa McVeigh saw this. He never knew why, but one day, I
showed up at his door, freezing outside, in only sweat pants and in
total, complete breakdown. Gramps, I'm sure, never told anyone
about that day, and I respect him greatly for that, as I spent
about an hour upstairs ``losing it.'' It was almost suicide at that
point, but rage, but denial, but acceptance _ all these feelings
were battling for control. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now here's what led to my current life: It all revolves around
my arrival at Ft. Bragg for Special Forces. We all took
intelligence, psychological, adeptness, and a whole battery of
other tests. (Out of a group of 400). One day in formation, ten
(10) Social Security numbers were called out (no names) and told to
leave formation. Mine was one.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 of us were told that out of the select group of 400, we
had scored highest on certain tests. We had been selected because
of our intelligence, physical make-up (165 lbs. 6 ft. being
``ultimate warrier'' type _ I was only slightly off _ 160 lbs.
6'1{''), and physical abilities. We were to feel special, part of a
hand-picked group). ...
</P>
<P>
   We were all asked to ``volunteer'' (talk about peer pressure!)
to do some ``work for the government on the domestic, as well as
international, front.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   What I learned next, both from the briefings, and from the
questions and private talks included:
</P>
<P>
   1.) We would be helping the CIA fly drugs into the U.S. to fund
many covert operations;
</P>
<P>
   2.) Military ``consultants'' were to work hand-in-hand
w/civilian police agencies to ``quiet'' anyone whom was deemed a
``security risk.'' (We would be gov't-paid assassins!)
</P>
<P>
   3.) Many other details _ to verify these last two, see the
enclosed article, or watch, again the movie ``Lethal Weapon''. ...
</P>
<P>
   It also gives you new insight on things like WACO, etc. _ they
were murdered by hit-men. &QL;

AFTER DECADES OF WORK FOR ALBERT, SILENCE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marv Albert's life is one without work. Nine months
after pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault three days into an
embarrassing trial, he attends movies; reads voraciously; plays
tennis with Kenny, his oldest son, and his brother, Steve; walks
his new pugs, Lulu and Ruby, and plans a future with his fiancee,
Heather Faulkiner, from their duplex apartment on Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't think he's having a good time,'' said Steve
Albert, a boxing announcer for Showtime and the youngest of the
three Albert brothers. ``It's been a rough go. He's very anxious to
start working again.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert did not call a National Basketball Association game last
season for the first time in 30 years, but followed the league
passionately via his satellite dish. ``He watches as a fan and
aficionado, but can't resist zinging me for my overreactions to
things,'' said John Andariese, Albert's friend and former sidekick
on the MSG Network's Knick telecasts. ``He knows the roster of all
29 teams, and if you say, `Denver Nuggets,' he knows their
broadcast team.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Albert, who watched Game 3 of the NBA finals with his
brother and Andariese, added: ``It's so novel to watch with him. I
don't know if he finds it tough watching, not being there. But he
doesn't express bitterness to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once very accessible to reporters, Albert did a series of
television interviews just after his guilty plea but has refused
all requests since. He declined to be interviewed for this article,
which was assembled from talking to friends, associates and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Albert has not worked as a broadcaster since calling a Baltimore
Ravens-Giants game for NBC last Sept. 14. One month later, his
unexpected guilty plea led to his being fired by NBC and to his
resignation from the MSG Network.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be no immediate prospects for work, although
employers may be waiting for Albert to complete the year of
psychiatric counseling that was ordered by a Virginia judge. If
Albert completes the counseling and does not break the law for a
year, the charges against him are to be dismissed. ``Marv
understands the situation and the need for future employers to
perceive him in a state of normalcy,'' Andariese said. ``He knows
the price of fame and is prepared to deal with the price of his
fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a friend, ``He needs to be cleansed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of discussions about a talk show on New York's WFAN
and the television play-by-play job for the Miami Heat. A planned
meeting with Turner Sports, the NBA's cable partner, has not
occurred. ``I'd have been foolish not to talk to him,'' said Don
Sperling, who is running the sports operations of the Miami
television station that recently bought the Heat's rights. But the
team would not consider Albert, and rehired the incumbent
announcer. ``He was available, so it behooved us to go after him,''
Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Hollander, the general manager of WFAN, said: ``He's really
ready, just waiting to go. But deep down, he knows things won't be
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert's best prospect may be a return to MSG as the permanent
host of the nightly ``MSG SportsDesk,'' replacing the departed Bob
Page, and sharing the Knicks' radio play-by-play job on WFAN with
Gus Johnson. But there is no guarantee of such a return to his old
employer. A Madison Square Garden spokesman would not comment on
its interest in Albert.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who know him, Albert's familiar sarcastic
edge has been blunted, and he is humbler, after the public
spectacle of being charged with sodomy and assault after a February
1997 hotel meeting with a former lover, Vanessa Perhach. The
subsequent news media stampede turned him into the tabloids'
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dealing with this in a very straight-on way,'' Steve
Albert said. ``I've seen no traces of a `Why me?' attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert maintains a low profile, although he can be seen at local
restaurants, movie theaters and in Central Park. At the start of
his legal imbroglio, he said he would not hole up in his apartment,
that he had nothing to be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Albert has not talked to reporters since his post-sentencing
tour to chat with Barbara Walters, Larry King, David Letterman and
Katie Couric last October. Memorably, he told Walters on ABC's
``20/20'' that during an ``experimental'' phase in his life he met
a transvestite and dominatrix.
</P>
<P>
   Albert and Faulkiner have not married, but friends expect them
to wed soon. She has returned to work, producing freelance reports
for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Albert's lifestyle say it has been pared
back because of his lack of salary and the high cost of his
defense. ``I presume he's enjoying the benefits of his fame over
many years,'' Andariese said. ``I presume the legal fees didn't
wipe him out. If there were trouble, I'd feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Perhach would not comment on whether she has
received any payment from Albert in return for not filing a civil
lawsuit. Evan Bell, Albert's manager, also declined to comment. But
Andariese said, ``I'd say he feels all his legal problems have been
taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is what any future employer hopes. But will an
employer take a risk on Albert, whose talent is unquestioned but
whose image has been forever altered? Will fans and viewers accept
or deride him? What will advertisers tell any network or local
station or regional sports network?
</P>
<P>
   One industry official said, ``Sponsors are afraid if viewers
would be thinking about anything but the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert's partisans believe any backlash will be brief. ``Marv's
prepared for anything,'' Steve Albert said. ``He'd be so thrilled
to be back behind the microphone that he has to expect whatever
comes.''

CULTURE CZAR GETS HER WAY AND BLOCKS `THE PEONY PAVILION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-NOTEBOOK, CHINA-TAIWAN,
HONGKONG-ANNIVERSARY, ASIA-RUBIN) 
 (HLW)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center
Festival, announced here on Tuesday night that his struggle with
local culture authorities over how to produce ``The Peony
Pavilion'' had finally ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Shanghai Bureau of Culture has not given permission
for the company's actors to depart by this Friday as previously
agreed, Redden said, it has become impossible to perform the
classic Chinese opera as a centerpiece of the Lincoln Center
Festival in New York next Tuesday. Logistics involved in arranging
visas and travel for the actors required that a decision be made by
today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After hoping for an eleventh-hour breakthrough, following 10
days of muddled and confusing negotiations, Redden realized his
efforts were doomed on Tuesday afternoon when Ma Bomin, the
director of the Bureau of Culture, said she was too busy to see
him. As he neared a site outside the city where members of the
Shanghai Kunju Opera Company were rehearsing, his car passed hers,
going in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope for intervention by President Clinton, who arrived in
Shanghai on Monday evening, seemed to evaporate on Tuesday. In
fact, Ms. Ma could not wait at rehearsal for Redden, she told
others, because she was busy arranging a cultural performance at a
reception for President Clinton that was given by Mayor Xu Kuangdi
at the Shanghai Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hour Clinton was feted by the mayor and Ms. Ma on
Tuesday night, Redden somberly told a news conference in the Garden
Hotel that his hopes for staging a exceptional 55-act version of
``The Peony Pavilion'' were now over. He plans to fly back to New
York on Wednesday. Chen Shi-Zheng, the director hired by Lincoln
Center, also plans to leave Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really something very sad about something very good
being leveled in this way,'' Redden said. ``It was a monumental
show. It's heartbreaking to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Clinton's visit to China and plans to perform
``The Peony Pavilion'' in the United States were coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's visit so far has been characterized by a spirit
of openness and cooperation between Washington and Beijing, the
failure of such a high-profile example of cultural exchange between
the two countries offers a sour counterpoint. It is also a reminder
of the strength of a Communist Party-run system where government
officials wield substantial power over all manner of life,
including artistic projects.
</P>
<P>
   Redden flew here on June 22, a few days after Shanghai's Bureau
of Culture suddenly blocked shipment of the elaborate sets,
costumes, and props for the classic Chinese opera, raising
objections to the innovative staging of the production, and calling
it too `feudal,' `superstitious' and `pornographic.'
</P>
<P>
   After three days of difficult negotiations, and a dramatic
confrontation with officials at Shanghai's Hongqiao International
Airport, he left for Hong Kong last Thursday, but came back the
next day to try again. All along, Redden said, he had difficulty
discerning whether the mixed signals he got from Bureau of Culture
officials reflected a willingness to negotiate or a drawn-out
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Ma, Yuan Huiguo, said that she was
unavailable for comment and that no information was available about
the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, as he sipped a gin and tonic in a hotel
lounge, Redden lamented the thought that ``The Peony Pavilion,'' as
Chen directed it, and the Kunju Opera Company rehearsed it for
eight months, might never be performed again. Redden himself saw
only small parts of the opera in rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, sitting at the same table, said he felt particularly
wounded by the way the actors he worked with for so long had been
partly broken by political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a deep fear now,'' Chen said. ``It's going to take a
long time before that fear is taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Lincoln Center Festival repeated its view
that a contract between Lincoln Center and the Shanghai Kunju Opera
Company had been improperly violated, since it was approved by the
Bureau of Culture last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find this decision truly incomprehensible,'' the statement
said. ``Lincoln Center and Chen have made every effort in the past
10 days to address the concerns of the Bureau of Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden, still unsure what would appear on stage at Lincoln
Center on July 7, said it was likely that each of the performances
at this summer's festival would include a reading of a statement
about artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize how much artistic freedom you have until you
come to a place like this and see how easily it can be taken
away,'' Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center, he also said, will most likely take legal action
against Shanghai officials for breaking a contract worth several
hundred thousand dollars.

RUBIN IS OPTIMISTIC ON THAI SUPPORT FOR IMF REQUIREMENTS 
(JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ As he continued to gather damage reports
from the crisis-torn economies of Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin expressed optimism on Tuesday that the political leaders of
Thailand would be able to marshal public support for the difficult
work of reforming that economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin arrived in Seoul late Tuesday night, the final stop of his
six-day four-country tour, after a morning of meetings in Bangkok
with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, other senior officials and
business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking with the prime minister I thought they felt they had
the public support they needed to proceed on the path,'' Rubin said
in a briefing with reporters on the flight to Seoul. He added that
among Thailand leaders ``there was a recognition that a sufficient
social safety net was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has urged leaders on each stop of his trip to create
adequate ``safety nets.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip began on Friday in Beijing and ends on Wednesday here.
With Thailand and its neighbors facing an economic contraction of 5
to 10 percent this year, Rubin is plainly worried that unless
people are cushioned from the blow, the dislocation could erupt
into social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin did not visit Indonesia on this trip, in part because its
capital, Jakarta, was ablaze in riots and arson fires when the trip
was being planned. The turmoil there has shadowed Rubin's trip, a
reminder that the Asian crisis is now less about daily fluctuations
in the ringgit or the rupiah than about the price of basic staples
like food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to build a social safety net,'' Mari Pangetsu,
executive director of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a research institute, in Jakarta, said. ``This is not just
an economic issue, but a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the International Monetary Fund say its rescue
packages for the region have raised the risk of social unrest, with
an emphasis on high interest rates. That has stabilized currencies,
but it has also choked off credit and brought commercial activity
to a near standstill.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand the opposition has used adherence to the IMF plan as
a club against the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin rejected those criticisms, saying: ``The IMF has not
tried to be Draconian.'' He noted that the fund had begun to show
added flexibility in fiscal policy, as the economic pain in those
countries worsened. In Thailand, for example, the fund has
permitted the government to swing from a budget surplus to a
deficit to free up money for new social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged that the crisis had led to ``enormous
hardships for the people of Thailand.'' But in a speech to business
students at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok he said: ``The
economic difficulties are a product of the crisis, not of the
reform programs your nation has adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some pointed questions the students gave Rubin a
standing ovation. In general, Rubin appeared more enthusiastic
about Thailand than his previous stop, Malaysia. There he held a
cordial but inconclusive meeting with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who faults the West and what he calls its unscrupulous
currency traders for much of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who oversaw the currency-trading desk at Goldman, Sachs
in New York before joining the Clinton administration, said
Mahathir had raised the issue of short-term capital flows and their
harm in the meeting. ``We didn't really engage in a debate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, Rubin plans to meet with President Kim Dae-jung,
other senior officials, labor leaders, and the heads of the five
largest conglomerates, Daewoo, Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and the SK
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cases with Thailand and Malaysia, Korea's economy has
shifted into reverse in the last six months. Its output shrank 3.8
percent in the first quarter of 1998, and unemployment war running
at to 6.7 percent. The prospect of growing layoffs has led to
strikes, including a general walkout last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he would seek an update on the government's efforts
to reform its troubled banking system. The meeting with the
executives could prove interesting, because analysts say the
conglomerates, known as chaebols, have dragged their feet on
cleaning up their debt-laden balance sheets.

 &HT;    Women face a gentler Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Fortunately, the United States Golf Association
doesn't get quite as carried away with its setup for the U.S.
Women's Open as it does annually with the men's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   If you've already forgotten, the most memorable highlight of Lee
Janzen's win at The Olympic Club 10 days ago will not include Lee
Janzen. It will star the red-plaid-knickered Payne Stewart at the
conclusion of his Friday round, helplessly observing his golf ball
roll slowly, dimple by dimple, from a point just inches under the
cup to an eventual point 25 feet down the slope of the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-putt golf, John Daly called it, and who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   This week, Blackwolf Run Golf Course won't be as severe, nor as
comical and embarrassing for the USGA. As setups for women's
tournaments go, this one will rank as tough, but far more
reasonable than Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   The rough won't be as rough. It was as high as 7 inches at some
spots at Olympic. The highest grass at Blackwolf Run will be cut at
approximately 3 inches in the primary rough, 1 1/2 inches in the
intermediate zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think 3-inch rough for ladies golf is somewhat
comparable to 5-inch rough for men's golf, when you bring in the
strength factor,'' said Tom Meeks, USGA director of rules and
competitions. ``I think it would be very unfair to hit out of
5-inch rough at the Women's Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The greens won't be as fast, either _ similar firmness, perhaps,
but not those readings of 12.8 on the stimpmeter that were common
at Olympic when things dried out. Figure on 10 to start with, Meeks
said, maybe 10.6 by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The fairways won't be cut quite as tight for lies _ one-half
inch, compared with three-eighths at Olympic, and will be 30-34
yards wide. At Olympic, other than the 17th, they were 26-30 yards
wide.
</P>
<P>
   If things go as planned, none of Pete Dye's greens at Blackwolf
Run will turn into the circus that was OIympic's 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just chose a hole location on Friday we thought would work,
and it didn't, and I blame nobody but me,'' Meeks said. ``When you
set holes for the Open, you're flirting with the edge, anyway. You
do this long enough, you're going to set a bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of widespread criticism last week, Meeks is not
setting holes for the Women's Open. Judy Bell, the USGA past
president, has that job. Meeks is here this week only because
Kendra Graham, the USGA's director of women's competitions, is on
maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been put on probation,'' Meeks said, chuckling.
``Even if Kendra were here, Judy would still be setting the
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks' main job this week is monitoring the pace of play, and at
the U.S. Women's Open that's a huge task by itself. Thursday and
Friday at this event are probably the longest two days in
tournament golf. Two years ago at Pine Needles, the field of 150
players _ 50 threesomes off the No. 1 tee only _ failed to finish
Thursday night before darkness. And that was without a weather
delay.

BOEING DELAYS SCALING DOWN COMMERCIAL DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. won't be able to eliminate 12,000
commercial aircraft jobs this year as planned because there's still
too much work to be done to bring the company's ailing assembly
lines back to full health.
</P>
<P>
   While companywide employment has already dropped slightly,
Boeing won't begin scaling back its commercial division payroll in
earnest until later this year, company spokesman Peter Conte said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives will most likely address employment issues
this morning when they give progress reports on the company's
aircraft production recovery program to analysts and news media.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been struggling since October to fill all of its
commercial airplane orders on time _ mainly next-generation 737s _
because of parts shortages, lack of trained assembly workers, a
rapid increase in production rates and other manufacturing
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Boeing announced that employment in its
Renton-based commercial aircraft division would drop by 12,000 this
year, beginning in mid-year as aircraft production peaks and
assembly line bottlenecks are cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   But because the company is still in the production recovery mode
with continuing backups on its 737 production lines in Renton, the
number of job reductions will be lower than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   While a delay in job cuts appears to be good news for workers,
analysts had viewed Boeing's previously announced plans to reduce
employment as a sign that the company's production woes were behind
them and improved earnings were ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a precursor to another charge (against corporate
earnings),'' analyst Paul Nisbet with JSA Research in Newport,
R.I., said Tuesday. ``They are going to be keeping a few more
thousand people for a longer period of time and that amounts to
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already has spent nearly $3 billion in its effort to get
its troubled aircraft production lines back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing was forced to make costly design changes on
its new 737 models to gain approval from U.S. and European aviation
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Write-offs for manufacturing problems combined with costs for
absorbing McDonnell Douglas Corp. resultedin a loss of $178
million last year. It was Boeing's first loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Conte said it's too early to tell what the actual
number of job cuts will be by year end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is still there to reduce BCAG (Boeing's
commercial division) employment by 12,000; it just won't be this
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said as soon as Boeing gets its assembly lines running
smoothly again, the company will begin reducing employment first
through attrition, then layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they bring back the lines to full health, then you have the
opportunity to not replace people as they retire, resign or move on
to other positions,'' he said. ``But right now, the work is still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Boeing executives said the company's production recovery
plan was slightly ahead of schedule but that airline customers
could expect delivery delays on certain models through the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that things are slipping is not good news,'' Nisbet
said. ``At one time they said they'd be up to full (production)
speed by the end of the second quarter and that slipped to the end
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is increasing total production of all jetliners to 49 a
month in the third quarter and is at maximum capacity in Renton
where the 737 and 757 jets are built.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company plans to deliver 550 commercial jets this
year. As of May 27, Boeing had delivered 189.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companywide employment figures released Tuesday show
that as of June 1, Boeing had 238,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually 800 more than the company employed as of May 1.
But about 400 of the new hires are summer interns and 300 are
university graduates who were hired as part of Boeing's college
recruitment program, Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing started out the year with about 238,600 employees
companywide, of which 103,420 were in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent employment numbers (as of June 1) show that
Boeing has 104,000 employees in Washington state; 42,300 in
California; 22,000 in St. Louis; 22,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 6,000 in
Philadelphia; and 42,100 in other locations throughout the country.

GALINA BREZHNEV, 69, HIGH-LIVING DAUGHTER OF FORMER DICTATOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Galina Brezhnev, the high-living daughter of the former
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev whose antics often led to scandal,
died on Tuesday in a Moscow hospital. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news agencies said she is to be cremated on Wednesday.
There were no details about the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Galina Brezhnev was never involved in politics but she figured
in some major scandals in the last years of Soviet power. The
arrests of some of her husbands and some of her friends illuminated
the corruption of the Soviet aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-drinking member of the Soviet elite who liked to race her
father's Mercedes, Ms. Brezhnev had her first brush with scandal
when she was just 22 and ran away with a circus acrobat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could hold 10 people on his shoulders but failed to hold
Galina too long,'' NTV television observed on Tuesday night.
``Galina got married quite often.'' She remained infatuated with
the circus and with circus performers for several decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, a close friend from the circus, known as Boris the
Gypsy, was arrested and charged with smuggling. The arrest took
place when Yuri Andropov was head of the KGB, and Andropov
portrayed the move as part of his anti-corruption drive. But it was
also interpreted as a bid by Andropov to position himself to
succeed Brezhnev as Soviet leader. Brezhnev died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the end of her notoriety: In 1988, her husband Yuri
Churbanov was arrested for taking bribes and imprisoned for six
years. Churbanov had been a lieutenant colonel in the police when
he met Ms. Brezhnev and was promoted to post of chief deputy
interior minister soon after their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the early years of reform under Mikhail Gorbachev, the
Churbanov case sent an important political signal: that no one was
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   After Churbanov was jailed, Ms. Brezhnev said she was unaware of
his bribe-taking and divorced him, saying he had been a bad
husband. Churbanov was released from prison in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her brushes with scandal, Ms. Brezhnev retained her
privileges and comfortable life style. She won a law suit for the
return of a Mercedes and other valuables confiscated from
Churbanov.
</P>
<P>
   There were no details on Tuesday night about survivors.

POPE ACTS TO STIFFLE DISSENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In one of his sharpest rebukes to liberal Catholics to
date, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday made changes to canon law aimed
at stamping out debate on a wide range of passionately-discussed
issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Reasserting the articles of faith that are ``definitive'' and
binding to all Catholics, the pope on Tuesday inscribed those
teachings into church law, and warned that those who dissent would
be subject to ``just punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Roman Catholic theologians in the United States have
questioned Rome's authority on doctrinal matters. In an Apostolic
letter that was released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope made
it quite clear that he was addressing _ and reining in _ those
academics.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostolic letter was both an act of Vatican housekeeping and
a cornerstone laid down for this pope's legacy. On one hand, the
pope was merely filling a gap in the code of canon law, but his
eagerness to make his teachings as clear _ and as binding _ as
possible was one of the most vivid signs yet that in the twilight
of his papacy, Pope John Paul II, at 78, is seeking to make his
rulings irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   The pope explained he was acting ``to defend the faith of the
Catholic Church against errors that arise on the part of some of
the faithful, above all those who dedicate themselves to the
disciplines of holy theology.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's letter addressed the church's ``profession of
faith,'' a list of essential Catholic beliefs that the pope
reformulated in 1989. All clergymen and Catholic teachers and
theologians are required to follow it.
</P>
<P>
   By inscribing his teachings about the articles of faith into
canon law, Pope John Paul II said he was establishing norms that
would ``impose the duty to observe the truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decree is likely to disappoint those theologians who
had hoped to keep open a discussion of women's ordination, among
other things. But John Paul II had previously made his opposition
to any such deliberations well known.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostolic letter did not specify which teachings the pope
was addressing, but it was published along with a highly detailed
doctrinal commentary written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who
heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and who is
the Vatican's leading conservative thinker. Ratzinger's definitions
of what constitutes ``infallibly taught'' doctrine are likely to
rekindle debate among the very theologians the Vatican had hoped to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters, the cardinal warned, ``would be in a position of
rejecting a truth of Catholic doctrine and would therefore no
longer be in full communion with the Catholic Church.'' The
consequences could range from warnings to excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the pope has moved to bring dissenting
theologians to heel. Father Charles Curran, an American priest who
differed with the Vatican on contraception, homosexuality and other
issues, was stripped of his right to teach Catholic theology at
Catholic University in Washington, D.C., in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Vatican excommunicated a Sri Lankan priest, Tissa
Balasuriya, for challenging papal authority and key teachings. The
decision was reversed after he signed the profession of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Vatican added a category of fundamental truths _
such as the ban on contraception and on marriage of priests. At the
same time the Vatican broadened the requirement for Catholic
leaders to pledge fidelity to these truths to include theologians
teaching in Church-sponsored schools and universities, not just
members of the clergy. Many American Catholics viewed this as a
blow to academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a fear that canon law could be used to further
clamp down on dissent. ``The obvious purpose could be to unite the
church but the real consequence could be to divide it,'' said
Father Richard McBrien, a professor of Theology at the University
of Notre Dame, in South Bend, Ind. ``The last thing the Catholic
church needs is heresy-hunting or demands for oath-taking or any
finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American theologians, however, were already troubled by a
previous papal Apostolic letter in 1994 forbidding the ordination
of women. The Vatican's Congregation For the Doctrine of Faith
issued a document in 1995 insisting that the pope's ruling on the
matter was ``infallibly taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Catholic Theological Society of America
challenged that interpretation and asked the Vatican for further
study of the question. On Tuesday, the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith, which published a ``doctrinal commentary,''
alongside the papal decree, specifically cited the ban on women
priests as an example of doctrine that is ``infallibly taught.''
That doctrine, among others, was inserted into canonical law by
today's decree. And that is likely to disappoint many American
theologians. ``Church documents have to be read very carefully, but
on the face of it, this appears to be quite troubling,'' said Dr.
Jon Nilson, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, and a
member of the Catholic Theological Society of America. ``Women's
ordination is at the forefront of issues in the process of
reconciliation with other Christian churches _ if you are serious
about unity within the churches you have to keep open discussion of
women's ordination.''

U.S. AND EUROPE CLASH OVER INTERNET CONSUMER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Differences between European nations and the United States over
how to protect consumer privacy have led to a clash over
technologies endorsed by the world's two leading makers of browsing
software for navigating the World Wide Web, Microsoft Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Europe governments, which favor enacting
laws to protect consumer privacy online, and the Clinton
administration, which prefers to let electronic commerce industries
regulate themselves, could delay the much-anticipated evolution of
the Internet into a huge international supermarket of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two proposed standards: the Privacy Preferences
Project, or P3P, and the Open Profiling Standard, or OPS. Both are
technologies intended to make it possible for individual computer
users to determine how much personal information they are willing
to make available to various Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals are being considered for possible international
implementation by an Internet standards group, the World Wide Web
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, a committee of the European Union issued
a tough report attacking both proposed standards as inadequate and
possibly in violation of European laws designed to protect consumer
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that P3P and OPS, which will be built into
browsers made by both Microsoft and Netscape, clash with the
European Privacy Directive, which restricts the ability of
businesses to collect private information about individuals without
their permission.
</P>
<P>
   When it goes into effect this October the directive is expected
to toughen national laws of 15 European governments whose privacy
standards are already more stringent than those of the United
States. The European laws require that corporations get people's
permission before collecting demographic or marketing information
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant, because the Europeans are saying this
mechanism might not work,'' said Joel Reidenberg, a law professor
at Fordham University in New York City and an expert on
international privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's committee, the Working Party on the
Protection of Individuals' Personal Data, issued its draft opinion
on June 16. In addition to criticize the technology itself, the
report stated that ``a technical platform for privacy protection
will not in itself be sufficient to protect privacy on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard de Graaf, first secretary of the European Commission
delegation in the United States, said, ``We believe technology has
a role to play in enhancing privacy protection, but we have some
concerns about seeing technology as the magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report said that such a technology for privacy
protection would still need to be applied within a framework of
enforceable laws if it was to protect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said there was a risk that the P3P standard
would mislead European companies into believing that they had met
their legal obligations by offering the software.
</P>
<P>
   There is added risk that European computer users would come into
contact via the Internet with Web sites that do not meet European
data protection standards, according to the report. It warns that
the current P3P does not require, or even allow for, the providing
of information about sanctions or remedies to users, a violation of
European laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the report states that Internet users are unlikely to
alter the so-called default settings that are preconfigured with
each browser. The committee warns that the software will be of
minimal privacy protection value if the browsers are not set by
default to the highest privacy protection possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shot across the bow,'' said Evan Hendricks,
Publisher of Privacy Times, a privacy policy newsletter, which
reported the European Union criticism of the P3P standard earlier
this week. ``If the Europeans enforce their own standards, then the
U.S. is now headed on a collision course over the Directive.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, the Clinton administration has pressured United
States industries to arrive at strong self-regulatory standards
that would avoid the necessity of enacting new laws to protect
personal information in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   However, in recent weeks that position has appeared to weaken as
critics _ including the United States Commerce Department _
continued to point out areas in which self regulation is failing as
corporations rush to take advantage of the Internet as a new medium
for marketing and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a flash point,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director
of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington,
D.C.-based privacy organization. European approaches have tended to
encourage systems that permit anonymity, he said, while American
companies have been building systems that encourage users to
provide personal information.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Microsoft acquired Firefly, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
Internet start-up company that develops technologies that support
P3P.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment Tuesday on the European Union
report.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the World Wide Web consortium said Tuesday that
they had been in discussions with members of the European
Commission and that they believed that the technology could be
modified to meet the European privacy concerns. But they also
acknowledged concerned that the technology might become embroiled
in a political war between Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a middle ground it's going to take some time to
find it,'' said Joseph M. Reagle Jr., a policy analyst at the
consortium. ``I'd hate to see it used as a political straw man
anywhere. While P3P isn't perfect, it is a step forward. Issues
related to the harmonization of data protection regulations and
extraterritorial claims of jurisdiction on the Web will take many
years to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagle disputed the report's assertion that there were
shortcomings in the basic P3P vocabulary that notifies computer
users of their privacy options. In fact, he noted, the system can
be easily tailored for any set of privacy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission report follows a similar, but less
strongly worded report by the International Working Group on Data
Protection in Telecommunications, a group of privacy officials from
various governments.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which met in Hong Kong in April, stated in its
report: ``Technology cannot in itself be the solution for securing
privacy on the Web. It needs to be applied according to a
regulatory framework.''

REEBOK DROPPING AD DEAL WITH BASKETBALL CELEBRITY O'NEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an indication that star power alone can't sell shoes, Reebok
International Ltd. said Tuesday that it will not renew its
endorsement contract with basketball's Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaq inked the estimated $15 &UR;  &LR; million deal with the
Stoughton, Mass. athletic footwear company in 1992, it was hailed
as a landmark endorsement for a potential role model with a size 21
foot. Shoes would be designed for O'Neal and named after him, with
the hope that kids from urban playgrounds to the toniest of suburbs
would covet them.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. As sneaker sales have cooled for
the entire industry, companies are re-evaluating their marketing
strategies, and some athletes who once earned millions in
endorsement fees are lucky if they can get free shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a veritable all-star team of athletes has recently been
dropped from the roster of first-string sneaker pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Larry Johnson, Oliver Miller, Glenn Robinson, and
Bobby Phills are among those who've seen fees dwindle or have had
their contracts bought out by various sneaker companies. The same
goes for football's Emmitt Smith, who pitched shoes and apparel for
Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's a rare star who has the cachet and charisma to
sell athletic footwear and apparel, said executive director Gregg
Hartley of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only about four athletes in the whole world who can
actually sell product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them happen to be named O'Neal, whose multi-year
contract with Reebok, the second-biggest maker of athletic footwear
to Nike, expired Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hartley, the athletes who might actually be worth
their huge endorsement fees include Jordan, and golfers Tiger Woods
and Greg Norman, who has his own Reebok collection.
</P>
<P>
   Second-tier stars are another matter. They may sink clutch
baskets and birdies. They may score touchdowns and hat tricks. But
they don't put enough money into store cash registers to justify
big endorsement fees. With second-tier stars, shoe companies don't
always get ``a bang for their marketing buck,'' said editor Sean
Brenner of Team Marketing Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And using athletes always carries a risk of adverse publicity.
When Latrell Sprewell of the Golden State Warriors attempted to
throttle his basketball coach last season, North Reading-based
Converse Inc. moved quickly to fire him as a pitchman for its
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, shoe companies are victims of their own success. A
few years ago, a surefire formula for selling sneakers was pretty
straightforward: Hire a National Basketball Association star, put
him on TV, and watch boys and young men eagerly flock to the malls
to buy shoes worn by their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   No one had more success with that strategy than Nike Inc. and
Michael Jordan, although it also worked for Grant Hill and Fila.
</P>
<P>
   Success brought imitation, and the result was a series of
copycat ads that consumers couldn't tell apart. It got to the point
where viewers couldn't keep straight which star was endorsing which
shoe, said Jim Andrews, editor of IEG Endorsement Insider, a
newsletter that tracks endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence hinted that many kids were
switching their sneakers for so-called brown shoes. Instead of
Nikes, they were wearing hiking boots and clunky footwear, perhaps
turned off by the endless bombardment of sneaker ads.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's little sales data to support it, several
industry observers dismissed the brown-shoe trend. In their view,
sneaker ads featuring stars have run their course. It's time for
something new, they say, something that breaks through the clutter,
something that celebrates everyday athletes rather than overpaid
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They oversaturated the market. So many players had signature
footwear, it was no longer unique,'' said Andrews. ``You can't
expect consumers to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reebok, having many stars under contract was vital at one
point. A decade ago, Reebok was known as a company that made
aerobics shoes for women. When it expanded into the men's market,
the challenge was to convince men that Reebok was sufficiently
macho. To do that, Reebok began to sign up athletes en masse. The
thought was that if sports fans turned on their TVs and saw pro
athletes in Reebok shoes, Reebok would gain authenticity as a
performance brand.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Reebok had more than 100 NBA athletes under
contract. At the summer Olympics in 1996, meanwhile, about a third
of the 10,000 athletes wore some Reebok product.
</P>
<P>
   After years of heavy investment, however, Reebok has concluded
that it has gotten across the message that it's a performance brand
for both men and women. And as sneaker sales have flattened _
Tuesday Nike reported the unthinkable: a quarterly loss _ Reebok
has decided it no longer needs to spend so heavily on star
athletes. Other footwear companies, also coping with weaker sales
and a glut of inventory, have reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been cutting back,'' said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   When sales weaken, one of the first things that companies do is
slash marketing budgets, said Hartley of the sporting goods
association, and that's what shoe companies are doing as their
cyclical industry struggles through the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said it will continue to highlight basketball star Allen
Iverson. But instead of a slew of NBA stars, it will rely more on
some women basketball players to help sell sneakers and soccer
stars with global appeal to market athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson said the current strategy is to
put more emphasis on the shoes themselves than on star jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about doing more with less,'' Fogelson said. ``It's about
a renewed focus on product.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for Shaq over his departure from Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 26-year-old star of the Los Angeles Lakers earned
an estimated $28 million in endorsement fees, touting such products
as Pepsi-Cola and fast-food from Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday his agent said O'Neal is ``finalizing plans for future
footwear and apparel commitments.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flying the American flag may be patriotic, but so
is fighting for the freedom to burn it, a civil liberties group
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, People for the American Way, unveiled an advertising
campaign Tuesday aimed at rallying opposition in the Senate to a
constitutional amendment that would ban flag desecration. The
measure passed the House last year and could come up in the Senate
soon after the Fourth of July recess. A close vote is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make the point that it is just as patriotic to
fight for the freedom to burn the flag as it is to wrap yourself up
in the flag,'' said Mike Lux, a vice president of People for the
American Way. ``What is important is the freedom that the flag
represents, not the flag itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, which started airing Tuesday _ in time for
the Fourth of July _ on television stations in Oregon, Washington,
North Dakota, and Washington, D.C., James Warner, a former prisoner
of war in Vietnam, pleads ``don't let them burn our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning is protected
as free speech by the First Amendment. A year before, the Supreme
Court invalidated state flag protection laws, ruling that Texas
could not fine a protester who burned an American flag on public
property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, an anti-desecration constitutional amendment, which
requires a two-thirds majority to pass, fell three votes short in
the Senate. Last year, the House passed the measure 310-114, and
the Senate may find it difficult to resist passage in this election
year. Three-fourths of the states would need to ratify the
amendment for it to become part of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, sponsored the Senate
proposal, which was approved last month by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American flag serves as a symbol of our great nation,''
said Hatch, who chairs the Judiciary Committee. ``The flag
represents, in a way nothing else can, the common bond shared by an
otherwise diverse people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry voted against the
amendment in 1995. Their staffs said the senators plan to oppose
the amendment again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment hasn't been amended in the entire 200
years of our history, and now is no time to start,'' Kennedy said
Tuesday. ``The best way to honor the flag is to honor the ideals it
represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but he said in a
statement after his vote against the amendment in 1995 that it was
his responsibility to uphold the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutionally, the substance of the right to dissent, no
matter how ugly it might be, is at the core of who we are as a
country,'' he said. ``It is what separates us from every other
nation on the face of this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a coalition including 126 veterans
groups, is promoting the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amending the Constitution to protect the flag will in no way
impair with anyone's rights,'' said Marty Justis, a spokesman for
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Justis said those who argue that flag desecration is such a rare
act that it does not warrant a constitutional amendment are missing
the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a question of how many times it happens; it's a
question of how wrong it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura W. Murphy, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the ACLU is firmly against the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political expression and dissension from government are
precisely what the First Amendment was designed to protect,'' she
said. ``We think the American people are bigger than this, that we
can tolerate political dissent in this country.''

INVESTORS COOL TO HILTON PLAN; STOCK TUMBLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.J., Nev.)  (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hilton Hotels Corp. announced a long-awaited
transaction Tuesday aimed at enhancing shareholder value, but
investors seemed to focus instead on the deal that got away _
helping to cause shares of Hilton to fall in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Hilton announced that it was splitting itself into
separate lodging and gaming companies and that the gaming company
would merge with Grand Casinos Inc., the largest operator of
casinos in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the deal _ particularly the split of the
company _ would be good for Hilton shareholders in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   But investors had been betting that Hilton would also announce a
merger of its new hotel company with Ladbroke Group PLC, the
British company that controls the Hilton brand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The splitting of the company is rational,'' said Harry Curtis,
an analyst with BancAmerica Robertson Stephens. ``The acquisition
of Grand is rational. The near-term question is what were the
expectations, and they were a lot higher. It disappointed a lot of
fast money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton shares fell $2.875, or 9 percent, to $28.625 on Tuesday,
as 4.7 million shares were traded. Shares of Grand Casinos fell
$1.50, or 8 percent, to $17.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton shareholders will receive one share of stock in both the
lodging company, which will retain the Hilton name, and the gaming
company, which has yet to be named. Hilton said it expected the
distribution to be tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming company will merge with Grand Casinos in an all-stock
transaction. Grand's small business managing Indian casinos will be
spun off to Grand shareholders and will not go to Hilton. Hilton
said it was paying about $650 million and assuming about $550
million of debt to acquire Grand's Mississippi operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton shareholders are expected to end up owning about 86
percent of the combined gaming company and Grand shareholders about
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bollenbach will remain chief executive of Hilton, which
will be a pure lodging company for the first time since 1970. He
will also be chairman of the gaming company; Arthur Goldberg, who
now runs Hilton's gaming division, will be chief executive. Thomas
Brosig, Grand's chief executive, will be in charge of gaming
operations for the Midwest, Mississippi and other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Berman, chairman of Grand Casinos, told analysts Tuesday
that Grand shareholders' stake in the new gaming company would be
worth about $15 to $17 a share. In addition, they will be left with
shares in the new Grand spinoff, worth at least book value of $2.81
a share. That implies a total value to Grand shareholders of $18 to
$20 or more, not much higher than the current market price.
</P>
<P>
   Combining with Hilton's gaming operations, Berman said, is
``about grasping growth opportunities that smaller companies just
can't reach.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hilton, the logic in splitting is that the company's stock
valuation is held down by the gaming business. In addition, many
Hilton shareholders did not like the casino business and were
opposing efforts by Hilton to make gaming acquisitions at a time
when the casino industry is ripe for consolidation, Bollenbach
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we've got two big companies that are free
to grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that the split made sense and that the
acquisition of Grand would make Hilton a presence in Mississippi,
the third-largest market after Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   John Rohs, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said that Hilton's
gaming and lodging company stocks should trade for a combined total
of $33 or $34 a share based on market valuations for other gaming
and lodging stocks. But he said that adding Grand to the mix might
not add much because the Mississippi casinos will face stiff new
competition next year from Mirage Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts added that Hilton's hotel business, now free of the
casinos, would become a more tempting takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   But Bollenbach said in an interview that he did not think any
companies would pay the price Hilton wants. He also said the
company had no plans to sell off individual hotels such as the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Bollenbach said that a merger with Ladbroke was ``something that
we talk about a lot.'' But it would have to be a stock transaction,
and there are difficulties getting American investors to hold
shares in a British company and British investors to hold American
shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bollenbach said the hotel company, rather than being bought,
would be an acquirer, probably not of complete hotel companies but
of individual hotels that are coming on the market, particularly as
troubled Japanese investors unload real estate.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's deal, the combined debt of Hilton and Grand will be
split evenly between the Hilton lodging and gaming companies, which
should leave both with investment-grade credit ratings, officials
said. This could mollify Hilton bondholders who are wary of
Bollenbach. When he engineered a split of the old Marriott Corp.
some years back, he loaded all the debt into one of the two
companies, causing bond prices to drop.

RESEARCHERS EXPRESS CAUTIOUS HOPE OF BEATING AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ At the 12th World AIDS Conference, some scientists
expressed cautious but renewed hope Tuesday of ultimately
eliminating the HIV virus from the body and thus curing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cure of HIV infection is not a myth, it is a problem we can
tackle,'' said Dr. Roberto Siliciano of Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Today the best that doctors can offer are combinations of drugs
known as cocktails that can drive the amount of virus in a person's
blood below levels detectable in laboratory tests. But that does
not mean the virus has been eliminated from the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered that although the virus
could not be detected in the blood, it was still hiding in certain
cells to produce what is known as a latent reservoir of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dr. David Ho and his team from the Aaron Diamond
AIDS Research Center in New York City first discussed the
possibility of eradicating HIV. At the World AIDS Conference in
Vancouver, British Columbia, they announced an experiment of
purposely asking a patient to stop the medication to determine
whether HIV returned.
</P>
<P>
   However, the discovery of a latent reservoir meant that HIV was
primed to bounce back when cocktail drug therapy stopped. That
discouraged Ho from undertaking that widely publicized experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did the experiment. It was a lesson,'' Ho said. In an
interview he explained that when the amount of HIV ``dips below the
level of detection, we get the false sense that virus replication
is shut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ho, Siliciano and others said that they have gone back
to the drawing board to map new strategies to eliminate the latent
reservoir. In pursuing that goal, scientists are moving into
uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   Although vaccines can prevent viral infections, drugs do not
cure any viral disease the way antibiotics can cure some bacterial
infections. When a person gets over a viral infection, recovery is
due to the body's natural immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   However, some viral infections are latent. The chicken pox
virus, for example, persists in the body after a childhood attack,
to come back as shingles in adulthood. No one knows what
reactivates the chicken pox virus to produce shingles.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of HIV, one strategy is to find new drugs to rid the
body of the last cell of the reservoir. Another is to use one drug
to flush HIV out of hiding so that another drug might kill the
escaping virus.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``activating the immune system to flush out the virus
is something that we have no experience with,'' Ho said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, such an approach would fail if the cells in the latent
reservoir continue to become infected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, discussed another possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that you don't have to eliminate HIV,'' Fauci said.
If the size of the latent reservoir or HIV is drastically reduced,
then the body's natural immune defenses might keep the remaining
infection in check.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of the scientists seeking an AIDS cure knows how many
barriers must be overcome to rid the body of the last HIV, if that
is ever possible.
</P>
<P>
   The current barrier lies in what are known as memory CD4 cells
in the latent reservoir, which forms soon after HIV enters the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, young uninfected CD4 cells emerge from the thymus
gland in the chest and circulate throughout the body in its lymph
system. When such cells meet a foreign invader like HIV, they turn
into a different cell (known as a lymphoblast) and begin to
proliferate. HIV kills many CD4 cells. But some survive in a
resting state in which HIV does not replicate unless something
stimulates it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said in an interview that he suspected that it would take
several courses of therapy to successfully purge the body of the
latent reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the normal life span of the memory cells. To its
disappointment, Siliciano's team found that the number of memory
cells was no lower among people who had taken the drug cocktails
for up to 30 months than among those who had just started such
therapy. The reservoir's stability suggests that it is replenished
by a low level of HIV replication.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ho was less certain, saying that his team had measured
a small and slow rate of decay of the memory cells.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is continued replication of HIV, it might not pose
an insurmountable barrier because newer drugs in the pipeline might
eliminate the virus, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
   Ho said his team is ready to try yet another approach. This
summer he expects to start a pilot study using an experimental
vaccine to boost immune responses. The aim is to determine whether
that step will help rid the body of the latent reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the scientific goal of an AIDS cure, Ho said: ``We
should unapologetically declare that as the ultimate objective,
even though the challenges are rather daunting right now. If I
thought it was completely unrealistic I would not work on it. But I
cannot quantify what the chance might be.'' &QL;

REEBOK DROPPING AD DEAL WITH BASKETBALL CELEBRITY O'NEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an indication that star power alone can't sell shoes, Reebok
International Ltd. said Tuesday that it will not renew its
endorsement contract with basketball's Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaq inked the estimated $15 &UR;  &LR; million deal with the
Stoughton, Mass. athletic footwear company in 1992, it was hailed
as a landmark endorsement for a potential role model with a size 21
foot. Shoes would be designed for O'Neal and named after him, with
the hope that kids from urban playgrounds to the toniest of suburbs
would covet them.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. As sneaker sales have cooled for
the entire industry, companies are re-evaluating their marketing
strategies, and some athletes who once earned millions in
endorsement fees are lucky if they can get free shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a veritable all-star team of athletes has recently been
dropped from the roster of first-string sneaker pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Larry Johnson, Oliver Miller, Glenn Robinson, and
Bobby Phills are among those who've seen fees dwindle or have had
their contracts bought out by various sneaker companies. The same
goes for football's Emmitt Smith, who pitched shoes and apparel for
Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's a rare star who has the cachet and charisma to
sell athletic footwear and apparel, said executive director Gregg
Hartley of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only about four athletes in the whole world who can
actually sell product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them happen to be named O'Neal, whose multi-year
contract with Reebok, the second-biggest maker of athletic footwear
to Nike, expired Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hartley, the athletes who might actually be worth
their huge endorsement fees include Jordan, and golfers Tiger Woods
and Greg Norman, who has his own Reebok collection.
</P>
<P>
   Second-tier stars are another matter. They may sink clutch
baskets and birdies. They may score touchdowns and hat tricks. But
they don't put enough money into store cash registers to justify
big endorsement fees. With second-tier stars, shoe companies don't
always get ``a bang for their marketing buck,'' said editor Sean
Brenner of Team Marketing Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And using athletes always carries a risk of adverse publicity.
When Latrell Sprewell of the Golden State Warriors attempted to
throttle his basketball coach last season, North Reading-based
Converse Inc. moved quickly to fire him as a pitchman for its
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, shoe companies are victims of their own success. A
few years ago, a surefire formula for selling sneakers was pretty
straightforward: Hire a National Basketball Association star, put
him on TV, and watch boys and young men eagerly flock to the malls
to buy shoes worn by their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   No one had more success with that strategy than Nike Inc. and
Michael Jordan, although it also worked for Grant Hill and Fila.
</P>
<P>
   Success brought imitation, and the result was a series of
copycat ads that consumers couldn't tell apart. It got to the point
where viewers couldn't keep straight which star was endorsing which
shoe, said Jim Andrews, editor of IEG Endorsement Insider, a
newsletter that tracks endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence hinted that many kids were
switching their sneakers for so-called brown shoes. Instead of
Nikes, they were wearing hiking boots and clunky footwear, perhaps
turned off by the endless bombardment of sneaker ads.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's little sales data to support it, several
industry observers dismissed the brown-shoe trend. In their view,
sneaker ads featuring stars have run their course. It's time for
something new, they say, something that breaks through the clutter,
something that celebrates everyday athletes rather than overpaid
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They oversaturated the market. So many players had signature
footwear, it was no longer unique,'' said Andrews. ``You can't
expect consumers to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reebok, having many stars under contract was vital at one
point. A decade ago, Reebok was known as a company that made
aerobics shoes for women. When it expanded into the men's market,
the challenge was to convince men that Reebok was sufficiently
macho. To do that, Reebok began to sign up athletes en masse. The
thought was that if sports fans turned on their TVs and saw pro
athletes in Reebok shoes, Reebok would gain authenticity as a
performance brand.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Reebok had more than 100 NBA athletes under
contract. At the summer Olympics in 1996, meanwhile, about a third
of the 10,000 athletes wore some Reebok product.
</P>
<P>
   After years of heavy investment, however, Reebok has concluded
that it has gotten across the message that it's a performance brand
for both men and women. And as sneaker sales have flattened _
Tuesday Nike reported the unthinkable: a quarterly loss _ Reebok
has decided it no longer needs to spend so heavily on star
athletes. Other footwear companies, also coping with weaker sales
and a glut of inventory, have reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been cutting back,'' said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   When sales weaken, one of the first things that companies do is
slash marketing budgets, said Hartley of the sporting goods
association, and that's what shoe companies are doing as their
cyclical industry struggles through the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said it will continue to highlight basketball star Allen
Iverson. But instead of a slew of NBA stars, it will rely more on
some women basketball players to help sell sneakers and soccer
stars with global appeal to market athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson said the current strategy is to
put more emphasis on the shoes themselves than on star jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about doing more with less,'' Fogelson said. ``It's about
a renewed focus on product.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for Shaq over his departure from Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 26-year-old star of the Los Angeles Lakers earned
an estimated $28 million in endorsement fees, touting such products
as Pepsi-Cola and fast-food from Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday his agent said O'Neal is ``finalizing plans for future
footwear and apparel commitments.''

SKIP AWAY SETTLES ARGUMENT IN WINNING STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time and again, he has proven himself. He has won $8.9 million
in purses and is undefeated in seven races under jockey Jerry
Bailey. He set a track record last month while carrying 130 pounds.
Two years ago, he even outran Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Skip Away had left to prove in the
Hollywood Gold Cup is that his victory in the star-depleted
Breeders' Cup Classic should not carry an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   It won't.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away and Gentlemen were eye-to-eye as they entered the
stretch Sunday in the defining moment of a showdown that seven
months ago had been anticipated and then delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen was supposed to run in last November's Classic, also
at Hollywood Park, but an untimely sickness kept him on the
sidelines. Another top horse, Formal Gold, was hurt and didn't make
the Classic, either. The result was that Skip Away's biggest
victory was diminished not by any fault of his own, but by the lack
of quality competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, more than a few holdouts have insisted Gentlemen is
a faster horse than Skip Away, and that over his favorite track, he
surely would have outrun Skip Away in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   That verdict _ or as close as we can get to it _ was finally
returned Sunday as Skip Away and Gentlemen raced in tandem into the
Hollywood stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decisive one. Skip Away looked at Gentlemen and,
basically, sneered at him. Or from the other perspective, Gentlemen
looked at Skip Away and backed down, just as so many other rivals
have done.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen narrowly defeated Skip Away last summer in the Pimlico
Special in what was a sensational race for both horses. But
Gentlemen maintained that brilliance for only three races, and has
yet to regain it. Skip Away, on the other hand, continues his march
toward Cigar's earnings record of $9.9 million, which he seems
destined to surpass, barring a career-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it appears that Skip Away would have won the
Breeders' Cup Classic even with Gentlemen in the field.
</P>
<P>
   It had already become evident that he deserved the controversial
1997 horse of the year award that instead went to juvenile champion
Favorite Trick. Trainer Sonny Hine has cried foul ever since, with
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the season isn't over yet and almost certainly will
be filled with more twists and turns. Remember that in most years,
a racing snapshot taken in June is nearly unrecognizable when the
Breeders' Cup rolls around. Round two of Skip Away vs. Gentlemen
could transpire in August in the Pacific Classic, also a $1 million
race. Silver Charm might join that field, too, if he ever recovers
from his trip to Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   Before Skip Away proved his final point Sunday, it was merely a
majority opinion that the 5-year-old is presently the best horse in
the United States and maybe the world.
</P>
<P>
   Until we see proof otherwise, that opinion now should be
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   According to speed figures, Skip Away runs just as fast as
Cigar, the heralded two-time horse of the year (1995, '96). Bailey,
who also rode Cigar, seconds that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they both ran together, Skip Away beat him,'' said
Bailey, referring to the 1996 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.
``Maybe that tells you something. I have a special place in my
heart for Cigar, but maybe Skip Away is a better horse.''
Two arrivals
</P>
<P>
   Anet and Commitisize, two horses trained by Bob Baffert, arrived
at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie yesterday after a flight from
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both horses were sent for Saturday races. Anet, last year's Lone
Star horse of the meeting who more recently ran second in the Texas
Mile on April 19, will run in the $200,000 Lone Star Park Handicap.
Commitisize is shooting for the $150,000 USA Stakes, won by Anet a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Commitisize belongs to Mike Pegram, who also owns Kentucky Derby
and Preakness winner Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the horses to realize they are no longer
close to the Pacific Ocean breezes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little hot,'' exercise rider Lupee Navarro said,
``but they're doing well.''
Long distance rival
</P>
<P>
   On the same week as Lone Star's June 19 NTRA All-Star Jockey
Championship, Prairie Meadows racetrack held a national jockey
competition of its own. And on the same day as Saturday's Lone Star
Park Handicap, Prairie Meadows has scheduled its Prairie Meadows
Cornhusker Breeders' Cup Handicap, worth $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Johnsen, general manager of Lone Star, is frustrated by
what he claims is a lack of scheduling cooperation by the Altoona,
Iowa, track, where growing purses are funded by a thriving
slot-machine casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's in the best interest of horse racing to
have all-star events popping up all over the country,'' Johnsen
said. ``And I was very disappointed at Prairie Meadows' decision to
have their jockey challenge on the Monday before our Friday. The
Jockeys' Guild even asked them to move it to the week after ours,
but they declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it was a nice little promotion for Des Moines, Iowa,
because it sure didn't do anything for our sport.''
Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm is back in training after the virus that knocked
him out of the Hollywood Gold Cup. ... 1997 Belmont Stakes winner
Touch Gold looked sharp in his first race of the year, winning a
Churchill Downs allowance Sunday in 1:34 for a mile, only one-fifth
of a second off the track record. His first summer goal is the Aug.
8 Whitney at Saratoga. ... Instead of migrating over to Louisiana
Downs, the horses of Lone Star trainers Dallas Keen, Steve
Asmussen, Sam David Jr., Mike Stidham, Kenny Smith and Steve Hobby
will instead go to Hawthorne Race Course near Chicago, which opens
today. David also is expected to run some horses at Louisiana
Downs. ... Cowboy Dan finished second in an allowance race Saturday
at Cleveland-area Thistledown, and now is probably out of
contention for the July 19 Ohio Derby. ... Three-year-old Lil's Lad
is back in training after ankle surgery that knocked him out of the
Triple Crown, but don't expect to see him run until late August or
September. ... Skip Away was also on the flight to Texas that
carried Anet and Commitisize, but he stayed on the plane and
continued to New York. ... The stable of Houston-based brothers Bob
and Lee Ackerly includes stakes fillies Little Sister and
Swearingen, who have raced at Lone Star. But their best horse is
3-year-old filly Jersey Girl, who scored her sixth consecutive
victory in Saturday's Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont Park and next
will attempt to sweep the track's filly Triple Tiara on July 25 in
the Coaching Club American Oaks. ... Potential rivals for Anet in
the Lone Star Park Handicap are nominees Silver Goblin and
Spiritbound. ... Churchill Downs ended its spring meeting Sunday
with an average daily purse distribution of $469,643, plus
increases in both on-track attendance and betting.

 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The warnings that the bubble is about to burst have
been sounded each quarter for the last few years, but investors in
the stock market continue to ignore them. And so far, despite a
series of blows lately that were widely expected to take the air
out of the balloon, they have been right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Asian economic crisis poses a threat to already
slowing corporate profit growth at home. And yes, the recent rise
in wages could eventually mean a revival of serious inflation. Yet
all indications are that the American economy is remarkably sound,
seemingly indestructible, and therefore, investors surmise, so is
Wall Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why, midway through 1998, share prices are once again
hovering near their all-time highs. The investing public, for all
the complaints of the professionals, remains sanguine about the
unheard-of riches being delivered by one of the greatest bull
markets in history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index _ a widely followed proxy
for the larger stock market and millions of index-fund investors _
is up nearly 17 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial
average, the best-known market barometer, is up 13 percent in a
year that many Wall Street pros had forecast full-year gains of
less than 8 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a year well above almost anyone's expectations,''
said Frederick Taylor, the chief investment officer at the U.S.
Trust Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though share prices fell modestly Tuesday and finished the
second quarter with only slim gains of about 2.9 percent for the
S&AMP;P 500, the evidence suggests that investors have not yet cooled
to stocks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are dire warnings that weaker profits later in
the year could send investors fleeing and erase most of the gains.
Or that Asia, already in recession and still on the edge of
destruction, could swipe winnings in Europe and topple American
markets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the U.S. economy seems to be in the throes of what
the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called a
``virtuous cycle,'' of powerful growth, little if any inflation,
low unemployment and rising wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   That's an almost ideal economic scenario that may be
compensating for the gradual slowdown in profit growth, which has
drifted down for large companies to a gain of just 3.8 percent in
the first quarter compared with a 15 percent advance in the period
a year earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This combination of favorable economic factors has been critical
to the market's surge, said Taylor at U.S. Trust. Unemployment,
inflation and interest rates are all low, consumer confidence is
high, and where federal budget deficits reigned, now there are
surpluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole group of things that if you had forecast
them a few years ago, no one would have believed it,'' he said.
``As an American looking at the U.S. economy these are indeed good
times.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with soaring consumer confidence, Americans are rushing to
buy their favorite products _ no less than the shares of companies
that create and market those products.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call investors defiant, narrow-minded, excessively bullish,
naive, or even downright silly. But also call them rich _ billions,
no trillions, richer with each passing quarter. The ``virtuous
cycle,'' for them, is about buying Gap khakis, and then buying into
shares of the Gap and its retail brethren. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for those counting, the current bull market, which dates
back to October 1990, just before the gulf war, clocked day 2,819
Tuesday _ making it the third-longest bull market in history. It is
now just months away from passing the period that ended
disastrously in October 1929.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not even the audacious 1980s can match the run of the 1990s for
durability or distance. In the 1980s, the Dow soared 250 percent to
its August 1987 high, before tumbling 22.3 percent on Oct. 19, 1987
_ Black Monday. In the 1990s, however, the Dow has climbed about
280 percent, including a record three consecutive years with gains
of 20 percent or more. (In the 1920s, the Dow gained 496 percent
before plummeting into the Great Depression.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if there is anything to raise a warning flag about the
sustainability of the remarkable stock market run of the last few
years, it is that the winnings are being concentrated in an
ever-smaller group of blue-chip companies that include well-known
names like General Electric, Dell Computer, Microsoft, Coca-Cola
and Wal-Mart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Americans, along with a growing mass of foreigners, have
placed their bets largely on companies like Dell Computer, one of
the hottest stocks of the decade. And despite its rocket-like rise,
Dell has gained another 121 percent this year, pushing its market
value to $58 billion _ more than that of General Motors Corp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many companies seem protected against even dire attacks by
something resembling a bullet-proof vest. Microsoft, despite the
antitrust action by the federal government and at least 20 states,
has seen its shares appreciate another 67 percent in 1998, pushing
its value up $110 billion in just the last six months to $267
billion, second only to General Electric, which is worth almost
$300 billion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The market value of corporations _ or what investors value them
at _ has been growing exponentially in the 1990s, along with the
urge to merge.
</P>
<P>
   And when corporations merge, or hint at such deals, share prices
soar, feeding the great bull market. Financial deals, like
Citicorp's agreement to merge with Travelers Group for $70 billion,
have been among the most lucrative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see the merger deals not so much as a sign of
health, but as a symbol of a market that is peaking, and readying
for a fall. They argue that companies running out of ways to
increase profits have nothing better to do than seek partnerships
as a way to keep the game going just a little bit longer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the warning signs, the sharpest concerns corporate
profits. The first-quarter growth was the slowest since 1991, and
the second-quarter estimates are for gains of about 3.5 percent,
according to First Call Inc., which tracks earnings data.
</P>
<P>
   A profit slowdown, conventional wisdom goes, would weigh heavily
on share prices, and at the very least, stall the bull run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock prices and profits go together, and through the 1990s,
you've had a golden age of profits,'' said Ronald Talley, an
economist at the WEFA Group, a forecasting unit in Eddystone, Pa.
``However, it looks like that period may be coming to an end. You
can't have profits growing faster than the economy forever, and it
seems that unusual situation is about to end.'' &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Gail Dudack, the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities,
says the first quarter's strong economic growth with meager profit
gains portends a difficult second half of the year. ``If you put
those two pieces of information together, it suggests you could
have a negative quarter later this year,'' she said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed market
strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., says the ``supertanker''
economy will continue to steam ahead, buoying the major indexes
even if many smaller stocks languish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the profit picture, though, could be determined by
events in Asia, and they do not look good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Boeing and Motorola have issued profit warnings,
creating a group of losers circling a narrower band of big winners.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, estimates that the top 30 companies that make up the S&AMP;P
500 provided about half of this year's gains, partly because
foreign investors consider them safe and recognizable. Many on Wall
Street talk about a two-tiered market, a market of haves and have
nots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The big surprise this year has been the focus and narrowness
of the market,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads Birinyi Associates,
a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``Everyone believed that
at some point smaller stocks were going to join in and they
haven't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weaker fortunes of smaller-company issues can be seen in the
Russell 2000 index, which has gained just 4.6 percent this year.
``It's really been the General Electrics and the Coca-Colas that
are getting all the activity,'' Birinyi said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big losers midway through 1998 are the energy stocks,
suffering from a huge decline in the price of oil, as well as
semiconductor companies with heavy exposure to Asia. National
Semiconductor, an S&AMP;P 500 stock, is down nearly 50 percent this
year. The Rowan Cos., an oil drilling concern, is down 36 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worries about Asia and profits were said to be behind the
anxious moments in the second quarter, when the Dow first soared to
a record 9,211.84 in May before falling as low as 8,627.93 earlier
in June, a drop of 6.3 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But with each dip has come a resurgence of buying, and that
surge sent the S&AMP;P 500 to a record on Monday, before slipping
slightly Tuesday. The Nasdaq, despite turbulence in recent weeks,
is up 20.7 percent this year. The Dow, meanwhile, closed at
8,952.02 _ hovering around the 9,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything end the party? Certainly the Federal Reserve
could if it decides to raise interest rates. For the latest on that
front, tune in Wednesday shortly after 2 p.m. for the conclusion of
the Fed's two-day Open Market Committee meeting.

BIRTH RATE FOR UNMARRIED BLACK WOMEN IS AT 40-YEAR LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic on birth rates is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or -1927.) 
(ps) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The birth rate for unmarried black women, long a
focal point in the debate over the causes of poverty among blacks,
has reached its lowest point in 40 years, federal health officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by the National Center for Health
Statistics there were 74.4 births per 1,000 unmarried black women
in 1996, the last year for which complete data are available. That
rate is significantly below the peak of 90.7 per 1,000 unmarried
black women in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report showed that the out-of-wedlock birth rate has
been dropping for all age groups of black women. Demographers and
health officials said that the reasons _ an increase in
contraceptive use, sex education and efforts by some community
groups to encourage abstention _ should allow the trend to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just been no let up, and it's not been slowing down,''
said Stephanie Ventura, a demographer with the National Center for
Health Statistics who wrote the report. ``And it's not just for
teen-agers. For all black women under 30, the declines have been
really big.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures on fertility rates for unmarried black women are
part of an annual report on births compiled by the National Center
for Health Statistics, a division of the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Using data from birth certificates
submitted by the states, the report analyzed the 3.9 million births
that occurred in 1996 and highlighted a number of trends, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer babies were born that year than in any year since 1987,
part of a continuing decline that put the number of births at 6
percent below the recent high point, which was 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of women having multiple births rose sharply, and
resulted in 5,298 sets of triplets, 560 sets of quadruplets and 81
sets of quintuplets. The multiple births contributed to a 10
percent increase in the number of low birth-weight babies since
1984.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smoking among pregnant teen-agers increased, particularly
among Mexican, Puerto Rican and African-American teen-agers, though
overall smoking during pregnancy continued to decrease.
</P>
<P>
   But, one of the most closely watched numbers is the
out-of-wedlock birth rate for black women, long considered one of
the clearest indicators of many problems that have plagued poor
black communities. The decline in that rate is part of a continuing
decrease in the birth rate among all black women _ teen-age and
adult, married and unmarried. There has even been a small but
notable decrease in the overall birth rate among unmarried women,
to 44.8 per 1,000 in 1996 from 46.9 per 1,000 in 1994. That stems
from a drop in the birth rate among unmarried white women, which
had more than doubled from 1980 to 1994 before it began to drop,
hitting 37.6 per 1,000 women in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks is
lower now than it was in the 1950s and 1960s surprised even experts
who follow these trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me about that before these data came out, I
would not have been aware of that,'' Jacqueline Darroch, vice
president for Research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute. ``And I
don't think most people would be either.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Darroch and federal health officials gave a number of
reasons for the decrease in the out-of-wedlock birth rate for black
women that included improved contraceptive use, especially a sharp
increase among African-American women of passive, long-acting birth
control methods such as Norplant, Depo-Provera and intrauterine
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Some health officials also say that stepped up efforts by
community groups to provide sex education or help young black women
abstain from sex are beginning to pay off. And some said that the
AIDS epidemic is causing more black women to take precautions like
using condoms that can also lower the pregnancy rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did scare people,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of
health and human services. ``The remarkable increase in condom use
by African-Americans is directly attributed to AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the welfare system have not been a significant
factor, according to some people who monitor fertility rates.
Noting that out-of-wedlock birth rates for black women have been
dropping steadily since 1989, they assert that the decline started
before states and the federal government enacted welfare reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening at a time when the economy is improving,''
said Kristin Moore, president of Child Trends, Inc.,
Washington-based research and advocacy group. ``We're seeing a
trend that predated welfare reform. so I would more likely look at
the economy as a hypothesis rather than welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the number of unmarried black women bearing children has
been dropping, the percentage of black children who are born
out-of-wedlock remains high. It was 69.8 per cent of black births
in 1996. The comparable figures for non-Hispanic whites was 21.5
percent and for Hispanic women, 40.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers say the government has kept accurate birth
statistics by race and marital status since 1955. Until 1969, the
statistics lumped black women into a category that included all
racial minorities, but experts say the vast portion of births to
nonwhites in those years were to black women. The previous low
birth rate for unmarried black women was 75.2 per 1,000 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said that the percentage of children born outside
of marriage was more meaningful than the birth rate of unmarried
women as a sign that too many African American children are being
raised in environments where they are most at risk to become
engaged in crime, drug abuse, or other anti-social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you care about the link between black poverty and children
in single-parent households, you want to know what percentage of
black babies are born into one-parent households,'' said Stephan
Thernstrom, co-author of ``America in Black and White: One Nation
Indivisible.'' ``I don't think there's been a decline in that. That
would be real news.''  &QL;

STUDY PUTS TOTAL COST OF U.S. NUCLEAR ARMS AT $5.48 TRILLION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nuclear weapons have cost the United States at
least $5.48 trillion since 1940, and for most of that time neither
Congress, the armed services nor the president had a clear idea
what was being spent, according to a four-year study sponsored by
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The figure, which is stated in 1996 dollars converted under a
Defense Department formula, represents about a third of the
nation's military spending and about one-tenth of all expenditures
by the federal government from 1940 to 1996; only non-nuclear
defense programs and Social Security cost more.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent on nuclear weapons, plus money for environmental
cleanup, would buy 290 million automobiles, says an author of the
study, William J. Weida, a professor of economics at Colorado
College in Colorado Springs and a former director of the Economic
Policy and Analysis division of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen I. Schwartz, editor of the study, said: ``Nuclear
weapons were considered to give more `bang for the buck.' '' For
that reason, Schwartz said, policy planners have paid little
attention to costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S.
Nuclear Weapons Since 1940,'' was published on Tuesday by
Brookings, a research center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of nuclear weapons programs have never been compiled
before, according to the study. The cost includes money spent to
invent them and produce them, build the missiles, bombers, and
submarines to deliver them, and to defend against enemy nuclear
attacks. In addition, cleaning up environmental damage resulting
from the production of nuclear weapons will bring the total cost to
$5.82 trillion, based on estimates of what will be needed in the
next 80 years, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission or its
successor, the Department of Energy, were at the center of most of
these programs.
</P>
<P>
   Producing nuclear weapons accounted for only about 7 percent of
the total cost, the study said. Deploying the weapons, including
the cost of missiles and bombers, accounted for 55.7 percent of the
total; defending against nuclear attacks made up 16.1 percent;
targeting and controlling the weapons made up 14.3 percent; and
nuclear waste management and cleanup was approximately 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study group said one reason for the high costs was
interservice rivalry, with the Air Force getting nuclear arms and
then the Navy and Army wanting them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors said strategic deterrence had prevented
nuclear conflict and probably conventional conflict in Europe as
well. Although they said that task could have been accomplished
more cheaply, they did not say how much more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waste is in the eye of the beholder,'' Schwartz said.
``Clearly, nuclear deterrence as a concept and a reality exists.
But there's a big difference between having 5 weapons or 10 weapons
or 20 weapons or 20,000 weapons. Somewhere in there, you stop
getting more bang for the buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money went for projects that failed, like the
development of a nuclear-powered airplane and the deployment of
nuclear bombs under the Greenland ice cap. Far more was spent on
producing nuclear weapons that the authors say were far in excess
of military requirements. Weida, the economist, said part of the
problem was pork barrel politics. Lawmakers were loath to cut back
or cancel production of nuclear weapons in plants in their states
or districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tie between regional economic benefits and nuclear
weapons,'' he said, ``created an inertia which made it extremely
difficult to curtail nuclear weapons programs after their useful
life had expired.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study also said the current annual budget of
$4.5 billion for ``stockpile stewardship'' _ a testing system
without nuclear explosions _ exceeds the historical average for
research, development, and testing by about $900 million a year.
The Department of Energy says stockpile stewardship is less
expensive than its Cold War testing and maintenance program.

ENGLAND FALLS TO ARGENTINA IN SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-ETIENNE, France -- Maybe this is Dante's version of soccer
hell. Maybe this is the price the English are damned to pay for
unleashing their lager-besotted hooligans on the continent.
Spending their blood and their sweat and their tears for 120
minutes and losing, again and again and again in shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again Tuesday night, as England courageously played a
man down for the final 73 minutes only to be knocked out of the
World Cup by Argentina, 4-3 on penalty kicks after a 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult way to go out of the tournament'', said
English coach Glenn Hoddle, after keeper Carlos Roa had knocked
aside two shots, the last by David Batty, to earn the Pale Blues a
quarterfinal date with the Dutch in Marseille on Saturday. ``Good
luck for Argentina, but it's hard for us to take.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in eight years that the English had been
bounced from a major tournament in a shootout, having lost to the
Germans in the semifinals of both the 1990 World Cup and 1996
European championships.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, they thought the gods were with them once they'd
held off the two-time champions for what seemed an eternity after
midfielder David Beckham was sent off in the 47th minute after
spitefully kicking Diego Simeone after Simeone had fouled him. ``I
thought it was going to be our day,'' said English coach Glenn
Hoddle. ``Obviously, it's a massive disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines, who knocked the English out of the 1986 Cup on
the infamous ``Hand of God'' goal punched in by Diego Maradona,
were happy just to get out alive. They had trailed 2-1 after
Michael Owen, England's 18-year-old greyhound, had humiliated their
defense with a mad 50-yard dash. And with Simeone and star striker
Gabriel Batistuta on the bench and unavailable for the shootout,
the Argentines covered their faces after English keeper David
Seaman batted down the second shot by Hernan Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines, who gunned down both Yugoslavia and host Italy
to make the 1990 finals, have a knack for surviving shootouts. But
few inside the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Tuesday night ever thought
it would come to that, not with the Pale Blues playing 11-on-10 for
as long as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``England played the way they always do, very much in keeping
with their tradition and character,'' said Argentine coach Daniel
Passarella. ``Even though they lost one player, we were always
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina had dealt the English a stunning blow in the sixth
minute, going up on Batistuta's penalty kick after Seaman had
tripped Simeone in the area. But the Reds had gotten it back in the
10th when Owen took an artful dive after Roberto Ayala's bump and
captain Alan Shearer scored from the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When Owen, the boy savior from Liverpool, scored the goal of the
tournament in the 16th, taking a ball from Beckham, blowing by
defender Jose Chamot, skirting Ayala in overdrive and blasting a
goal to the far corner, the English were surging on emotion and
adrenalin, boosted by thousands of fans who rocked this
reverberating cockpit with chants of `Come on England' and choruses
of `Rule Brittania'.
</P>
<P>
   It took a span of three minutes for everything to change. Just
before the half, during added time, the Argentines lined up for a
free kick -- and pulled a sucker play. Instead of looping the ball
over or around the English wall, Juan Veron knocked it across to
Javier Zanetti, who slipped around Darren Anderton and Paul Scholes
and fired a shot past Seaman, as 10 men in white jerseys stood
around sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   So it was 2-2, and two minutes into the second half it was also
11-on-10 after Beckham (better known in the States as Posh Spice's
boyfriend) got himself sent off by Danish referee Kim Milton
Nielsen. So Hoddle had his remaining midfielders play back and his
squad stiffened their upper lips and got by on what Walt Whitman
called ``the surly English pluck''.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a goalmouth cross in the 61st minute which Shearer
deflected away and a grab by Seaman on Marcelo Gallardo's corner in
the 89th, the Pale Blues managed little for the rest of the match.
Anywhere they went in the midfield, there was an English pit bull
snapping at their ankles. ``We were aiming for victory,'' shrugged
Veron, ``but with the English on the defensive, the match didn't
seem winnable.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the English came closer to winning it. Shearer
uncorked a free kick in the 52nd that Roa saved. Owen sprinted into
the area in the 75th but ran out of angle. Then defender Sol
Campbell headed one into the net in the 81st but it was called back
for a foul on Shearer.
</P>
<P>
   Had Nielsen noticed what appeared to be a hand ball in the box
by Chamot a minute into overtime, the English might have gotten
long-delayed justice for Maradona's goal. But he didn't, so it went
to the shootout. And when Seaman thwarted Crespo, the Reds crossed
their fingers and looked to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   But Roa immediately denied Paul Ince, and it was even. After
Veron, Gallardo and Ayala had scored for Argentina and Paul Merson
and Owen for England, it came down to Batty, the midfielder from
Leeds who had come on for Anderton in overtime. ``You can't force
someone to take a penalty,'' said Hoddle. ``I asked David if he
wanted to take it and he accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Batty aimed for the left side of the goal, which had been golden
for everybody else. But Roa got there for a clean block and England
was back in its own peculiar circle of Dante's hell. ``At the end
of the day, it's a game of football that we lost,'' Hoddle said.
``And we have to bounce back from it.''

COMMENTARY: MORT, JIM &AMP; HARRY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We're all in a new tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   No one is paying attention to the Ken-Monica-Bill triangle or
the Monica-Linda-Lucianne triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this media hotbed, everyone is now obsessed with the
Mort-Jim-Harry triangle. Mort Zuckerman, James Fallows and Harry
Evans are in a thermonuclear spat over at U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   First Zuckerman, who goes through editors faster than he once
went through girlfriends, decided to dump Fallows. Then Fallows
launched a marathon self-defense. Then, in an effort to prove he is
not Norman Maine, Tina Brown's husband tried to grab credit from
his boss, Zuckerman, for firing Fallows.
</P>
<P>
   These three men are forces in journalism. Not positive ones. But
forces. Besides U.S. News Zuckerman owns The Daily News of New York
and The Atlantic Monthly. Fallows has gotten famous inflaming the
self-flagellating tendencies of his profession. And Evans' last
cultural masterstrokes were Dick Morris' $2.5 million memoir and
those Barneys literary breakfasts. (My favorite was when Evans
invited Hugh Downs to be on a panel discussing Proust.)
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, le tout Fourth Estate is in a swivet about whom to
side with.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't side with Mort, will we never get to play in those
Sag Harbor Literary Softball Games? Will he snub us at the Four
Seasons or sic Rush &AMP; Molloy on us?
</P>
<P>
   If we don't side with Jim, will we lose our chance to
participate in those high-toned panels at the Washington Press
Club, sponsored by the Pew Foundation, on the topic of ``Why the
Media Stink''?
</P>
<P>
   If we don't side with Harry, will Tina say mean things about us
in The New Yorker? Will Harry and Tina stop inviting us to those
intime power dinners at their East Side apartment?
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid softball with Mort and dinner with Tina
and Harry, I thought I could put aside my qualms and side with Jim.
Sure, he had written that pompous screed about journalism, arguing
that political reporters should not look behind the veil at the
White House but simply accept its pronouncements at face value.
Sure, he turned the U.S. Newsroom into a boys' club filled with
Crimson cronies. And sure, Fallows does have a problem recognizing
a news story. Princess Diana's death, for instance, did not pique
his journalistic interest.
</P>
<P>
   But I began to waver when he treated his staff to a windy eulogy
for himself. Verging on Castro-length, the speech became an instant
classic, faxed and e-mailed all over Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was full of Fallows blather about his philosophy of news,
which always gives me the creeps. ``One concept of `news'
emphasizes the most dramatic breaking event of the week just
past,'' he said. Henry Luce made a fortune on that little concept.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows revealed that Andrew Cunanan had claimed another victim.
``To choose an example about which Mort and I strongly disagreed:
the shooting of Gianni Versace,'' he said, adding, ``Each page we
give to, say, Versace is a page we can't use for ... `News You Can
Use.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what kind of news we should emphasize,'' the
sermon continued. ``To me the choice is: last week's news, or next
week's.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week's news? Is this a news magazine or the Psychic
Hotline?
</P>
<P>
   For a profound thinker like Fallows, trends beat news every
time. Zuckerman was reported to be upset over his editor's
downplaying stories like the Republican coup against Newt Gingrich
while producing a high-concept cover on ``How Julia Child Invented
Modern Life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a wee bit offensive how Fallows' acolytes, still on
Zuckerman's payroll, trashed the owner to reporters, saying that
Fallows had had to resist Zuckerman's attempt to let his
ex-girlfriend Bianca Jagger do a piece on Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but given a choice between a Jagger piece and yet
another story on ``Top 10 HMOs,'' I'll go with the ex.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows' faithful told of other bouts that the ousted editor was
having with his renowned conscience, including whether to run a
10-part serialization of Evans' upcoming book on American history.
Harry Evans expounding on American history?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it will have to do until Fallows delivers his exquisitely
sensitive tell-all piece about Zuckerman in two parts in The
Atlantic, entitled ``The Passionless Publisher.''

 &HT;    Brake plants OK strike
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ United Auto Workers in Dayton are ready to dust
off their old picket signs and stage another walkout against the
General Motors Corp. as soon as striking workers in Michigan end
their battle with the world's No. 1 automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of UAW Local 696 on Tuesday received approval from their
members at two GM brake plants in Dayton to organize a possible
strike against GM later this summer. About half of the 3,400 hourly
workers voted and nearly 80 percent supported the strike
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The strike vote means Dayton might be the next battleground in
the ongoing fight between the International UAW and GM. Strikes at
two factories in Flint, Mich., have already closed 26 of GM's 29
North American assembly plants, idling more than 7,000 GM workers
in the Miami Valley, and 162,000 auto workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   GM said Tuesday the strikes cost it $1.18 billion, or $1.79 a
share, in the second quarter, more than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Local 696 members chastised GM Tuesday after casting their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contracts don't mean anything to GM. All they want is to keep
taking our jobs from Dayton to Mexico or other foreign countries
and we are sick of it,'' said Mike Boehmer, a 34-year employee at
the brake plant on Wisconsin Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us could retire and don't really need to do all this.
But we'd like to keep GM jobs in Dayton and give the kids around
here a chance to have decent jobs,'' Boehmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 696 leaders will now ask the International UAW to approve
a five-day strike letter against GM. That letter would set a
five-day deadline to resolves any issues before the International
UAW could organize a walkout. The International UAW, not Local 696,
would decide when to serve GM with that five-day strike notice.
</P>
<P>
   A strike may never happen, but if a walkout does occur, it
likely wouldn't begin until the Flint strikes are resolved,
according to UAW officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikes have already crippled GM's North American
production, so a strike by Dayton workers would not have much
additional impact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a lengthy strike in Dayton later this summer could shut
down GM's North American operations within days, just as it did in
March 1996, when Local 696 members staged a 17-day walkout. The job
action ultimately cost GM nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important the corporation understands that local unions
are ready to draw a line in the sand and make GM live up to their
agreements,'' said Gary Hill, president of UAW Local 696.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM's credibility is at an all-time low all over this country.
People say a strike would be disaster for our plants, but GM wants
to take away 1,800 jobs. That's disaster right there,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials said a strike authorization hurts their ability to
bring business to the brake plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the message this vote sends to our
customers,'' said GM spokesman Jim Hagedon. ``Without strong
support of our customer base, revenue and jobs disappear and the
long-term future of these plants remains very much at risk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two brake plants have been facing the threat of sale or
shutdown unless they become profitable. Documents show the two
plants have lost more than $40 million in the past two years and
projections show they could lose as much as $262 million in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other manufacturing operation, the local
brake plants symbolize the dilemma facing hard-line unionists
trying to save jobs within a huge company that's determined to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The local issues splitting the UAW and GM in Dayton include:
</P>
<P>
   E Company documents show GM wants to slash about 1,800 jobs from
the brake plants and combine the operations into the factory on
Needmore Road. The union says GM agreed in the local contract to
employ about 2,900 workers at the plants until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   E GM wants to eliminate ``make out and quit,'' a quota clause
that requires workers to produce a certain number of parts in an
8-hour workday. Workers sometimes complete the work in five or six
hours, but get paid for a full shift. Because of the quota clause,
the brake plants have the lowest productivity rating among any of
GM's parts plants, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   E Union leaders say GM has failed to add 70 jobs it promised
late last year and the company has violated some health and safety
standards. The union also is concerned that GM is subcontracting
the plants' skilled trade and maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   Local 696 leaders believe a letter from Ricardo Blazquez,
manager of the both brake plants, spurred Tuesday's large voting
turnout and encouraged employees to support a possible strike.
Before the 1996 strike, only about 200 workers attended the strike
authorization vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Blazquez warned his work force that a strike
authorization would endanger the plants' future.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders distributed a letter of their own Tuesday and
blasted Blazquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your actions in regards to the letter are deplorable and a
blatant violation of the GM/UAW national agreement for attempting
to use fear and intimidation as a means to negotiate directly with
our (members),'' said the letter from Joe Buckley, Local 696 shop
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Hagedon said the company doesn't regret sending Blazquez's
letter to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Local 696 is only following the lead of the
International UAW, which is trying to protect its membership at
plants throughout the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   As in many other GM plants, most Dayton workers have more than
25 years' seniority and are nearing retirement. The union's goal,
through a combination of strikes and increased productivity, is to
keep such plants open long enough to allow workers to retire, said
Sean McAlinden, a University of Michigan labor analyst.
</P>
<P>
   If a Dayton walkout occurs, ``it'd be a
`get-me-a-couple-more-years' kind of strike,'' McAlinden believes.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at ending the strikes at the Flint Metal Center and
GM's Delphi East parts plants resumed Tuesday, but no progress was
reported.

 &HT;    Mead on hunt for mill
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Paper industry analysts believe Mead Corp. is
shopping for at least one of rival International Paper Co.'s coated
paper mills, two weeks after the Dayton-based paper company
announced the sale of its flagging Zellerbach distribution unit to
IP.
</P>
<P>
   Mead has clenched its operations around coated and specialty
paper, packaging and school and office supplies. Last week the
company restructured and combined its coated paper divisions, which
make high-quality paper for the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Purchase, N.Y.-based IP has made no secret it is
disappointed with the performance of its own coated paper business.
The company may sell or restructure the division in the next year
or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be significant improvement (with coated
paper),'' said IP spokesman Phillip Giaramita. ``That's high on the
list here.''
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of these events has germinated talk that Mead and
IP are ready to do business again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something behind that rumor,'' said Mark
Wilde, an analyst with Bankers Trust New York. ``The most likely
business Mead would grow in would be coated paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde believes the primary target is IP's large coated paper
mill in Jay, Maine _ just up the road from Mead's Rumford coated
paper mill, purchased two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jay millworker Reggie Tardif said talk about a sale has been
swirling for about a year, though no buyer's name has been
mentioned. He said IP is having trouble selling the plant because
of its massive dumping mound _ an environmental liability dubbed
``IP Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Peter Ruschmeier of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette said he
doesn't know of any specific mills Mead would want, but he knows
Mead is on the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about Mead making acquisitions,'' he said.
``Mead has sold off some assets and its balance sheet is in good
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn McAuley, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman, was
among those who predicted Mead would jettison Zellerbach. She also
thinks Mead and IP will strike another deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say other possible Mead acquisitions include Crown
Vantage's mill in St. Francisville, La.; Weyerhaeuser Co.'s mill in
Columbus, Miss.; and Repap Enterprises's mill in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Coated paper accounted for about $1 billion, or 22 percent, of
Mead's annual sales of $5 billion last year, McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   Coated Paper sales last year were $1.8 billion, or 9 percent, of
IP's total sales of $20 billion, according to the company's annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   Mead officials declined to comment specifically about potential
acquisitions, citing Security and Exchange Commission rules against
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   But spokeswoman Elizabeth Russo said, ``We would like to grow
our coated paper business.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street generated more money for corporate
America in the first half of this year than any other six-month
period in history, as historically low interest rates and a still
buoyant stock market gave fresh momentum to the business of issuing
stock and debt.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied pace of underwriting has helped finance
consolidation in almost every area of industry, reflected in the
record pace of mergers and acquisitions. Companies worldwide
completed mergers and acquisitions valued at $1.36 billion in the
first half of this year, double the figure from the corresponding
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The money-raising boom also channeled funds into start-up
companies and financed investment in technology and production
equipment at larger ones, helping prime America's economy for
strong expansion in the second half, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that this reflects a great entrepreneurial spirit
in the economy,'' said Peter Blanton, an equity capital markets
specialist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``You have people who are
starting companies or companies investing in new growth areas
because of the availability of capital today. That means it is
having an effect on the real economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At just shy of $1 trillion, securities companies raised almost
as much money for clients in the January to June period as they did
during the whole of last year, which was in itself a record,
according to Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has meant soaring profits for Wall Street's
leading securities companies. Many have seen their already strong
earnings growth accelerate so far this year with jumps of one-third
or more in first-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   The question for many on Wall Street is whether the underwriting
juggernaut will meet resistance in the second half. Some analysts
expect that the drop in interest rates this year prompted a
one-time jump in companies seeking to take advantage of low rates
to refinance earlier debt. That trend will not necessarily continue
in the second half, as debt offerings slowed significantly as the
second quarter came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been seeing nearly perfect conditions for people to
borrow money,'' said Jeff Chandler, head of the global debt
syndicate desk at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Wall Street's leading debt
underwriter. ``But I would be hard pressed to say that the level of
issuance is going to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for stock issues is also murky. Many securities
firms say they have a large backlog of equity offerings that should
keep them busy through the year, as hundreds of companies have
taen the first steps toward raising capital on the public markets
and world governments continue to sell the public stakes in
government-controlled phone and energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market has turned choppy in recent weeks and
investors have become fussier about what kinds of newly issued
stocks they want to buy. June was one of the worst months in recent
memory for initial public offerings, with at least a dozen
companies that were scheduled to issue shares deciding to hold off
until market conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a combination of a more flattish market and a more
selective buyer. Things are slower going into the summer,'' said
Thomas Tuft, co-head of global equity capital markets at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Others see new stock issues picking up in the fall, however, as
some delayed deals from the summer and a bulging backlog of fresh
corporate offerings compete for investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   With Wall Street steaming ahead at top speed, there was enough
business to keep every big investment bank bustling. But the battle
to lock up clients and generate fees was as fierce as ever, with
the major brokerage houses fighting for the top spots on the
quarterly league tables, the brokerage house rankings.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Merrill Lynch was the clear leader in
overall offerings of debt and equity. In total, Merrill underwrote
$169 billion of securities, for a 16.9 percent market share.
Salomon Smith Barney was No. 2, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers rounding out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked by underwriting initial public offerings of stock, the
most hotly contested brokerage business because of the large fees
associated with that work, Goldman, Sachs took a dominant
leadership position. The private bank underwrote about $2.5 billion
worth of new issues, for a 22 percent market share. Morgan Stanley,
Salomon Smith Barney, Prudential Securities and Credit Suisse First
Boston made up the top five.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch was a surprise laggard in new equity issues so far
this year. A Merrill official said, however, that a large initial
public offering priced Tuesday, the last day of the second quarter,
would make it the second-largest underwriter for the period if that
deal were added to its total.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, which itself is the result of a merger
late last year, put in a strong equity underwriting performance
after slipping in the rankings last year. The company ranked third
among brokerage firms for equity underwriting so far this year,
compared with a seventh-place performance in the corresponding
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is indicative of the type of equity distribution
we put together,'' said Jim Cowles, head of equity capital markets
at Salomon. ``After the merger, we are bringing in clients that we
did not have before.'' &QL;

RECRUITING GAMBLES PAY OFF BIG FOR UCLA 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Recruiting classes, especially great ones, are
years in the making. Relationships form, trust develops, the
recruit's inner circle grants approval, and a letter-of-intent is
signed. UCLA's 1998 basketball class is no different. The Bruins
made first contact with JaRon Rush, their heralded incoming
freshman, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the blueprint for UCLA's success was sketched during several
closed-door meetings last fall when coach Steve Lavin weighed two
options: pursue solid Southern California recruits like Ricky
Anderson and Nate Walton, who both eventually signed with Arizona;
or try to snare the top national talent (Rush, Jerome Moiso and Dan
Gadzuric) in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins aimed high and missed, they'd be shut out of
replacements for J.R. Henderson and Jelani McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin rolled the dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin understands that to keep UCLA afloat at the level
the program needs to maintain, you have to take risks,'' assistant
coach Jim Saia said. ``We passed up good players to try to get
great players.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight months, Lavin and his assistants solidified
relationships with recruits _ and, equally important, with their
inner circles _ and produced what many recruiting services believe
is the nation's No.1 class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the classes when they brought in Bill Walton or Lew
Alcindor were better,'' recruiting guru Bob Gibbons said. ``But in
the 20 years I've been doing this, there has never been a UCLA
class this good. They did it the old-fashioned way. They earned it
by outworking people. I've rated it No.1 (in the nation). It has
the potential to be truly a Fab Five class.'' &QL; 
Caribbean surprise
</P>
<P>
   In April of '97, Lavin dispatched Saia to an all-star game in
Orlando. By that point in the recruiting season, most coaches
reasoned, the top European talent had been tapped. But Orlando was
the first U.S. appearance for Jerome Moiso, a native of the
Caribbean nation of Guadaloupe who attended high school in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso was easy to spot: 6-foot-10, with long arms and a mature
physique, well-skilled offensively. Obviously, a prime talent.
</P>
<P>
   Saia watched Moiso practice, then spoke with him for an hour.
That first contact proved decisive. Their relationship progressed
through the summer and culminated when Moiso visited UCLA last
summer. A week later, he gave the Bruins a verbal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing him practice and being able to talk to him was
crucial,'' Saia said. ``That's where it all began with us and
Jerome.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso was so eager to begin he asked to enroll in December. But
as a marginal student with rudimentary English skills, his grades
and SAT scores prevented it. He matriculated to Milford (Conn.)
Academy, played his way into the national scene, and crammed for
the SATs. He signed a letter of intent last month and attained a
qualifying score several weeks ago. &QL; 
Persistence pays
</P>
<P>
   If ever a player appeared destined for Kansas, it was JaRon
Rush. The 6-6 forward is a Kansas City, Mo., native and starred
locally at Pembroke Hill School. His father-figure, Tom Grant, is a
multimillionaire and a Kansas booster. Last fall, Rush was quoted
in the Kansas City papers as saying, ``It would take an act of God
for me not to go to KU.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the comment, UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis
walked into the basketball office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's over,'' Dalis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant Michael Holton, who doubles as the recruiting
coordinator, would not surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing God is in the miracle business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks underestimated Rush's interest in UCLA. He visited
the campus in 1995, he idolized Charles O'Bannon and his AAU coach,
Myron Piggie, was friendly with former Bruins assistant Lorenzo
Romar. When Romar left for Pepperdine in 1996, Holton stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Through the recruiting process, Piggie grew to respect and trust
Holton. Even when it appeared Rush was headed to Kansas, Piggie
urged Holton to disregard the reports. Grant's influence will fade,
Piggie advised, and Rush will forge his own path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public perception was JaRon was being groomed to go to
Kansas and just being courteous to other schools,'' Holton said.
``We never believed that. We were patient instead of panicking or
going in another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors. Rush is close to UCLA guard Earl
Watson, a native of Kansas City, Kan., who also played AAU ball for
Piggie. Rush also liked UCLA's style of play, he liked Southern
California, and he liked Lavin. ``He's down to earth and easy to
get along with,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   As Rush veered from his patriarch, Grant, he was drawn to the
Bruins' youthful coaching staff and committed to UCLA in February. &QL; 
The center piece
</P>
<P>
   Northern California recruits Ray Young and Matt Barnes had
signed in November. With Moiso committed and Rush in the fold, one
player stood between UCLA and the nation's No.1 recruiting class:
Daniel Gadzuric, a 6-10 talent of Yugoslavian and Caribbean
descent, raised in Holland, schooled at Gov. Dummer Academy in
Byfield, Mass., regarded as the country's top center prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Moiso,Gadzuric was a known commodity. From Kentucky and
Kansas to George Washington and California, every school wanted
him. Nor did the Bruins have an insider (i.e.: Piggie) keeping
watch over their best interests. Instead, they had to convince both
Gadzuric and his coach, Steve Metz, that Westwood was the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   The courting began in earnest last summer, when Gadzuric's AAU
team played in Long Beach, and he visited the campus unofficially.
After three years on a rural campus in Byfield, Mass. _ 30 minutes
outside Boston _ Gadzuric wanted a metropolis. He immediately liked
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA customized its pursuit. Gadzuric is into Disney characters,
so the Bruins' notes and letters to him included Mickey Mouse
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent one with Mickey and Minnie holding a basketball, and
Dan's face was in the ball,'' said Metz, laughing. ``I said, `Would
you go to a school that does that?' And he said, `Yeah, I love that
stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the recruitment began, Metz, who serves as Gadzuric's
pseudo-guardian in the U.S., preferred an Eastern college. He was
wary of UCLA's distance, the young coaching staff and the potential
problems stemming from Jim Harrick's NCAA violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at UCLA were very open and generous with their
time,'' Metz said. ``(On the campus visit) Lavin went out with me
at night, and we met with coach Wooden and stayed up late talking
basketball. For the head coach to be that accessible was very
different. They won me over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final piece was meeting the players. I mean, how can you
not like Baron Davis?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had impressed Metz, but there was another hurdle: the
NBA. Gadzuric's Dutch advisers believed an NBA contract and
subsequent shoe deal would turn their man into Europe's most famous
player, worth $15 million a year with unlimited endorsement
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Saia headed to Germany to discuss options. He explained the
rules governing college eligibility. (Once Gadzuric declared for
the draft, he could not withdraw.) He detailed the NBA's rookie
salary structure. (Gadzuric would not be eligible for massive
free-agent dollars for three years, at the earliest.) And he
described the declining state of shoe contracts. (Rare for big men,
rarer still for rookie big men.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Gadzuric's advisers endorsed college over the NBA.
His classroom performance improved this semester, and in May the
NCAA Initial Eligibility Clearinghouse certified his Dutch grades,
removing the final obstacle to freshman eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   He's due in town in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that NBA talk was around the Final Four, and it was
scary,'' Saia said. ``It's unbelievable when you have a kid that
good from overseas, because you have to deal with so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to roll the dice.

   CHICAGO _ In real life, Timothy Smith is a ``mystery shopper''
for Taco Bell, buying chicken incognito at the fast food joints and
reporting to headquarters whether it is cooked too little or served
too cold.
</P>
<P>
   This job may have done little to prepare him for his big moment
Tuesday, but Smith, 30, had other things going for him. For one,
his head was shaved. For two, he had the right answer when the
casting director, Julie Ashton, asked him, ``Timothy, how tall are
you?''
</P>
<P>
   6 foot 4, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' Ms. Ashton said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith became one of a handful of men who may just have a shot at
the movie part of a lifetime, the title role in ``Michael Jordan:
The Untold Story of an American Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, television producers have descended on Chicago,
hoping that somewhere in this scrappy workingman's town where the
six-time National Basketball Association champions, the Bulls, are
the municipal religion, they might just find a natural for the part
of the world's most famous athlete in a movie to be made this fall
and broadcast before the end of the year for the new Fox Family
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely we're going to get the Denzel Washingtons of the
world,'' said Lance Robbins, a producer for Fox Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   And while actors across the country have been sending in their
head shots and bragging on their hook shots, ``we haven't seen many
professional actors that could play basketball and look like
Michael Jordan,'' Robbins said. ``We've literally had white guys
submit reasons why they should play Michael Jordan: `I may not look
like him but I can play him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the producers threw open a high school gym on Monday
so that Jordan wannabes could show how they looked on a basketball
court. Several thousand men, teen-agers and boys showed up, some
waiting in line for hours to audition for the boyhood, teen-age and
basketball star phases of Jordandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't want to be Jordan?'' said Robert Reed, 29, a high
school math and science teacher who tried out for the part. Reed is
such a Michael fan that his 5-month-old son's middle name is
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After the aspiring actors dribbled and took a few shots, at the
direction of a former community college basketball coach, and read
a line in front of a camera, Ms. Ashton selected the 30 or so most
promising Jordans for callbacks to a studio Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Parkinson, a 27-year-old firefighter who showed up for
the gym casting call after working a 24-hour shift, was one.
Tuesday, in a dark Italian suit with a red silk pocket
handkerchief, showing Jordan's Armani side, Parkinson sat in a room
full of Jordan look-alikes mouthing a scene in which Jordan, having
left basketball for baseball, decides to respect the baseball
strike: ``I won't cross the strike line, Ron. I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   His Airness himself has nothing to do with ``The Untold Story.''
The screenwriter, Michael Murray, who has written television movies
about the Menendez Brothers and Madonna, has teased a script out of
the many books, magazine articles and newspaper stories that have
been written about Jordan
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't approached him,'' Robbins said. ``But someday, we
would love to have a Michael Jordan meeting. We'd love to have him
bless the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be overwhelmingly favorable, Robbins said,
touching only briefly on his affinity for gambling and a few
sensitive scenes, like ``the fact that he was very very shy when he
was in college, hardly went out on dates, and joined a home
economics class and got confidence to interact with women.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ms. Ashton was quite impressed by a few of the
novices, especially Smith, who delivered the lines with emotion and
nuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you're really looking mostly for, like, acting
skills,'' Ms. Ashton said. ``But with this project, it's really a
look. And basketball skills would be nice too.''

like him but I can play him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the producers threw open a high school gym on Monday
so that Jordan wannabes could show how they looked on a basketball
court. Several thousand men, teen-agers and boys showed up, some
waiting in line for hours to audition for the boyhood, teen-age and
basketball star phases of Jordandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't want to be Jordan?'' said Robert Reed, 29, a high
school math and science teacher who tried out for the part. Reed is
such a Michael fan that his 5-month-old son's middle name is
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After the aspiring actors dribbled and took a few shots, at the
direction of a former community college basketball coach, and read
a line in front of a camera, Ms. Ashton selected the 30 or so most
promising Jordans for callbacks to a studio Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Parkinson, a 27-year-old firefighter who showed up for
the gym casting call after working a 24-hour shift, was one.
Tuesday, in a dark Italian suit with a red silk pocket
handkerchief, showing Jordan's Armani side, Parkinson sat in a room
full of Jordan look-alikes mouthing a scene in which Jordan, having
left basketball for baseball, decides to respect the baseball
strike: ``I won't cross the strike line, Ron. I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   His Airness himself has nothing to do with ``The Untold Story.''
The screenwriter, Michael Murray, who has written television movies
about the Menendez Brothers and Madonna, has teased a script out of
the many books, magazine articles and newspaper stories that have
been written about Jordan
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't approached him,'' Robbins said. ``But someday, we
would love to have a Michael Jordan meeting. We'd love to have him
bless the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be overwhelmingly favorable, Robbins said,
touching only briefly on his affinity for gambling and a few
sensitive scenes, like ``the fact that he was very very shy when he
was in college, hardly went out on dates, and joined a home
economics class and got confidence to interact with women.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ms. Ashton was quite impressed by a few of the
novices, especially Smith, who delivered the lines with emotion and
nuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you're really looking mostly for, like, acting
skills,'' Ms. Ashton said. ``But with this project, it's really a
look. And basketball skills would be nice too.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors may be growing weary of the merger frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives continue to do a dizzying number of deals and
to justify the acquisitions with talk about synergy and the chance
to be really big or really global. But their shareholders are
reacting with increasing skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T Corp. announced last week that it would buy
Tele-Communications Inc., its chairman said that the company would
be ``better positioned for growth'' and that the purchase would
make AT&AMP;T an ``undisputed leader'' in some businesses. Investors,
though, were not buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the effect on AT&AMP;T's bottom line and concerned
about the complexity of the deal, they sent the stock down 8
percent on the day the deal was announced. The stock has continued
its slump, closing Tuesday at $57.0625, up 18.75 cents. It is down
13 percent since the announcement of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T isn't the only company to receive a thumbs down after
announcing a merger or acquisition. Through June 19, stocks of 59
percent of the companies that announced they would buy other public
companies fell the day of the announcement, compared with 49
percent in the first half of 1997, according to Commscan LLC, a New
York information services company that caters to professional
investors. The negativity runs deeper as well: 16 percent of the
deals announced this year were met with a decline in share price of
more than 5 percent, compared with just 11 percent of the deals a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While the largest deals tend to receive a negative reaction, the
increase is consistent during this stage of a merger cycle,
according to Mark L. Sirower, a business professor at New York
University whose recent book, ``The Synergy Trap,'' analyzes why
deals fail.
</P>
<P>
   Investors often punish companies that they fear are overpaying
or doing deals because their competitors are, Sirower said. ``When
the stock price goes down, the market is saying you're transferring
value from your own shareholders to somebody else's shareholders,''
he said. Good news for them, bad news for you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other factors can cause the acquiring company's
shares to fall, including a deal so complex that it is difficult to
evaluate. In some cases, a company may have made so many
acquisitions that investors fret it will have trouble digesting
another company and getting a quick payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sirower says investors tend to get it right. After studying the
stock performance of acquiring companies for one year after a deal
was announced, he found that companies whose stocks were down a
week after the news of a deal tended to underperform.
</P>
<P>
   The high valuations in the overall stock market may be making
investors anxious, said Henry Taibo, an associate at Commscan.
After all, how much more can a company be worth after figuring in a
hefty premium on top of an already high market price?
</P>
<P>
   Consider Roslyn Bancorp Inc.'s proposed $1 billion acquisition
of TR Financial Corp., which owns Roosevelt Savings Bank on Long
Island. When Roslyn made its offer at the end of May, TR Financial
was already selling close to its 52-week high, and Roslyn was
offering a 58 percent premium. The deal valued TR Financial at 29
times estimated 1998 earnings, while other savings and loans are
trading at an average multiple of 17. Roslyn's stock dropped about
15 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to be cranky whenever an acquiring company offers
a premium of more than 15 percent, according to Commscan's analysis
of deals announced so far this year. The stocks of companies paying
that much or more fell about 70 percent of the time, compared with
44 percent when the acquiring company paid a smaller premium.
</P>
<P>
   And all-stock deals met the most resistance. Analyzing
transactions valued at more than $1 billion, Commscan found that
only one-third of the all-stock deals led to an immediate increase
in the acquiring company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Deals in some industries received more positive receptions than
others. When a deal was announced in retail, apparel, consumer,
food and beverage, dining and lodging industries, the stocks of the
acquirers rose at least 60 percent of the time, according to
Commscan. Because there has been less merger activity in some of
these industries, a deal may have a significant effect on a
company's market position, Taibo explained.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted the most negatively to deals in financial
services and waste management, where half or all announcements were
met with a decline in the acquirer's stock price. Because these
areas have seen a lot of consolidation, the prices may be high, and
investors may view the latest change as insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market already knows you're very active,'' Taibo said.
And, talk notwithstanding, is decidedly unimpressed. &QL;

 &HT;    Dolphins' Phillips under investigation
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When he signed Lawrence Phillips last
December, Jimmy Johnson said he would give the troubled running
back very little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one rule - do what's right - and that encompasses a
lot,'' the Dolphins coach said of a man whose transgressions
included assaulting a former girlfriend, drunk driving and
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's one rule surely does not encompass what Phillips
stands accused of having done late Saturday night. Police in
Plantation are investigating whether Phillips assaulted a West Palm
Beach woman at the Brickhouse Lounge in Plantation, Fla., when she
refused to dance with him.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Michelle Black, has a criminal history too. Black,
26, was charged with a felony of aggravated battery with a deadly
weapon in 1997, pleading guilty in October to a lesser misdemeanor
charge of battery and paying $1000 restitution to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's an ongoing investigation,'' Plantation police
Detective Steve Geller said of Saturday's alleged incident. A
report will be forwarded to the state attorney's office, and Geller
said Phillips will have a chance to tell his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Black was sitting in the
Brickhouse Lounge after 2 a.m. Sunday morning when Phillips
approached her and asked her to dance. She said she didn't dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who I am?'' Phillips allegedly asked, before
threatening to ``break your jaw bone and pull the weave out of your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says Phillips then punched her twice in the face, and
tried to flee the nightclub. Black suffered a minor cut to the
lower lip and a front chipped tooth. She would later say she felt
dizzy, and claim that she blacked out momentarily. She was taken to
Plantation General Hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Black's sister, Seglanda Miller, alerted club security, and
Phillips was detained by three policemen. According to the report,
Phillips denied hitting or knowing Black, and ``was somewhat
uncooperative.'' He ``was told to calm down or he may be arrested
for disorderly conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was told by the head of nightclub security that he
would be arrested for trespassing if he returned to the club. He
left with two friends, one of them former University of Miami
quarterback Ryan Collins, who, the report says, ``supposedly ...
offered the victim's sister Miss Johnson $20 to forget the
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether Johnson forgets it, and in turn,
forgets what he said about cutting Phillips very little slack.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' division rivals, the New England Patriots, have
released two players in the last two years, because of their
off-the-field troubles. In April, they cut Phillips' former
Nebraska teammate Christian Peter, who (among other things) had
received 18 months probation after pleading no contest to sexually
assaulting a former Miss Nebraska. Last month, New England released
Dave Meggett, who was facing sexual assault charges in Canada. The
charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, during the Johnson tenure, the Dolphins have signed Clayton
Holmes, Roosevelt Potts, Lamar Thomas and Phillips, and drafted
Hudhaifa Ismaeli and Kenny Mixon. Holmes, Potts, Ismaeli and Mixon
all had previously failed drug tests. Thomas served time on
domestic abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is fond of saying that he is very consistent, meaning
that he treats everyone differently. But Phillips was expected to
get the worst of that double-standard. Johnson took a big risk in
signing him, so he could compete with Karim Abdul-Jabbar and now
first-round pick John Avery for the starting tailback spot.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the risk seemed worthwhile. Phillips got his weight
down from 234 to 216 - he's listed at 210 on the police report -
and until breaking his toe in early June, was making headway toward
playing time. Now he has some explaining ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of it,'' Johnson said in a
statement Tuesday. ``If it is true, we will all obviously be very
disappointed. We will take our time with this to look at all of the
facts. Only after we have gathered all the information and the
facts, and I have had an opportunity to speak with Lawrence, will
we make a decision on what action might be taken. Until we do those
things, no action will be taken by the Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   The police may take their own action in the interim.

 IPO Gives Sagging Silicon Graphics a $60 Million Shot in the Arm   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Remember Silicon Graphics, the one-time world-beater whose
technology made dinosaurs in ``Jurassic Park'' roam the big screen?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company, which now is fighting for survival after frittering
away its initial success, was just made $59.5 million richer
yesterday. Silicon Graphics came into the money by spinning off
about 16 percent of its MIPS Technologies subsidiary, a maker of
high-end computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MIPS offered 1.25 million new shares at $14, while Silicon
Graphics sold 4.25 shares of its MIPS holdings during the initial
offering. The stock traded under water much of the day before
closing at $13.44.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lukewarm reception on a down day for computer chips,
Silicon Graphics certainly could use the extra cash. Chairman and
CEO Richard Belluzzo, a former top executive of rival
Hewlett-Packard, needs it to implement his blueprint for a
turnaround at the ailing computer firm.
</P>
<P>
   And while the majority of Wall Street analysts that follow
Silicon Graphics (SGI) have a dour view of its long-term prospects,
a handful of fund managers and and analysts say the stock is cheap
and poised for at least a near-term rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that Silicon Graphics is the most endearing
company in the world, but they just got handed a check for (about)
$60 million,'' says one hedge-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO dough certainly will increase Silicon Graphics' asset
value. What's more, the bulls think that investors will warm up to
the stock once Belluzzo starts wielding his cost-cutting blade. The
short-term positive financial impact on operating margins might
give the stock at least a temporary lift, the hedge-fund manager
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty speculative call,'' says analyst Kurt King of
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, who rates the
stock a ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a hedge-fund manager and it goes up only a point, I can
still make some money. But there are some long-term concerns for
the business,'' King says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for Belluzzo is to transform Silicon
Graphics from a maker of high-end graphics products to a
manufacturer of network computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   And SGI's share price reflects the harsh reality that new
management has a long way to go. Thus, Silicon Graphics might look
ripe for speculative investors at around $12 a share, just a point
above the company's 52-week low of about $11 &UR; . &LR;  The low point was
January 12, several days prior to announcements that Belluzzo was
leaving HP to run SGI.
</P>
<P>
   After its initial rise on the news of Belluzzo's new job,
Silicon Graphics' stock climbed again _ hitting its 52-week high of
$30 in September. The run-up apparently was triggered by twin
announcements: a deal with Intel to make new products together, and
plans to take a piece of MIPS public.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been downhill ever since. Once the new-management
euphoria faded, investors woke up to &UR;  &LR; company warnings of quarterly
losses and the reality of the company's core problem of entering a
new business segment dominated by IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with such titans won't be easy. Belluzzo has taken at
least one step in the right direction by arranging to use Microsoft
software and Intel chips to build so-called Wintel computer
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost-cutting is an ongoing thing'' and should not drive
the stock, says analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P Morgan Securities in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Silicon Graphics ``could be an interesting little value
play,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   HEADS UP:

 Fast Fall For Maker Of Myst   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
For longtime fans of Broderbund Software, last week's acquisition
by The Learning Co. wasn't just another merger.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Learning Co. represents everything Broderbund was not: A big
mean merchandising machine. Where Broderbund, the last independent
maker of multimedia, built its reputation on innovation, The
Learning Co. has grown to its mega-status by swallowing companies
whole and undercutting the competition.
</P>
<P>
   That undercutting was among the factors on which Broderbund
blamed its unprofitability. Indeed, it's one of the reasons
Broderbund executives finally took the desperate measure of
shopping the company, and selling it at what many in the industry
saw as the bargain price of $420 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a shame to see things end up this way for
Broderbund,'' said Eric Winkler, Broderbund's former marketing
communications director, who now is director of marketing for IBM's
Edmark division in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same sad feeling as someone saying goodbye to a
longtime friend. It took (founder) Doug Carlston and (former
president) Bill McDonagh 18 years to build what was a special
place. To see it go to anyone less than a Disney and at a price
that is so far below the value Wall Street placed on the company
just a year ago doesn't seem to do those 18 years justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler recalled a company heyday in which children of employees
filled the halls, employees brought their dogs to work and Friday
get-togethers built a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   In another irony, in Broderbund's prime, it nearly bought The
Learning Co. That was only two years ago, an eternity in the
consumer software trade. At the time, The Learning Co. was a
smaller, Fremont-based entity.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund had offered $440 million for The Learning Co. at that
time, a whopping sum _ nearly nine times The Learning Co.'s
revenues. It lost out when Cambridge, Mass.-based SoftKey
International made a hostile $606 million bid. SoftKey changed its
name to The Learning Co. when it completed the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to those overheated days, The Learning Co. last
month agreed to buy Broderbund for an estimated $420 million, or
roughly the company's revenues plus its cash.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Carlston, a Harvard lawyer, founded Broderbund with his
brother Gary in 1980. In the early years, it was a games company,
but it soared to great heights with Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego? educational software. Doug Carlston also acquired The
Print Shop, which became another Broderbund mainstay. In the 1990s,
Broderbund scored another hit when it published Myst, a quirky
computer game that went on to top the all-time sales charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderbund basically invented the connection between good
product and good brand in our industry,'' Learning Co. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Michael Perik said in a conference call to
analysts when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund stock soared in those years, topping $70 before it
fell into a long slow decline. It had fallen as low as $15 a share
this month, finally rebounding on the acquisition rumors. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The high-tech landscape has changed drastically from
Broderbund's early days as a barn-burner. Several factors hurt the
company, analysts say:
</P>
<P>
   _It was late to recognize the significance of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _It depended too much on its old hits. ``Myst is still
incredibly successful, but that's more luck than anything they did
on their part,'' said Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown
Whelan and Co. in San Francisco. ``You can't be a one-hit wonder
and survive. At least, you can't survive for long on your past
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   _It just couldn't compete in the new land of the software
giants. The Learning Co. and Cendant, in their war to build market
share, offered rebates of as much as the entire price of individual
software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund officials long complained about the pain such tactics
inflicted. Ultimately, analyst David Cole figures they decided,
``If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   When it competed against The Learning Co., Broderbund always
pointed to the quality of its products. Even at the merger
announcement, Broderbund CEO Joe Durrett said the deal brings
``great distribution, execution and management skills to what I
think is arguably one of best sets of evergreen titles the software
industry's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice he didn't say anything about joining The Learning Co.'s
strong lineup of titles. ``The original SoftKey was known for
shovelware,'' analyst Cole said, using a derogatory industry term
for software that's crammed into boxes and sold before it can be
polished to a higher quality.

 Software's Sequoias   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Two giants are battling for dominance of the consumer software
industry _ and neither one is named Microsoft.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the attention paid to the Redmond, Wash., software
giant, it is not the nation's top seller of software in stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are two contenders for that spot: Cendant Corp., a
troubled Southern California conglomerate that owns everything from
hotel chains to software, and The Learning Company, a Cambridge,
Mass., software firm that keeps gobbling up its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the overall software market, but most of its
sales come from businesses, not stores.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Cendant held the No. 1 consumer software spot.
But then The Learning Company announced its intention to buy rival
Broderbund for $420 million _ which would boost it to the No.1 spot
in sales, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Broderbund acquisition puts The Learning Company one step
ahead,'' said Stephen Dube, senior analyst with Wasserstein Perella
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, each company has less than a 10 percent slice of the $2
billion market for consumer software _ which ranges from computer
games to desktop publishing to educational titles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Their battle illustrates the increasingly competitive nature
of the consumer software industry, where shelf space is hard to
come by and prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the only way to survive the shelf battles and price
wars is to have a huge lineup of titles and hope for a best-seller
_ such as Broderbund's Myst, the best-selling game of all time _
that will pay for the non-hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to look like the book publishing industry,
where it's hard for a single-title publisher to break into the
market,'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry
newsletter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small companies are fine as long as they have hits,''
Tarter said. ``But if they hit a dry spell, they go broke.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such a fate, Cendant and The Learning Company have both
used acquisitions to build large libraries of titles. In fact, both
firms were born from mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company is the successor to SoftKey Software _ a
Cambridge, Mass., company that was created in 1994 as the result of
a merger of three small software companies.
</P>
<P>
   SoftKey changed its name to The Learning Company after buying
the Fremont software firm with that name.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, The Learning Co. has bought eight more firms,
racking up huge financial losses but also ringing up the sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Learning Company racked up losses of $475 million
on sales of $392 million. But at the same time, its stock has
steadily climbed to yesterday's all-time high of $29.63.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is betting that The Learning Company eventually will
turn a profit once it has gobbled up the all companies in its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Learning Company has acted as a consolidator,'' said Larry
Marcus, software analyst at BT Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``We
forecast them to be the fastest-growing market share leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company also has an advantage because it focuses
only on software, ``while Cendant is more scattered between
categories,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cendant is barely a software company. It was formed in
December from the $11 billion merger of direct marketing firm CUC
International and HFS Inc., an owner of hotel chains such as Days
Inn and Ramada, and real estate brokers such as Century 21.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger, CUC had been on a two-year buying spree in
the software and Internet industry _ snagging software industry
leaders Davidson Associates and Sierra On-Line, as well as a number
of Web site companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cendant was created, the company has slowed its
acquisitions, partly because it ran into financial trouble. On
April 16, Cendant shares plunged 46 percent after the company said
it had discovered accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's stock has not yet bounced back, even though the
company fired the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cendant has been leading a software-industry trend
called ``net zero pricing,'' according to David Cole, senior
analyst at DFC Intelligence, a market research firm in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the company is giving away software. For example,
Cendant offers some titles for sale at $29.95 _ and then gives the
buyer a manufacturer's rebate of $29.95, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cendant is a direct-marketing company,'' Cole said. ``They
figure that's a good way to get names'' for future sales prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. has been matching Cendant's deals, Cole said,
but neither side can afford to keep it up forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for companies trying to make money off the software
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts say the companies that can afford to lose
money in the short term likely will be the long-term winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect there to be continued consolidation,'' said Andrea
Williams, Volpe Brown Whelan analyst. ``It's a profitable business,
but it's only profitable for a few companies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``Is it sad because there's less selection?'' she asked.
``Ultimately, the reason for that is, the market's not supporting a
broad selection.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, TLC spokeswoman Susan Getgood said
consolidation is good for consumers. ``To some degree, it
guarantees that the brands that they love and trust will continue
to be available to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that consumers are paying less for their computers
_ which now cost less than $1,000 _ and they want to pay less for
their software, too. Many PCs now come with the software basics _
word processing, e-mail, spreadsheet, database, Web browser,
graphics program _ already included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software has to come down in price to reflect those changes,''
said Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
``There are only a few large players that can afford the cost of
mistakes. We end up across the gamut with larger, more powerful
companies, for good or for bad.''

 Banker Quattrone Leaving Deutsche   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
After months of vehement denials, investment banker Frank Quattrone
and two colleagues abruptly quit the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
Technology Group yesterday, leaving its future in doubt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quattrone and fellow bankers Bill Brady and George Boutros
disclosed their intention in a midday voicemail message sent to
DMG's 160 employees in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the voicemail, Quattrone said
the trio had decided to join Credit Suisse First Boston, which has
a local office in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone, who formed the DMG Group two years ago, reportedly
apologized for the sudden departure, and said his contract with DMG
prevented him from offering his erstwhile associates jobs with his
new employer.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile exodus was confirmed by Macy Egerton, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank Securities, parent company of the DMG
Technology Group in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been informed of their intention to leave the firm,''
Edgerton said.
</P>
<P>
   The DMG Technology Group was born in controversy two years ago.
In what has been called the ``Easter Massacre,'' Quattrone led a
mass defection from the San Francisco offices of the Morgan Stanley
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   What lured Quattrone was a multimillion-dollar offer to set up
his own Silicon Valley investment banking operation under the
auspices of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, a huge German bank that
wanted to buy a presence in the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, dazed employees in Menlo Park tried to digest the
news, which came as a shock because Quattrone had spent the last
few months denying reports that he was having trouble with his
German bosses, and that he, Brady and Boutros were planning to jump
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just sitting here and waiting to see what happens,''
said one source. ``A lot of people are packing their boxes.''

CHINESE SAY CLINTON MAKES FEELING FREE CONTAGIOUS, BUT FOR HOW
LONG? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the week, millions of curious Chinese have sought
out a chance to lay eyes on President Clinton, on TV or in person,
to catch their first glimpse of what wide open democracy looks
like.
</P>
<P>
   Some watched a joint news conference broadcast live on
television that turned into a genuine public debate about sensitive
political subjects, like human rights and the Tiananmen massacre.
For many it was their first such debate, and more memorable for
being between President Jiang Zemin and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Others skipped class to gate crash an auditorium at Beijing
University where the president engaged students in a hard-hitting
question and answer session.
</P>
<P>
   American officials openly hoped that these kinds of events would
promote a free political discourse in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Chinese who saw the president indeed came away
enthusiastic and impressed _ feeling, even acting, more free. But
others cautioned that only time would tell whether this fuzzy sense
of freedom could outlast the presidential visit or translate into
concrete political change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a very good thing and a important step
towards greater openness in politics,'' said Deng Zhenglai, a
prominent liberal magazine editor. ``In the past the Chinese people
had never seen talks between leaders on sensitive topics, and it
helps them appreciate the importance of open discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``So now we have seen that leaders can talk
openly in China. But there's no sign yet about whether the average
Chinese can talk openly too.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews, a broad mix of Chinese people _ from
students to factory workers to small entrepreneurs _ said that
Clinton's frank discussions and the willingness of China's leaders
to openly respond have left them hopeful that China will move
toward a more democratic political system, and left them feeling a
bit freer to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like now we can talk a little more about sensitive
issues like human rights and Tibet,'' said Song Jiantong, a
middle-aged book publisher who was strolling on Beijing's Chao Yang
Avenue under a big red umbrella with his wife, Fang Shuqing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fang described excitedly how she and her husband were
shocked to run across the unannounced live debate between Jiang and
Clinton while channel surfing Saturday. ``I took the debate as a
signal that China's going to be more democratic than before,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still China remains a tightly controlled dictatorship, albeit
one that is loosening its hold. And, Tuesday, as always, many
people in Beijing were unwilling to be drawn into even vaguely
political discussions. More than a dozen older people said they had
``no viewpoint'' on Clinton's visit when asked, even though many
said they had seen or heard about the extraordinary political
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But a younger generation of Chinese does have opinions, which
they are increasingly willing to share. And Clinton's trip seems to
have served as a catalyst for them.
</P>
<P>
   On the lush campus of Beijing University many students said they
took time off from studying for final exams to listen to Clinton
answer pointed student questions about human rights and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   From his perch by the side of the Beijing University's famous
``No Name Lake,'' Xiao Yan, a math major, said that he and five
classmates had rushed from a final exam to watch on TV at a
restaurant, where they had watched the presidents joint news
conference two days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting,'' he said. ``This is something we rarely
see, since most of the news avoids controversial topics, so this is
a sign of progress. There's an old saying, `When you hear from many
different sides only then you understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people have heard both sides of the relationship
speak, they'll be able to form their own opinions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Clinton could not have forced such
discussion if China's government had not itself been willing to
accept more candid discourse. ``The Party is already much more open
than 15 years ago,'' he said. ``It has been a slow step by
step-process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zhao Xingang, a 25-year-old businessman who attends graduate
school at night, said: ``This visit has opened the possibility that
Chinese themselves will be able to openly debate such topics. I
think the leaders are leaning in the direction of democracy.'' Like
many young Chinese, he praised Jiang for breaking with tradition to
engage in such a public debate _ and to permit it to be shown live
on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang Xiaojin, a professor of International Relations at
People's University in Beijing, laughed when asked if the Clinton
visit would have a large impact on the rules of Chinese domestic
politics. ``Maybe on the next generation,'' he said. ``The kind of
influence it will have will be subtle and indirect.''
</P>
<P>
   And some people emphasized that the Party's decision to engage
in debate did not mean that it was interested in revising
longstanding positions, but rather reflected a new confidence that
it could chart its own course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government felt that the debate would not cause an
uncontrollable reaction, and they wanted to show they are moving
towards greater freedoms,'' said a 20-year-old chemistry major at
Beijing University who would only be identified by his surname,
Nie, as he shared a watermelon at a campus stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know how the blunt though cordial exchanges
between Clinton and Jiang on topics like the Dalai Lama and human
rights played in the inner sanctums of the Party compound,
Zhongnanhai. Chinese leaders are never called on to defend their
positions to the Chinese public, let alone to an American public
watching half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese and certainly the hard-line old guard in the Party
must have cringed as they watched Clinton, the guest, attacking
Chinese policy on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt there are some people who do not think so highly of
this, but those people have no impact whatsoever now,'' said Li
Jie, a historian and expert on international relations with the
Communist Party School.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese said that it was not Clinton's views, but his style
and the flavor of the open debate that came as a shock. A number of
urban Chinese have Internet access and Hong Kong cable television
so they have read, for example, about the American position on
Tibet and have seen Clinton utter sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many said they were floored by his live performance in
the television debate. ``Before we had only seen him in pictures,''
said Song Jiantong, of the publishing house. ``We didn't know he
was so funny and easy going. He answered every question. We now
have a better understanding of what U.S. democracy is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiu Ruizhaun, a doctor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Science
said, ``Clinton has the right to talk about issues. It was a good
beginning to see that he was not hostile to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young Chinese said that Jiang, who read from notes, looked
stiff compared to the loquacious American president. But then
again, Clinton has been doing these performances for 30 years, and
Jiang is new to the business.
</P>
<P>
   Although political freedoms are still severely restricted in
China, many Chinese said they felt and acted more free this week
than they had in years. In a country known for crowd control,
emboldened citizens jumped over barricades to get a better view of
Clinton; they approached Western reporters offering opinions _ even
offering their names.
</P>
<P>
   But experts were unsure whether such enthusiasm would induce the
Chinese government to hasten the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's landmark visit might have opened the door to a
possible fundamental transition to democracy in China,'' said Liu
Juning, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social
Science. ``When such a live televised debate takes place in China
between the top Chinese leader and another Chinese person _ rather
than a visiting president _ then democracy will not be far away.'' &QL;

   KOSOVO POLJE, Yogoslavia _ Fighting between Serbian forces and
separatist rebels in Kosovo Province was heavy on Tuesday as senior
Serbian officials vowed to drive the rebels from a town near the
provincial capital and open roads obstructed by rebel barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian authorities blocked reporters from entering the area
of the fighting. But the rattle of automatic weapons and periodic
explosions reverberated from the slag heaps and roads surrounding
the Belacevac open pit coal mine, which was seized by ethnic
Albanian guerrillas from the Kosovo Liberation Army a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Spirals of black smoke rose from burning houses in the village
of Hade next to Belacevac, six miles west of the provincial
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by a convoy of reporters to enter the town on Tuesday
afternoon was met by an angry crowd of heavily armed Serbian
civilians who smashed the windows of the vehicles and threatened
reporters with automatic rifles and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that the
violence in Kosovo was ``unacceptable.'' She called on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia _ of which Serbia makes up the
larger part _ to withdraw Serbian special police units and the
Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army from the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said in Shanghai, where she was traveling with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Serbian attack, which began on Monday, is part of an
attempt by the 50,000 or so special police and army soldiers
deployed in Kosovo to push back the rebels, who now control about
40 percent of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian governor of Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, said on Tuesday
that Serbian forces would soon begin to clear rebel checkpoints and
barricades from all major roads in the province, a push that
Western officials fear could further step up the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The main road from Pristina to Pec has been blocked by armed
rebels for seven weeks, and the Serbian-held town of Kijevo, 25
miles west of Pristina, is surrounded by rebel troops.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy who visited the area
last week, called Kijevo ``the most dangerous place in Europe,''
saying that an attack to relieve the town could touch off a general
war.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen Serbian police and some 200 Serbian civilians
are trapped in Kijevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wait much longer to open the road,'' Odalovic said
in an interview late on Tuesday afternoon, ``especially considering
the situation of the Serbian population surrounded in Kijevo. The
United States and Europe do not have a constructive attitude
concerning this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic League of Kosovo, the province's governing ethnic
Albanian political party, said four people had been killed,
including an 8-year-old boy, and that eight men had been wounded in
the fighting around Belacevac on Monday. There was no way to
confirm the reports independently.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest fighting remains concentrated around Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the province there are daily skirmishes between
Serbian forces, often sheltered behind sandbags, and the rebels.
Special policemen have moved about a half-dozen armored personnel
carriers to within a mile of a barricade of cars set up by rebels
armed with rocket-propelled grenades in Lapushnik, blocking the
road to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   There has been desultory fire and shelling, but the Serbian
forces have yet to crash through the roadblock. On Monday several
houses near Lapushnik were on fire, but there were no reports
Tuesday of fires or heavy combat around the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The three-pronged Serbian assault by hundreds of policemen and
soldiers on Belacevac have driven more than 8,000 people from their
homes in the mining town and the neighboring village of Hade during
the last two days. Serbian officials said the police and Serbian
paramilitary forces had advanced to within 600 feet of Belacevac.
They said the advance had deliberately been slowed to avoid taking
many casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being very cautious,'' Odalovic said. ``We want to
prevent as many casualties as possible among both our police and
civilians. The terrorists are trying to use the civilians as a
human shield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belacevac mine supplies coal to the nearby Obilic power
plant, which provides electricity to most of Kosovo and parts of
the rest of Serbia and the neighboring country of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel army, which saw its ranks swell with volunteers after
a violent Serbian sweep four months ago that was intended to wipe
out the opposition, is fighting to create a separate state.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the two million
people in the province. The fighting has left more than 300 dead.

CINCINNATI ENQUIRER WORKERS SUBPOENAED IN CHIQUITA CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Fla.)   (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In an unusual move, a special prosecutor has
subpoenaed employees at The Cincinnatti Enquirer, which has
apologized to Chiquita Brands International Inc. for using voice
mail messages stolen by a reporter in a scathing expose.
</P>
<P>
   Enquirer Publisher Harry M. Whipple has acknowledged the
subpoenas, but he declined to identify who had received them or how
many were issued.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the newspaper's staff expressed confusion and
some consternation over what seemed to be such a swift capitulation
to Chiquita, the big Cincinnati company controlled by Carl H.
Lindner. Chiquita owned The Enquirer before the newspaper was sold
to the Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer, which has also agreed to pay at least $10 million
to Chiquita, had accused the banana producer of a bribery scheme in
Columbia and imperiling public health in Central America with
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't even understand if the paper is saying the
charges are untrue or not,'' said one young newspaper employee, who
asked not to be identified as he sat outside the Enquirer building
downtown. ``The whole thing just leaves everybody puzzled.''
</P>
<P>
   In its apology, published for three days on the front page this
week as part of the legal agreement with Chiquita, The Enquirer
said it renounced the articles, which they said ``created a false
and misleading impression of Chiquita's business practices.'' It
said that ``an Enquirer employee was involved in the theft of this
information in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas are rarely issued to journalists in the United States,
but some media experts said they were not surprised by the
prosecutor's actions, noting that employees of news organizations
can scarcely expect to flout the law for a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that The Enquirer has said the voice mail was
stolen, it is not entirely surprising that there would be a
criminal investigation,'' said Robert Steele, director of the
ethics program at the Poynter Institute, a group in St. Petersburg,
Fla., that studies journalism practices. ``There are no exemptions
from the law for journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that rare circumstances, such as cases involving life
and death, can create an exception to the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard from the reporter yet,'' Steele said. ``I
want to hear what he has to say about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead reporter on the series, Mike Gallagher, 40, was
dismissed on Friday. He has declined requests for an interview. His
lawyer, Patrick Hanley, has also declined to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Schwarzlose, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University who focuses on ethics, said the action by The Enquirer
was the latest example of news organizations saying they were
unwilling to tolerate unethical journalistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He said the news organizations were trying mightily to avoid
lawsuits, noting that a jury trial could be dangerously expensive
for a newspaper, given the skeptical view many Americans hold
toward the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``News organizations are taking no chances,'' said Schwarzlose,
``and I think its a healthy thing.''

MENTAL ABUSE CAN LEAVE DEEPER SCARS THAN PHYSICAL MISTREATMENT

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The bruises left from her husband's rage have faded.
She's come to terms with the memories of his swinging fists.
</P>
<P>
   But there are deeper wounds _ some Jan Agardy has carried for 16
years _ that haven't even begun to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical abuse I have put into perspective and dealt with,
but I am nowhere near dealing with the emotional abuse,'' said
Agardy, 49, who was physically and mentally abused by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Most physical violence is easily recognized and frequently
discussed, Agardy and other domestic-violence victims said. But the
torturous, sometimes bizarre, acts of emotional abuse are more
deeply hidden and may take years to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical things heal,'' Agardy said. ``The mental and
emotional abuse are mixed with your identity _ and it becomes so
fractured that it takes a while for you to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, Agardy said, with isolation from her friends and
family. Her husband would make her feel guilty for talking on the
phone to friends or family, she said, to the point that she'd
rather not talk to anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   He would also read every item on her grocery receipt, she said,
pointing out where she spent too much money and telling her she was
too stupid to know how to shop correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he would assail her with vulgar language and names
until she was on the floor in tears, ready to call police. But she
didn't call. He told her the police wouldn't believe her because
she couldn't show them her ``bleeding guts.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotional abuse can even be inflicted through a victim's
children, said Monalou Callery, herself a former victim who worked
with the Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence and now trains
others in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband once lined her three children up and forced
each to tell her she was a ``whore,'' ignoring their pleas of
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme as they may sound, these two women's experiences are not
uncommon, domestic-violence counselors say. Other forms of mental
abuse frequently cited by victims include:
</P>
<P>
   Constant name calling, and forcing children to call the victim
names.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing the victim that nobody else would want them.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to take the children if the victim tries to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Devising strict rules for the victim to follow at home.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling finances and setting aside an allowance for the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the victim's freedom by keeping the car keys,
disabling the engine or even locking the victim up at home.
</P>
<P>
   What most domestic-violence victims have in common, however, is
a batterer desperate for control, said Betty Ryan-Della Corte,
founder of Faith House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to control the money, how you dress, or he monitors
your whereabouts,'' she said. ``They do it to control you.''
</P>
<P>
   But a batterer might not stop there, said Marge Di Stasio of the
Sojourner Center. To continue his victim, she said, an abuser also
will work to prevent her from ending the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The batterer tries to distort a woman's reality until she
thinks she's crazy,'' Di Stasio said. ``They wear the woman down
until she doesn't have the self-esteem to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a woman is ready to leave, counselors say talking
to someone is always a good first step.
</P>
<P>
   A woman must learn that she doesn't have to live in an
emotionally abusive relationship, Di Stasio said. But it's hard for
a victim to believe she deserves better when she's constantly being
told that the problem is her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to get sober at a bar,'' she said. &QL;

POPE ACTS TO STIFLE DISSENT ON SOME CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9-11th grafs to add explanation of cannon law and insert
other new material. Also adds 3 new grafs at end of story.) (sw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In one of his sharpest rebukes to liberal Catholics to
date, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday made changes to canon law aimed
at stamping out debate on a wide range of passionately discussed
issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Reasserting the articles of faith that are ``definitive'' and
binding to all Catholics, the pope on Tuesday inscribed those
teachings into church law, and warned that those who dissent would
be subject to ``just punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Roman Catholic theologians in the United States have
questioned Rome's authority on doctrinal matters. In an apostolic
letter that was made public by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope
made it clear that he was addressing _ and reining in _ those
academics.
</P>
<P>
   The apostolic letter was both an act of Vatican housekeeping and
a cornerstone laid down for this pope's legacy. On one hand, the
pope was merely filling a gap in the code of canon law, but his
eagerness to make his teachings as clear _ and as binding _ as
possible was one of the most vivid signs yet that in the twilight
of his papacy, Pope John Paul II, at 78, is seeking to make his
rulings irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   The pope explained he was acting ``to defend the faith of the
Catholic Church against errors that arise on the part of some of
the faithful, above all those who dedicate themselves to the
disciplines of holy theology.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's letter addressed the church's ``profession of
faith,'' a list of essential Catholic beliefs that the pope
reformulated in 1989. All clergymen and Catholic teachers and
theologians are required to follow it.
</P>
<P>
   By inscribing his teachings about the articles of faith into
canon law, Pope John Paul II said he was establishing norms that
would ``impose the duty to observe the truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decree is likely to disappoint those theologians who
had hoped to keep open a discussion of women's ordination, among
other things. But John Paul II had previously made his opposition
to any such deliberations well known.
</P>
<P>
   Canon law covers such grave crimes as heresy and a refusal to
accept what the church considers ``divinely revealed truths,'' as
well as far lesser crimes, but does not deal with those who disavow
truths that the church holds to be ``definitive.'' In a sense, the
pope was closing a loophole that had allowed some theologians to
expound a more liberal interpretation on some issues than Rome ever
has.
</P>
<P>
   The apostolic letter did not specify which teachings the pope
was addressing, but it was published along with a highly detailed
doctrinal commentary written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who
heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and who is the
Vatican's leading conservative thinker.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger's definitions of what constitutes ``infallibly
taught'' doctrine are likely to rekindle debate among the very
theologians the Vatican had hoped to silence. His document
mentioned sexual relations outside marriage, euthanasia and the
ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters, the cardinal warned, ``would be in a position of
rejecting a truth of Catholic doctrine and would therefore no
longer be in full communion with the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences could range from warnings to excommunication,
some church officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not the first time the pope has moved to bring dissenting
theologians to heel. The Rev. Charles Curran, an American priest
who differed with the Vatican on contraception, homosexuality and
other issues, was stripped of his right to teach Catholic theology
at Catholic University in Washington in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Vatican excommunicated a Sri Lankan priest, Tissa
Balasuriya, for challenging papal authority and important
teachings. The decision was reversed after he signed the profession
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Vatican added a category of fundamental truths _
such as the ban on contraception and on the marriage of priests. At
the same time, it broadened the doctrine to require theologians
teaching in church-sponsored schools and universities to pledge
they would follow it. Many American Catholics viewed the
development as a blow to academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a fear that canon law could be used to further
clamp down on dissent. ``The obvious purpose could be to unite the
church, but the real consequence could be to divide it,'' said the
Rev. Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of
Notre Dame. ``The last thing the Catholic Church needs is
heresy-hunting or demands for oath-taking or any finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American theologians, however, were already troubled by a
previous papal apostolic letter in 1994 forbidding the ordination
of women. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith
issued a document in 1995 insisting that the pope's ruling on the
matter was ``infallibly taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Catholic Theological Society of America
challenged that interpretation and asked the Vatican for further
study of the question. On Tuesday, the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith, which published a ``doctrinal commentary,''
alongside the papal decree, specifically cited the ban on women
becoming priests as an example of doctrine that is ``infallibly
taught.'' That doctrine, among others, was enshrined in canon law
by Tuesday's decree.
</P>
<P>
   And that is likely to disappoint many American theologians.
``Church documents have to be read very carefully, but on the face
of it, this appears to be quite troubling,'' said Dr. Jon Nilson, a
professor at Loyola University in Chicago, and a member of the
Catholic Theological Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's ordination is at the forefront of issues in the
process of reconciliation with other Christian churches. If you are
serious about unity within the churches, you have to keep open
discussion of women's ordination.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs that reconciliation with Protestant
faiths was not paramount in Ratzinger's mind. In his list of
articles of faith that are ``definitively held'' by the church and
therefore ``infallibly taught,'' the cardinal included the
declaration by Pope Leo XIII on the ``invalidity of Anglican
ordinations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic Church does not in fact recognize Anglican
ordinations, it has made huge strides at ecumenical reconciliation
with its sister church. The timing of the reference was awkward: a
few weeks before 800 Anglican bishops, who include women, meet at
the Lambeth Conference, which takes place once every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That touches a pretty tender nerve,'' said the Rev. Francis
Sullivan, a Jesuit who teaches in the theology department of Boston
College. ``The fact that he would include the declaration of
invalidity as an example of what is infallibly taught is going to
raise a reaction from our Anglican brethren _ and from many
Catholics.''

MENTAL ABUSE CAN LEAVE DEEPER SCARS THAN PHYSICAL MISTREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GINGER SCOTT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The bruises left from her husband's rage have faded.
She's come to terms with the memories of his swinging fists.
</P>
<P>
   But there are deeper wounds _ some Jan Agardy has carried for 16
years _ that haven't even begun to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical abuse I have put into perspective and dealt with,
but I am nowhere near dealing with the emotional abuse,'' said
Agardy, 49, who was physically and mentally abused by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Most physical violence is easily recognized and frequently
discussed, Agardy and other domestic-violence victims said. But the
torturous, sometimes bizarre, acts of emotional abuse are more
deeply hidden and may take years to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical things heal,'' Agardy said. ``The mental and
emotional abuse are mixed with your identity _ and it becomes so
fractured that it takes a while for you to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, Agardy said, with isolation from her friends and
family. Her husband would make her feel guilty for talking on the
phone to friends or family, she said, to the point that she'd
rather not talk to anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   He would also read every item on her grocery receipt, she said,
pointing out where she spent too much money and telling her she was
too stupid to know how to shop correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he would assail her with vulgar language and names
until she was on the floor in tears, ready to call police. But she
didn't call. He told her the police wouldn't believe her because
she couldn't show them her ``bleeding guts.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotional abuse can even be inflicted through a victim's
children, said Monalou Callery, herself a former victim who worked
with the Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence and now trains
others in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband once lined her three children up and forced
each to tell her she was a ``whore,'' ignoring their pleas of
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme as they may sound, these two women's experiences are not
uncommon, domestic-violence counselors say. Other forms of mental
abuse frequently cited by victims include:
</P>
<P>
   Constant name calling, and forcing children to call the victim
names.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing the victim that nobody else would want them.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to take the children if the victim tries to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Devising strict rules for the victim to follow at home.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling finances and setting aside an allowance for the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the victim's freedom by keeping the car keys,
disabling the engine or even locking the victim up at home.
</P>
<P>
   What most domestic-violence victims have in common, however, is
a batterer desperate for control, said Betty Ryan-Della Corte,
founder of Faith House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to control the money, how you dress, or he monitors
your whereabouts,'' she said. ``They do it to control you.''
</P>
<P>
   But a batterer might not stop there, said Marge Di Stasio of the
Sojourner Center. To continue his victim, she said, an abuser also
will work to prevent her from ending the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The batterer tries to distort a woman's reality until she
thinks she's crazy,'' Di Stasio said. ``They wear the woman down
until she doesn't have the self-esteem to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a woman is ready to leave, counselors say talking
to someone is always a good first step.
</P>
<P>
   A woman must learn that she doesn't have to live in an
emotionally abusive relationship, Di Stasio said. But it's hard for
a victim to believe she deserves better when she's constantly being
told that the problem is her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to get sober at a bar,'' she said. &QL;

HOLOCAUST SCHOLAR QUITS MUSEUM POST  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expressing ``deep regret,'' the United States
Holocaust Museum Tuesday accepted the resignation of John Roth,
whose appointment as the head of a new center for Holocaust
scholarship ran into severe criticism from some Jewish groups who
said he had made inappropriate comments about the Holocaust and who
campaigned for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Roth, chairman of the department of philosophy and
religious studies at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont,
Calif., said their campaign against Roth had paid off and they
praised him for resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials said in a statement they were ``saddened'' by
Roth's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's resignation comes after several weeks of controversy in
which some Jewish groups said Roth, in articles written years ago,
made inappropriate analogies involving the Holocaust. For instance,
they criticized him for comparing, in a 1988 article, the treatment
of Jews in Nazi Germany to Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Roth had been working with museum officials to establish within
the museum an international Center of Advanced Holocaust Studies,
which would train scholars in Holocaust research.

ARTHUR LEVINE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having quietly expanded its research operations and
recruited a new crop of scientists since it was embroiled in a
research fraud case seven years ago, Rockefeller University, the
biomedical research institution in Manhattan, has selected a
prominent cancer researcher as its next president, university
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Levine, who is credited with establishing and then
expanding Princeton University's molecular biology department
during 12 years as chairman, will assume the post Wednesday,
becoming the university's eighth president. He has served as
chairman of an independent review panel on Federal AIDS research
funding since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Dr. Torsten Wiesel, a neurobiologist and Nobel Prize
winner who has served as president since 1991, after his
predecessor, Dr. David Baltimore, a molecular biologist and Nobel
laureate, stepped down amid a debate over his defense of a
colleague who was accused of writing a scientific report containing
fabricated data. Two years ago, a federal appeals panel dismissed
charges of scientific misconduct against the author of the article,
Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari. Baltimore, never accused of fraud
himself, is now president of the California Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel, who will continue his research at Rockefeller, is widely
regarded as having restored stability at the university. A
soft-spoken man with a reputation for diplomacy, Wiesel has
attracted $180 million in private research grants to the
university, significantly expanded the number of research
laboratories and recruited new faculty members, from renowned
scientists like the AIDS specialist Dr. David Ho to promising
younger researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a tremendous renewal of faculty strength under
Torsten's leadership,'' said Stephen Burley, a professor of
molecular biophysics who is chairman of the university's faculty
senate. ``I think it's going to be a tough act to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Trustees and faculty members interviewed Tuesday said they were
drawn to Levine's reputation as a scientist _ he discovered a
protein molecule that inhibits the development of cancer tumors _
as well as his record in administering departments at Princeton
and, before that, at the State University at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. became chairman of the
Stony Brook microbiology department in 1979, and five years later
became the founding chairman of Princeton's molecular biology
department. Over the next 12 years, he oversaw the development of
two research laboratories at Princeton and expanded the department
to 35 faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Furlaud, the outgoing chairman of Rockefeller's board of
trustees, said, ``The trustees wanted an excellent scientist who is
recognized as such but also an excellent administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Furlaud said, will be responsible for
overseeing the growth of the university as it approaches its 100th
anniversary in 2002 and for drawing younger scientists to replenish
the existing crop of senior faculty members approaching retirement.
Moreover, because research like the human genome project is fueling
radical new developments in biology, Levine will have to help the
biomedical institution keep pace by attracting specialists in
quantitative fields, including physics, mathematics and computer
science.

SOCIAL SECURITY'S FUTURE, AND GORE'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the prospect of trying to fix Social Security
gives heartburn to nearly all politicians, it could be downright
ulcerating for Vice President Al Gore. His role in any solution to
the retirement system's looming financial problems could prove
either a tremendous accomplishment or a heavy burden going into the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton, insuring Social Security's viability for
the 21st century is an overriding goal, but one for the history
books. With no elections in his future, he can afford to cut
benefits, raise taxes or tinker with the basic structure of what is
arguably the most successful of government programs.
</P>
<P>
   It is tougher for Gore, who will be the host of a
town-hall-style debate on Social Security in Cranston, R.I., on
Wednesday. He has to keep his eye on key constituencies like
organized labor, the elderly and other groups that want to keep
Social Security more or less intact, while at the same time
recognizing that many Americans are eager for a chance to invest
some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Already other presidential hopefuls are staking out positions.
Most striking are the emerging differences among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional liberals like Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri
want to keep the current guaranteed government retirement benefit
intact, although they would consider allowing the Social Security
system itself to seek higher investment returns by investing in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is challenging party orthodoxy by
advocating the establishment of private investment accounts
financed by a portion of payroll taxes. Kerrey sees the accounts as
a way of helping people at the bottom of the income scale to amass
more wealth along with those at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. John R. Kasich
of Ohio are also coalescing around some version of private
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Rhode Island debate _ the second in a series
organized at Clinton's urging by the American Association of
Retired Persons and the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group
_ Gore will remain studiously neutral.
</P>
<P>
   His cautious nature might have kept him out of the ideological
fray anyway. But in this case his role was dictated by Clinton, who
wants to spend this year letting all sides in the debate slug it
out before weighing in with a plan of his own at a White House
conference in December.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential opponents in the presidential race ahead are
already suggesting that they are more willing than Gore to make
tough choices and offer innovative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more risk in riding the fence on this one than on most
issues, because it could prove to be a razor-wire fence,'' said
Steve Jarding, Kerrey's national political director. ``No matter
who the candidates are, you'd better lead on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats suggest that Gore will suffer, especially in the
primaries, if he strays too far from the party's liberal base and
goes along with Clinton and the Republican Congress in any plan
that reduces Social Security's role as a poverty fighter for the
elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say he will play a high-profile role in reaching
a bipartisan consensus when Congress gets down to serious work on
the issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the predominant issue in the
national debate in 1999, and Al Gore plans to be right in the heart
of it,'' a senior adviser to Gore said Tuesday. ``People say Gore's
going to run and hide. That's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say that in internal debates Gore
advocates gutsy approaches to dealing with long-term entitlement
costs regardless of the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he and Clinton could find a way to stake out middle
ground between the varying approaches. One option favored by the
Gore camp would keep the basic Social Security system intact but
create voluntary private accounts for people who wanted a chance to
invest more for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come in between Kasich and Gephardt,'' said one
administration official, ``it plays well for Al Gore.''

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Klesko probably will not go on DL
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Braves are going to try to play
short-handed until the All-Star break, which shouldn't pose a
problem. They've been doing it much of the first half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The team has postponed any decision to place Ryan Klesko
(appendicitis) on the disabled list, in hopes that he would be able
to return to action before the 15-day inactive period expires. That
decision was contingent on the return of Andres Galarraga (sore
lower back), who played Tuesday for the first time in six days _
and homered in his first two at-bats. That means the Braves will be
down to 24 healthy players until after the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can cope,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``We've been
playing most of the year with 22 or 23 anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   That's in reference to nagging injuries to Walt Weiss
(hamstring), Keith Lockhart (shoulder) and Galarraga. But the
team's dilemma is also linked to the talent remaining at Class AAA
Richmond. Outfielder Damon Hollins could get his second call-up of
the season, but beyond filling out the bench, would hardly see
action. Class AA Greenville outfielder George Lombard (.332, 14 HR,
33 RBIs) would be a candidate for elevation, but he has been
sidelined with a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryno could play in 10 days,'' Cox said. ``That's right after
the All-Star break (July 9). He could be back in time for four
games with the Marlins and then go right into the series with the
Mets. If we disable him, he'd miss all those games with the
Marlins.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's appendix was removed Monday by Dr. Joe Mims via
arthroscope, which reduces the traditional recuperation time from a
month down to a week to 10 days. He could be released from Piedmont
Hospital today.
</P>
<P>
   Walt's wait
</P>
<P>
   After Weiss finished second in AL All-Star balloting for
shortstops in 1989, he figured it might just take time to make the
team. But that notion gradually faded through low finishes to the
point that he conceded he'd never be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it in the past,'' he said, ``but I got to
the point now where I just accepted the fact that I was never going
to play in an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   That changes next Tuesday when he starts for the NL in Denver,
but that news was secondary to the improving condition of son
Brody, 3, who is fighting an E. coli infection. Not only was he
upgraded to fair condition Monday, but doctors at Scottish Rite
Childrens Medical Center could conclude his dialysis treatments
today. At the current rate of progress, Brody could go home this
weekend. Chipper Jones was gratified at being voted the NL's
starting third baseman, at the All-Star but objected when it was
suggested that the balloting hinted a changing of the guard among
the league's top third basemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because if (San Diego's Ken) Caminti is healthy, he's
still probably the premier third baseman, as far as being able to
do it all,'' Jones said. ``He's a Gold Glover. He's been a National
League MVP. Obviously, his numbers are pretty good year in and year
out. When I compare third basemen around the league, Caminiti's is
the statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez took his first crack at DH Tuesday night.
Intricate strategy? ``There's nobody left,'' said Perez.
``Everybody's hurt.'' ... To restock a dwidling roster in Richmond,
the Braves signed former farmhand Andy Tomberlin Tuesday. After
lasting seven years in thesystem without reaching Atlanta,
Tomberlin, 31, had drifted through four organizations since 1993
before being released June 22 by Detroit.

 &HT;    Defensive end Goodloe plans to transfer from Texas
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Backup defensive end Will Goodloe has been
released from his scholarship at the University of Texas and plans
to transfer, the school confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodloe, a junior who did not go through spring drills because
of family concerns, had planned to return in the fall but decided
he needed a fresh start elsewhere, he told school officials.
Goodloe returned to his hometown of Spring Valley, Calif., to
contemplate his next move. He could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch, 275-pounder entered the preseason last year
as the projected starter but lost the job in camp. He played
sparingly during the season, making 11 tackles in nine games.
During the spring he reduced his class load to help care for his
wife, who had complications during childbirth, and was ineligible
to go through spring drills. He was projected as a backup in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Goodloe, a consensus top-100 national recruit who also received
basketball offers from Villanova, Southern California and Tulsa,
made 14 tackles in 12 games as a freshman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry the situation did not work out for Will at the
University of Texas,'' Coach Mack Brown said in a statement. ``But
we wish him the best of luck as he continues his college
education.''

   SHANGHAI _ President Clinton, in a concession to Beijing, stated
formally on Tuesday that the United States did not support
independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, which considers Taiwan a breakaway
province that should be politically reunited with the mainland, had
pressed Clinton to state the American policy while he was on
Chinese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior officials
have expressed the carefully worded three-part American position on
this trip and on other occasions. But it was important to Beijing
that the words come from the president himself, and he obliged
during a round-table discussion with Shanghai residents today.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from Wu Xinbo, a professor in the
American Studies Institute at Fudan University here, Clinton said
that he had told Jiang Zemin, China's president, that American
policy on Taiwan remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating what has come to be known as ``the three no's,''
Clinton said: ``I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy,
which is that we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two
Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan
should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a
requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan reacted harshly, even though Clinton's words were the
same careful formula that American officials have used before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Chinese Communists have no rights and
are in no position to conduct bilateral talks on anything related
to our affairs,'' said Roy Wu, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable debate about how new Clinton's statement
is. The ``three no's'' formula was publicly used last fall by the
State Department, which viewed it as a reiteration of longstanding
policy. But some scholars and supporters of Taiwan say the formula,
as it was expressed then, was more detailed and restrictive than
past statements, and they called on Clinton to disavow it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials traveling with Clinton tried to minimize the
importance of the president's statement. The president told the
same thing to Jiang, they said, and there was no intention of
putting the statement in a written communique, a move that would
give the words more weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president himself had indicated prior to coming here that
he would reaffirm longstanding U.S. policy, and he did so,'' said
Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman. ``And I believe during the
course of this visit we've made it clear both publicly and
privately that we hope the people of Taiwan and the people of the
People's Republic find an amicable resolution to the question of
Taiwan. And that obviously would be a useful outcome of
cross-strait dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also noted that the president had restated American
policy toward Taiwan in an answer to a question during an
appearance at Beijing University on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At that event, Clinton said: ``First of all, the United States
policy is not an obstacle to the peaceful reunification of China
and Taiwan. Our policy is embodied in the three communiques and in
the Taiwan Relations Act. Our country recognized China and embraced
a one-China policy almost 20 years ago. And I reaffirmed our
one-China policy to President Jiang in our meetings.''

YANKS FAIL TO LAND ALL-STAR STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JACK CURRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fans who punch the holes in the All-Star ballots
were not overly impressed with the individual players on the best
team in the major leagues, since the Yankees did not have any
starters voted to the American League team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This was not as shocking as it may sound, because the Yankees
have exemplified a team concept and do not really have one standout
player, like a Juan Gonzalez. They have a handful of stars.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez, shortstop Derek Jeter and second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch each finished second while third baseman
Scott Brosius, who might deserve the honor more than any other
Yankee position player, finished third. The pitchers and reserves
will be selected Wednesday, and Joe Torre is expecting three to
five Yankees to make the team for next Tuesday night's game in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The manager did not feel snubbed by the lack of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, we didn't have anybody in the top 10 in the MVP
voting,'' Torre said. ``If that's any indication what this means,
that's OK. If you're using that as a barometer, it's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Torre wants his players to be lauded for their
achievements, he emphasized that they are focused on team goals
instead of personal ones like the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Torre spoke with Cleveland's Mike Hargrove, who will pick the
rest of the team, and obviously lobbied for David Wells (who is on
schedule to possibly start the game), David Cone, Paul O'Neill (who
finished sixth among the outfielders), Brosius and Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Like Torre, the Yankees were not forlorn about being overlooked
in the starting lineup. The Yankees possess a selfless personality,
and grousing about missing out on the All-Star team is as foreign
to them as three straight batters swinging at the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids pick up the ballot card and vote for the biggest
names they know from Nintendo,'' O'Neill said. ``My son does that.
I did that when I was a kid. I wanted to see Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius added, ``I think if you ask anybody on this team, the
recognition they're interested in is playing on a World Series
team, not an All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had crept ahead of Cleveland's Jim Thome in the
voting last week, seemed relieved that he had lost by 200,000 votes
because he wants to rest his shoulder injury. The absence of
himself or any Yankees in the lineup did not bother Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez and the types of
seasons that they are having,'' said Martinez, referring to the
Seattle center fielder and the shortstop who will be starters.
Griffey has 32 homers and 71 runs batted in and Rodriguez has 27
homers and 66 RBI. ``I'd say they would trade places with us to be
where we are in the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cone and Wells both entered Tuesday night's game with the
Phillies with 10 victories, they appear to be cinches to make
Hargrove's pitching staff. O'Neill was the first name Torre
mentioned as a Yankee who should be on the team, Brosius has
probably been the best all-round third baseman in the league and
Jeter was being trumpeted as a most-valuable-player candidate
before straining his abdominal muscle in June.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Jeter is most likely to be bypassed because
Hargrove is sure to pick Omar Vizquel, the Cleveland shortstop,
over the matinee idol as a backup to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter,'' Jeter said. ``People on this team
want to win. Everyone wants to be on the All-Star team, but we have
an ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That takes place in October, not July.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernie Williams, who is on the disabled list with a strained
right knee and who has been rehabilitating in Tampa, Fla., will
join the Yankees on Wednesday. Joe Torre said it is unlikely that
Williams will play until after the All-Star Game, but he wants the
center fielder around the Yankees. ``We're home for a week and I
want him to get back in the team stuff,'' Torre said. ``Hang around
with the guys and be here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chili Davis, who is also on the disabled list following right
ankle surgery in April, was at the Stadium on Tuesday and might
return in a month. The American League has not yet ruled on Mike
Stanton's appeal of his five-game suspension. Torre was unsure when
a decision would be rendered and said there is a chance the league
might want Stanton to serve the suspension vs. American League
teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ When catcher Joe Girardi, who is essentially a backup, was
told he had finished third in the All-Star balloting, he said,
``That's funny.'' &QL;

EWING SAYS OWNERS CAUSE LABOR WOES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night that the National Basketball Association shut down
for business, the Knicks' Patrick Ewing blamed free-spending
franchises for the league's contentious labor situation, but
offered few solutions for a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners talk about wanting cost certainty,'' said Ewing,
president of the players association. ``Well, they have cost
certainty. They're the ones with the checkbooks. If they feel that
Patrick Ewing or Michael Jordan or whoever is not worth what
they're paying them, then they have the right to say, `No, this is
all we can pay you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's up to us, move on, go to another team and get what's
right. In what walk of life are limitations put on workers as to
how much they can be compensated? Wall Street? No. Why should we be
any different?''
</P>
<P>
   The owner-imposed lockout began at midnight after the collective
bargaining agreement expired. Teams are prohibited from negotiating
with, signing or trading players until a new labor agreement is
signed. Financially conscious franchises participated in a flurry
of activity Tuesday before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   _The Philadelphia 76ers bought out the remaining $5.6 million of
Derrick Coleman's contract, making the enigmatic forward a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   _The Orlando Magic waived the veteran point guard Mark Price.
</P>
<P>
   _The Seattle SuperSonics released the 37-year-old shooting guard
Dale Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   _The Boston Celtics let go point guard Tyus Edney.
</P>
<P>
   _The Dallas Mavericks came to terms with their No. 1 draft pick,
Dirk Nowitzki, who considered playing in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If the lockout lasts into the season, NBC and Turner Sports
would pay full rights fees, but would recoup their losses in
different ways. NBC would recoup fees that go to lost games by
paying less over the next three seasons. Turner, which carries NBA
games on the cable networks TNT and TBS, would add more games to
its combined three-night schedule to make up for missed telecasts.
If the lockout is long, a fourth night could be added.
</P>
<P>
   With no negotiations scheduled and both sides preparing for a
long battle that could lead to lost games for the first time in
league history, Tuesday was a day for teams to wrap up loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Charles Barkley moved up a hernia operation that was
supposed to performed later in the month so he could be treated by
a team doctor. In New Jersey, Keith Van Horn worked out at the
Nets' facilities for perhaps the last time this summer. And across
the river in New York, Ewing, the Knicks' franchise center was
playing up themes of unity among the 400-plus players.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing spoke as one of his oil paintings was unveiled at a hotel
in Manhattan Tuesday during a private art exhibit. He did not sound
like a player whose union was about to make concessions soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to be done? I'm not really sure,'' Ewing said.
``They feel they want a greater share of the pie, like I've been
saying. And we feel we want our fair share. It's unfortunate that
it's come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle is over the owners' desire to put a ceiling on how
much players can earn. They would like to change a system that they
reluctantly approved three years ago, a system that has enabled the
player salaries to account for more than 57 percent of
basketball-related revenue taken in by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Having enjoyed the benefits of the current deal, the players
hold one clause in the deal sacred and refuse to budge. Called the
Larry Bird exception, it enables teams to pay their own free agents
whatever they want _ above and beyond the salary cap.

 &HT;    Enforcement of new abortion law blocked
 &HT;    By Lisa Ocker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal judge Tuesday temporarily blocked enforcement
of a new state law restricting abortion, saying the law could
deprive women of their constitutional right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Donald Graham said the law also ``threatens
women with irreparable injury because they may be denied
appropriate medical care either because doctors will not treat them
or doctors will be forced to use more dangerous abortion
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was to become effective Tuesday, bans
``partial-birth abortions,'' except when the mother's health is
threatened. Under the law, doctors who perform the procedure could
face penalties of five years in prison and $5,000 fines. They also
may face civil lawsuits by a father or grandparents of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing several doctors and clinics across
Florida argued that the law's language is so vague it also outlaws
the most common and safest abortions at any time during pregnancy,
including the first trimester.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Attorney General Kathleen Burgener rejected that
argument, saying the law allows other medical options for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, her right to privacy and to choose is not affected,''
Burgener said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgener declined to comment on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the law was led in part by attorney Priscilla
Smith, representing the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision makes clear that women and their doctors, not
state legislators, have the right to make private medical
decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines a partial-birth abortion as a procedure where a
physician ``partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before
killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona Reis, director of the West Palm Beach-based Presidential
Women's Center, which also challenged the law, was glad about the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the procedure is only done in the most
severe cases of fetal (birth defects),'' Reis said. ``There are
only a handful of doctors who perform these procedures, which are
done in the third trimester and none of them are in Florida, to my
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws similar to Florida's have been enacted in 28 states.
Graham's ruling Tuesday represents the 17th time a state's
partial-birth abortion ban has been blocked by state or federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The partial-birth ban, passed by state lawmakers in 1997, was
vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles. But legislators this year overrode
the veto. Chiles challenged the timing of the override before the
state Supreme Court, which has not yet decided the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These judges don't seem to care what the Florida Constitution
says, what the law is, or what the people want,'' said John
Dowless, executive director of Florida's Christian Coalition. The
coalition says the law only outlawed late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish the judges would run for political office and stop
legislating from the bench,'' Dowless said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's ruling is effective for 10 days. A second hearing would
be required to determine the law's constitutionality.

 &HT;    Democrats join together for Governor's race
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Just weeks after calling each other
``plagiarist'' and ``money launderer,'' the top two Democratic
candidates for governor stood side-by-side Tuesday, joined hands
held overhead in the traditional style to a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay and former state Sen. Rick Dantzler made
official what both camps had leaked Monday: Dantzler would join
MacKay's ticket against Republican Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy, I proudly accept your invitation to become your running
mate,'' Dantzler shouted into the microphones at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   In political campaigns, yesterday's combatants can become
today's teammates, often without missing a beat. So it was Tuesday
under a blazing noontime sun.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who had accused Dantzler of stealing his plan to fix
health care plans, was asked if he could address their earlier
jibes at one another. ``The answer to that is no,'' he said to
laughs from the friendly crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzler had complained at a news conference that MacKay and the
Democratic Party were unethically transferring so-called ``soft
money'' donations given the party to MacKay, even though Democratic
opponents weren't receiving such money.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic _ which is also used by the Republican Party and
Bush _ was called a ``scam'' in a Dantzler press release, which
closed with this exhortation: ``Stop laundering money, Buddy!''
</P>
<P>
   All of that was forgotten Tuesday as the two arrived together at
a downtown Tallahassee park, in matching short-sleeved shirts _
MacKay wore forest green, Dantzler midnight blue _ and khaki
trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Together they taunted Bush, who so far has raised several times
as much money as MacKay and Dantzler have between them.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, though, pointed out that between them, they have more
years in state and federal political offices _ 40 _ than Bush can
ever hope for. ``Our Republican opponent can't live long enough to
get the number of years of experience that we've got,'' MacKay
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman turned that figure to fit a Bush campaign
theme: MacKay, with 16 years in Tallahassee and eight in
Washington, is a ``career politician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a part of the problem,'' Cory Tilley said.
</P>
<P>
   The third major Democratic candidate, state Rep. Keith Arnold,
of Fort Myers, has said he will remain in the race. Neither he nor
Bush has announced a running mate, which they must do by July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last year named Secretary of State Sandra Mortham, only to
have her resign from the ticket this winter over negative press
reports about her financial management of her office. His running
mate in 1994, Rep. Tom Feeney, was widely seen as damaging because
of some of his unorthodox views.
</P>
<P>
   That difficulty with running mates gave MacKay grist for a
final, parting shot: ``I've made one selection for lieutenant
governor, and I'm real proud of it. Let the Republicans say what
they will.''

 &HT;    Texas swimmer to cross Atlantic to honor father
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In Benoit Marie Jean-Paul Lecomte's mind, which
promises to be a very fascinating place for the next few months, he
is a man without a country. It is not France, where he was born,
raised and Sorbonne-educated, nor the United States, to which he
migrated seven years ago. Not ready to give up his Gallic
citizenship, not ready to leave his home in Austin, ``I'm somewhere
in between,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   For 80 days beginning in mid-July, the 31-year-old adventurer
will put his body where his mind is, trekking the 3,395 miles from
Cape Cod, Mass., to Brest, France, powered in near-equal parts by
his freestyle stroke and the fortuitous current of the Gulf Stream.
This is like swimming the distance from Austin to Houston and back
_ 10 times _ and is precisely why his mind holds such intrigue.
Swim what? For what?
</P>
<P>
   ``People get interested,'' says the 5-foot-9-inch, 151-pound
Lecomte, who avoids quizzical looks by going by Ben in lieu of his
full name. ``They think, `The guy's crazy,' but I'm doing it for a
good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   One would assume that anyone who would wade into the 55-degree
water off Hyannis Port, Mass., on or about Bastille Day _ and swim
at least 20 miles a day with only the aid of a wet suit, fins,
snorkel and support boat for nearly three months _ must have
something substantive torturing him.
</P>
<P>
   Lecomte, whose ancestors long ago mandated that all in the
family lineage would take Marie as a middle name to persuade the
Virgin Mary to watch over them, does not carry family photos in his
wallet. ``A picture is very static,'' he says. ``I like images in
my mind. They're much more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how he makes his father, Pierre, live again, seven years
after the cancer Pierre appeared to have beaten took his life at
age 49. When the boredom of staring into the ocean starts creeping
in along with the lactic acid, Lecomte plans to do what all
super-endurance athletes do: disassociate. It's what he does when
he experiences sharp pain on dry land, when he thinks of swimming
and its comforting, soundless and visionless numbness.
</P>
<P>
   What then, when you have more soundless and visionless numbness
than you know what to do with and the same stimulatory deprivation
that salves the pain creates it? As those moments turn to hours,
days, weeks and even months, he'll think of his family: his mother
Liliane back home in the Paris suburb of St. Ouen L'Aumone and his
brothers Christophe, a 2-hour, 30-minute marathon runner; and
Fabien, a competitive skier. But mostly he'll think of his father.
</P>
<P>
   He'll think of how, even months before colon cancer was first
diagnosed, Pierre intuitively sold his lucrative recreation
business and vowed to slow his pace. He'll recall how, when they
found the cancer, Pierre bravely fought it, and how when it came
back six months later, he spent his time hunched over his
accounting books, verifying the only thing he would have left to
give after he was gone, his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Ben will recall how his family, wanting to answer his father's
every need, put a bell by his bed and gave him instructions that no
request was too trivial; how Pierre would fight to stand and slowly
shuffle wherever he needed to go, IV stand in tow, and how the bell
never rang.
</P>
<P>
   Those memories would drive him, but he also remembered reading
in L'Equipe, the French sports daily, about the exploits of men who
rowed and wind-surfed across the Atlantic, and how he had wished
they'd worked a little altruism into their motivation. And the
ideas he had long held were nurtured: to come to the United States,
to leave behind a still-grieving mother who had bravely gone back
to school to become a teacher, to learn the English language and
fulfill a lifelong goal, and most of all, to do something to honor
his father and help others.
</P>
<P>
   It would be built around swimming, the sport he embraced when
running wore out his knees. It would involve endurance, and it
would involve the Atlantic Ocean, ridiculously challenging yet _ in
his mind _ also perversely doable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something to come from me, not dictated by someone
else,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are edges to be had, and Lecomte has spent the
better part of the last seven years finding them. He contacted
Eddie Coyle, a kinesiology professor and director of the Human
Performance Lab at the University of Texas, for dietary advice.
Coyle, who had worked with athletes competing in ultra- endurance
events as long as 24-hour runs, was initially cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any major feat, when you look at it in its entirety, it
looks impossible,'' Coyle said, ``but when you break it down into
small steps, it becomes possible. What he's attempting is
physiologically possible. Now it's a matter of not becoming sick,
maintaining nutrition and avoiding accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Coyle and Jennifer Macaulay, a graduate student in
sports science and nutrition, Lecomte formulated a diet heavy on
carbohydrates for energy, but with significant amounts of fat and
protein for the long haul, to replace the estimated 7,000 to 8,000
calories he'll burn per day.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's difficult to simulate in practice the rigors he'll
face on the open ocean, Lecomte has invested four to six hours per
day in training and has completed two 24-hour swims, taking a
minute or so every 20 minutes to rest and gulp down some fluids and
food. Lecomte plans to swim six to eight hours per day in two-hour
blocks, stopping to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a general idea of what his needs are, but since what
he's doing is so different, we'll have to let him figure out what
works for him,'' Coyle says. ``It's like an experiment in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Coyle expects Lecomte to swim his way into better
shape during the first few weeks of the journey as his body adapts
and he finds the optimal nutrition and rest cycles. Finding the
right equipment also requires trial and error, but that must be
done before he starts.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it comes to sharks, who aren't big on giving
second chances. Rather than swim in a bulky cage, Lecomte will
entrust his safety to a Shark Protective Ocean Device, a relatively
new system that employs a mild electrical field to dissuade nearby
predators from any uninvited interruptions. It does not deter
jellyfish. Lecomte made a note of that, calling a trans- Caribbean
swimmer who used the system for tips on the best medication for the
anticipated stings.
</P>
<P>
   As for wardrobe, he'll bring a variety of wet suits, with and
without sleeves and of differing thicknesses, to wear when the
water is a chilling 55 degrees near the coasts and when it reaches
the low 70s in the Gulf Stream. He will use a specially made
snorkel, which goes in front of his face so as to not impede his
stroke, and fins. Sometimes he'll swim a scissor kick with two
fins; sometimes he'll make like Flipper with a heart-shaped
Fiberglas monofin to better vary the load and avoid injury.
</P>
<P>
   (Appropriately, the monofin is made by a company named FINIS, a
word that, in French, is the first-person imperative of the verb
``to finish,'' an omen if ever there was one.)
</P>
<P>
   All decked out, looking like ``The Little Mermaid'' meets ``The
X-Files,'' Lecomte elicits stares. Even at laid-back Barton
Springs, where he frequently trains, dodging middle-aged slackers
on their blowup alligator floats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I bet you can go really fast with that,'' marvels one
bystander overcome by FINIS envy.
</P>
<P>
   Another adolescent, with a dangerous combination of curiosity
and knowledge of current events, asks warily, ``Are y'all checking
on the salamanders?''
</P>
<P>
   (``Been swimming here for years and I've never seen one,'' says
Lecomte, who in full regalia must strike more fear in the amphibian
than any bulldozer- happy developer.)
</P>
<P>
   Training has actually been the easy part, at least compared to
finding sponsors. Lecomte was ultimately put in touch with the
Association for International Cancer Research in Fife, Scotland,
which offered to accept any resultant donations, but not help him
financially. Left to his own resources, Lecomte has worked
inordinately long hours to finance the trip (he's got about
$100,000 of the $140,000 estimated cost covered) and provide
something to donate to the International Cancer Research, though he
expects interest to shoot up when he dives in.
</P>
<P>
   Lecomte, on leave of absence from his marketing job at
TeleService Resources, a subsidiary of American Airlines, has
managed to line up his equipment, most of it donated and thoroughly
tested; provide physical performance and diet analysis; arrange
publicity, a web page and cell phone; and secure the use of a 39
1/2-foot boat named Falbala and her crew of two. He'll bring what
he calls his memory box, filled with an assortment of carefully
chosen photos, letters, audio tapes and any mementos he might deem
motivational. Sometime before he departs, he'll also visit the
nearest bookstore, head to the biography aisle and pluck off the
shelf a tome about a kindred soul by the name of Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks no records, follows no rules. He knows the
cross-Channel crowd will sniff at his swim, quickly noting that it
came with three things not allowed in treks from Calais to Dover _
wet suit, snorkel and fins _ but their approval is of no value to
Lecomte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to gauge myself with them,'' says Lecomte, who
says his feat is akin to walking a long distance, not running it.
``I am not the best swimmer, either. This is not so much the
physical aptitude after a while. It will be like being in jail,
having to stare at a blank wall for six to eight hours. But it's
something I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when he splashes ashore in October somewhere near Brest _
understandably, he's not very particular as to exactly where _
he'll do so to no grand celebration, just a reunion with his mother
and brothers. ``Right now I'm not even thinking about finishing,''
Lecomte says.
</P>
<P>
   He'll hate to swim and run, but any celebration on his native
soil will be brief. He needs to be back at the UT Performance Lab
within a week so he can be tested on the physical effects of his
swim on his lung capacity and body composition. After 80 days in
the choppy Atlantic, drained mentally and physically and in ways he
can only imagine, the only way back is to go first- class. Surely,
then, he'll head to Paris' Orly Airport _ which long ago superseded
LeBourget, the grass field where Lindbergh touched down that night
71 years ago last month _ and board the Concorde for the
sub-four-hour hop back to the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish,'' he says wistfully, and again in his mind he's there,
somewhere in between.

ADVERTISING: LOWE &AMP; PARTNERS/SMS WILL PROMOTE COMMERCIALS FOR CBS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York is creating
promotional commercials for CBS as the network gears up to peddle
its wares for the 1998-99 television season. The humorous spots,
meant to assist CBS in the challenging task of attracting a younger
audience, are set in such fanciful locales as inside a space
shuttle and outside a ``Goodfellas''-style social club.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials from Lowe, which is known for sharp campaigns
for familiar consumer brands like Mercedes-Benz, Sprite, Braun and
Perdue, are supplementing work created in-house at CBS as well as
by a boutique shop, Air Creative Group in Los Angeles, which has
been a CBS roster agency for a decade. All the spots carry the
theme ``The address is CBS. Welcome home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of
Companies, recently began working for CBS on a project basis.
Executives say the project is being extended because of the
positive initial reaction to the first three spots that Lowe
created, which CBS quietly began running in the last two weeks
during a variety of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are already noticing and paying attention,'' said
George F. Schweitzer, executive vice president for marketing and
communications at CBS, a unit of the CBS Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in this business,'' he added, ``that's what you fight
for.'' Billings are not being disclosed, in part because they are
difficult to value because the commercials are running on CBS's own
air time.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Lowe to the CBS roster points to the increasing
efforts by networks to distinguish themselves from a lengthening
list of competitors by running brand identity campaigns in addition
to the traditional spots that pitch specific shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV and VH1 have long looked
to Madison Avenue for brand-building commercials.
</P>
<P>
   As for the broadcast networks, ABC, part of Walt Disney Co. has
been the most prominent proponent of agency-created branding
campaigns with work from the Venice, Calif., office of TBWA
Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. A
smarty-pants campaign for the 1997-98 season, carrying the theme
``TV is good,'' is being replaced for the coming season with less
cynical ads carrying the theme ``We love TV.''
</P>
<P>
   By developing a relationship with an agency such as Lowe, ``we
went to a team that specialized at taking a look from the outside
in rather than from the inside out,'' Schweitzer said, ``which is
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``this is not ABC and Chiat/Day,'' because
``it's a project we assigned without a review; we went to Lee
directly because I believe in his creative vision for helping us
look different.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is Lee Garfinkel, co-chairman and chief creative officer at
Lowe, who said of the project: ``The idea is to show real
situations where people you wouldn't expect are talking about CBS
programming in a more contemporary and fun way. CBS wants to
broaden viewer appeal to create a more diverse audience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order given that CBS finished the 1997-98 season
fourth among the four biggest broadcast networks in the demographic
category most coveted by advertisers _ men and women ages 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an older category that CBS is trying to sell
aggressively to Madison Avenue, viewers 25 to 54, the network
finished fourth among men and second among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS is the oldest-skewing network and its audience composition
remains the least desirable,'' said Joe Mandese, editor of The
Myers Report, a media industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there are a lot of older `demos'
available,'' he added, because older people usually watch more TV,
``and younger `demos' are rarer.''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer acknowledged the difficulty of the job ahead in
reaching ``a younger audience, younger baby boomers, but we're
hoping people will see the spots and say: `I didn't expect that
kind of a commercial from CBS. Maybe I'll give those guys another
look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mercedes campaign that Lowe created echoed some of the
issues we're dealing with at CBS,'' he said, ``in that it was meant
to enhance a solid product with a stodgy image by using
self-effacing imagery.'' That campaign, for the Mercedes-Benz of
North America unit of Daimler-Benz AG, won kudos for such
unconventional elements as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and a
rubber duck.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS commercial set inside the space shuttle features the
voices of actors playing astronauts, who quarrel with Mission
Control because their launching times conflict with favorite CBS
programs like ``60 Minutes'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' They
are, the spot asserts, ``just a few of the people on Earth who call
CBS home.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two make-believe social club spots _ shot to resemble
surveillance footage _ that present grainy, black-and-white images
of actors impersonating gangsters. They are described as ``yet
another family who calls CBS home.''
</P>
<P>
   One mobster says to his friend in a dem-dese-dose voice: ``You
see `Touched by a Angel' last night? It really got to me. I haven't
had such a good cry since Tony the Fish got whacked.'' Another,
named Paulie, is welcomed back from an unspecified place that
probably had bars on the windows; his first questions are about the
plot lines of his favorite CBS series.
</P>
<P>
   Told that on ``The Nanny,'' the nanny married her boss, Paulie
replies, ``I can't believe I missed the whole wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials were created by Garfinkel; Gary Goldsmith, vice
chairman and executive creative director; Seth Fried, a copywriter,
and Steve Kashtan, an art director. The social club spots were
directed by Tom Schiller, who has contributed short films to
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The social club cronies will return for additional spots,
Schweitzer said, adding: ``I've looked at a script about our new
Monday night lineup in which one guy says, `Everything's changing;
what should I do?' and his friend advises, `Give it a shot.'''

COHEN SEES NO FURTHER UNKNOWNS FOR TOMB  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the family of 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie
prepared at last to bury him, 14 years after his remains were
placed in the Tomb of the Unknowns, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said on Tuesday that it was unlikely the nation would ever again
have to lay an unknown serviceman to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Pentagon, Cohen said new genetic tests _ not
available when Blassie's remains were declared unknown and placed
in the tomb, at Arlington National Cemetery _ had brought the
government much closer to its promise to account fully for those
who died or disappeared during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be proven wrong,'' Cohen said, ``but it would seem to
me that given the state of the art today, it's unlikely'' that any
further remains, from either Vietnam or any future war, will ever
lie in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   But if Cohen's remarks signaled the end of a military tradition
that was widely established after World War I, and has roots that
are even older, his formal announcement that the remains removed
from the tomb were Blassie's ended one family's long wait for
answers. The lieutenant, a 24-year-old Air Force pilot, was shot
down over South Vietnam on May 11, 1972, and had since been
officially considered missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   In Florissant, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, Blassie's mother,
Jean, gathered her surviving children together and expressed relief
that they would be able to ``bring him home.'' Mrs. Blassie and her
family had urged the Pentagon to test the remains _ a total of six
bones _ ever since 1994, when a newsletter, The U.S. Veteran
Dispatch, first raised questions about whose they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart I've always believed, since about 1994, that
Michael was in the tomb,'' Mrs. Blassie said, standing with her son
and three daughters before a phalanx of television cameras outside
the apartment building where she lives. ``And I'm just relieved and
thankful there's going to be a closure, and we'll bring him home.''
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's brother, George, who was just 11 when Air Force
officers arrived with the news of the disappearance and in all
likelihood death, said he could spend hours describing his ``hero''
but wanted people to know just one thing: ``We do understand that
the Tomb of the Unknowns is an honorable place, but Michael really
deserves to be known.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen announced the identification on Tuesday, three
independent consultants hired by him must still verify the results
of the Pentagon's investigation and the genetic tests that made
identification possible. At that point, the Armed Forces
Identification Review Board, which oversees the grim task of
formally identifying war dead, must make a final determination.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at Mrs. Blassie's apartment, the family said the
hope was to bury Blassie as soon as July 11, at the Jefferson
Barracks National Cemetery, just south of St. Louis, in a grave
near that of his father, a World War II veteran who died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force will transport the remains to Missouri, help with
a memorial service, and bury Blassie with full military honors, Lt.
Gen. David Vesely, assistant vice chief of staff, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The identification of the remains has, as expected, raised the
question of whether they should be replaced in the tomb by other
Vietnam remains, which would have to be not only unidentified but
also unidentifiable, even given the new genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   There are 2,087 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War,
and the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii has more
than 100 sets of bone fragments that are, for now, unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy De Leon, the under-secretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, who headed the Pentagon inquiry that led to the
identification of Blassie's remains, said the Defense Department
had to find out ``not simply are there remains that are
unidentified at this point, but whether there is truly something
that is unidentifiable, so that the `known but to God' will really
be the absolute standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who had called on Cohen to open
the Tomb of the Unknowns to verify the remains that proved to be
Blassie's, said that in the future the Pentagon had to pursue every
conceivable clue before declaring remains unknown. ``If that means
we would not inter people there again, so be it,'' Smith said.
``Maybe we have moved beyond that.''

CINCINNATI ENQUIRER WORKERS SUBPOENAED IN CHIQUITA CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf, Chiquita did NOT own Enquirer before
Gannett.) 
(ATTN: Ohio, Fla.)   (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In an unusual move, a special prosecutor has
subpoenaed employees at The Cincinnatti Enquirer, which has
apologized to Chiquita Brands International Inc. for using voice
mail messages stolen by a reporter in a scathing expose.
</P>
<P>
   Enquirer Publisher Harry M. Whipple has acknowledged the
subpoenas, but he declined to identify who had received them or how
many were issued.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the newspaper's staff expressed confusion and
some consternation over what seemed to be such a swift capitulation
to Chiquita, the big Cincinnati company controlled by Carl H.
Lindner, who was the top shareholder in the company that owned The
Enquirer before the newspaper was sold to the Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer, which has also agreed to pay at least $10 million
to Chiquita, had accused the banana producer of a bribery scheme in
Columbia and imperiling public health in Central America with
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't even understand if the paper is saying the
charges are untrue or not,'' said one young newspaper employee, who
asked not to be identified as he sat outside the Enquirer building
downtown. ``The whole thing just leaves everybody puzzled.''
</P>
<P>
   In its apology, published for three days on the front page this
week as part of the legal agreement with Chiquita, The Enquirer
said it renounced the articles, which they said ``created a false
and misleading impression of Chiquita's business practices.'' It
said that ``an Enquirer employee was involved in the theft of this
information in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas are rarely issued to journalists in the United States,
but some media experts said they were not surprised by the
prosecutor's actions, noting that employees of news organizations
can scarcely expect to flout the law for a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that The Enquirer has said the voice mail was
stolen, it is not entirely surprising that there would be a
criminal investigation,'' said Robert Steele, director of the
ethics program at the Poynter Institute, a group in St. Petersburg,
Fla., that studies journalism practices. ``There are no exemptions
from the law for journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that rare circumstances, such as cases involving life
and death, can create an exception to the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard from the reporter yet,'' Steele said. ``I
want to hear what he has to say about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead reporter on the series, Mike Gallagher, 40, was
dismissed on Friday. He has declined requests for an interview. His
lawyer, Patrick Hanley, has also declined to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Schwarzlose, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University who focuses on ethics, said the action by The Enquirer
was the latest example of news organizations saying they were
unwilling to tolerate unethical journalistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He said the news organizations were trying mightily to avoid
lawsuits, noting that a jury trial could be dangerously expensive
for a newspaper, given the skeptical view many Americans hold
toward the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``News organizations are taking no chances,'' said Schwarzlose,
``and I think its a healthy thing.''

   WALKOUTS TO COST GM $1.18 BILLION IN 2ND QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said strikes at two factories in Flint, Mich.,
which have forced 26 of the automaker's 29 North American assembly
plants to close, will cost the company $1.18 billion after taxes in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute at two Delphi Chassis Systems brake plants in Dayton,

   FDA APPROVES NEW SWEETENER
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of an
artificial sweetener known as Ace-K in soft drinks. Analysts
predict that Ace-K, marketed by Hoechst as Sunett and officially
known as acesulfame potassium, will add $55 billion in sales to the
nation's carbonated soft-drink industry. An hour after the FDA
announcement, Pepsico said it planned to introduce by October a
diet cola called Pepsi One using Ace-K and aspartame.

 &HT;    Galarraga's back strong with 2 HRs
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He grinned as he crossed himself before
taking his first batting practice in a week. He toyed with using a
heavier bat, to lessen the stress of his swing. He fretted about
Tropicana Field's artificial turf and the strain on his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Who's zoomin' who, Andres Galarraga?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rolled over Tampa Bay 7-2, as Galarraga, in his first
game in six days because of back trouble, homered with his first
two swings of the night, giving him 27 and his fifth double-homer
game of the year. Though he was subsequently knocked out of the
game in the seventh on a Rick White fastball to the left wrist, he
is expected to be back in the lineup tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle snapped out of a 1-5 spin to improve to 9-6,
allowing five hits while striking out five in six innings. Tampa
Bay's Tony Saunders, 3-0 against Atlanta last year when he pitched
for the Florida Marlins, yielded just four hits but finally fell to
the Braves in his fifth career start against them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored four times and took a 7-2 lead in the seventh,
which Andruw Jones began with his sixth triple. Danny Bautista,
starting in left field against the left-handed Saunders, had looked
bad in two strikeouts but broke out of a 1-for-22 slump with an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   That chased Saunders, who allowed just four hits. Reliever
Esteban Yan, who inherited two runners, served up a 1-2 double to
pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart. Eddie Perez scored easily for a 5-2
lead but Bautista ill-advisedly tried for home and was easily
thrown out on Miguel Cairo's relay. After a walk by Walt Weiss and
Gerald Williams' infield single, Scott Aldred was brought in to
face Chipper Jones, who ripped a single through the left side for
two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were burned in the fifth by a double steal, resulting
in the first steal of home in Tampa Bay history. Neagle retired the
first two men he faced that inning, but Randy Winn and Miguel Cairo
put together consecutive singles to bring up Bobby Smith with men
on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-2 pitch, Cairo, who had stolen four bases in nine tries,
took off from first base and catcher Javy Lopez threw to second,
just as Winn broke for home. Lopez's threw bounced, Winn scored
without a play at the plate and Tampa Bay cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's second homer came with the bases empty in the
fourth, giving Atlanta a 3-1 lead, and it was one of the three
longest balls yet hit at the Trop.

COMMISSIONER ELECTION SET 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless Bud Selig plans to produce a surprise candidate, the
baseball owners will elect him commissioner at a meeting July 9 in
Chicago. ``At the meeting,'' according to a notice sent to owners
Monday, ``the clubs will be asked to conduct an election to fill
the position of commissioner.'' The notice did not say who the
candidate or candidates will be, but there is really only one, and
he has been the acting commissioner for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   Selig has virtually no opposition, meaning he should easily
receive the required three-fourths majority of the 30 clubs. Other
owners have said the two Chicago teams have been opposed, but one
official said Tuesday that it wasn't clear that they would vote
against Selig's election. The San Francisco Giants had been listed
as a possible no, but they have more recently indicated that they
plan to vote for Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Selig had expressed reluctance to take the job, but, urged by a
growing number of owners, decided several weeks ago to accept it,
some of the owners said. He has not acknowledged that decision. &QL;

OAKLEY-CAMBY DEAL IS FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Knicks tied up some loose ends Tuesday before the National
Basketball Association locked out its players at midnight. After
the Toronto waived Charles Oakley's physical, the draft-day deal
that sent Marcus Camby to the Knicks and Oakley to the Raptors
became final.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks also used the last day of interaction with players to
hold a workout for a 6-foot-4-inch point guard from Israel, Oded
Katasch, who may be available as a free agent once a new collective
bargaining agreement goes into effect. Until the lockout ends,
teams have to cease their business activities, including free-agent
signings.
</P>
<P>
   Katasch, 23, is a star for the Tel Aviv team that plays in the
European league. He may become part of the Knicks' fallback plan if
they cannot trade for Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley never made it to Toronto for his physical. He flew to
Atlanta because of a family emergency, Raptors officials said.
After General Manager Glen Grunwald and Coach Butch Carter flew to
Atlanta to meet with Oakley, the team waived the physical. &QL;

fronted Black Sabbath, perhaps the archetypal heavy metal band, his
career has been pronounced finished time and time again. Yet time
and time again he has rebounded. Last year, his Ozzfest package

BUSINESS GROUP REACHES AGREEMENT TO BUY NETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of New Jersey businessmen reached an agreement to buy a
majority interest in the Nets on Tuesday, setting the stage for the
team to attempt a move out of the Meadowlands Sports Complex and to
a proposed site in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The new ownership group, put together by the real estate
developers Finn Wentworth and Stanley Gale of Florham Park, N.J.,
and including Steven Witkoff, a prominent real estate investor in
New Jersey, and Raymond Chambers, a New Jersey businessman and
philanthropist, will execute an option to pay $150 million for
approximately 65 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   A $25 million payment was placed Tuesday. According to a news
release issued by the Nets, several members of the current
seven-man ownership group will be part of the new ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is business as usual for the New Jersey Nets,'' Wentworth
and Gale said in a statement. ``Our group is extremely pleased with
the progress of the organization under Michael Rowe and his
management team. We have a commitment to keep the team in New
Jersey and continue on the positive course that the team has been
on the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, the Nets' president, said in the team's statement: ``The
Nets organization is pleased that our team will remain in New
Jersey. We are grateful to the existing ownership group and our new
owners for making it possible. We are dedicated to continuing the
progress the franchise has made in recent years at bringing an NBA
championship to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ownership group had 60 days to complete the purchase,
with the option expiring Tuesday night. It will forfeit the payment
if the deal does not go through, but Gale and Wentworth said they
expected that a final agreement would be completed soon. The sale
is contingent on approval from the National Basketball Association
board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if completed, puts an end to the attempts of two other
groups _ a team from Long Island, led by Charles Wang of Computer
Associates, and a group led by the New York Islanders owner Howard
Milstein _ to buy the Nets. Both groups hoped to bring the team to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new ownership has ties to attempts to revitalize Newark. It
hopes to bring the team to a new arena that would be built near the
new Performing Arts Center. The move would hinge on the ability of
the group, helped by the political clout of Gov. Christie Whitman,
to urge the Devils to accompany them from East Rutherford to
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   John McMullen, the Devils' owner, has flirted with the notion of
relocating to Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the owners of the team, I am committed to keeping the
Nets in New Jersey and I couldn't be happier that this group has
purchased the team,'' Whitman said in a statement. ``I look forward
to working with the new owners, and the owners of all New Jersey
sports teams to ensure that New Jersey remains the premier sports
venue in the metropolitan region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' lease at Continental Arena runs through 2030, but it
has windows for the team to opt out in 2000 and 2004. Rowe has said
that the team will choose to escape the lease, whether or not it
moves to a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   According to a state official, Whitman will request proposals
through the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, soliciting
ideas on prospective sites as well as ways of increasing
profitability at the current site. But the official, who asked not
to be named, said that the governor was hesitant to support any
site until she was certain that both teams would occupy the same
arena. &QL;

 MASSIVE UNION RALLY SHUTS DOWN MIDTOWN; 21 HURT, 38 ARRESTED  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 20,000 construction workers protested the
city's use of a nonunion contractor in a turbulent rally Tuesday
that erupted into clashes with the police and paralyzed traffic in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The rally and a spontaneous march that followed _ whose size and
ferocity took city, police and even union leaders by surprise _
left 18 police officers and three civilians hurt, most with minor
injuries, and 38 demonstrators under arrest, one for assaulting a
police horse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One protester was hospitalized in serious but stable condition
after being kicked in the head by a police horse.
</P>
<P>
   Amassing at the headquarters of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority at 44th Street and Madison Avenue, the demonstrators
brought traffic to a standstill for blocks around during the
morning rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, thousands of demonstrators marched across town toward
the nonunion construction site at 54th Street and Ninth Avenue,
where several workers broke through barricades, threw bottles and
scuffled with the police, some of whom responded with mace.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir acknowledged that officers were
caught off guard because the department anticipated 10,000
demonstrators, but, he said, there were 40,000 at the
demonstration's peak. The rally's main sponsor, the Building and
Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, estimated there
were about 30,000 demonstrators, while some union officials said
that there might have been only 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who blocked a protest by taxi drivers
earlier this summer by arguing that they were trying to shut down
the city, acknowledged that his administration was surprised by the
size of Tuesday's protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the construction workers given the same advance warning
that the taxi drivers gave, they'd have been dealt with in the same
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From around 8 a.m. to noon, much of midtown Manhattan was
crippled by the swirling crowds, as thousands of burly, often
shouting, construction workers roamed through the streets, angering
bewildered drivers, pedestrians and storeowners. At the same time,
police vehicles, sirens screaming, repeatedly crisscrossed midtown
as they scrambled to maintain control..
</P>
<P>
   Some construction workers wrestled with the police, climbed on
cars, waved flags and threw garbage bags at officers. Safir said he
started with 550 police patrolling the demonstration but quickly
increased the number to 1,000. By walking off the job, the
demonstrators shut down several hundred construction sites
throughout New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at City Hall, Giuliani assailed the
demonstrators, especially those who attacked the police. He said
the city would sue the building trades council to demand
compensation for the damage and seek an injunction that would
severely punish future out-of-control demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to tolerate this kind of activity,
whatever the nature of the dispute,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fernandes, a spokesman for the Building Trades Council,
said the rally's organizers also were caught unaware by the
spontaneous march and unsuccessfully urged the workers to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're apologizing not for the entire demonstration, we're
apologizing for any vandalism or violence that occurred,''
Fernandes said. ``If the police are saying there were 40,000 people
there, and 20 or 30 of them misbehaved, well, we're not minimizing
that they misbehaved, but most people behaved properly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the unions would make restitution for any personal
injury or property damage that was done by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators gathered to pressure the MTA to end its
contract with Roy Kay Inc., based in Freehold, N.J., that was
awarded a $32.6 million contract to build a new transit command
center.
</P>
<P>
   On three different occasions over the past month, 1,000 to 2,000
construction workers have demonstrated at the Ninth Avenue site.
But frustrated that those protests were gaining little attention
and hardly seemed to be pressuring the MTA, the construction unions
spent the past 10 days organizing Tuesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was another example of the growing militancy
that many of the nation's labor unions are showing when the wages
and jobs of their members are threatened. But what was to be one of
labor's proudest days _ it was one of the largest union protests in
New York in years _ turned out in many ways to be an embarrassment
because the street chaos greatly overshadowed the unions' message.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration, union leaders said they were not
planning any more demonstrations, saying the reason was not
Giuliani's warnings, but that they had finally gotten their message
across.
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said it was worth giving up a day's pay to
show they were serious about drawing a line against Roy Kay and
other nonunion contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job's nonunion, and it should be union,'' said Ralph
Falco, a tile layer from Paterson, N.J. ``We can't afford to lose
jobs like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MTA officials, who are permitted by law to award contracts to
nonunion companies, said that Roy Kay won the contract because it
was the lowest bidder. But union officials, as well as an
association of 1,000 unionized building contractors, urged the MTA
to drop Roy Kay, asserting that it is not a responsible contractor
and that the law requires that contracts go only to responsible
firms.
</P>
<P>
   To make their argument, labor leaders pointed to numerous safety
violations by Roy Kay, to New York State's investigating it for
submitting false documents and to its workers' rupturing a gas line
at Rutgers University last year, causing the evacuation of more
than 100 students.
</P>
<P>
   The Roy Kay contract is by no means the first work the MTA has
awarded a nonunion company. But union officials said they believed
it was important to protest the contract because of Roy Kay's
run-ins with the law and because they feared the trend toward
nonunion contracts was growing.
</P>
<P>
   Under city and state law, contractors that make the lowest bid
generally win the job. But there is a caveat _ the city and state
can usually reject the lowest bidder if it is found not to be a
responsible contractor, for instance, if it committed numerous
environmental and safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials insisted that Roy Kay should be removed from the
project, pointing to a report, entitled ``Anatomy of a Bad
Contractor,'' that Anthony Weiner, a City Council member from
Brooklyn, did about Roy Kay. The report described many of Roy Kay's
violations, including two serious federal safety citations the
company received last November for failing to protect workers from
a cave-in during excavation work at Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Building trades officials say they hope the state Labor
Department will soon bar Roy Kay. The company is under
investigation, having already been suspended after construction
unions provided evidence that it had submitted false documents to
qualify for a state program that trains construction apprentices.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the telephone at Roy Kay's headquarters
Tuesday said the builder had no comment about the attacks against
it.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway defended
awarding the contract to Roy Kay. ``Under state law we are required
to accept the lowest bid whether that be union or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Malloy, president of the building trades council,
said that was an incomplete reading of the law because it forgot
that bidders not deemed responsible can be rejected.

 &HT;    James wins in Alabama
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Montgomery _ On a sultry election night in Alabama's capital,
incumbent Gov. Fob James, a champion for Christian conservatives,
was declared the winner in the Republican runoff with a
double-digit lead over challenger Winton Blount.
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of the precincts reporting, James led Blount 56
percent to 44 percent, picking up 192,818 votes to Blount's
150,766. Blount had hoped for a large Democratic crossover,
especially by black voters. While many black Democrats apparently
turned out in Birmingham, black turnout elsewhere was light.
</P>
<P>
   In the main ballroom of the Embassy Suites, James supporters
dined on sliced roast beef and sipped lemonade as Lynyrd Skynyrd's
``Sweet Home Alabama'' boomed over loudspeakers. Across the street
at the Montgomery Civic Center, the Blount faithful ate chicken
wings and meatballs while a live band played Jimmy Buffet songs. As
they did in other parts of the state, voters in James' hometown of
Lanett were split on Christianity in government and whether the
incumbent governor projects the image of an eccentric man behind
the times.
</P>
<P>
   Kennon Goggans, 74, grew up three blocks from where James was
born. Goggans said he voted for James because of the governor's
``Christian attitude toward government. If a man stands up for his
rights and my rights in the courts, I should support him. We need
God in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sorrell, 51, said he cast the first Republican ballot in
his life for Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with Alabama has been the goobers we elect
governor,'' said Sorrell, a textile worker. ``He (James) comes from
a George Wallace tradition of goobers. Anybody who wants to enforce
Christianity at the bayoneted end of a National Guard gun, that's
ridiculous.''

EDITORIAL: GLIMPSES OF CHANGE IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's trip to China has given Americans an
extended look at political life in that complex and changing
country. Some of what they have witnessed was predictable,
including the Chinese government's effort to clear outspoken
dissidents from Clinton's path. But a good deal was not, like the
uncensored broadcast in China of Clinton's news conference with
President Jiang Zemin. The signs of unexpected openness may be the
most encouraging development of the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the change is a temporary relaxation or a harbinger of
greater freedom is not clear. China for the most part remains a
repressive dictatorship. But modest liberalizing changes have been
under way for much of the last year. They seem to reflect the
growing confidence and power of Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Jiang has been China's top leader for the past nine
years. But it was only after the death of Deng Xiaoping last year
that he defined his own positions, endorsing accelerated
privatization of industry, banking reform and slightly freer
political debate. Jiang took another step last weekend by debating
some of the most sensitive issues in Chinese politics with Clinton
on live television, including the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989
and Beijing's policies toward Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's words conveyed important nuances to Chinese listeners.
His characterization of Tiananmen as a ``political disturbance''
departed from the official line that it was a
``counter-revolutionary riot.'' He also offered a dialogue, with
conditions, to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader. These
words may be taken as a license to broader public debate on both
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also encountered less encouraging attitudes. The
nationalistic tone of questions asked by students at Beijing
University, China's traditional democratic hothouse, was
disheartening. It suggested that heavy government pressure directed
against students and faculty there since the Tiananmen repression
had changed the intellectual climate.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Chinese, however, are somewhat freer today to express
political views in private, and freedom can become contagious.
Jiang seems to understand that a society organized around
money-making is harder to regiment than one organized around the
nostrums of Chairman Mao. Despite censorship and other government
restrictions, exposure to global commerce, television and the
Internet are chipping away at the old restraints.
</P>
<P>
   As China continues to modernize its economy, it will face new
pressures from within and without to open up its political system
as well. Clinton has repeatedly used his public appearances on this
trip to point out the connection between economic and political
freedom. Millions of Chinese have been listening attentively. &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ President Clinton appealed Wednesday to American
firms here to help China sever an ``iron unbreakable link'' between
economic growth and industrial age energy practices that could lead
to environmental catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no right as president of the United States to ask China
to slow its economic growth,'' Clinton told the American Chamber of
Commerce in Shanghai. ``I don't have a right to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a citizen of the world, and as a leader of our country,
I have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet
that our grandchildren can all enjoy living in,'' Clinton said on
Day Seven of his China tour.
</P>
<P>
   In his only major meeting with American business leaders,
Clinton warned China already is besieged with pollution crises.
Every major body of water in China is polluted, the water table is
dropping around the nation, and respiratory illness is the biggest
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Shanghai, the most developed industrial and
financial center of mainland China, can be ``the center of an
energy revolution in China'' with the help of the American
businesses that are important investors and producers here. He said
clean growth can lead to faster growth and less resources spent on
cleaning up the pollution mess later, as well as on taking care of
people who get sick from pollution related disease.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping engaged in China also is essential to the growth of
America's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have after all in the United States just 4 percent of the
world's population, but we produce 20 percent of its wealth,''
Clinton said. ``Clearly, we must do something with the other 96
percent of the people on this small planet, in order to maintain
our standard of living, and our ability to stand up for our values
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit has not been a stellar success from the
point of view of American business.
</P>
<P>
   The White House bypassed visits to any American factories here,
despite heavy pressure from U.S. firms hoping Clinton would
showcase their operations. Business here is still complicated and
restricted, and few American corporations generate notable profits.
A visit by Clinton might impress shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America got several other disappointments from
Clinton's nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The White House waffled for weeks before deciding not to include
a business delegation as part of Clinton's official entourage. That
would have given commercial relations a high profile role in
Clinton's trip through five cities.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Clinton and his administration achieve an agreement on
China's admittance to the World Trade Organization, which business
leaders listed as a number one priority of this summit. As a WTO
member China would have to reduce tariffs and loosen tough controls
over foreign firms doing business here.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors especially appealed hard for Clinton to stop by
its new joint venture factory that will turn out a version of the
Buick Regal here in Shanghai, a daring project that carries the
risk of falling flat for lack of big-car demand. GM was still
hopeful by mid-month, but a major strike in the United States made
a presidential visit a bad publicity risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley also said at a briefing
Tuesday that no progress had been made on reducing China's trade
deficit, with the American side saying China sells about $50
billion more than it buys from the United States. New figures show
the deficit has jumped by another 13-14 percent in the first five
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, our exports have not grown anywhere near
the degree that their exports to the United States have,'' Daley
said. And he said no ``concrete steps'' have been taken in the last
five days to shrink the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the concern over the deficit and over the existing
barriers to doing business here, China's official news agency
Xinhua this week put out an article trumpeting the country's
profit-making possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``China remains the largest potential market on earth,'' Xinhua
said, underscoring that some companies have mistakenly viewed China
as ``a big nation but a small market.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the State Statistics Bureau found consumer spending in
China has been growing two to three percentage points more than
gross domestic product since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   China's 10 percent growth has dipped to less than eight percent
this year, but Xinhua predicted an upturn ``that will in turn drive
consumer spending and turn China into the world's largest consumer
goods market.''
</P>
<P>
   This visit did not even generate a huge total of new business.
On Tuesday Americans and Chinese signed $2 billion in deals at the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing, an event that Clinton did not
attend. Xinhua reported another $1.1 billion the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deals had been expected for months, and some even
previously announced. So there were few surprise contracts like the
big $6 billion package announced when Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited the United States last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``new'' deals was $800 million worth of passenger
planes that China is buying from Boeing. That was part of a deal
for 50 planes announced last fall, though Boeing said a new letter
of intent also had been signed to sell another 10 aircraft worth
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another big contract was General Electric's sale of a $161.7
million integrated steam turbine system to the Chinese.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   The White House bristles at comparisons between its tactics in
the independent counsel investigation of President Clinton and
President Nixon's Watergate strategy. Yet echoes of Nixon's effort
to block access to his tapes were inevitable Monday, as Clinton's
lawyers worked to block testimony by Bruce Lindsey, one of his
closest aides. But there was a striking new element in these
arguments before a federal appeals court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As one member of the three-judge panel remarked, this was the
first time a sitting president had invoked lawyer-client privilege
to thwart a grand jury inquiry. Showing a refreshing measure of
independence and professionalism, the Justice Department has
declined to endorse the president's unique assertion that an
absolute privilege protects all his conversations with government
lawyers. So, it can only be hoped, will the court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House dropped its flimsy executive privilege claim
earlier this month in order to help deter the Supreme Court from
granting a special expedited review before adjourning. That
strategy worked. But as the lower court judge, Norma Holloway
Johnson, essentially recognized in her decision, Clinton's claim of
attorney-client privilege for Lindsey is really just an executive
privilege claim in disguise. As such, it is no more supportable in
the face of the showing of need by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing the White House lawyer, W. Neil Eggleston,
introduced a provocative new thought. Citing the constitutional
separation of powers, he contended that since Starr had raised the
possibility of an impeachment proceeding, the president had every
right to rely on government layers to defend himself. To be sure,
any investigation of a sitting president is difficult legal ground.
But what the White House is proposing is an untenable expansion of
presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer-client privilege is a hallowed principle, as the Supreme
Court just reaffirmed with its ruling last week denying Starr
access to notes taken by the private lawyer for Vincent Foster, the
White House counsel who committed suicide. But it should not be
stretched into a rule that would justify a refusal by every
presidential aide who happens to hold a law degree to cooperate
with an independent counsel inquiry. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Runway repairs at Westchester County Airport in White
Plains are scheduled to be completed early next month, bringing an
end to disruptions that began for travelers in May.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, owned and operated by the county, has been
repairing and upgrading its main runway since May 9. As a result,
it was closed for most service from May 9 through May 18 and a good
part of every weekend subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, which handles 82 scheduled flights each weekday and
65 scheduled flights each weekend, notified carriers last summer
that it would be making these repairs. The airlines _ which include
AMR's American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, UAL's United Airlines,
and U S Airways and several of its commuter lines _ have rerouted
their passengers to other flights at other airports, usually La
Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines said they had to cancel flights at the airport
with little notice, because of repairs that were delayed, in part,
because of heavy rains. According to Marta Laughlin, a spokeswoman
for Northwest, the airline canceled 100 flights in advance, and
between 10 and 20 at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful we will be able to work out a way to recoup our
lost revenues, but we're not overly optimistic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Castelveter, a spokesman for U S Airways, said the repair
schedule had created ``some inconveniences, but we overcame the
obstacles by putting passengers into other airports.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Peter Scherrer, assistant airport manager, the
airport will be closed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturdays and
Sundays during the weekends of July 25 and Aug. 1, after which all
repair work will be completed and regular operations resumed. He
also said the shutdowns were necessary because the airport had only
one main runway. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of British Airways, American Airlines is
installing new sleeper seats in the first-class cabins of its new
Boeing 777 aircraft, officials of the airline said last week. Each
seat, which fully reclines into a bed, will feature a reading
light, a power outlet, telephone, interactive entertainment system
and a privacy divider with storage space.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will use the 19 777s it has ordered for long-haul
service like trans-Pacific flights; it plans to take delivery of
the planes in January.
</P>
<P>
   American will also install new business-class seats in the 777s,
as well as in its current 767 fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, over the next 18 months, American plans to open new
service centers for its ``platinum'' level frequent fliers at
airports in Miami and Los Angeles, and new first-class lounges at
airports in Miami, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is also building new arrival lounges at airports in Miami,
New York (Kennedy International Airport), London (Heathrow Airport)
and Dallas, and adding new showers to existing lounges in Los
Angeles; Newark; San Jose, Calif., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thistle Hotels, which owns and operates some 90 hotels in
Britain, including 24 in London, is offering a ``pound for dollar''
rate from July 13 to Aug. 31. Rates that are normally quoted in
pounds will be available in dollars, thus creating a 40 percent
discount.
</P>
<P>
   A one-night stay, for example, at the Selfridge in London will
be $225, compared with the regular rate of 225 pounds ($374).
Bookings must be made two weeks in advance; a minimum stay of two
nights is required.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's Hotel Sofitel Metropole Hanoi has a special business
traveler's package that includes a buffet breakfast, a fruit
basket, late check-out, free laundry and pressing, discounted dry
cleaning and free local phone calls. Rates, good through Dec. 31,
are $229 a night single occupancy and $259 double occupancy, not
including service or tax. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   As of next Tuesday, U S Airways will no longer issue advance
boarding passes to its passengers.

EDITORIAL: SHIFTING DEMOGRAPHICS OF HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   There is now little doubt that AIDS is becoming an epidemic of
color, striking the African-American community to a
disproportionate and devastating degree. Yet neither political
leaders nor black institutions anticipated this demographic shift
early enough to protect a vulnerable population that historically
has been neglected in health care and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from 25 states compiled by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention show that African-Americans account for 57
percent of new infections with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
even though they make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population.
While death rates from AIDS have dropped for all groups, the
declines have been much greater among whites than blacks. Young
blacks fare even worse. In data collected between January 1994 and
June 1997, blacks accounted for 63 percent of infected individuals
between the ages of 13 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the disease is becoming more prevalent among
women of all races, who account for more than a quarter of new
infections. Young women, who make up 44 percent of those infected
between the ages of 13 and 24, are especially hard hit. The
changing face of the disease, from one with a vocal and educated
constituency of gay men to one afflicting poor minorities, women
and teen-agers, raises new challenges for prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As the demographics change, the government's AIDS policies must
change as well. Expansion of needle exchange programs, safer-sex
education in schools and drug treatment efforts would help slow the
virus' spread into new groups through needles and sexual contact.
But posturing in Congress has blocked these common-sense measures,
leaving desperate communities even more vulnerable to the epidemic.
Efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to direct some AIDS
prevention funds to agencies serving minorities should be expanded
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, black community and civil rights groups,
churches and schools must raise their voices to increase awareness
of the disease and its prevention. Their relative silence on the
subject has made it easier for politicians and the broader public
to ignore the disease's impact on a minority population struggling
to survive. &QL;

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S UNGUARDED BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County does not rely on the mystique of its fabled
beaches to attract summer lifeguards. It scours swim teams in high
schools and colleges on the West Coast, casting its net as far east
as Arizona. New York City, once again in the throes of a lifeguard
shortage, could take a page from California's book. Four miles of
city beach are now closed. Some stretches are shut for
environmental reasons, but two and a half miles are closed because
there are not enough guards. That is unacceptable in a crowded
metropolis, where summer heat and humidity can reach triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs 600 lifeguards to cover 14 miles of beaches. As
the holiday weekend approaches, it is 70 lifeguards short. It needs
600 more for 60-plus public pools. By the second week of July, the
Parks Department hopes to have 1,000 lifeguards altogether _ an
improvement over last summer, when it could find only 870
lifeguards and had to shut down six miles of beach between Memorial
Day and Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean lifeguards must meet rigorous standards _ they must swim
440 yards in 6 minutes 40 seconds, for example. The pay is modest
but hardly a deterrent. Novice lifeguards earn about $8.60 an hour,
experienced guards average more than $14. That is slightly below
California's pay scales, but as Parks Commissioner Henry Stern
jokingly observed in a recent interview with a California
newspaper, ``the surf may not be as good, but the ground is solid
and doesn't shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the department's recruiting efforts, which consist
largely of want ads, web site notices and memos to school
officials, should be vigorously expanded to reach competitive
swimmers at colleges up and down the East Coast. California has
devoured NCAA data for promising candidates, with marked success.
</P>
<P>
   No one is asking the department to do the impossible. It cannot
easily halt erosion, which closes some beaches, and it cannot
prevent storms. But it can find lifeguards. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Tempting as it may seem, Dan Cavaluzzi, a towboat
captain, does not refer to the weekend sailors who get hung up on
sandbars or run out of fuel as jerks, morons, or any of the other
terms one may use for people who mess up because of their own
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can make a mistake, says Cavaluzzi, who works for
TowBoat/U.S., a sort of AAA for boaters. It is not his job to be
``judgmental.'' What's the point of asking why an $85,000, 35-foot
cabin cruiser ended up roosting on pilings in the Hudson River,
making, when the tide is out, for a remarkable photo that is one of
the first things the captain shows to a visitor?
</P>
<P>
   The job of a towboat captain, as Cavaluzzi sees it, is to allay
distress, emotional and mechanical; to ``diffuse the tension and
anxiety''; to deal with ``the ego problem.'' Which is not to say
certain types do not try his patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a call, there are four things I ask,'' Cavaluzzi says,
on the deck of his 25-foot Privateer off City Island, his home
base. `` `Is everyone on board in good health? Are you taking on
water? Are there adequate life jackets?' Then _ if it's not an
emergency situation and they don't have insurance: `This is
commercial marine assistance. You have to be billed for this
service.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The waves lap gently against the boats of the weekend sailors;
the sky is blue and life is good _ though not as good as it was
years ago, when the Coast Guard would tow for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they start screaming, `That's a rip-off!' ''
Cavaluzzi says. ``I always say, `Sir, if you like, I can call the
Coast Guard.' They assume the Coast Guard is going to drop out of
the sky in three minutes. Meanwhile, the boat is still pounding on
the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling broadly, the captain does an eerie imitation of a prow
grinding against rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caaaa-runk, caaaa-runk!'' he growls. ``Then the wife or
girlfriend starts hollering. A couple more slams on the rock
settles it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a hard-drinking, hard-living old salt who lives on
his weathered boat accompanied by a one-eared cat and a can opener
so rusted you could contract tetanus just looking at it? Go to a
movie. Cavaluzzi, except for his pleasure in the misfortunes of
obnoxious sailors, has the aspect of a seafaring Boy Scout.
</P>
<P>
   A cleaning lady comes in every Monday to tidy up the boat. If
you remark, on a perfect Sunday as sailboats skim Long Island
Sound, that all one needs is a martini, Cavaluzzi quickly invokes
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``No drinking from May to November,'' he says. ``You never know
when you'll get a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he is a stickler for proper names.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have a lot of ropes, a visitor notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On board, we call them lines,'' Cavaluzzi says.
</P>
<P>
   Do so many boaters get into trouble because they don't read
their maps?
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them charts,'' Cavaluzzi says.
</P>
<P>
   A short history of aid at sea: In June 1983, the Coast Guard
began referring nonemergency calls to private towing operators.
TowBoat/U.S., a division of the Boat Owners Association of America,
one of the major private companies, provides unlimited towing for
an annual fee of $85.
</P>
<P>
   A short history of Cavaluzzi: Born Dec. 4, 1955, in the Bronx,
near Pelham Bay _ ``three blocks from the water'' _ to a New York
City bus driver who would put four sons through college. Graduated
from Bronx Community College with a degree in plastic engineering
and today, married and with a young son, runs a plastics supply
business from his home because, he says, you can't make a living in
the towing business. Was a volunteer with the Coast Guard
Auxiliary. Now is a co-owner of three boats that patrol the
approximately 30 miles of waterway from the Statue of Liberty to
Rye Beach, in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Try to get stories from Cavaluzzi about the early days of
``commercial marine assistance,'' when he was a private towing
operator and it was said to be a ferociously competitive game, and
you'll get little more than a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say you age, you mature,'' Cavaluzzi says.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his rescues, he is more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   He says that many of the devil-may-care Jet Skiers one sees
actually carry both insurance and cell phones and that he fished
two young Jet Skiers out of Eastchester Bay this past weekend after
their panicked father _ still aboard the Jet Ski _ placed a call.
He says that even if someone cannot afford to pay, ``you have a
moral obligation'' to tow the boat to the nearest port. He says,
referring to ``the ego problem,'' that sailboat owners tend to be
more difficult than power boat operators: they feel they know more
about the sea than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A story comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 65-foot sailboat,'' Cavaluzzi says, ``Hung up on rocks near
the lighthouse at Execution Point. I hollered, `You're aground.'
They didn't believe me. I said, `Look at the lighthouse! It's not
moving!' ''
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Cavaluzzi is smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just sipped another cocktail,'' he says. ``And we came
back later with another boat and towed 'em. When a sailboat's on
the rocks I have to tip 'em over about 45 degrees. And the wife is
screaming ... .''

FREE AGENCY OPENS WITH A STRONG CROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A general manager with a generous checkbook and several holes on
his roster could rapidly improve his team when the free-agent
signing season begins Wednesday. He could acquire goalie Mike
Richter, center Doug Gilmour, center Ron Francis, right wing Brett
Hull, defenseman Steve Duchesne and defenseman Uwe Krupp.
</P>
<P>
   These players might cost $25 million or more a season. All would
want multiyear contracts, possibly with no-trade clauses. But it
could be done with no compensation because all are over the age of
31. They are among the Group 3 free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's 10-year career in St. Louis ended Tuesday when General
Manager Larry Pleau told Hull the club would not re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our organization believes a change will be good
for the Blues, as well as Brett,'' Pleau said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said: ``I'm disappointed that the Blues wouldn't agree to a
no-trade clause. I wanted to know that I'd finish my career in St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been much recent speculation that he may go to
Chicago, where his father, Bobby Hull, was once known as the Golden
Jet. Should the Blackhawks sign Hull, it is possible that the No. 9
worn by his father will come out of retirement and be worn by the
son.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are not expected to bid for Hull. But they may be
interested in Scott Fraser, a 26-year-old Edmonton Oiler right wing
who is an unrestricted free agent in the Group 6 category. He
scored 12 goals in 29 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, the key question involves Richter, who earned
$3.9 million last season. His price on the market is expected to be
between $5 million and $7 million a season on a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation throughout last season was that Richter would be
wooed by either Vancouver or Philadelphia. The Canucks have Coach
Mike Keenan and captain Mark Messier, who were with Richter in New
York for the Stanley Cup championship of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are also a logical fit because Richter is from that
area and the team has not solved its chronic goalie problem.
Richter was chosen last week in the expansion draft by the new
Nashville team, but the Predators do not intend to sign him. They
merely hold rights to compensation for him after he signs with
another team.
</P>
<P>
   When he does, the Nashville team will get an at-large choice in
next summer's entry draft. It will come from no specific team but
will be added to the pool of players available, likely in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's availability occurs at a time that might not be ideal
for his bargaining leverage. He is coming off a mediocre season
into a market in which unrestricted goalies are plentiful. Among
the best-known are Curtis Joseph of Edmonton, John Vanbiesbrouck of
Florida and Sean Burke of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Should Richter leave the Rangers, they may be tempted to take
one of the others who would work for less money than Richter is
worth. With rebuilding ahead of them, the Rangers might not care to
pay a premium price for a goalie while filling in at so many other
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, seeking mobility on defense, are likely to talk
with Krupp, a former Islander who scored the overtime goal for
Colorado that clinched the fourth and final game of the Stanley Cup
finals against Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the general manager wished to take a more difficult path to
get a younger star, he could select one of the following Group 2
free agents: defenseman Aleksei Zhitnik of Buffalo, defenseman
Sandis Ozolinsh of Colorado, left wing Tomas Holmstrom of Detroit,
center Doug Weight of Edmonton, defenseman Rob Blake of Los
Angeles, center Saku Koivu of Montreal, defenseman Scott
Niedermayer of the Devils, right wing Zigmund Palffy of the
Islanders, left wing Rod Brind'Amour of Philadelphia, right wing
Owen Nolan of San Jose, center Pierre Turgeon of St. Louis,
defenseman Bryan McCabe of Vancouver or center Andrei Nikolishin of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These free agents' former teams have a right to either match
their offer sheets and keep them or lose them and get, as
compensation, up to five first-round draft choices. &QL;

THREE LEAVE ONE BIG BANK FOR ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER TRUELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a high-stakes game of musical chairs, Credit Suisse First
Boston has hired the leaders of Deutsche Bank's global
high-technology banking business.
</P>
<P>
   The new hires, which are expected to be announced Wednesday, are
an effort by Credit Suisse to build up its own franchise quickly in
the fast-growing area of investment banking for computer and
software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Quattrone, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank
securities' technology group, Bill Brady, its head of corporate
finance, and George Boutros, the group's head of mergers and
acquisitions, told Deutsche that they were leaving Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been informed of their intention to leave the firm,''
said Macy Egerton, a spokeswoman for Deutsche in New York. She said
that neither she nor her firm had any further comment on the
defections.
</P>
<P>
   The departures, while a potential coup for Credit Suisse, leave
Deutsche Bank's huge investments of recent years in high-technology
banking temporarily without leadership. All three men had built
their careers together at Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co., and had left that
firm with great fanfare in 1996 to head Deutsche's huge effort in
this area of investment banking from their offices in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, the German banking behemoth, had paid millions of
dollars to lure Quattrone and his colleagues and had even granted
them a share of the revenues they generated. The group had scored
some successes, notably the initial public offering for Amazon.com
and several other young Internet companies, but rivals had
repeatedly questioned whether Deutsche was making money on its
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The defections put a further dent in Deutsche's plans to build a
significant worldwide investment banking unit, which would also
service American high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse, which already owns a minority stake in Volpe
Welty, a small high-technology investment bank in California, has
made building up its high-technology banking business a strategic
priority. &QL;

GROCERS DECRY WELFARE DEBIT CARD AS COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Arizona grocers say the state's new program that
converts welfare checks and food-stamp coupons into a plastic debit
card is costing them money, and they want to be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it cost us money to do the work of the state?''
asked Dwayne Richard, president of Arizona Food Marketing Alliance.
``The state is saving money and the retailers are picking up the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona grocers say the program costs them in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   - Most large chains must train their floor and office staff to
handle the new debit card system.
</P>
<P>
   - Most say the one or two free debit card terminals the state
system is willing to provide are worthless in a store with five,
eight or 12 check-out counters.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure their customers are not inconvenienced, large
stores must be ready for food-stamp shoppers in all lines. That
means the state is forcing them to readjust their existing software
at a cost of up to $750 a store or $30,000 per large chain, Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   - Using the old food-stamp coupons is similar to a cash
transaction, with little cost involved. But the new state system
sharply increases debit card purchases, which costs retailers from
2 cents in the largest stores to 20 cents in the smaller ones each
time they swipe a card through their cash register computer,
Richard said. Some states have agreed to reimburse retailers,
including Maryland, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois. Arizona has
not.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely these new costs will be coming out of the grocer's
profits, which average a razor-thin 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of profit margin, any new costs will be passed
on to the customer,'' said Debra Albery, a spokeswoman for Safeway,
which has 10 stores in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers in Arizona and across the country like the concept of
debit cards for welfare shoppers, but similar complaints are being
heard around the country, said Carole Throssell, spokeswoman for
the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fairly widespread,'' Throssell said. ``We've been
frustrated by efforts of state and federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has not demanded uniformity in operating
systems from state to state, forcing some merchants to accommodate
two different systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a patchwork quilt system that is cumbersome,'' Throssell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, legislators failed to make the changes in the
program the grocers wanted but agreed to fund a study on the
program's financial impact on Pima County retailers, who begin the
program July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The state official running the program said he would support
legislation to give retailers a tax break for documented start-up
costs they incur, but he's not prepared to ``subsidize'' retailers
and deplete $300,000 annual savings for the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to enhance their revenue,'' Dayne Coffey, a
Department of Economic Security manager, said. ``If you don't want
to pay it, don't participate _ or use the state (computer)
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Grocers already absorb the cost of debit card use for other
customers, so they should do so for welfare customers also _ or
charge all customers a fee for using any debit cards, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting they raise prices,'' he said, ``but if they
provide a service to one class of debit card holders they should
provide the same service to all customers who present a debit
card.'' &QL;

PAUL VAN BUREN, 74, `DEATH-OF-GOD' THEOLOGIAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Paul Matthews van Buren, a leading exponent of the
``death of God'' school of theology, died on June 18 at Memorial
Hospital in Blue Hill, Maine. He was 74 and lived in nearby Little
Deer Isle.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said last week in an
announcement of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buren was trained in the philosophical method of linguistic
analysis, beginning with what he perceived as the problem of
speaking meaningfully about a God for whom no sensory verification
is possible. With ``God talk'' _ that is, talk of anything
transcendent _ ruled out, he built a faith focused on ethical
behavior around the historical Jesus of Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at Temple University, he was one of the three
principal American Christian theologians identified with the
``death of God'' movement of the 1960s, although he distanced
himself from that term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called death-of-God movement is a journalistic
invention,'' van Buren told an interviewer in 1974. ``It missed the
serious questions that needed to be discussed at the time, such as
whether the Christian message can make sense in the world we're
living in today.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Secular Meaning of the Gospel: Based on an
Analysis of Its Language'' (Macmillan, 1963), van Buren said, he
was ``trying to find an utterly nontranscendent way of interpreting
the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That way,'' he said, ``sense could be made of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other theologians criticized both the methodology and thinking
of the approach. One of the critics' central counterarguments was
that if faith was stripped of all the mysticism surrounding the
deity, there was little left of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buren, as an associate of the Shalom Hartman Institute of
Judaic Studies in Jerusalem in the 1980s, worked to build bridges
and new understanding between Christianity and Judaism. His last
book, ``According to the Scriptures,'' considered how early
Christians, as Jews, understood the death of Jesus through Jewish
methods of biblical interpretation. It is to be published in
October by Wm. B. Eerdmans.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buren made his reputation as a nontraditional theologian
with ``The Secular Meaning of the Gospel.'' He also wrote ``The
Edges of Language: An Essay in the Logic of a Religion''
(Macmillan, 1972). His long engagement with Judaism and discussions
with rabbinical scholars at the Hartman Institute was distilled in
a trilogy, ``A Theology of the Jewish-Christian Reality'' (Harper &AMP;
Row, 1987-88).
</P>
<P>
   Paul van Buren was a native of Norfolk, Va. He graduated with a
bachelor's degree in government from Harvard College in 1948 after
having served in World War II in the Coast Guard. He received a
bachelor's of sacred theology at Episcopal Theological School in
1951 and was ordained an Episcopal priest in the Diocese of
Massachusetts. His doctorate in theology came from the University
of Basel in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a co-rector and curate in Detroit and began his
academic career in 1957 as an assistant professor of systematic
theology at the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest in
Austin, Texas, in 1957. He joined the Temple faculty in 1964,
served as chairman of the department of religion from 1974 to 1976
and took emeritus status in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buren is survived by his wife of 50 years, Dr. Anne Hagopian
van Buren; two daughters, Alice van Buren, of Santa Fe, N.M., and
Ariane van Buren, of New York City; two sons, Philip, of New York
City, and Thomas, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a sister, Elsie van
Buren, of Peterborough, N.H.; a brother, Sheffield, of Harwichport,
Mass.; and five grandchildren.

SOSA SHOWS PATIENCE AT THE PLATE IN HIS FINEST SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Once upon a time, Sammy Sosa was the kind of
mad-hatter batter who swung so violently and so indiscriminately
that, it was said, he would attack even a white paper cup if it
came floating toward home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember pitching against him when I was with the Mets,''
said Mark Clark, now a teammate of Sosa's on the Cubs, ``and you
could bounce a ball in front of the plate, and he'd swing at it.
He'd go for a high, bad slider. You knew he was going to be up
there hacking. You knew he could hurt you, but you felt you could
handle him in tight situations. Not anymore. He's been
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible may be an understatement, in a sports world of
galloping hyperbole. Tuesday evening at leafy Wrigley Field, Sosa
concluded the most remarkable home run-hitting month in the history
of baseball. Entering the Cubs' game against Arizona, he had
slugged 19 homers _ breaking the one-month record held by Rudy
York, who hit 18 homers in August 1937 for the Tigers. If Sosa
happened to belt homers as he has in June for each of the six
months of a season, he would wind up with 114 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that not even the compactly, powerfully built,
easygoing right fielder for the Cubs is on that pace. More
modestly, he is on track to break the one-season home run record of
61, set by Roger Maris in 1961. At month's end, about the halfway
point of the 1998 season, Sosa has stroked 32 homers, which put him
even with the Seattle Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. and four behind the
St. Louis Cardinals' masher, Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said Tuesday. ``He's the man. If
anyone's going to break Roger Maris' record, it's going to be him.
Me, I'm just another kid on the block having a pretty good
season.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been more than just another kid on the block for several
years now, although he has not been as appreciated or as generally
applauded as he is this season. He has not only slugged homers like
crazy, but is also hitting for average _ his .328 is 71 points
higher than his 10-year major league career average _ and has
knocked in 78 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people forget when they look at what Sammy has done
this year,'' Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman said, ``is that he's put up
great numbers for a bunch of years. Forty homers, 36 homers twice,
a hundred or more RBIs for three straight seasons. The other fact
is that he has also matured as a ballplayer, especially at the
plate. He has become more patient, waiting for the pitcher to get
the ball in the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The patience and the maturity may be seen in the way the
right-handed-hitting Sosa will go to other fields on pitches that
in the past he would try to pull. ``In Kansas City last weekend,''
Riggleman said, ``he got two big hits for us, both to right field,
and drove in key runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has even sprayed his soaring home runs around, hitting 13
to left, 10 to center and nine to right.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is 29, and didn't begin playing organized baseball until he
was 14, in San Pedro de Macoris, the town in the Dominican Republic
that has sent an extraordinary number of players to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how far he's come when you consider where he came
from,'' said Omar Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager, who
was a scout for the Texas Rangers in 1985 when he signed Sosa for
$3,500. ``I remember him coming from a poverty-stricken background,
where he lived in a two-room house with his widowed mother and four
brothers and two sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa remembers selling oranges for 10 cents apiece and shining
shoes for 25 cents to help the finances of his family. Last year,
he signed a four-year contract with the Cubs for $42 million. ``I
think about when I had very little, when I couldn't buy myself a
gift, or my family a gift,'' he said. ``That's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been generous with his money, going to hospitals in the
United States and Latin America, and returning to the Dominican
Republic to spread gifts to the needy and the ailing, as well as
investing in his home country, having developed a mall in hopes of
creating jobs and opportunities beyond baseball. He has also been
generous with himself and his immediate family _ his wife, Sonia,
and their four children, and his mother and brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has done it in a circuitous fashion. He came up with the
Rangers, was traded to the Chicago White Sox, hit as low as .203
for them and found himself in the minors before being traded to the
Cubs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa says that the secret of his success this season has to do,
yes, with more patience, but also with a far better ball club than
he had been accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting third now with Henry Rodriguez and Mark Grace
behind me,'' he said, ``so the pitchers have to come in with good
pitches to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has become a huge sports presence in Chicago, a place
dominated by another rather colossal individual. ``The president of
my country, Leonel Fernandez, asked if I could get Mike Jordan to
visit the Dominican,'' Sosa said. ``I agreed to try. I went to the
United Center, where the Bulls were practicing, and I think he will
come. We would play golf. The only problem is, I don't play golf. I
practiced once, but I hit everything a foul ball, and I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had much better luck at hitting fair balls out of Wrigley
Field, among numerous other ball yards in the Western Hemisphere. &QL;

NEW JERSEY MENTAL HOSPITAL SHUTS DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IVER PETERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARLBORO TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital closed
Tuesday for good, 67 years after it opened and after three years of
blistering opposition from unions whose members lost good jobs,
from the families of some patients who worried that their loved
ones would be hurt and from homeowners who do not want mentally ill
people as neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first big psychiatric hospital to be shut under the
state's three-year plan to move men and women with schizophrenia,
manic depression, severe depression and other disorders out of big
institutions, a process known as deinstitutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the 800 patients once treated here were taken to new
places a week ago. Some went to other state psychiatric hospitals
and some to group homes, but most went to live on their own with a
$450-a-month stipend and help from special teams that seek to
prevent the kinds of crises that put the patients in hospitals in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Roberts, the chief executive of Marlboro, said he was sad
that his 17 years at the hospital were over, but not sad to see the
patients removed from Marlboro's 17 custodial ``cottages'' _
Tudor-style dormitories for as many as 55 patients each _ and sent
to less institutional settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of place people were talking about when they
said someone had been `put away,''' Roberts said in the chaos of
his former office, which was filled with cardboard boxes. ``For a
long time, that's what happened _ people were put here and all but
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   A small cemetery near Marlboro's main gate remains as a reminder
of the days when patients came to the hospital never to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Marlboro leaves New Jersey with three big
psychiatric hospitals: Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital near
Parsippany in the north, Trenton Psychiatric Hospital in the
center, and in the south, Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Camden
County, where Roberts will be the new chief. As part of
deinstitutionalization, the state is also closing some of its seven
developmental centers for mentally retarded patients in favor of
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Beauchamp, executive director of the Mental Health
Association in New Jersey, said the closing of Marlboro was long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, people go through the state hospitals
rather quickly,'' Ms. Beauchamp said. ``They are stabilized, they
got some care and they were moved out. But the people who were in
Marlboro a long time really suffered the most _ they spent long
periods of their lives locked away, not really learning anything
new and getting just custodially cared for _ and there is really no
excuse for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Tuesday's closing was for the best. The
hospital's staff of 1,400 people, most of them unionized dormitory
workers called ``human services technicians,'' were faced with the
choice of commuting to one of the remaining state psychiatric
hospitals to keep their $30,000 a year jobs, or leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Their unions accuse Gov. Christie Whitman of favoring the
closing of Marlboro to save money, although the governor has
promised that the $68 million it took to run Marlboro for a year
will be spent on community-based care. Group homes are run by
nonprofit, and nonunion, mental health groups.

RALPH S. BROWN, 85, PROFESSOR AND EXPERT ON COPYRIGHT LAW  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph S. Brown, a law professor at Yale Law School
for more than four decades and an expert on unfair competition,
copyright, government security, and the rights of individuals, died
on June 17. He was 85 and lived in Guilford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who taught his last course, ``Copyright and Unfair
Competition,'' during the winter, was the editor of the first
casebook on these subjects, ``Cases on Copyright, Unfair
Competition, and Other Topics.'' The book was republished in its
sixth edition in 1995, 35 years after it originally appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Among his battles in support of free competition in the 1950s
was his opposition to the ``fair trade'' laws, which enabled
retailers to band together to maintain set price levels. The
professor, maintaining in the language of the day that this
practice should not be exempt from antitrust laws, said: ``Bargain
hunting, especially for the ladies, is a pretty important
privilege. And if a man wants to buy a bottle of aspirin and save a
nickel by walking an extra block, there shouldn't be a law to
prevent that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Brown wrote ``Loyalty and Security: Employment Tests in
the United States,'' for which he was awarded the Henderson Prize
from Harvard Law School for excellence in dealing with problems in
government. He was concerned about both the fairness and
effectiveness of the federal government's security programs
covering civilian defense workers with access to classified
information. The programs grew out of growing fears of Communist
infiltration of the government in the late 1940s and '50s. Brown
said that ``the full panorama of employment tests carried on in the
name of loyalty and security were every bit as extensive and
confusing'' as those that followed Waterloo or Gettysburg, and he
called for greater clarity and care in determining and declaring
where government risks existed and where they did not. Much of the
program was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1959 as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was born in Federalsburg, Md., and graduated from Phillips
Exeter Academy. He received both his Bachelor of Arts degree, in
1935, and his law degree, in 1939, from Yale. After law school, he
joined the New York firm of Wright, Gordon, Zachry &AMP; Parlin, then
moved to Washington to serve as a lawyer for the Office of Price
Administration, but soon thereafter he joined the Navy. He was
appointed to the Yale law faculty after returning from service in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, he was associate dean of the law school from 1965 to
1970, a member of the board of governors of the Yale University
Press and chairman of the Yale advisory committee on investor
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, the former Elizabeth Mills, he is survived by
three daughters, Lauren Brown, of Branford, Conn., Valerie Brown,
of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Lila Brown, of Frankfurt, Germany; two
brothers, Elliott, of Naples, Fla., and Huey, of Snow Hill, Md.;
two sisters, Sarah McCulloch, of Guilford, Conn., and Barbara Pace,
of Chautauqua, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.

IGNORING ORDERS, MERCHANTS SELL NEW METROCARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officially, the new unlimited-ride Metrocards do not
go on sale until Saturday. But some merchants who will be official
vendors of the new cards are ignoring orders not to sell them
before the start of the program and are selling them to subway
riders who fear that the new cards will be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting high interest in the new fare program, the merchants
say riders are trying to beat the rush for the new cards and are
worried that stores will quickly run out once the program begins.
Of 60 dealers questioned in the last two days, 14 said they were
already selling the cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York City Transit executive in charge of Metrocards,
Christopher Boylan, said there was no reason to be concerned that
the 3,200 vendors outside subway stations would be running out of
the new Metrocards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than enough to satisfy the needs of our customers
and we can fill the needs of an out-of-station provider
overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boylan said the merchants were notified that they were not to
sell the unlimited-ride cards until July 4. But he said the
merchants would not be punished for jumping the gun. He also said
buyers would find notification of the July 4 start date on the
cards' wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Transit officials said they were concerned about
confusion that might result from the early sales. A customer could
buy a weekly or monthly pass, thinking it could be used
immediately, and it would not be usable until Saturday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   If someone attempts to use one of the new cards before Saturday,
a message will appear on the turnstile monitor that reads ``valid
only after 07/03/98.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a
rider advocacy group, said he would not fault New York City Transit
for any confusion over the new cards. ``They had only six months to
put this program together, and it is a miracle that it looks like
it is going to work,'' Russianoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The new cards, which cannot be used more than once in 18 minutes
at the same entrance to discourage use by nonpaying riders, are
being unveiled Saturday to coincide with the one-year anniversary
of a program that allowed free subway-to-bus transfers with a
Metrocard, New York City Transit officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Boylan, who told the agency's finance committee last week that
nearly 72 percent of the subway system's riders were using
Metrocards, said he expected the new weekly cards would increase
sales immediately and the monthly cards would do the same once
people return to more regular work schedules in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to introduce a one-day unlimited-ride Metrocard
for $4 in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The unlimited-ride passes, which were announced by Gov. George
Pataki in December and will cost $17 a week and $63 a month, are
expected to attract 100 million additional rides a year, a
ridership increase of about 6 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Transit officials said a list of vendors selling
the cards in New York City could be found at the agency's World
Wide Web site (www.mtahq.org/mtacc/demo/zipmaps.htm).
</P>
<P>
   The card is also being sold in Nassau and Westchester Counties,
officials said. &QL;

 &HT;    Chef, can you dig it? Judge restores old debt
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His career revived by a shift from ``Shaft'' to
``Chef,'' actor and soul singer Isaac Hayes has been ordered by a
Cobb County, Ga. judge to repay a decade-old $88,868 business loan
_ plus almst $100,000 in interest.
</P>
<P>
   Area businesswoman Doris Wall originally obtained a court order
in 1989 demanding that Hayes pay the money.
</P>
<P>
   But her attorney, Lynwood Maddox Sr., said that for much of the
'90s, Wall didn't pursue the money, believing Hayes didn't have the
means to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, she knows he's making a comeback or is reviving his
career or whatever,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   Once known primarily for his 1971 Oscar-winning theme from
``Shaft,'' Hayes has enjoyed a career boost via TV as the voice
behind the cartoon character Chef, a school cafeteria worker, on
the Comedy Central cartoon ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, State Court Judge Robert McDuff revived the 1989
order. With interest, Hayes must pay about $188,130, Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   The loan occurred sometime in the late 1980s, according to
Maddox, who said he didn't know what the money was for. Hayes lived
in metro Atlanta from 1979 to 1992. He lives in New York now.

CRITICS FEAR SHIFT IN CONTROL OF CHILD CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration Tuesday will put into
place the final pieces of its plan to reorganize the city's network
of 39 child health-care clinics, and advocates for the poor are
worried that it will harm the quality of services at clinics that
serve the city's poorest children.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the change appears to be merely a bureaucratic
pen stroke. Control over the clinics, for years administered apart
from the city's sprawling public health system, will be moved from
the main office of the Health and Hospitals Corp. to hospitals and
clinics in neighborhoods around the city. Giuliani officials say
there will be no changes in the clinics themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the advocates contend that the shift represents a subtle
step toward dismantling the child clinics and the distinct role
they have had for the last 90 years as small-scale providers of
health care for children only. Ultimately, the advocates fear, the
shift could signal an end to the idea that the clinics are somehow
special, and then future budget cuts could force the city into
folding them into the rest of the public health system.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the advocates released a survey showing that a large
majority of parents whose children are treated at the clinics are
satisfied with their services. They said that level of satisfaction
argues against making major changes _ and particularly beginning to
charge fees _ that might make parents less likely to take their
children to the clinics for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Judy Wessler, policy
coordinator for the Commission on the Public's Health System and a
frequent critic of the Giuliani administration on health issues.
``They work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Van Dunn, a senior vice president of the city's Health
and Hospitals Corp., agreed, saying the clinics do work well. He
said the city has no plans to close or merge them, or begin
charging fees. Aside from shifting the responsibility from the
health agency's main office to the public hospitals near the
clinics, he said, parents would see no changes in the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand their concerns,'' Dunn said. ``They are
worried that when you integrate that things are going to get
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the city's top health officials are
``committed to these clinics,'' which were first established in
1908 to give milk and water to poor immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see them as a vital source of health care to the
community,'' Dunn said, ``and we would not, I repeat not,
compromise the delivery of care to children.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was the latest in a barrage of assaults on the city's
efforts since 1994 to change the way the clinics are administered.
Based on interviews with 142 parents, the report found that 95
percent of them were satisfied with the services and 82 percent
said they could get immediate appointments for their children.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the clinics were under the city's Department of
Health, in an arrangement that the advocates said protected them as
distinct entities for children. Nearly half of the clinics are in
public housing projects, apart from other public hospitals or
primary care clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the child clinics were transferred to the Health
and Hospitals Corp., which runs the public hospital system, and
advocates worried that they would be lost in its huge bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Concern grew last fall when the agency decided to decentralize
control over the clinics, making them the responsibility of the
eight divisions of public hospitals and clinics (the North Bronx
network, for example, encompasses Jacobi Medical Center, North
Central Bronx Hospitals and several clinics).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katherine Lobach, the former city official who oversaw the
child health clinics for 11 years, said she worried that
decentralization would erode what she said had been a hallmark of
the clinic: one office that oversaw the quality of the entire
program and set consistent medical standards for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will no longer be any central authority to maintain the
standards,'' Dr. Lobach said.

   CLOUDS NEVER LIFT FOR TEXAS UNDERDOG
</P>
<P>
   Just when Garry Mauro thought things could not get any worse in
his effort to unseat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, things got
worse.
</P>
<P>
   For months the polls have had Mauro, a Democrat and the state
land commissioner, trailing the popular Republican governor, most
recently by better than 50 points. How could it get any worse?
</P>
<P>
   Well ...
</P>
<P>
   First came the bumper stickers, proclaiming ``Vote Texan:
Bush/Sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be John Sharp. He is a Democrat, running for
lieutenant governor. He says he does not have any problem with the
sticker pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the incumbent lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. He is
the state's highest-ranking elected Democrat. He is not seeking
re-election _ but he is seeking to re-elect Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then House Speaker Pete Laney, another top Democrat, along with
Paul Hobby, the Democratic candidate for comptroller, said they
would not be getting involved in the governor's race, followed by
state Rep. Robert Junell, a Democrat who is chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, and a hundred or so Democratic sheriffs
and other county officials, who said they would be getting involved
in the race _ on Bush's side.
</P>
<P>
   Finally came the most embarrassing poll of all, the one released
just a few days ago that found that roughly 40 percent of all
Democratic voters plan to vote for Bush, whereas just 2 percent of
Republican voters intend to support Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing just fine,'' Mauro insists, noting that the
country's top Democrats, President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, have both spoken out for him and have helped him raise
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   But the way many political pros in Texas see it, Mauro is in the
worst of political places. They say he is faring so badly
politically that he threatens to drag down the entire Democratic
ticket this fall and at the same time hand Bush, the former
president's son, not only a second term as governor of the nation's
second-most-populous state but also a running start, if he wants
it, in the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE MISSION FOR GUNG-HO B-1 BOB
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Dornan was a member of Congress, representing
California's dependably Republican and conservative Orange County
for the better part of two decades, he was not much given to
Capitol Hill's special brand of civility, comity and convention. He
was better known, instead, as the master of boastful bluster, the
ad hominem assault and the blunt riposte.
</P>
<P>
   So two years ago when he got into political trouble back in his
home district, those Republicans who had felt his verbal sting one
time too often were not there to help. He was turned out of office
by Loretta Sanchez, one of the growing number of moderate Democrats
showing up in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than retreat, Dornan spent almost $500,000 to challenge
the validity of the balloting (again with no help from his party).
When that did not work, he decided to run again, though he was
urged not to by many Republican leaders in California and
Washington, who figured a stronger candidate could be found to
challenge Ms. Sanchez and return the district to Republican
control.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of those leaders, Dornan won the primary _ and
immediately demanded that they apologize and reimburse him for his
unsuccessful vote challenge. When they did not, he called Speaker
Newt Gingrich ``a disaster for Republicans'' and threatened to
boycott a June 29 rally in California at which Gingrich was to talk
about party unity and the need to elect every Republican
congressional candidate possible in order to retain control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt, it's time for you to bring me in from the cold,'' Dornan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich sent word on Friday that Dornan, a former Air Force
pilot known as B-1 Bob, would be welcomed at the Monday rally. And
then at the rally, after speaking about party unity and what it
would take to retain control of the House, the speaker added:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dedicated to electing Bob Dornan and returning him to
his seat in the House. I believe that B-1 Bob has one more mission
to run for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornan jumped to his feet and threw the speaker a salute.
</P>
<P>
   TERM-LIMIT CAMPAIGN: LESS BANG FOR THE BUCK
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of term limits have been unusually active this year,
pressing candidates in just about every state, especially
congressional candidates, to pledge to serve a limited time in
office. Those candidates who have refused have been sharply
chastised in costly advertising campaigns, and those who have taken
a pledge have been roundly praised.
</P>
<P>
   And the results?
</P>
<P>
   Clean-cut examples of legislators' being elected or turned out
of office as a result of the pledge campaign are hard to come by,
even though term-limits groups have spent big money in many races.
For every claim of success, there is at least another claim of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's special congressional election in New Mexico,
term-limits advocates spent $250,000 in support of one of the
candidates. He lost. But what was the impact of the term-limits
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Also in dispute this election year is what success the advocates
are having in passing new term-limits laws, previously an area of
considerable success, at least at the state level. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   On the June 2 primary ballot in California, voters found an
initiative that proposed requiring members of Congress to push for
passage of a Constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.
Pending adoption of that limit, all candidates would be asked to
sign pledges of support for term limits and those who refused would
be publicly identified in ballot material.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's backers conceded even before it was placed on the
ballot that it might be unconstitutional, given that courts have
said that states must not interfere in federal elections. But give
the measure a shot anyway, voters were told, because come the fall
a ``superior,'' more carefully worded substitute would be on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The June initiative passed, narrowly, and presumably will soon
face a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But come November there will be no ``superior'' substitute to
vote on. The term-limits forces missed the mid-June deadline for
obtaining the 433,269 petition signatures required to get it on the
November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for U.S. Term Limits, a leading backer of the
substitute, characterize the failure as a minor setback and insist
there is still plenty of momentum left in the term-limits crusade. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to prove his loyalty to state Republican
leaders for the second time in a month, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
embraced the re-election campaign of state Attorney General Dennis
Vacco on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani held a news conference on the steps of City Hall to
announce his endorsement of Vacco, a Republican who is running for
a second term along with Gov. George Pataki. He called Vacco ``an
excellent partner'' and said he deserved much of the credit for
reducing crime in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came four weeks after Giuliani warmly praised
Pataki, whose candidacy he opposed in 1994, in a speech at the
Republican State Convention in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In both his convention speech and Tuesday's endorsement,
Giuliani was clearly trying to make amends with state GOP leaders,
whose support could be crucial to his future as a state or national
candidate. Although the endorsement was not shocking _ the mayor
also supported Vacco in 1994 _ it came surprisingly early in the
campaign season. Four years ago, Giuliani waited until September to
endorse Vacco.

NEW YORKERS JAM REMEDIAL CLASSES FOR A TOUGHER CUNY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A month after trustees at the City University of New
York voted to phase out remedial courses from their four-year
colleges and set higher entrance standards, college officials say
they are seeing a big jump in the number of students applying for
CUNY's summer remedial courses, hoping to master basic reading,
writing and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in interest in the summer courses has prompted the
university and its branch campuses _ both the two-year community
colleges and the four-year colleges _ to add thousands more seats
for remedial students. While officials on Tuesday had no precise
figures on how many had applied for remedial courses this summer,
they said they expected to register about 50 percent more students
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colleges have all found themselves inundated with requests
for seats for summer immersion,'' said Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice
chancellor for academic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The new entrance standards, which bar students from enrolling in
four-year colleges until they pass placement exams in all three
subjects, do not begin to take effect until the fall of 1999 and
will not be fully in place until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But college officials and students said that the highly
publicized debate this spring over the fate of CUNY's remedial
programs had made more students aware of the requirements and eager
to get the work out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The summer immersion classes are particularly desirable because
they are free _ students who take remedial classes during the
school year pay regular tuition _ and the summer classes tend to
have higher pass rates than semester courses.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials project that remedial enrollment will be more
than 22,500, up from fewer than 15,000 last summer. Some colleges
still have waiting lists, but no figures were available on how many
total students had applied for summer slots. They include both new
students and those already enrolled in CUNY who have not finished
their remedial work.
</P>
<P>
   Francia Fermin, 19, who began remedial classes at Medgar Evers
College in Brooklyn this week, is typical of the summer students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned,'' she said. ``I want to be sure I can
complete it. My mother, she's kind of worried, and she wants me to
finish it and get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   A good student at St. Michael's Academy in Manhattan, where she
got mostly A's and B's, Ms. Fermin learned a few weeks ago that she
had failed all three placement exams.
</P>
<P>
   Medgar Evers President Edison O. Jackson said that whenever he
speaks, people ask him whether their children will be squeezed out
of CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is heightened awareness on the part of the
community,'' he said. ``They say, `I want to get my child in
there.' They don't want the door to shut in their face. They don't
want to take the gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   CUNY has budgeted an extra $1 million for this summer's remedial
courses, up 18 percent from $5.5 million in 1997. It is not nearly
enough to pay for the 50 percent rise in seats. But Medgar Evers
and other colleges have rearranged their budgets to try to let more
students take the courses this summer, rather than during the
regular school year.

 &HT;    U.S. GULF ALLY HAS DAIRY QUEEN, HARDEE'S AND POLITICAL PRISONERS
 &HT;    With BAHRAIN-GLANCEBOX 
 &HT;    Advance for use the weekend of July 3-6 
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain _ In the sandy little neighborhood near the mall
with the J.C. Penney's, graffiti cries out for any foreigner who
might pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reformist. Not a terrorist,'' it says in broken English
that will likely be covered quickly by police wielding rifles and
paint buckets.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans know little about Bahrain, but many of the Arabs
here speak English. They eat at Dairy Queen and Hardee's, work in
banks and resorts or live off the sailors at the port center for
the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans celebrate their independence this weekend, tidy
little Bahrain has everything American except democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Facing tough restrictions on free speech, an opposition movement
is trying to bring back a parliament that was banned 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors regularly criticize Bahrain, a country of
586,000 and only four times the size of Washington, D.C., for
jailing dissidents without trial and mistreating prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahraini government counters that its opponents are
``foreign-backed militant extremists'' responsible for thousands of
arsons and bombings.
</P>
<P>
   They note that nearby Iran has backed attempts to destabilize
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers say Bahrain's leaders exaggerate the outside
threat because it strikes a nerve with their American ally. A real
terrorist army, they say, would likely use firearms and cause more
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprisingly patient movement,'' said Graham Fuller, a
researcher with the Rand Corporation and a former high-ranking
official in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller called the Bahraini opposition ``a genuine push for
democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement's most frequent tools appear to be graffiti, the
Internet, vandalism and arsons _ which have killed several.
Activists enjoy jamming tires around household propane tanks and
burning them until the tank top blows with a loud, but harmless,
bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pure Bahraini invention,'' boasted an enthusiastic
college graduate who is an activist in his early 20s. ``We figured
out we could let all the foreigners know (about us), without
hurting anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most prominent opposition group is the Bahrain
Freedom Movement, with an Internet site featuring pictures of the
movement's martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   They show no signs of anti-Americanism, despite the U.S. support
for Bahrain's rulers. They ask for an elected parliament, the
release of political prisoners, and implementation of the country's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But many question if the opposition will keep it's relatively
restrained approach, given the political climate on the steamy
islands.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 U.S. State Department report, there were up
to 1,100 Bahrainis in jail for opposing the government. Many are
there just for speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   The report said they are sometimes beaten on their feet and
heads, burned with cigarettes or subjected to electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from Amnesty International gave roughly the same
assessment, noting that two prisoners died in Bahraini jails,
apparently from mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahrain is perched in the volatile Persian Gulf, important
for the United States' watch over oil shipping. It consistently
supports the U.S. pressure on Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bahrain is a state that has been long a friend and partner of
the United States in the important work of ensuring the security
and stability of the Gulf region,'' U.S. Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering said in Bahrain recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security concerns trump human rights concerns . . . even
though the human rights record of Bahrain is worse than any other
place on the Arabian Peninsula,'' said Nathan Brown, director of
the George Washington University Middle East Studies Program.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been run like a family business by the
Al-Khalifa monarchy since the 1700s. Power is mostly held by Sunni
Muslims who, according to the State Department, hold a ``favored
status'' for jobs over the two-thirds of the population that are
Shia Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Khalifa's, Sunnis, live in palaces and drive luxury cars
with the low-numbered license plates.
</P>
<P>
   They get credit for making Bahrain modern before its neighbors.
It has the world's largest aluminum plant, good health care and
literacy rates around 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But unemployment is rising, even though one-third of the
population comprises foreign workers who have been brought in to do
much of the manual labor and police work. The population has grown
quickly and is restless.
</P>
<P>
   The Al-Khalifa family dissolved the country's parliament in 1975
and allows no political parties. The family appointed a council to
serve in place of the parliament, similar to councils throughout a
region not known for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The current unrest began in 1994 with a petition drive and
street demonstrations calling for parliament. About 40 people have
been killed in the dispute, with the two sides differing on who has
lost the most. Some activists have died in prison, while some
police and civilians have died in arson fires.
</P>
<P>
   The country now runs under a ``security law''' under which
people can be jailed up to three years without trials. Sometimes,
when their terms come up, they are re-arrested immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini officials note they frequently release prisoners and
that anyone who wants change can speak directly to the Amir, Sheikh
Isa bin(cq) Sulman Al-Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you talk about some groups which commit crimes, by
killing people or burning houses or destroying public utilities,
such kind of people you don't deal with through dialogue. You deal
with them through the court,'' said Bahrain's Minister of
Information Mohumad Al-Mutawa in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini officials count more than 7,300 arsons and 179
explosive or incendiary incidents ``by a textbook example of a 20th
century insurgency campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al-Mutawa said the country allows free speech, but the State
Department report said the government restricts Internet access and
satellite dish ownership. Sensitive to adverse publicity, it
deported a reporter for a German company last year. Most Bahrainis
will not let their names be used when talking about the government
to foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it acts with restraint, and observers agree
things could be worse. Bahrain has not executed its opponents and
frequently releases them once they agree to cease their activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is often allowed to monitor prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is little consolation to the wife of the most prominent
opposition leader. Sheikh Abdul Amir Al-Jamri, 59, is a religious
leader and was a member of the parliament before it was abolished.
He has been in prison since 1996 without being charged or brought
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheikh Abdul Amir insists on using peaceful methods to restore
the parliament,'' said his wife Zahra Yousif Atiya, known as Um
Jameel.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Jameel, is also in prison and she wants the world to
know what is going on in the tiny island state.
</P>
<P>
   ``America controls everything. It's all in their hands. If they
wanted Bahrain to restore parliament, they could do it in the first
day,'' she said.

DESPITE TWIST, JUDGE ORDERS ARRAIGNMENT FOR BRUNNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Dominguez High basketball star Kenny Brunner was ordered
Tuesday to be arraigned in Superior Court on charges of robbery and
attempted murder, but the case against him was dealt a severe blow
when the victim and an eyewitness testified under oath that they
could no longer be sure that Brunner was the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a case,'' said Jerome Bradford, Brunner's
private attorney, after Municipal Court Judge Jacob Adajian
concluded Tuesday's preliminary hearing by ordering Brunner and
co-defendant LaDale Lunnie to be arraigned July14 in Superior Court
on charges they robbed Los Angeles City College basketball coach
Mike Miller of $1,500 cash and that Brunner tried to murder him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D.A. should dismiss this case. Is the D.A. (office)
prosecuting this because it's out for justice and truth or because
Kenny Brunner is a college basketball star?''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner in January quit Georgetown's team midway through his
freshman season and later left Fresno State when he was suspended
after being charged in a robbery and assault case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting attorney Andrew Bassis said he intends to go forward
with this case, but conceded that Tuesday's testimony of Miller and
basketball scout Russell Ramsey, an eyewitness to the robbery, was
``important.''
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles police officers Kevin Webb and Nathan Butcher
testified that Lunnie told them he helped Brunner with the robbery,
that testimony may not be allowed in Superior Court, where a
statement of one co-defendant cannot usually be used against
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case,'' Bassis said, ``it may create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Ramsey said Tuesday they couldn't be sure Brunner was
the man who a few minutes after the departure of Lunnie, an LACC
student came into Miller's school office on the afternoon of May
22, stuck a revolver against Miller's chest and pulled the trigger.
When the gun didn't fire, Miller said he asked the assailant what
he wanted and the man said, ``Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller then reached into the left pocket of his pants, pulled
out 15 $100 bills which he often carried ``to pay for (players')
dinners or anything else,'' and handed them to the man who then
fled. When Miller picked Brunner out of a police mug sheet the next
day, he wrote on a report: ``This is certainly the man who did
this. I will never forget his face.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miller was asked Tuesday by Bassis
</P>
<P>
   if Brunner was the man who robbed him, Miller replied: ``I
believe so, but I can't be 100percent sure. ... I hadn't slept all
night. I was upset at having a gun at my chest. I thought somebody
was going to kill me. At the time I was somewhat traumatized. It's
hard to make a positive identification.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ramsey followed Miller to the witness stand, he seemed even
less sure that Brunner, the man he also picked out of the mug
sheet, was the assailant. Ramsey described the assailant as clean
shaven, while Brunner, in the mug shot, had some facial hair. He
also said Brunner appeared an inch or so taller and more muscular
than the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Ramsey each testified that before the robbery they
had never heard of Brunner, a four-year starter and a high school
All-American at one of the highest-profile basketball programs in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who coached LACC to the state title in 1997, said he has
seen Dominguez play twice, but he was focused on opposing players
he was recruiting. Ramsey said he just got into the scouting
business a year ago, by which time Brunner was already out of high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bassis asked Miller and Ramsey if, before the robbery, they
would recognize Brunner walking down the street. Each answered,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassis asked Ramsey if anyone had asked him not to make an
identification in the case. Ramsey answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officers testified that Lunnie told them Brunner
would pay him $100 if he talked to Miller, made sure the adjacent
gym door was closed and if he waited in the car to drive Brunner
away.
</P>
<P>
   Lunnie led officers to Brunner's residence in South Central L.A.
According to Webb: ``Mr. Lunnie kept saying, `Don't let Kenny see
me if he sees me, he's going to kill me. The guy is crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford characterized Lunnie as a liar who didn't even know
Brunner. Bassis said Lunnie's statements to the police are
credible. ``There's no reason to believe Mr. Lunnie would implicate
Mr. Brunner in a robbery if he didn't know him,'' Bassis said.
``How does he know Mr. Brunner was not in Hawaii?''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, unable to make $550,000 bail, is being held in L.A.
County jail. He attended Tuesday's hearing in handcuffs wearing an
inmate uniform of a white shirt and powder blue pants with white
socks and tan sandals.
</P>
<P>
   He winked at two of his friends, Laker forward Mario Bennett and
former Pepperdine star Dane Suttle, and sneered briefly at Lunnie
but otherwise sat passively through most of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lunnie remained free Tuesday, having posted $35,000 bail.
