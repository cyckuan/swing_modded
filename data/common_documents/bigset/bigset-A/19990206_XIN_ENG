BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana has
said that the world community would by no means support the
independence bid of Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The target of the world community is to achieve a high-degree
of autonomy for Kosovo, within the scope of Yugoslavia, Solana
told Yugoslavia's Nedeljne Informative Novine weekly, which was
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Solana stressed that neither did NATO want to hear the appeal
for Kosovo's independence nor support any program that advocated
its independence.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, have been fighting Belgrade for independence. The two

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A wild fire has destroyed
close to 100 hectares of natural forest belonging to the Bale
Mountains National Park, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local police as saying that the fire which
broke out last Saturday might have been caused by angry local
pastoralists whose cattle were devoured by the wild beasts.
</P>
<P>
The Bale Mountains National Park, some 330 kolometers southeast
of Addis Ababa, is Africa's largest Afro-alpine habitat. The
southern part of the park is heavily forested where is the home of
numerous animals including lion, leopard, spotted hyena and red
fox.
</P>
<P>
Police said the prevailing windy climate had made it difficult
to put out the fire that raged for three days.
</P>
<P>
Local residents who took part in the effort to extinguish the
fire said they have seen scorched bones of animals apparently
consumed by the fire.
</P>
<P>
A man allegedly caught red-handed while igniting the fire has
been taken into custody while the police have intensified their
search for the other fire-raisers, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> GA Resumes Emergency Special Session on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua)- -The United Nations
General Assembly on Friday resumed the tenth emergency special
session to consider "Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East
Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory".
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the session was sponsored by the Group of
Arab States and supported by the Movement of Non-Alignment
Countries.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the session would be to recommend that a
conference be convened involving the countries that have signed
the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention barring settlements on occupied
territory.
</P>
<P>
The session was originally summoned in April 1997 and has since
reconvened three times, most recently last March.
</P>
<P>
Previous sessions of the emergency General Assembly
overwhelmingly condemned Israel's failure to revoke plans to build
housing at a site south of Jerusalem called Har Homa in Hebrew and
Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic. The site was captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution is expected to be adopted at this session
which would again condemn Israel's failure to comply with demands
to halt work at Har Homa/jabal Abu Ghneim and all other settlement
activity.
</P>
<P>
It would reiterate previous recommendations to U.N. members for
"the cessation of all forms of assistance and support for illegal
Israeli activities" in the occupied territories, in particular
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
At least twenty states would speak at the session, according to
the U.N. spokesman office.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Senegal to Discuss Regional Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian and Senegalese leaders
are expected to discuss the conflicts in Guinea Bissau and Sierra
Leone during a two-day visit to Senegal by Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigerian officials said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian embassy officials in Dakar said that Abubakar expected
in Dakar Friday from Gambia would hold talks with his counterpart
President Abdou Diouf on the fighting in Guinea Bissau, Pan-Africa
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader paid a two-day visit to Gambia where he
discussed the conflicts in Bissau and Freetown with Gambian
President Yahya Jammeh.
</P>
<P>
Sengal and Guinea have sent troops to Guinea Bissau in support
of President Joao Bernado Vieira's government in the war against
the rebels led by former army chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
President Jammeh initiated peace talks between the two warring
parties in Guinea Bissau which led to a peace accord signed in
Nigerian capital Abuja last November.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja accord, the Nigeria-led West African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG has begun to deploy troops
from Togo and Niger in Bissau to replace the Senegalese and
Guinean troops.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian officials in Dakar noted that General Abubakar
would sort out some "sticky points" in the troop deployment and
the larger issue of ensuring a definitive peace in the former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader is also expected to seek Diouf's support in
his efforts to end the fighting in Sierra Leone where the ECOMOG
troops have been battling the rebel revolutionary United Front
force since January 6.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that President Diouf could use his influence
to persuade some nations to end their support for the rebels in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Some countries including Liberia, Burkina Faso and Libya have
been accused of supporting Sierra leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Charge d'Affaires in Dakar E.O. Olusanmokun was quoted
as saying that "Nigeria and Senegal are key players in the West
African sub- region and the meeting between their leaders would
enhance efforts to bring peace, stability and harmony in the
area."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar left capital Abuja for Gambia on Thursday and is
expected to return home on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans to Vote in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africans can expect
to go to the polls between May 18 and 27, the president's office
said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although President Nelson Mandela decided not to announce this
in his state of the nation address to parliament, his office said
that elections would be held on a date during this period.
</P>
<P>
"It remains the government's intention, all things being equal,
to hold elections on a date between the 18th and 27th of May,"
Mandela's office said.
</P>
<P>
"However, given the discussions currently under way among legal
 representatives of the various parties in the case being heard at
the Cape Town supreme court, the president decided not to
expressly pronounce on these putative dates in his address," it
said.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted a presidential aide as
saying that Mandela had received a call from government lawyers
shortly before delivering his speech, asking him to postpone the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers are appearing in the Cape High Court, which is
hearing the New National Party's case against the government on
the question of bar- coded identity documents.
</P>
<P>
The party said the requirement that only citizens with
bar-coded IDs could vote was unconstitutional as it deprived
millions of people of their right to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela blamed some parties in parliament for
his being unable to formally announce the election date.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Independent Electoral Commission
would receive an additional 160 million Rand (27 million U.S.
Dollars) in the coming budget to enable it to fulfil its
functions.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Recruiting Mercenaries From S. Africa: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The rebel movement National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is recruiting
mercenaries from Batalhao Buffalo, the army of the past apartheid
regime, the state-run National Radio of Angola (RNA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the RNA report, the military group led by Jonas
Savimbi is trying to recruit mercenaries in South Africa's
executive capital Pretoria, promising to pay thousands of U.S.
Dollars per month for those who will fight in the Angolan civil
war. The UNITA is keen on the ex-Batalhao Buffalo soldiers who
are mainly Boers (offsprings of the Dutch ancestors) born in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The potential mercenaries had been fighting together with the
UNITA troops during the 1970s and 1980s. Later as the
multi-racial government was established in Pretoria, the force was
dismissed and most of the soldiers are currently unemployed,
living on the scanty government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The RNA noted that a group of mercenaries, mainly the
ex-Batalhao Buffalo soldiers, recruited in Pretoria will soon take
the way via Zambia to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The radio added that Mines Tadeu,.who is the aid to head of the
UNITA delegation to the Joint Commission for the Angolan Peace
Process Isaias Samakuva, played a crucial role in the recruiting
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Angolan government frequently accused the
"mercenaries from Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa" of helping
Savimbi fight the civil war. They are mainly engaged in
instructing and training, or operating such high- tech weapons as
tanks, missiles and long-range artillery.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Police's to Reduce Fatal Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting Inspector General of Police John Kisembo made the
remarks at a press conference at the Police Headquarters Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, accidents tend to decline but the
number of victims of accidents are on the increasing trend, he
said. In 1995, there were a total of 12,350 accidents and 1,546
people killed in accidents. The accidents dropped to 8,096 while
1,579 people killed.
</P>
<P>
The police boss attributed this decrease in accidents to
awareness campaigns and improved mechanical conditions of
vehicles. He however, blamed the increase of casualties on
overloading of buses, speeding, incompetent drivers, drunk driving
and others.
</P>
<P>
To check the increasing trend of the casualties, the police
officers across the country are urged to exercise duties earnestly
and traffic offenses will seriously punished.
</P>
<P>
Various bus operators shall not be allowed to overload and
incompetent drivers will be forced to take driving tests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, drivers are urged to report the mechanical
conditions of their vehicles to police on a regular basis. Members
of the press are also encouraged to cooperate with the police
authorities in restoring road safeties.
</P>
<P>
On corruption of police offices, the police boss said any
police officer proven to take bribes will be punished and that so
far some police officers have been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to give the exact number of police officers
prosecuted, saying that the investigation process is still under
way.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Makes IPO of 100 Million Shares on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Delphi Automotive Systems made
an initial public offering of 100 million shares priced at 17 U.S.
dollars per share on Wall Street Friday, a significant step closer
to independence from long-time parent General Motors.
</P>
<P>
"Today's IPO represents a significant step toward
independence," said J.T. Battenberg III, Chief Executive Officer
and President of the company, in front of the New York Stock
Exchange. "while we are proud of the heritage we share with
General Motors, the separation should provide increased
opportunities for growth as we go public and seek to expand our
sales globally."
</P>
<P>
The separation makes Delphi a new firm among the top 30 U.S.
companies on Fortune's 500 list. With an annual sale of 28.4
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, the new independent company has
"tremendous potential for growth," Battenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The Troy, Michigan-based Delphi is the world's most diversified
automotive products and technology supplier with more than 200,000
employees. Until today's IPO, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of
General Motors, operating in 36 countries.
</P>
<P>
GM continues to hold 465 million shares, or more than 80
percent stocks in Delphi. But GM said earlier it intends to
distribute the remaining shares to GM shareholders later this
year in either a split-off or spin-off, or some combination of
both.
</P>
<P>
Delphi will have significant benefits of the separation, which
include a growing sale to major vehicle manufacturers other than
GM, capital planning flexibility and improved labor relations.

<P>
A specialized technical support unit would also be set up to

The Zimbabwean government is to acquire five million hectares
of land over a five-year period to manage the resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
Msika assured the white commercial farmers that the Zimbabwean

<HEADLINE> UNEP Budget and Reform Endorsed in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of environment and
senior officials from over 100 countries have adopted important
decisions on the work program, administration and budget of the
U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) at the 20th Governing Council
session which closed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long meeting was dominated by two issues: reform and
finance. The council adopted the budget and gave broad support to
the proposed restructuring of UNEP in line with a new integrated
work program focusing on five areas, a UNEP official told the
media.
</P>
<P>
The five areas are environmental monitoring, assessment,
information and research including early warning; enhanced
coordination of environmental conventions and development of
policy instruments; fresh water; technology transfer and
industry; and support to Africa.
</P>
<P>
On finance, delegates of various governments recognized the
need to have adequate and stable financial resources if it is
effectively to meet the environmental challenges of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed a decision to broaden the funding base and
 authorized the Executive Director's proposal to prepare a 120
million U.S. Dollars budget for next biennium.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said, "the spirit and
cooperation this week have been tremendous, with not only
governments, but non- governmental organizations, youth, private
sectors and industry, all contributing to a very successful
outcome."
</P>
<P>
"We have been given a clear signal that the world needs UNEP,
the global environmental guardian," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the session, delegates also participated in 12 panel
discussions on a wide range of topics, including sustainable
tourism, the impact of deforestation on the environment, and
telecommunications and the environment.

<HEADLINE> French Parliamentarians Rap U.N. Embargo Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A six-member delegation of the
French parliament who have wound up a visit to Iraq denounced on
Friday what they called the ``perverse effects'' of the U.N. 986
resolution on Iraq, also called ``Oil for Food'' program.
</P>
<P>
Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, a parliamentarian of the Gaullist
Rally for the Republic who headed the delegation, said one
generation of Iraqi people is being sacrificed because of the
embargo imposed by the U.N. since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
``We can call it a sacrificed generation, a generation of
embargo,'' said Bachelot-Narquin at a press conference held after
the delegation returned from a mission of information in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She said that the delegation witnessed ``a state of
destruction'' in Iraq, including ``recurrent mal-nutrition'' and
``health degradation'' of its people and the loss of a sense of
culture among Iraqi youths.
</P>
<P>
``There is no humanitarian action in Iraq. Iraq is paying for
the products with the oil it sells,'' she said, adding that Iraq
cannot the amount of oil allowed by the U.N. to buy enough food
for its people, because its oil installations are running down and
need repaired.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarian accused the United States of ``hijacking
the concept of double usage'' by banning key materials such as
medical materials.
</P>
<P>
``They ban the import of potassium, which is used for caring
diarrhoea of children, under the pretext that it could be used as
arm of war. Even things like agricultural vaccines and computers
are suspected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the French proposal to lift oil embargo against
Iraq is the most realistic to change the situation, although it
has not aroused much enthusiasm from the international community.
</P>
<P>
France has called for the ``renovation'' of the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), the lifting
of oil embargo, and the establishment of an economic and financial
surveillance mechanism to make sure that Iraq does not use oil
income to develop its arsenals of arms of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Upbeat About Job Creation, Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Friday his country's economic fundamentals are
strong and that there is hope for job creation.
</P>
<P>
"For a start, if economic growth last year and this year are
less encouraging, we are confident that this is an exception that
confirms an otherwise upward trend," he said in his last state of
the nation address to parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"In this era of volatility, what we need to ask ourselves is
why South Africa did not experience the kind of paralyzing
turbulence that was the lot of most countries at our level of
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the answer was that South Africa's economic
fundamentals were robust. Local and foreign investments were on
the rise. Exports were increasing, and in some areas of
agriculture, the increase had been by as much as 100 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications and tourism were growing at an impressive
rate, and road construction and spatial development initiatives
were expanding the economic base of regions that were previously
ignored.
</P>
<P>
Public works programs had created hundreds of thousands of
jobs, even though some were temporary, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The government had also made impressive strides in the
restructuring of state assets, he said, adding that the government
was committed to continuing with this program, but in a systematic
and professional way.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had not experienced the full effect of the
global crisis, because it had credible and sustainable fiscal and
monetary policies, combining discipline with flexibility.
</P>
<P>
He said there was hope for job creation because many of the
initiatives would take time to be felt in the lives of ordinary
people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus May Appeal Against Rotterdam Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Church of Cyprus will
examine the prospect of appealing against a Dutch court ruling
concerning four icons stolen from a church in the Turkish Cypriot
part of Cyprus, the Cyprus News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Rotterdam District Court, while acknowledging that the four
icons came from the Turkish Cypriot church, decided there was
insufficient evidence to prove they had not been purchased in
good faith by a Dutch couple.
</P>
<P>
It also refuted an argument by the Cyprus Church that the
icons should be returned on the basis of the Protocol to the
Hague 1954 Convention regarding the return of cultural property
in the event of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Although the Netherlands has signed and ratified the protocol,
no law has been passed in the Dutch civil law for its enforcement.
</P>
<P>
According to Tasoula Hadjitofi, Cyprus' honorary consul to the
Hague and representative of the Church of Cyprus for Stolen Arts,
the four icons were purchased by a Rotterdam couple between 1976
and 1978 from a United States merchant who was not, however, a
certified arts dealer.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple paid some 85,000 Cyprus pounds (170,000
U.S. dollars) in cash without receiving any receipt.
</P>
<P>
The case was dealt with under Dutch law, which provides that
the couple should be recognized as the owners unless proven by
the Church of Cyprus that they did not act in good faith when
purchasing the icons.
</P>
<P>
The Church of Cyprus has three months to decide whether to
appeal against the Rotterdam District Court decision.

UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians on Friday
urged the United Nations General Assembly to back their case
against Israel's settlement policies in the West Bank and Gaza
Stripe, saying they violate the Geneva conventions.
</P>
<P>
The move came despite Israeli objections that the U.N. session

October.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the tenth emergency special session on Israeli
settlement in the occupied territories, Masser Al-Kidwa, Permanent
Observer of the U.N. Palestinian Mission, said "What about the
peace process? what has become of it?"
</P>
<P>
"The policies and the positions of the Israeli government
remain unchanged, in denial of the principles of the process and
in continuous violations of the existing agreements," Al-Kidwa
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations to back a special conference of the
countries that signed the Geneva conventions to exclusively
discuss the settlement issue.

HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic

opposition parties should boycott the commission being set up by
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) (pf) to review
the Lancaster House-brokered constitution.
</P>

</P>

He was responding to the ruling party's secretary for legal
affairs, Eddison Zvobgo, who said Thursday that the legal

"I do not believe that constitutions are made the way ZANU (pf)
is trying to do it," the DP leader said, adding that "we have our

Zvobgo said that the commission will soon be announced for
consultations on what type of constitution the people wanted to

<HEADLINE> About 84 Percent State Enterprises Privatized in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian privatization process is
in its winding up phase after the successful sale of about 84
percent state owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) disclosed in a report
released Friday that by the end of last month, out of 280 state
enterprises in the working portfolio of the ZPA, 236 companies
have been privatized since the agency was established in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ZPA has realized 70 million U.S. Dollars from
the sale of companies while investors have assumed more than 45
million Dollars of liabilities and about the same amount was
committed by the investors in investment pledges.
</P>
<P>
A key feature of the privatization program over the next phase
would be the new government policy guidelines on private sector
participation in strategic areas of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government intends to offer a minority
share holding of 20 percent in the Zambia Telecommunications
Company to a private strategic partner and to float some shares of
the Zambia National Commercial Bank on the Lusaka Stock Exchanges
as part of a comprehensive policy to divest its share holding in
the bank.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Air Attack on  Ethiopia's Border </HEADLINE>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean Foreign
Ministry Friday denied the accusation by Ethiopia that two
Eritrean fighter planes bombed on border town Adigrat at 10:45
a.m. on Friday, according to a report reaching here from the
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said
the accusation is "a complete fabrication, " said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the press statement accused that "Ethiopia is planning
to launch a full-scale war against Eritrea," saying that "while it
was Ethiopia that opened a new front in Tsorona (central Eritrea)
by deploying about 55,000 troops, including the 'elite' 20th
division, Ethiopia claimed earlier this week that 'Eritrea had
deployed troops in the Tsorona front to attack industrial cities
in northern Tigray and the Obelisk in Aksum."
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson said earlier
Friday in a statement that two Eritrean fighter planes bombed the
northern border town of Adigrat, some 890 kilometers away from
Addis Ababa, at 10:45 a.m. of Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The intended target of the air attack was the fuel depot and
its surroundings," said the office.
</P>
<P>
In a similar statement issued Thursday, the office said
Eritrean forces shelled from their positions at Geamahlo on the
Badme-Sheraro front beginning at 6:00 a.m. on Thursday. It also
accused the Eritrean forces of carrying out heavy shelling for 45
minutes at the Zalambessa front.
</P>
<P>
In a new effort to stave off war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
over their nine month border dispute, U.N. Secretary General's
Special Envoy for Africa Mohamed Sahnoun arrived in Addis ababa
Thursday and met with Ethiopian leaders. Sahnoun reportedly held
talks with U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia Friday. Prior to Addis
Ababa, Sahnoun flied to Asmara Tuesday to have talks with Eritrean
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations
have stepped up their diplomatic efforts to resolve the border
dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea in recent weeks amid fears

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Await Outside Hospital for News of King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Jordanians gathered
outside a hospital here Friday in a somber waiting for words about
the condition of King Hussein Ibn Talal, who is apparently losing
his struggle against lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
Rubbing hands and stamping feet in the freezing rain, they were
reluctant to leave the heavily guarded King Hussein Medical City,
a military medical compound named after the king himself, where
the 63-year-old monarch is barely surviving on life-support system
as his internal organs had failed.
</P>
<P>
Grave silence prevailed on Amman streets Friday as Jordanians
were praying desperately for the health of the king, who was flown
home on his "persistent wish" from a U.S. hospital in the day
after a second and unsuccessful bone marrow transplant as part of
cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
Shops were closed and there was virtually no traffic in the
capital. Amman residents stayed around radios and televisions in
their cars or houses, waiting in vain for news of miracle that
their beloved ruler would rise from the sickbed again.
</P>
<P>
The cancer-stricken monarch was semi-conscious and suffering
from liver and kidney failures when he was flown back home from
the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States, where he had been
receiving chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to the hospital upon his arrival in Amman, with
his family staying at his bed. The king was said to be critically
ill and under intense medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Journalists and well-wishers were prevented from approaching
the hospital by soldiers and police. And the roads and streets
leading to the hospital have been blocked.
</P>
<P>
Channel One and Channel Two of the Jordan TV terminated
routine programs to broadcast personal files of Hussein, the
longest serving ruler in the Middle East, who inherited the
Jordanian throne on May 2, 1953, at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
The king won his first battle against cancer after surgery on a
cancerous kidney in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the lymphatic cancer was detected in 1998, the king
indicated that he would spend his last days with his people in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, the king returned to Jordan, officially claimed
cured of cancer after six months of chemotherapy in the U.S., but
was flown back to U.S. a week later, after naming his eldest son
Abdullah Bin Hussein as successor to the Hashimite throne.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long return home, Hussein on January 26
delegated all powers to the new Crown Prince Abdullah, except the
rights of making amendment to the constitution and signing major
international accords.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who had received education in Britain and the U.S.,
was an army major general in charge of the most elite special
force of the kingdom that supervises the security of the royal
court.

international community," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would be doing its best for the success of talks
between Belgrade and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. The talks
will begin in Rambouillet, a French town 50 kilometers southwest
of Paris, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said the negotiations will be tough, but there are
serious reasons to expect them to be successful.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the Kosovo problem cannot be solved in a
jiffy."
</P>
<P>
The entire international community wants Kosovo to remain part
of Yugoslavia but to enjoy extensive autonomy, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"This means a no to the status quo but also a no to the
independence of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Russia has been an active player in efforts to bring a peaceful
resolution to the Kosovo crisis. It is a member of the six-nation
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia. The other members are Britain
France, Germany, Italy and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Vows to Fight Political Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Friday vowed to use "non-standard but constitutional"
measures to fight political extremism.
</P>
<P>
"There are forces in the country that, taking advantage of
economic difficulties, seek to stir up Russia and plunge it into a
political standoff and a pre-election fever," Primakov told a
meeting of Russia's Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the government to give a resolute rebuff to
such political speculators."
</P>
<P>
However, he said "reaction to such actions by all tiers of the
executive branch is still very weak" and law enforcement agencies
are failing to make full use of their resources.
</P>
<P>
Primakov called for wide public action against radicals, urging
the media to refrain from fanning up tension in the country,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"In a situation where an election campaign has in effect taken
off and intense political struggles are inevitable, urgent
coordinated measures must be taken to riddle the criminal element
that is fighting for power," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the situation and ensure "fair and honest
elections," the government is proposing a "non-standard but
constitutional mechanism of interaction" with parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the Friday meeting approved a draft political
statement setting out the initiative for political non-aggression
among the branches of power.
</P>
<P>
Exercise of authority will be futile without peace in society
and social stability is impossible if there is discord between
branches of government, Primakov said.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Urged to Tell All about Links with Nazis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche
Bank, was Friday urged to disclose all the facts relating to its
involvement with the Third Reich and its financing of the Nazi
concentration camp at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
Michel Friedman, a member of the Central Council of German
Jews, said that at least bank employees at the scene must have
known "what it meant to have supported and financed Auschwitz".
</P>
<P>
Files discovered in the bank's archives in Hanover revealed on
Thursday that the bank helped finance the building of Auschwitz in
which more than one million inmates, mostly Jews, were killed.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly discovered records, the bank's branch in
Kattowitz - now Katowice - in Upper Silesia provided credits to
finance construction work at the camp in the then-German-occupied
Poland.
</P>
<P>
The construction work was on the site of the I.G. Farben
concern at Auschwitz (now Oswiecim) and in the camp of the Nazi
Waffen SS, an elite corps of combat troops.
</P>
<P>
The extended Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp held about
1.3 million inmates between 1940 and 1945. Some 1.1 million of the
inmates were either put to death or died of the appalling hardship
and disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Berlin-Brandenburg Info-Radio, Friedman said:
"I cannot imagine that decisions of this importance would have
been taken simply by regional officials."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said Friday that representatives
of Nazi victims seeking compensation had "raised some strong
arguments".
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the Deutsche Bank documents comes as the bank
faces compensation claims in the United States from Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
The Minister at the German Chancellor's Office, Bodo Hombach,
was due Sunday to travel to the United States to discuss on behalf
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder compensation issues with victims
of Nazi forced-labour programs.
</P>
<P>
But the bank said Friday that Hombach's talks in the U.S. were
not connected with the publication of the files.
</P>
<P>
The revelations have thrown into doubt Deutsche Bank's plans to
merge with the U.S. group Bankers Trust in a 10-billion-dollar
deal. But the affair had no significant effect on the bank's
shares on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Auschwitz is widely regarded as the deadliest camp established
by the Nazi regime in pursuit of its notorious "final solution" in
which an estimated six million Jews were killed.
</P>
<P>
The order to set up the camp was issued on April 27, 1940 by
the SS (Schutzstaffel, or Defence Squad) chief Heinrich Himmler.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the first prisoners arrived - 728 Polish men.
The camp expanded and the number of inmates had risen by the end
of 1941 to 22,500, of which 11,000 were Soviet prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The camp contained the notorious gas chambers in which Zyklon B
gas was used to kill prisoners from September 1941.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslav official said Friday
Belgrade would accept giving autonomy to Kosovo amid European
Union warnings that peace talks starting this weekend in France
were the final chance halt spiraling violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Information Minister Milan Komnenic told Germany's ARD
TV his government would back giving substantial autonomy to Kosovo
which is 90 per cent ethnic Albanian. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was responsible for eliminating Kosovo's former
autonomous status in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians open in
Rambouillet, France on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as for the European Union (EU) presidency, German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the Rambouillet talks were
the last chance to stop fighting in Kosovo from lurching out of
control.
</P>
<P>
Germany holds the E.U.'s rotating presidency for the first half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said both Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians should not
doubt the determination of the six-nation Contact Group for
Yugoslavia to bring an end to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the NATO alliance the Contact Group has given the
Kosovo combatants three weeks to hammer out a negotiated
settlement - backed by the threat of NATO military action to
enforce it.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group members are: Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yassir Arafat on Friday declined to announce a delay to his
planned May 4 declaration of Palestinian statehood at an
international aid donor conference.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Frankfurt Friday from Washington. It is his
first visit to Germany since the new German government came to
power.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at the talks in Frankfurt said Arafat vowed to
continue the peace process with Israel but refused to make any
concrete pledge about postponing a declaration of Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the United States are firmly opposed to any
statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials attending the two-day meeting organized by
the World Bank left early in apparent anger over Arafat's stance.
</P>
<P>
German Development Aid Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said
she regretted the Israeli departure but added it had only been due
to what she termed internal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is seeking some 4.5 billion dollars in aid for the
Palestinian Authority region over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Attending the donor conference were some 50 states and
international organizations and Palestinian representatives.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to delegates Arafat accused Israel of blocking
economic development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"There is an economic blockade of the Palestinian territories,"
he said in Bonn after talks with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The blockade - when fully in place - cost the Palestinian
territories 10 million dollars per day, said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the European Union (E.U) said it planned to make
further aid to the Palestinians dependent on progress the Middle
East Peace process.
</P>
<P>
Donor states have approved 3.65 billion dollars for the
Palestinian Authority since 1993 of which 2.5 billion dollars has
been disbursed, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the single biggest donor state and has made
available 1.2 billion marks (714 million dollars) in part through
its E.U. donations, said the German Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Third Rwandan Genocide Suspect Got 15-Year Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) sentenced Friday a suspect in
the 1994 Rwandan genocide to 15-year imprisonment, sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that Omar Serushago, 37, a former Interhamwe militia
leader, was given the term by Judge Laity Kama at the court in
Tanzania's northern town Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the sentence took into consideration mitigating
factors such as Serushago's voluntary surrender in Cote D'Ivore
last year.
</P>
<P>
"He also played an important role in the Nairobi-Kigali (NAKI)
operation which led to arrests of seven key former Rwandan leaders
in Nairobi in 1997, " Kama was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Kama also noted that the gravity of the crimes
committed by Serushago, including four murders of Tutsis by
himself and other 33 in Gisenyi Prefecture under his command,
"demanded a serious penalty."
</P>
<P>
Serushago, an engineer by profession, pleaded guilty to counts
of murder, extermination and torture last Friday, but objected to
the crime of rape.
</P>
<P>
He is the third person that have been convicted by the U.N.
court for genocide since its establishment by the Security Council
on November 8, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The court is to prosecute persons responsible for serious
violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda
and Rwandan citizens responsible for such violations committed in
the neighboring states, between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
As the first international body charged specifically with
prosecuting crimes of genocide, the ICTR has so far tried and
sentenced former mayor of Taba Jean-Paul Akayesu and former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda life imprisonment, the maximum sentence the
Tribunal can impose.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal has issued indictments against 35 individuals, 26
of them and five suspects are in custody in the U.N. Detention
Facility in Arusha, while another indictee is in custody in Texas,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The other eighth indictees have not yet been apprehended.
</P>
<P>
Located on the outskirts of Arusha, the U.N. Detention Facility
has a total of 56 fully functional cells.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were massacred in central African state of Rwanda in a period of
three months soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu,
died when his plane was shot down over the capital Kigali in April
1994.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Pardon 3,000 Inmates Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 convicts will be
freed from Turkmen prisons on Saturday under a a pardon signed by
Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth pardoning since the beginning of the
year. Under the first three about 5,000 convicts were released and
to the remaining 1,700 terms were reduced by half, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov made the announcement at a conference on economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to overcrowd prisons, because social unity and
stability can be achieved only by a humane attitude to
compatriots," Niyazov said.
</P>
<P>
Last year about 19,000 inmates were amnestied under two
presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
The president said about 30,000 people remain in prisons and
detention facilities. They are hardened professional criminals.
</P>
<P>
Since Turkmenistan became independent in 1991, Niyazov said, it
has pardoned about 80,000 people. Ninety percent of the pardoned
do not return to criminal activities.

PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Bernard Thibault was elected
Friday the leader of France's oldest labor union, the
Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), at a CGT congress held in
Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Thibault, a 40-year-old railway worker, was elected to succeed
Louis Viannet, 65, at the 46th congress of the union, which was
opened Sunday in the eastern French city and attended by 1,000
delegates.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the election of Thibault marked a turning
point for the CGT which is expected to become more independent and
pragmatic in contrast to its strong alliance with the French
Communist Party (PCF) in the past.
</P>
<P>
Like his predecessor Viannet, Thibault is a member of the PCF.
</P>
<P>
The CGT, which has 650,000 members and used to be France's
largest union, has been surpassed by another labor union, the more
moderate Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT) in
membership.

<HEADLINE> Draft Document on Ceasefire in DRC Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The committee on the
Implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) ended its first meeting here Friday after
adopting a draft document on modalities for the implementation of
a ceasefire in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The committee set up last month will submit its report to the
regional ministers of foreign affairs and defense.
</P>
<P>
But the delegations of Rwanda and Uganda walked out of the
meeting, which started Tuesday, because the rebels fighting to
topple DRC President Laurent Kabila were not invited to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting was attended by representatives from
Zambia, Angola, DRC, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) were present
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting is part of the regional peace efforts.
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who has been mandated by SADC
to mediate a peaceful solution to the six-month war in DRC, held
talks with his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe in Harare on
January 28 and then with Kabila Tuesday on how to bring peace to
the largest central African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the visits after a regional ministerial meeting to
make preparations for a planned regional summit ended here in mid
January without achieving its target.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis in DRC has been postponed several times from the
originally planned date of December 8 of last year due to
disagreement on the presence of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila refuses to have direct talks with the rebels of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) led by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba
while Rwanda and Uganda which back the rebels demand the
involvement of the rebels in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said Wednesday in his headquarters in Goma, eastern
Congo, that any deal reached without the rebels will be useless
and repeated his call for direct talks with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The six-month war has dragged in six countries and threatens to
become a full-scale multi-national conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent their troops there
to back Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of
backing the rebels although they said they have deployed their
troops in DRC for their own security interests and accused Kabila
of backing the anti-government forces in their countries.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: U.N. to Step up Efforts to Stabilize  Global Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) has organized a five-day "Hague Forum,"
scheduled for Monday in the Netherlands, with delegates from 180
nations.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming forum was designed to evaluate progress since a
landmark 1994 conference in Cairo, the third such global meeting
since 1974 and the one that switched directions from an emphasis
on demographic control to general health care, education and
choice as part of a family planning approach to curbing population
growth.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA argues that if women were literate, informed and able to
make their own decisions, they would choose to have fewer
children. Such action was needed to reduce poverty and hunger and
to protect the earth's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Since alarm bells sounded some 30 years ago about the dangers
of an overcrowded planet, world leaders have initiated a panoply
of programmes to slow the population explosion.
</P>
<P>
But it will take at least another 50 years before the world's
population, now at 5.9 billion, will begin to stabilize at 8.9
billion people, bringing monumental problems for poor nations in
the interim, according to U.N. experts planning a forum next week
in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, if programmes falter and money to finance them
remains scarce, the world could have 10.7 billion people by 2050.
</P>
<P>
"In short, the planet seems to have averted -- at least for now
-- the threat of a population bomb. The danger now is that we will
declare victory and go home," says the U.N. Population Fund
(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
However, direct U.S. funding to countries for family planning
programmes was 540 million U.S. dollars in 1995, before being
slashed by the U.S. Congress to its present level of 385 million
U.S. dollars, about a third of the goal.
</P>
<P>
But Nafis Sadik, the Pakistani physician who heads UNFPA, noted
that Washington was not alone in failing to meet targets promised
in Cairo, where nations agreed to increase spending on population
programmes and related projects to 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2000
and 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2015.
</P>
<P>
One third was to come from rich nations and in 1995 industrial
states met their targets. But since then most have reduced support
for population measures except for Denmark, Finland, Sweden,
Norway and the Netherlands.

WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The chief U.S. negotiator
with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will leave
Washington Friday for South Korea and China for consultations,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Charles Kartman will first visit South Korea on
February 6-10 and then stop in Beijing on February 11.
</P>
<P>
When in Seoul, Kartman will hold talks with South Korean
officials, and then hold a three-way meeting with South Korean and
Japanese officials, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two issues will be on the agenda for their talks, including
ways for permanent peace accord to replace the armistice that
ended the 1950-53 Korean War and the U.S. intention for access to
a DPRK underground site at Kumchang-ri, where Washington had
alleged there might be evidence of a revival of nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has flatly repudiated the U.S. allegation and
challenged the United States for huge payment for access to the
underground site.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly said to have made some
progress through constructive negotiations on the underground
site. But the State Department said Friday the two sides have not
reached any agreement yet.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Kosovo Crisis May Threat Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit warned here on Friday that the Kosovo crisis may lead to a
serious threat to the Balkans and even for the whole Europe if a
civilized solution could not be found.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his meeting with with Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, head
of Turkey's Religious Affairs Department, Ecevit said that there
has been a human tragedy in Kosovo in recent years and Serbia had
impeded the rights and freedom of the people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He added that "people of Kosovo have been dragged into very
serious life conditions and hunger started in the region."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit pointed out that the international community has the
duty to put an end to the calamity in Kosovo, saying that "we
have come to a process that military measures are indispensable."
</P>
<P>
If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intends to be
more active in its stance towards the Kosovo issue, Turkey will
contribute to this with all its power, he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as unlikely the worry expressed by the United
States President Bill Clinton, who said the deterioration of the
Kosovo crisis may lead to conflicts between Turkey and Greece. But
he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up over 90 percent of the population
of Kosovo, a province of Serbia, have taken up arms for
independence. Military conflicts frequented recently, which led to
NATO warning of serious intervention to bring the two sides back
to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots to Reject Demilitarization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriots said on Friday
that it will never accept any proposals that will damage, change
or dilute Turkey's "effective and de facto guarantee" in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Cypriot regime, recognized
only by Ankara, pointed out that such proposals will be totally
rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
It denounced a recent proposal by the Greek Cypriot side, which
called for the demilitarization of Cyprus and deployment of an
international forces on the divided Mediterranean island, as a
"trick" between Greece and the Greek Cypriot side aimed at
abolishing and diluting Turkey's role in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Glafcos Clerides, president of the internationally
recognized Cyprus government, said he will accept the deployment
on the island of either a force of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) or a force whose composition will be
determined by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, initially put forward some years ago, asks for
the withdrawal of Turkish and Greek forces from the island, as
well as the disbanding of Cyprus' National Guard.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 35,000 Turkish troops and some
4,500 Turkish Cypriot armed forces in the northern part of the
island. About 2,000 Greek troops are stationed in southern Cyprus
together with the 19,500-strong Greek Cypriot National Guard.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
condemned the Serbian authorities for preventing ethnic Albanian
rebel leaders from taking off for Pari for peace talks in the
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said the Serbian action to prevent
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army from going to Paris with the
entire ethnic Albanian negotiating team was "extremely unwise."
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns this action by the Serbs. We insist
that the Belgrade authorities immediately allow the Kosovar
Albanian delegation in its entirety to depart," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We, our allies and Russia have all informed Belgrade that
their current course of action is extremely unwise," he added.
</P>
<P>
The entire ethnic Albanian negotiating team, which also
includes civilian politicians, postponed its departure for Paris
Friday. A French government plane sent to pick up the ethnic
Albanian delegation has taken off empty.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Court Ruling Challenges NPC: Legal Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law experts attending a meeting of the economic and legal
groups of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR)
Preparatory Committee expressed strong indignation over the court
ruling that it has the right to examine legislation passed by the
NPC and its Standing Committee and pronounce legislative items
invalid. The experts noted that the ruling violates the Basic Law
of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Beijing University Professor Xiao Weiyun said that the "court's
constitutional jurisdiction" in the ruling violates the "one
country, two systems" principle. He noted that the NPC is the
supreme state power organ according to the Chinese Constitution
and no organization or department can challenge or deny NPC
legislation and decisions.
</P>
<P>
The jurisdiction of the Court of Final Appeals is limited, said
Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wu Jianfan, with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), said that authority to interpret the Basic Law
rests with the NPC Standing Committee. Nonetheless, the recent
ruling willfully expanded the court's right to partially interpret
the Basic Law, said Wu.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legal experts said the opinions of the Preparatory Committee on
implementing the second clause of Article 24 of the Basic Law and
legislation of the HKSAR focus on preventing a rapid population
increase which would pressure all sectors of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Related regulations have played a positive role in easing the
pressure of population increases in Hong Kong over the past year
and have been in the best interests of the HKSAR, according to the
experts.
</P>
<P>
The close coordination between the entry and exit management
departments on both sides since 1994 has enabled more 78,000
mainland children with parents residing in Hong Kong to gain
residence in the region. Some 40,000 children arrived in the HKSAR
after July, 1997
</P>
<P>
"Management procedures have effectively avoided the excessive
influx of immigrants into Hong Kong," said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Events since the January 29 ruling by the Court of Final Appeal,
as well as public opinion indicate that the ruling has had a
negative impact on Hong Kong society. Experts noted that the
resulting negative impact has been in direct opposition to the
interests of Hong Kong residents and has hindered efforts to
maintain stability and prosperity in the HKSAR.

<P>
KIEV, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright recently urged the Ukrainian government to take the
necessary measures to solve its dispute with U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. had pledged financial aid of 195 million U.S.
dollars to Ukraine, but if the country does not make significant
progress in its economic reforms and in settling rifts with U.S.
investors before she submits the relevant report to congress on
February 18, the money might be reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has received over 1 billion dollars from the U.S. since
its independence in August 1991, the third largest receiver of aid
following Israel and Egypt. The U.S. links its financial help
every year to Ukraine's economic reform process and the status of
American investors there.

Nine U.S. companies were reported to be in trouble this year,
but Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, who just ended

<HEADLINE> Iranian Inventor Uses Thermal Shock to Shear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian inventor named
Mohammad Reza Khalili has designed a system which utilizes
thermal shock to shear glass, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The system produced by Khalili directs a jet stream of
compressed hot air at the subject using a nozzle to create cracks
in the glass in a controlled manner.
</P>
<P>
The innovation makes it possible to shear glass very
accurately and at high speeds, IRNA said, and there is no need
for any secondary operations such as sanding or heating after
using the system to shear glass.
</P>
<P>
Khalili, a faculty member of Tehran's Khajeh Nassir Tousi
Technical University, won a prize recently for his invention in
the inventions category of the Kharazmi science festival.
</P>
<P>
The Kharazmi science festival is held annually in Iran to mark
the anniversary of the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Won't Let Region Become Military Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese would never let
their region become a foreign military base even after possibly
having separated from Indonesia, Antara News Agency Saturday
quoted a local community figure as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will not possibly let East Timor become a foreign military
base. Even now the presence of military troops is terrifying the
people, the more so if East Timor becomes a military base," said
Manuel Viegas Carrascalao, a leader of Uniao Democratica Timorense
in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Carrascalao said the issue of East Timor becoming a foreign
military base had been disseminated by a certain party to
intimidate the people in the region and to divert their attention
from the Indonesian government's proposals to solve the East Timor
question.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government last week announced a major shift in
its policy on East Timor, offering independence if the territory
rejects Indonesia's offer of special, broad autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas stressed on Friday it was
impossible for East Timor to become a military base of one country
if the province separated from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The recent tendency shows the need for seaports where the
warships could dock for rest, refueling and minor repairs but not
a military base," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
A leader of Concelho Nacional Resistencia Timorense Leandro
Ishaak told Antara News Agency that the issue was not in his
organization's program.
</P>
<P>
"In our concept of a Free East Timor there is no mention of any
plan to become a foreign military base. If East Timor becomes an
independent country, it will pursue a foreign policy very much
like those of the ASEAN countries," Ishaak said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, an independent East Timor would never
become a threat to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Director of the Center for East Timor
Development Studies Antonio Castro da Silva said it was impossible
for East Timorese to let their region become a military base.
</P>
<P>
People were using their land for farming and animal husbandry
to support family income and a military base would bring unwanted
changes to their social, cultural and religious life, da Silva
said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.

GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Women's Federation of
south China's Guangdong province has successfully carried out a
project over the past few months to promote the self-awareness of
local women concerning their rights.
</P>
<P>
 Federation officials attending a Friday Sino-Australian

</P>
<P>
 The federation and the local media produced and televised TV
programs related to family violence and maintaining women's rights,
in addition to supporting discussions of related subjects in local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
 The federation has also provided consulting services and
training programs. Related efforts have proved highly beneficial,
with some 1,500 female officials gaining promotions during 1998,
some 100 more promotions than in the previous year.

agreed to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri,

South Korea and Egypt maintain "profound ties" following the
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has invested 160 million U.S. dollars in oil, auto

<HEADLINE> Abdullah Assumes Full Duties of Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s Crown Prince Abdullah
Bin Hussein became the de facto head of state Saturday as he
assumed all constitutional powers of a Jordanian king.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after an emergency cabinet meeting,
Information Minister Nasir Judeh announced that the cabinet
named Abdullah as the regent upon the will of the Royal Family as
63-year-old king Hussein was unable to exercise his constitutional
power.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has all royal powers, including the rights of
declaring war, ratifying international treaties, dissolving
parliament and appointing the government, Judeh said.
</P>
<P>
Granting all the administrative authority to Abdullah marked
his transition to the throne, closing the nearly half-century rule
of Hussein, the Middle East's reigning leader.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was flown back to Jordan Friday from the U.S. after the
failure of a second bone marrow transplant, the last-ditch
treatment for his lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had returned home on January 19 after six-month cancer
treatment in the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, the king announced to remove his brother Hassan
as his successor and named his eldest son, 37-year-old, Abdullah
as the new crown prince, just hours before he flew back to the
U.S. after he suffered from fever and low blood count, an apparent
symptom of the relapse of the lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the royal family said that the king is living
on a respirator and his brain has stopped functioning and his
liver and kidneys have failed since his arrival Friday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah had been appointed regent during the king's
absence. According to Jordanian constitution, the royal decree
expires automatically after the return home of the king.
</P>
<P>
But Judeh explained that "the constitution stipulates that when
the king is in the country and unable to carry out his
constitutional duties and responsibilities, then there are
constitutional requirements and stipulations that empower the
cabinet to appoint a regent."
</P>
<P>
The power transition is widely anticipated to be smooth given
Abdullah`s strong background in the military, who is now still an
army Major General in charge of the most elite special force of
the country.
</P>
<P>
But there are questions about Abdullah's ability to pull
together a country with a large Palestinian refugee population
that opposes the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also, there are doubts whether Abdullah' who lack political
experience, can maintain Hussein's high-profile contacts with the
West and Gulf states, which have kept Jordan's economy afloat over
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The government has made strenuous efforts to convey the
impression the transition will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
Judeh stressed that "this is a country of solid institutions,
this is a country of continuity."

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Refuse to Confirm Arrest of Exiled King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday Star newspaper reported that the king had been
arrested together with his three employees following a raid by
police on his home in a suburb of Johannesburg late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The king was arrested after police found a large arsenal of
arms and explosives in his "palace" in Fourways, Johannesburg,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The police only confirm Saturday that they had seized more than
70 firearms and a large quantity of explosives from the King's
residence. They refused to speculate why the exiled king was
allegedly storing such a large quantity of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Leka's father, King Zog, who was exiled from Albania in 1939,
helped the apartheid regime of South Africa procure arms and other
equipment banned under U.N. sanctions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, police received information of the
storage of weapons in Leka's home in August 1998, but was unable
to act because he had diplomatic immunity, which expired on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Marco Boni as saying that Leka had not enjoyed full
diplomatic immunity in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said Leka had enjoyed a privilege granted him in 1991 by the
then apartheid government, which protected his "archives", a term
which covered possessions and documents.
</P>
<P>
However, the present government had felt it necessary in the
national interest to withdraw that Privilege, which it did on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This was something the present government inherited from the
previous one, and it was in conflict with our present relationship
with the government of Albania," Boni said.

The statistics showed that over 27,000 refugee children, mainly
from Somalia, are enrolled in schools within the three U.N. High
Commission for Refugees camps at Ifo, Dangahley and Hagadera in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The schools in the camps are run by the United Nations but have

<HEADLINE> Parties' Alliance for Elections Rejected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria has rejected the proposed
alliance between the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the All
People's party (APP) for the National Assembly and presidential
elections to be held on February 20 and 27 respectively.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata told a press conference in
 capital Abuja Friday that the alliance was not feasible because
it ran contrary to the relevant laws and electoral guidelines,
Daily Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
AD and APP had sought to be allowed to field a single candidate
in all constituencies in the West African country for the National
Assembly and presidential elections with their acronym and logos
reflected on a common ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
The two parties proposed that the INEC should count jointly the
votes cast for them in favor of their joint candidates for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The INEC chairman confessed that the commission found the
proposals by the two parties "rather novel", saying that neither
of the proposals "has been used in favor of political parties
forming alliances in any part of the world."
</P>
<P>
However, he said any of the two parties is free to field
candidates on the platform of one of the registered political
parties and that a party is at liberty to urge its electorate to
vote for a particular candidate irrespective of that candidate's
party.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong in a presidential candidate sponsored
by one party having a running mate from the other party in the
spirit of the alliance, provided they run on the ticket of one of
the partners of the alliance," Akpata added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed alliance between the two parties and the possible
reaction of the INEC had generated a lot of interest and
controversy from within and outside the three registered political
parties in the most populous African country with the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) threatening to withdraw from the remaining
aspect of the on-going transition program.
</P>
<P>
Akpata noted that the decision to reject the proposed alliance
was reached after allowing representations from the parties from
both sides of the divide, adding that this is the final decision
of the commission on this matter.

LOS ANGELES, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Border Patrol
apprehended 162 Mexican immigrants who had been illegally
transported across the border into California Friday, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted after receiving an anonymous tip
Friday that a large group of immigrants were living in a 1,500-
square-foot house, said Bill Strassberger, spokesman for the
western division of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
Strassberger said men who illegally transport people across the
border often use "drop houses" to conceal people, while they wait
for money or a move to their final destination.
</P>
<P>
The police are investigating to discover who owns the house and
how long it has been used as a drop house, he said, adding that
most of the immigrants were returned to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks End to Kosovo Talks Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Saturday that he is optimistic that Serbia would back
down in a row threatening the start of the peace talks in France
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC radio he was hopeful that Belgrade would back down
after strong representations by the six-nation power Contact Group
which has summoned both sides to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on the Serbian province of Kosovo, due to start
near Paris later on Saturday, were put in jeopardy after Serbia
prevented the ethnic Albanian negotiators from flying to Paris, by
saying that the Albanians did not have the proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who will jointly chair the peace talks with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine, said he had called Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic on Friday after Serb authorities
prevented five Kosovo Liberation Army negotiators from leaving and
the entire Albanian team then postponed its departure.
</P>
<P>
"I...stressed to him that the Contact Group have no intention
of going ahead with the talks if the Kosovo Albanians are not
allowed to choose their own delegation and if that delegation is
then not allowed to turn up," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We have got the message across ....now the Kosovo Albanian
delegation will be allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
"I can't guarantee that, but as of last night it did look as
though Belgrade was going to back down," Cook said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Abdullah has become the de facto head of state of the country
under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Nasir Judeh explained at a news
conference that Abdullah had been the regent of the country when
the king was in the United States for cancer treatment. The royal
decree expires when the king returns home according to Jordanian
constitution.
</P>
<P>
But he added that "the constitution stipulates that when the
king is in the country and unable to carry out his constitutional
duties and responsibilities, then there are constitutional
requirements and stipulations that enpower the cabinet to appoint
a regent."
</P>
<P>
The crown prince will have all the powers of the monarch except
ratifying treaties, declaring war, dismissing parliament and
appointing government.
</P>
<P>
Hussein named Abdullah, his eldest son, as heir on January 26,
to replace his brother Hassan, who had been groomed for the throne
for 34 years, just hours before he flew back to the U.S. after the
relapse of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
He was flown home Friday after the failure of the second bone
marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the royal family, Hussein, is on
a respirator and his brain has stopped functioning and his liver
and kidneys have failed. Death was expected within hours or days,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia to Stick to Free Market Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has denied as groundless apprehensions that Moscow is
abandoning free market policy.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were afraid we would move to a nationalization
course but we did not do this and we are not doing it now either
at private enterprises or at banks," Primakov said in an interview
with the Interfax Vremya weekly and the Il Sole - 24 ore newspaper
of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ruble remains convertible and privatization is
still under way, he said. "We will look into how certain
enterprises were privatized, but only in court."
</P>
<P>
Privatization will continue in 1999. "However, we will
emphasize that changing the form of property must bring growth in
efficiency with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The role of the state "must be boosted," he said. "We do not
need to build a wild market, but a free and socially oriented one
which takes care of citizens' well-being," the Interfax news
agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said his government is taking steps to stimulate
direct foreign investments into the real sector of the economy,
including formulation and approval of related laws.
</P>
<P>
"Their current scale fails to meet the demand: they totaled
just 11.5 billion dollars on October 1, 1998," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will simplify the implementation of investment
projects, limit the procedure for coordination, licensing,
releasing technical assignments for the projects
</P>
<P>
Russia will try to introduce international accounting standards
to make enterprises financially transparent to potential investors,
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investments will also be encouraged through the
exemption from or reduction of profit and property taxes, a
postponement of tax and rent payments, and lower tax for housing
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed "the hope that these measures will result in
attracting 3.5-4 billion dollars in direct investment into the
real sector of the economy" this year.

YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan
retained the gold medal on Saturday though playing to a 1-1 tie
with Japan in the last game due to a scoring difference at the
Winter Asaid, which ended on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Japan were unbeaten before the gold medal match
in the six-team tournament before the match.

<P>
However, both sides found it was so difficult to open the

Forward Anatoliy Filatov first opened from the right corner at
the gate with 10:30 left in the last period to put Kazakhstan on a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Akihito Isojima equaled the match seven minutes later
with a long and power shot.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese almost made a winning goal at the last seconds in
a chaos batlle before Kazakhstan's gate when they used a chance of
5-play-4.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Japan totalled the four-win and one-tie in the
men's ice hockey tournament, with Kazakhstan scored more goals to
retain the champion, only minutes before the closing ceremony of
the eight-day Fourth Asian Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Japan retained its runner-up, while China took the bronze after
beaing host South Korea 7-2 early Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Dismisses Nike Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Superior Court Judge David
Garcia Friday dismissed a lawsuit that claimed Nike Inc. lied
about "sweatshop" conditions at its Asian factories, said a report
of the company.
</P>
<P>
"The court ruled in our favor, saying that the complaint as
written did not have a legal cause against Nike or the individuals
named in it, and hence the case was meritless," David Brown, a
lawyer representing Nike said.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accused Nike -- the world's largest athletics shoe
maker -- of falsely stating that it guarantees a "living wage" to
all workers and of painting a false picture of conditions for 450,
000 workers in Asian factories run by contractors.
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge David Garcia said he found no legal
basis for charges that Nike had violated California law by
willfully misleading the state's consumers about working
conditions for the thousands of Asian laborers.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will be appealed, said Alan Caplan, one of the
lawyers who filed the lawsuit in April.
</P>
<P>
Nike said it had acted during the past year to set a minimum
age of 18 for workers in Asian footwear factories, increase wages
40 percent for entry-level factory workers in Indonesia, and
improved factory air quality by substituting water-based adhesives
in the assembly process.

<TEXT>
<P>
All the authority and responsibility of the king have been
transferred to Abdullah in a cabinet meeting while the king is at
hospital under "intensive medical care" after his organs except
heart collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has become the de facto head of state of the country
under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Nasir Judeh explained at a news
conference that Abdullah had been the regent of the country when
the king was in the United States for cancer treatment. But under
the constitution the royal decree expires when the king returns
home. So the cabinet was authorized to reappoint the crown prince as
the regent by a vote considering the king's failing health to fill
the constitutional vacuum.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince will have all the powers of the monarch except
ratifying treaties, declaring war, dismissing parliament and
appointing government.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Minister Calls for More Direct Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Minister of
Tourism Veng Sereyvuth called for more direct flights to promote
the development of the travel industry in the country, the Vision
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia needs more direct flights with major tourist
originating destinations such as Japan, South Korea, France and
the six Mekong River countries as they offered enormous potential
for tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that efforts will be made with the
Mekong River states to undertake joint tourism promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
"We have a major advantage over other destinations as Cambodia
is still relatively unexploited in many fields including tourism.
We will do our best to improve the image of the country and do
away with all the negative hype about Cambodia to attract more
tourists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sereyvuth urged travel agents "to work hand in hand with the
ministry to promote such attractions like nature trail and
eco-tourism."
</P>
<P>
Many travel agents widely believed that with a stable new
government and political situation, Cambodia's tourism industry
will look bright again.
</P>
<P>
China's Southern Airline just began direct flight to the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Monday. So far, Cambodia has
direct flights to Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Hong
Kong, etc.

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Sales Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of
semiconductor chips in the fourth quarter jumped 10.5 percent from
the third quarter, but sales in December declined 0.7 percent
compared with November, the Semiconductor Industry Association
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The group said the reason of continuous increase of sales for
the fourth quarter is that the markets in the Asia-Pacific region
began to show signs of recovery and personal computer demand
continued to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
"Asia-Pacific sales in December are up 2.4 percent from
December 1997, when the financial crisis had not yet taken effect.
This stabilization bodes well for favorable sales in 1999," George
Scalise, president of the association, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The slight decrease of sales in December, according to the
group, was due to the holidays in the month, which generally
produces weaker sales than previous month.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges Delinking of Gulf Currencies from Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has called for delinking currencies of
the Gulf states from U.S. dollar to raise trade flexibility, the
English Gulf News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Ahmed Humaid Al Tayer made the call
at a gathering of Arab finance institutions in the Scientific and
Cultural Association in Dubai Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that if "we manage to delink our oil products from the
dollar, we would be able to create a basket of currencies to avoid
possible future political dangers."
</P>
<P>
He favors the introduction of the euro, saying the newly-issued
strong European single currency will help Arab countries because
they can export their goods to states dealing in both euro and
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"If we can price our oil products in euro, dollar and yen
instead of one currency, it would be great. This will reduce the
pressure exercised by the superpower as we could switch some of
our holdings out of dollar," Tayer said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to introduce a new pricing policy for oil and
products," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently all Gulf currencies are linked to the dollar except
for Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Crude revenues in dollar term for Gulf countries have fallen
with the slump in oil prices.

and was declared "clinically dead" after making a last journey to
Jordan from America.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- BMW, the German luxury car-maker that owns Rover in the UK,
Friday night removed its chairman and de factor number two in a
boardroom coup that could end executive rivalry but will almost
certainly leave the group vulnerable to a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

Conservative MPs and supplied details of Finance Minister Gordon
Brown's flights to a series of meetings in Mauritius, Bangkok and
Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- King Hussein of Jordan was declared clinically dead on
Friday. His passing away would weaken the situation in the Middle
East, where the king is not only the longest ruling monarch, but
also one of the principal guarantees of the regional stability. In
Amman, people are crying for their sovereign and are worried about
the future.
</P>
<P>
-- The closed-door talks on Kosovo will begin Saturday
afternoon in Rambouillet southwest of Paris in an oppressive
atmosphere, as the Serbs and ethnic Albanians were engaged in
their last arms wrestling when the Serb government blocked some
members of the Albanian delegation from leaving Pristina on Friday.
The French-British initiative also marks a real jump in the field
of the common foreign diplomacy by the Europeans in arranging the
"European Dayton" peace-making process.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Co-presided by France and Britain in the name of the six-
nation Contact Group, the peace conference on Kosovo should open
this afternoon in Rambouillet in the presence of President Jacques
Chirac. Belgrade has hardened its stand by ruling out talks with
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army and blocking the
ethnic Albanian delegation from leaving Pristina on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Jordanian government is expected to announce the
incapacity of King Hussein on Saturday, 10 days after the king
handed over his throne to his eldest son Abdallah. The Jordanians
still wanted to see a miracle happen on Friday despite the
diagnosis by the doctors that the king is clinically dead.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Oman Concerned over Health of Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and visiting Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said have expressed "deep
concern" over the declining health of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's health dominated the talks between Mubarak and Qaboos
Friday in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Information
Minister el-Sherif told the Egyptian Mail newspaper published
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "have expressed their concern (over Hussein's
health) and urged brotherly (people of) Jordan to show courage,"
el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
They "are monitoring with deep concern all reports concerning
the health of the Jordanian monarch," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Jordanian king returned to Amman Friday after a
failed bone marrow transplant earlier in the week in the U.S.. He
is in a "critical" condition and his organs except the heart have
failed.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Qaboos of Oman arrived last Thursday on a four-day visit
as part of the continued consultations with Mubarak on regional
issues and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the latest developments in the Iraqi
crisis and moves adopted by the Arab League concerning the issue,
el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 for what Washington said
punishing its not cooperating with the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees its elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers met January 24 on the Iraqi crisis,
expressing rejection of military solution to the Iraqi issue while
urging Iraq to comply with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Qaboos reviewed the Mideast peace process as part
of their efforts to close Arab ranks and patch up their
differences in a refined manner to safeguard the Arab potentials,
el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Palestinians and Israel were stalled
after Israel froze the latest peace deal, the Wye River agreement,
in early December, under which Israel should have pulled back from
another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.

<HEADLINE> China Reshines, Japan Dims in Asian Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liang Xiyi
</P>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China, who kept
a pre-meet low key about its winning prospects, shined again as a
sports powerhouse by retaining its top place in the gold tally of
the fourth Asian Winter Games, which closed the curtain here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China, who hoped for a third place with most 10 gold medals
before flying to the Kangwon Winter Asiad, has captrued 15 golds
as it did at the last Games on home turf in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan, expected to be one of the two-way battle for
the top winners against Kazakstan, stepped aside with only six
golds, two less than its gold tally captured at the 1996 edition.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan was also seeminly in short of its best athletes in
some events, including Ludmiila Prokasheva, one of the world's
premier speed skaters who was unable to make the Asiad for
preparing for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Though missing some top athletes, Kazakhstan, led by its winter
sports legend Vladimir Smirnov, still showed its undisputed Nordic
power in the continent to win five of the six golds in the cross
country, three in the biathlon.
</P>
<P>
The pre-game favorite aslo triumphed in the men's 5,000m speed
skating, men's ice hockey and women's giant slalom for a total of
10 golds, four less than its collection three years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian winter sports is still to cheer for
Uzbekistan, who as a debutant at the last Games, won its first
gold in the history of the Asian Winter gala.
</P>
<P>
Also surprisingly was that hosts South Korea finished runner-up
with a collection of 11 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Japan, though launched its last-ditch efforts at the
penultimate day of the eight-day tournament, deserved its fourth-
placed rank at the gold tally due to its negligence of the Games.
</P>
<P>
The two-time Asian top finisher in Winter sports, who won five
gold medals at the Nagano Olympics, missed two of possible these
medalists, including Hiroyasu Shimizu in the men's 500m speed
sakting and Takafumi Nishitani in the men's 500m short track
speedskating.
</P>
<P>
It also missed most of other 27 athletes who placed second to 8
th in Nagano including Tmomi Ikazaki, bronze medalist for the men'
s 500m speed skating.
</P>
<P>
"Japan didn't send its best athletes to the Games' most sports,
that was one of the reasons why we retained the top position and
Japan lost again," said Zhu Chengyi, secretary general of the
Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and South Korea have dispatched in the best
athletes to the Games," Zhu said. "We're deserved to be top two."
</P>
<P>
The triumph of China in the Kangwon Winter Asiad owed much to
its unexpeced three golds from the women's speed skating and
biathlon.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old speed skater Xue Ruihong took two while 18-year-
old budding star Song Li grabbed the women's 1,500m.
</P>
<P>
In the biathlon, Zhang Qing, 20, surprised the Kazkhstanians to
take two golds in the men's races, while Yu Shumei, fifth at the
Nagano Olympics last February, won her double golds in the women's
events.
</P>
<P>
China also won four golds through its short-track speed skaters,
three from figure skaters and one from the women's ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, who won eight golds to share third place with
Japan at the last Games, reapt its best harvest through short-
track speedskaters who bagged six out of 10 golds on offer.
</P>
<P>
The hosts, who hoped for a third place at the gold tally before
the Games, also had two victories in the speed skating and three
in the Alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
"The Kangwon Winter Games was a great occation for us to
improve the quality of the Asian Winter Games," said Kim Un-yong,
president of the South Korea Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
"It was the largest event ever, with the participation of 801
athletes, 380 referees and 709 journalists from 22 countries and
regions," added Kim, also president of the Kangwon Asian Winter
Games Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The fourth Asian Winter Games has broke records 69 times,
including world records five times in the short-track speedskating,
Asian records 37 times and Asian Games 27 times.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Turns Down New Mindanao Autonomous Region Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday refused a proposal of creating a new autonomous
region in Mindanao, the southern Philippines, for the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said the
government is already pouring much money into the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) headed by Governor Nur Misuari of
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't have enough funds for ARMM, how much more
with another autonomous region? It would strain our coffers,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration will concentrate first on
implementing its programs to develop Mindanao instead of
considering the new autonomous region proposal made by Senate
President Pro Tempore Blas Ople.
</P>
<P>
"Let's concentrate first on developing the entire island of
Mindanao and the welfare of our Muslim brethren. Let's talk about
the proposal when we have enough funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Ople suggested that the government create a new
autonomous region in Mindanao to persuade its leaders and men "to
return to the ways of peace."
</P>
<P>
Ople said that while ARMM is under the influence of the MNLF,
the MILF can take over a new autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
MILF leaders' call for an independent Islamic state has been a
stumbling block to peace negotiations between the government and
the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has made it clear that the issue is non-negotiable.

<HEADLINE> Lost Statue of Buddha Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A gilded bronze statue of
Buddha from Dali, an ethnic kingdom of ancient China, was recently
presented to the Shanghai Municipal Museum by a Hong Kong banker
after being kept abroad for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
The statue, with a height of 48 cm, has inscriptions of annals
inside it. It was made some 900 years ago. The statue is the
biggest of its kind now available, according to Ma Chengyuan,
curator of the Shanghai Municipal Museum.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Buddhism was widely believed
by people of the Dali kingdom, which existed in present-day Yunnan
Province during Tang and Song dynasties (618-1279).
</P>
<P>
Dali was hit by an earthquake in 1925 and the well-known
Qianxun Pagoda of Dali was destroyed, with many precious antiques
lost.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Buddhist cultural relics of the Dali Kingdom now
scattered abroad were thereafter taken overseas, said the Ma.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Stops FBI Extraditing Suspect to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRIBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The FBI was frustrated Friday
by the High Court of Kenya from extraditing a Kenyan suspect to
the United States for further questioning over the August 7
Nairobi blast, according to the Daily Nation newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The mechanic, Mohfoudh Salim, must either be brought before a
Kenyan court as soon as possible or set free, a judge sitting in
Mombasa ruled.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered the Immigration Department not to allow
American agents to take Salim out of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The FBI suspected the premises of Salim's garage could have
been used by the main bomb suspect, Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, the
court was told.
</P>
<P>
According to a six-page affidavit filed by Salim's brother, the
U.S. agents had seized Salim's passport and tortured him.
</P>
<P>
Salim's lawyer told the court: " the FBI agents should not be
allowed to operate with immunity as if they are in a Banana
republic."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the FBI has encountered a legal obstacle
in their effort to arrest suspects for the twin bombings, which
left more than 250 people dead and over 5,000 injured.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hotel Facing Over-capacity: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese top businessman has
warned that Lebanon's hotel industry is facing over-capacity and
will see a disaster with too many new buildings chasing too few
customers.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a big disaster if the number of hotel rooms
surges beyond the logical ceiling," said Pierre Achkar, president
of Lebanon's Hotel Syndicate, to the Daily Star published on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that there were around 7,200 hotel rooms in
Beirut and its nearby areas, with another 3,000 rooms to be
completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The number of hotel rooms throughout the country nears 10,000
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that the occupancy rate in most hotels ranges between
40 and 50 percent, warning that the ratio will drop to below 40
percent with more rooms being built.
</P>
<P>
"Investors will find themselves startling at empty rooms once
their fancy hotels in Beirut are completed," said Achkar.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 million U.S. dollars, excluding the cost of land,
had been invested in the hotel industry in the past two years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"This means that each of the rooms currently being built will
cost investors about 125,000 dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, hotel companies must hire 6,000 qualified staff to
operate these establishments, Achkar said.
</P>
<P>
Achkar urged the government to follow France's suit to ban
the construction of more hotels when the occupancy rate falls
below 50 percent.

<P>
HEFEI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A black swan imported from
Australia to a park in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, has
hatched two baby swans.
</P>
<P>
The park was built by local farmers in the 1970s, and it has
become a beautiful scenic spot thanks to the farmers' efforts in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The park has imported many rare plants and animals which live
and multiply there naturally.
</P>
<P>
The breeding rate for Australian black swans is rather low in
China, said a local zoologist, so the success of this black swan
was a pleasant surprise.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Buys Vehicles to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
purchased 300 vehicles in a bid to curb crimes in national parks,
Minister for Tourism and Wildlife Henry Kosgei said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 53 national reserves, Marsabit, Maasai Mara, Samburu
and Tsavo East will benefit from the fleet of British-made Land
Rovers, which is bound to arrive at the Mombasa port any time
from now, the Kenya Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"These are areas that have been and are still vulnerable to
insecurity, " Kosgei said. "Security personnel manning these areas
have always been faced with lack of transport means whenever any
emergency arose."
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry last year was at a record low as incidents
of insecurity happening in the parks tarnished Kenya's name
abroad. Mass cancellations of tourist bookings always followed
every time tourists were attacked by gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Kosgei said the signing of the East African Charter would also
help fight insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Hendrawan Confident of Success in Grand Prix Finals Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian men's top badminton
singles player Hendrawan is upbeat about possible victory in his
debut at the Grand Prix Finals later this month, the Jakarta Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The world number five said he was in top form, thanks to a two-
month break from competition that allowed him to recover from
illness.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm physically much stronger than ever. I think the
layoff is too long for me and I cannot wait for a return to court,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan last played in the Asian Games last December and
missed the season's two opening tournaments in Seoul and Chinese
Taipei earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Hendrawan, Budi Santoso and Hariyanto Arbi are also
tipped to lift the men's singles crown in the Grand Prix Finals.
The season-ending tournament was delayed from its original
schedule of December last year to February 24 to 28 because of the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Only the world's top 16 players in both men's and women's
singles are eligible for the finals, as are the top eight pairs in
the women's, men's and mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan said he would like his opponents to rate him an
underdog on account of his being out of action for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a little difficult in the early stages of my
comeback, and I hope everybody will be easy on me. Being an
underdog always give me an advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted Chinese opponents would give him the toughest test.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, the Chinese will make me play to the fullest. But I'
m now highly motivated to prove that I deserve the world best tag,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
An exhausted Hendrawan lost to China's Olympic silver medalist
Dong Jiong in the Asian Games final.
</P>
<P>
Fielding four pairs, Indonesia looks certain to dominate the
men's doubles competition at the Grand Prix Finals. Topping the
seeding list are Olympic and Asian Games champions Ricky Subagja
and Rexy Mainaky.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Mia Audina is the only Indonesian to
have secured a place in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will also have a pair each in the women's doubles --
Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban -- and mixed doubles -- Minarti
Timur and Tri Kusherjanto.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand National Day Marked in Wellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Governor-General
and Lady Hardie Boys gave a grand reception here Saturday,
commemorating the 159th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty
of Waitangi.
</P>
<P>
Waitangi Day is the national day of New Zealand, whose
constitutional history can be traced back to 1840 when the
Waitangi Treaty was signed. By the Treaty the Maori people
exchanged their sovereignty for the guarantees of the Treaty and
New Zealand became a British colony.
</P>
<P>
At the reception New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
delivered an important speech, in which she said: "New Zealanders
can look back over times of enormous change and achievement. At
the beginning of the century we were a small outpost of the
British Empire, striving to develop a national identity of our
own.
</P>
<P>
"Through hard work, sacrifice and ingenuity we have established
a very distinctive national identity."
</P>
<P>
She noted that this identity has been wrought on the basis of
"a partnership between the people who came here first, and those
who followed in later migrations."
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe a growing number of New Zealanders
understand, appreciate and desire progress on Treaty issues so
that all of us as New Zealanders are able to face the future with
confidence, and reject all those who advocate or promote from
either side of the debate extreme responses to the Treaty,"
Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, from my Government's point of view, I need to make the
point plainly. We do not support recent proposals for a separate
system of Parliament for Maori and Pakeha. Nor do we support a
separate tax system or justice system," the prime minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Our foundation from the Treaty of Waitangi and the fact that
we are a nation made up of diverse cultures, is an enriching
strength. We must value and cherish it and move ahead," she said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people attended the reception. Among them were
government ministers and diplomatic envoys of various countries in
Wellington.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Elections Needs $42mn: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican State Administration
Minister Alfredo Gamito said that the multi-party elections to be
held in the third season this year will need 42.2 million U.S.
Dollars, much less than the 64 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gamito made the remark in Maputo Friday, the Noticias daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sum is based on a joint study by the Mozambican government,
the European Union and the United Nations Development Program, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the reason for the reduced election budget is
 that the government is pursuing a money-saving policy by trying
the best to make use of the materials left over from the 1994
elections.
</P>
<P>
Gamito said that of the elections budget, nine million U.S.
Dollars will come from the government, another 23 million from the
EU and the rest 10 million to be offered by the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of the money will be used in voters'
registration, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Moves to Stabilize Kwacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's central bank, the Bank
of Zambia, released 9.3 million U.S. Dollars on Friday onto the
foreign exchange market in an effort to stabilize the exchange
rate of the country's currency, Kwacha, which fell in nominal
terms by 69 percent against the U.S. Dollar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Head of public relations of the bank Kabinga Pande said in a
statement issued last evening that this is the first time the
central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted him as saying that the amount
by the bank reflected 79.5 percent of the demand for foreign
currency for the day.
</P>
<P>
The majority of banks participated in the tender, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are signs that the market is gaining confidence as
reflected in the increased activity on the inter-bank market and
the general market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pande said the bank will continue to intervene in the foreign
exchange market as and when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Decreased export earnings and no balance of payment support
from donors led to the sharp devaluation of kwacha last year.

<P>
Hanoi, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said the financial-monetary crisis had had a serious
impact on Vietnam's economy and Vietnam would continue renovation
to overcome the impact, local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Editor-in-Chief of the Asian Wall Street
Journal Reginald Chua, Khai said that this had included: the
shrinking access for its exports unfavorable prices; declining
foreign investment in terms of both new projects and the
implementation of licensed projects; a fall in international
services such as aviation, tourism and telecommunication, greater
pressure on the exchange rate and more difficulties in the
international balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
After assessing the difficulties facing Vietnam and the lessons
of the crisis-hit countries, he said the government had
expeditiously formulated a wide-range of policies to alleviate and
overcome any elements that may cause instability.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam's policy was to continue renovation and to make
the fullest use of endogenous capacity by implementing a
consistent and long-term policy of developing a market-oriented
multi-sectoral economy under state management.
</P>
<P>
"We uphold the willingness to learn and be creative while
attaching importance to studying the experiences and lessons of
other countries in the international community," he said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia accused Eritrea
army of " launching a full-scale attack on Ethiopian troops at the
Badme front" at dawn Saturday, saying its "defense forces are
currently engaged in full- scale combat to defend their positions
and to repel Eritrea's invading army" .
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said "the purpose of this attack is
to control Ethiopian military posts at the Badme front and destroy
the Ethiopian army."
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled that "since June 1998 when Eritrean army
attacks on the Badme, Zalambessa and the Bure fronts were
successfully repelled, Eritrean forces have repeatedly launched
various provocative attacks on Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
It said, "only this week it shelled the Badme and Zalambessa
fronts."
</P>
<P>
"The fighting today is a full-scale attempt by Eritrea to
control and destroy Ethiopia's military posts at Badme," the

<HEADLINE> Uganda Set Terms for Congo (K) Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has said that it will
not take part in any negotiations for a cease-fire in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) until all the warring parties
are involved.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma made the announcement
Friday following the organizers of the Lusaka meeting again
refused to invite Congolese rebel leaders to the Zambia talks, the
New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma said that Uganda sees no value in participating in the
negotiations for a cease-fire when the combatants are not
involved. He described the negotiations without participation of
Congolese rebels as futile exercise and a waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
Nobody will compel the rebels to honor the agreement if they
are not invited to the talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to try to negotiate a cease-fire in the third
largest African country, started in Zambian capital Lusaka
Wednesday, but Ugandan and Rwandan officials walked out Thursday,
demanding the presence of Congolese rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba was quoted as saying that
any deal reached without his group would be useless.
</P>
<P>
Since the war erupted in Congo (K) in early August of 1998,
there have been strenuous regional and international efforts to
broker a peace deal there. However, so far neither the rebels nor
President Laurent Kabila has made significant concessions to
facilitate any cease-fire.

LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) has expressed concern over the souring relations
between Zambia and Angola and will encourage dialog to forestall
any conflict.
</P>
<P>
The SADC has also appealed to the United Nations (U.N.)
Security Council to support the planned deployment of the U.N.
peace-keeping mission in the troubled-torn Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The SADC executive secretary, Kaire Mbuende, said this at a
press briefing in Lusaka Friday ahead of the council of ministers
meeting and the 1999 consultative conference to be held in Lusaka
starting next week.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Mbuende as saying
the SADC was exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting
preferably at ministerial level between Zambia and Angola aimed at
taking corrective measures to restore bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"The relation is of major concern to us because one would not
want to see tension between them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC had been actively consulting both governments
over mounting accusations by Angola that Zambia had been supplying
arms to Angolan rebels fighting to topple the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende observed that the two countries had a long history of
cooperation dating back to the post-independence era up to the
1994 Lusaka peace protocol which was intended to set a new
political dispensation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He has promised to help in any way possible to redress the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Albanian King Arrested in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An exiled European royal,
Albanian King Leka, living in Fourways, Johannesburg has been
arrested after police raided his "palace" late Friday, Saturday
Star reported.
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated a large arsenal of weapons and explosives,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The raid came after a long and protracted legal wrangle over
the king's diplomatic immunity which expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last August, police received information that weapons were
being stored on the Fourways property belonging to the exiled
king, but they could not act because of his diplomatic immunity,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested the king and three of his employees over
the weapons, believed to consist of more than 70 firearms and a
large quantity of explosives.
</P>
<P>
Police refused to speculate on why the exiled king was
allegedly storing such a large quantity of weaponry, but it is
known that the last Nationalist government of South Africa allowed
his father King Zog to reside in the country because of his
excellent connections in America and Europe, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
King Zog helped South Africa during the apartheid era to
procure arms and other technological equipment banned under U.N.
embargoes, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted police spokesman Francois Grobbelaar as saying
that the quantity of weapons confiscated was alarming. The arms
cache consisted of 22 rifles, shotguns, 9mm pistols, carbines,
AK-47s and grenade launchers.
</P>
<P>
The explosive material consisted of hand grenades, 6mm
explosive rounds, M26 grenades, land mines and explosive
propellant.
</P>
<P>
The king and his employees are expected to appear in court
Monday, Grobbelaar said.
</P>
<P>
King Leka's father, King Zog, was exiled from Albania in 1939
at the start of World War II when Italy invaded the country.
Although King Leka was born in Albania, he has spent his entire
life in exile, moving from country to country with his parents.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Nationalist government of South Africa
allowed the king to settle in the country, ostensibly because of
his contacts in foreign countries who could supply weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHEN ZHEN, China, February 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand won the
doubles to lead China 2-1 on the second day of the first round of
Asian-Oceania Zone Group A of Davis Cup tennis here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The doubles result is not beyond our expection because the New
Zealanders are better than us both in serve and volly," said
Chinese team captain Wang Fuzhang.
</P>
<P>
But Wang added that they will not give up any chances in the
following reverse singles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Coming into the doubles with 1-1 after Friday's two singles
matches, the newly paired Chinese duo of Zheng Yu and Zhu Benqiang
were unble to stave off the competent pairing of Brett Steven and
Jeff Simpson, who sealed their team' lead in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Simpson said: "Winning the doubles do not mean we have take the
tie. We will concentrate on each match tommorow."
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on the percentage of next two reverse
singles, but said the Chinese number two player Zhang Yu plays
well.
</P>
<P>
That means New Zealand will mainly rely on the first reverse
single between Zhu Benqiang and Alistair Hunt.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealanders broke the Chinese duo six times in three
sets by their powerful serves and delicate vollies, finishing the
match 6-3, 6-4 and 6-0.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's reverse singles, the Chinese number one Zhu
Benqiang is taking on Alistair Hunt and Zhang Yu face Mark Nielson,
who replaced injured Brett Steven in the best of five series.

<HEADLINE> Policy Helping Small Chinese Enterprises Get Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China is drawing up new
policies to help small and medium-sized companies solve their bank
loan problems.
</P>
<P>
These companies account for 98.5 percent of China's total
number of companies, 70 percent of its payroll, 50 percent of its
enterprise assets, 60 percent of its sales, and 50 percent of its
taxes. But, in spite of this economic muscle, they have long been
plagued with a funding problem and many financial institutions are
reluctant to loan them money because of the risk involved.
</P>
<P>
In order to help their development and reduce the risk for
banks, the State Economic and Trade Commission has called for a
credit guarantee system and is choosing 10 provinces and
municipalities to experiment with it.
</P>
<P>
The system will target labor-intensive enterprises with good
market potential and innovative technology-intensive firms. Those
temporarily losing money but showing good prospects in long run
may also benefit from the new system.

<HEADLINE> Economic Union in South Asia Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Chamber of Commerce
and Industries (CCI) have suggested forming a South Asian Economic
Union by the year 2008 in line with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by the CCI leaders at a conference on
"SAARC Economic Union by 2008" held in Bangladesh's southeastern
city of Chittagong Friday, according to press reports reaching
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The CCI leaders traveled to Chittagong from Dhaka after the
conclusion of the 3rd SAARC Economic Cooperation Conference in
Dhaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC chamber was studying the feasibility of setting up 50
joint-venture projects in the region, said ICC's president Kanti
Kumer R. Podder.
</P>
<P>
The study report would be in hand by March this year, he said.
"To facilitate investment in member countries, a SAARC investment
fund will be created under the auspices of the CCI."
</P>
<P>
If the SAARC countries want to form an economic union, they
must ease and integrate their customs procedures to ensure free
flow of goods within the region, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The SAARC countries, instead of trying to enter the developed
markets, should expand intra-SAARC trade for their mutual
benefit," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Other CCI leaders agreed that a SAARC Economic Union is demand
of the day.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1985, SAARC, a regional economic grouping,
comprises Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan
and the Maldives.

2.9-billion-U.S.-dollar five-year reform plan of the Health
Ministry titled Health and Population Sector Program.
</P>
<P>
The changed structure is aimed at ensuring more efficiency in
the healthcare system, and it is a milestone towards improving the
healthcare scenario in the country, The Daily Star newspaper
Saturday quoted a Health Ministry official as saying after a
launching ceremony held in southwestern district of Jessore
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to reunify the present outreach union and
sub-district level health and family planning structures under a
single command," he said.
</P>
<P>
ESP delivery through community clinics for every 6,000 people
aims at ensuring quality service focusing on the needs of the
clients, and it would particularly address the needs of the
mother, children and the poor through community participation, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, communication strategies will be adopted to
change consumer-provider behaviors so that services intake and
quality increases.
</P>
<P>
Based on the research, the Health Ministry will implement the
ESP delivery and phase in 13,500 community clinics across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The ESP will offer five essential services -- reproductive and
child healthcare, communicable disease control, limited curative
care and behaviors change communication -- to a target group of
6,000 people as a unit.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will set up a unified agency to plan,
implement and monitor all procurements for the ESP, and United
Nations bodies will continue to procure essential drugs for the
community clinics and other establishments until the agency is
capable of procuring effectively, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Exports Hit Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea exports in 1998
gained a record 50 billion rupees (735 million U.S. dollars), a
17.9 percent increase over 1997 in rupee terms, tea exporters said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts described it as a "significant achievement"
given the impact of the Russian crisis. Russia stopped buying for
a couple of months beginning last August due to its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also said quality Ceylon tea fetched higher prices
in 1998. Export value increased by 17.9 percent while volume rose
only by 0.52 percent from 268.2 million kilos in 1997 to 269.6
million kilos last year.
</P>
<P>
The average export prices increased to 185.1 rupees per kilo
last year from 158.3 rupees per kilo in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite problems in Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) remained Sri Lanka's number one buyer with 44 million
kilos of tea. However, last year's imports by the CIS dropped by
19.8 percent compared to 54.9 million kilos 1997.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise last year was the emergence of the United
Arab Emirates as Sri Lanka's second largest buyer, increasing its
quantities by 69 percent from 20.5 million kilos in 1997 to 34.7
million kilos in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was placed third with 29 million kilos. Syria, Libya,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Iraq all increased their purchases of
Ceylon tea in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's record export performance in 1998 came on the back
of the largest ever tea crop of 280 million kilos in the country.
The 1998 crop figure was the fifth consecutive year of all-time
high tea production since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Hopes for Bumper Harvest Fading in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers' hopes of a
bumper crop harvest are fading as the excessive rains continue to
pound most parts of the country, leaving fields water logged and
severely leached, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The above-normal rains have become a nightmare to farmers and
many have had to revise their production downwards. Where farmers
used to apply top- dressing fertilizer once, they have now been
forced to go for second and third ammonium nitrate applications.
</P>
<P>
In its fortnightly crop and livestock report, Agritex said that
most crops were suffering from the effects of water logging and
leaching of nutrients.
</P>
<P>
However, the early planted crops seemed to have survived the
adverse effects of the continuous rains. Except for Matabeleland
South Province, the incessant rains across the country have caused
disastrous effects on the maize crop, the country's staple food
grain.
</P>
<P>
This has made weeding difficult and has led to the yellowing of
the crop.
</P>
<P>
In some instances, the late planted crop is a complete
write-off.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects Higher Growth in Jewelry Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Export
Promotion in Thailand has forecast a 15 percent growth in Thai
exports of jewelry and related products for this year compared to
five percent last year, The Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Sanit Vorapanya, director-general of the
department, as saying that the demand from the United States and
Europe is expected to remain buoyant.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 50 percent fall in demand from Asian countries due to
the regional economic turmoil, strong sales in the United States
and European markets helped Thai exporters to post an overall five
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Exports of jewelry and related products totaled 55 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, up five percent from the previous year. Italy and
China are Thailand's major competitors.
</P>
<P>
Currently, gems and jewelry are Thailand's seventh biggest
foreign exchange earner. Food and textiles, electronics and autos
and automotive parts are among the biggest foreign exchange
earners.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry has announced a target to increase
exports by four percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Passes Measures to Spur Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of
Thailand has approved a Bank of Thailand proposal to ease
regulations on car hire purchases in a bid to stimulate the
automobile industry where sales fell more than 60 percent last
year, a ministry official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial approval will allow leasing firms to set
minimum downpayment requirement instead of the mandatory minimum
downpayment of 25 percent of the vehicle price.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, leasing firms may fix the installment period, instead
of a limit of 48 months.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, leasing firms may repossess the vehicles after
customers fail to pay installments for three consecutive months.
The leasing firms are required to disclose their terms and
conditions prior to signing the contracts with customers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry adjusted a regulation for
financial institutions to run car leasing businesses. The
institutions were previously allowed to provide loans only up to
five percent of its capital and it was limited to five percent of
its total loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The easing of leasing rules is expected to give a boost to the
weak car market in which major firms have launched promotional
campaigns to boost sales and introduced new models.
</P>
<P>
Last year's sales totaled 144,065 units, including last-quarter
sales of 44,062 units.
</P>
<P>
The continued decline in interest rates, baht stability, lower
oil prices and the government's measures to stimulate domestic
consumption will also help shore up the domestic car market.

COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Permanent
Representative to the United Nations John de Saram has been
appointed co-Vice Chairman of the General Assembly's open-ended
Working Group on Security Council Reform, Foreign Ministry
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was made by the president of the U.N. General
Assembly after consultations with all the regional groups and
concerned representatives, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The open-ended Working Group, established by the General
Assembly in December 1993, focuses on the issue of equitable
representation and increase in the membership of the Security
Council and other matters relating to the council.
</P>
<P>
The president himself serves as chairman of the Working Group.

<P>
John de Saram served for many years as Director of the Office
of the Legal Counsel in the U.N. Secretariat, and was later
elected to the International Law Commission, before being
appointed as Sri Lanka's permanent representative to the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Sector Strives for Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China's postal service is to
step up efforts to enhance efficiency this year in order to wipe
out its three year loss making record in three years.
</P>
<P>
Three targets to achieve this have been set for this year,
namely to earn revenue of 36.5 billion yuan (4.4 billion U.S.
dollars), to reduce losses by 40 percent and enhance operational
efficiency by 28 percent, according to Liu Liqing, director of
China's Post Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The postal and telecommunications sector, once a single body,
will be broken up this year into separate entities. After years of
development, major breakthroughs have been made in expanding
postal networks, upgrading technologies and improving services,
which provide a sound environment for the sector's development.
</P>
<P>
But such factors as a shortage of capital and poor efficiency
have posed threats to the sector's sustainable and prolonged
development.
</P>
<P>
The postal service departments have mapped out an overall
development strategy for 1999. More Efforts will be made to
improve its management efficiency and services, enhance the
quality of its staff and step up system reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A new South Korean-Japanese
fishery agreement signed Friday goes into full effect on Saturday,
according to the South Korean Ministry of Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after a three-day negotiation between South
Korean Deputy Minister for Maritime and Fisheries Park Kyu-seok
and his Japanese counterpart Isao Nkasu.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korea may send 1,562 fishing boats
to catch 149,000 tons of 12 species of fish per year in the
Japanese exclusive economic zone, down from the past annual 207,
000 tons, while 1,575 Japanese fishing boats may enter the South
Korean exclusive economic zone to catch 94,000 tons of 15 kinds of
fish annually, down from original 110,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, out of the 1,562 South Korean fishing boats, 162 are
allowed to catch 3,013 tons of eel and 30 to catch 500 tons of
king crab in the Japanese zone. In the king crab fishing, South
Korean fishermen have to use the same dragnets as their Japanese
counterparts instead of gillnets.
</P>
<P>
South Korean experts said South Korean fishermen will suffer a
loss of at least 140 billion won (some 120 million U.S. dollars)
each year due to the new fishery pact.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Korean government said it has set aside a
special budget of 51 billion won (43.7 million dollars) to
compensate the fishermen's loss this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for European Lead in Deploying Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Europe should take the lion's
share of any peacekeeping burden in Kosovo if the Rambouillet
talks on the future of that war-torn Serbian province fail,
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting his Spanish
counterpart Eduardo Serra, Cohen said this is because Europe has
already taken the initiative to broker a political settlement of
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
has to take actions, all its members will have to share the
required budget according to the set proportions.
</P>
<P>
But it is still too early for the United States and Spain to
announce specifically how many troops they will deploy in that
province, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Both Cohen and Serra said they believed that Serbs and Kosovars
are likely to reach a peace agreement at the Rambouillet talks
proposed by the six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the U.S. defense minister met with Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Aznar on the Kosovo crisis and the NATO summit
scheduled for Washington in April.

<P>
BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here on Friday that he would continue to push forward the
Middle East peace process and the international community should
provide more economic aid to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that in spite of all the difficulties we are
facing, due to the suspension of negotiations and delays in the
implementation of commitments, we still reaffirm our total
commitment to all signed agreements," he told the press after
meeting German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who was representing Germany as the current president
of the European Union, said the EU and Germany would continue
their support for the Middle East peace process and called for an
immediate and overall implementation of the Wye accords on land-
for-peace by the Palestinian authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "any unilateral action" would impair the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Arafat was in Frankfurt attending a two-day
meeting of donor countries and organizations on financial support
for the Palestinian territories over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, Arafat did not
specify whether he has suspended a previous plan to announce the
establishment of the Palestinian State on May 4 but he noted that
it would be "more important" to realize the historical
reconciliation between the Palestinian and Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting hosted by the World Bank and attended by some 30
countries and eight international organizations, the donors
pledged to put up some 770 million U.S. dollars in aid to
Palestine in 1999, in the form of grants and concessional loans
toward development activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation put forward a new five-year
development plan with a cost of 4.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, minister of planning and international
cooperation of the Palestinian authority, said 49 percent of the
money would be invested in infrastructure projects, such as water
and sewage treatment plants. Some 29 percent would be used for
social infrastructure projects, such as schools and hospitals,
while the rest would be invested in industry and institution
buildings.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said Friday that news media
will play an important and positive role in increasing exchanges
and cooperation between China and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while meeting with Norman Pearlstine,
editor-in-chief of U.S.-based Time Inc.. He noted that China needs
to enhance the exchanges with the international community in order
to further promote mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin announced Friday at the opening
ceremony of the annual municipal People's Congress that great
efforts will be made to tackle air pollution and traffic jam and
to create a clean environment for the celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic later this
year.
</P>

-- The number of poverty-stricken people in Luliang Prefecture
in north China's Shanxi Province, one of China's poor
revolutionary bases, has reduced from 1.43 million five years ago
to present 300,000.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the local government's efforts in improving
local infrastructure. The prefecture's per capita income reached 1,
417 yuan in 1998, an average increase of 169 yuan a year during
the five-year period.
</P>

decided to crack down on the rampant small-volume petroleum
smuggling in southeastern coastal areas.

<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Youth Team Comes under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian youth soccer team came
under heavy fire from its domestic media after it failed to snatch
a win at the Dunhill Cup undergoing in Hanoi, Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian under-21 was held to a 1-1 draw by regional
minnows Malaysia before going down 1-2 to China and suffering a 1-
5 rout by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The disastrous 0-1-2 record meant it was sent packing after the
group stages of the eight-nation soccer showcase for the young
talents.
</P>
<P>
In an article headlined as "Dunhill Cup--New Blow to Bulgarian
Soccer's Reputation" published in Friday's edition of the weekly "
168 hours", criticism piled up on the youth team for its abysmal
performances to "have effectively closed out the Asian market who
had been interested in Bulgarian soccer starlets".
</P>
<P>
A depleted line-up which saw players reduced from the original
24 to the current 16 served the major reason for the fiasco, the
article said, and the fault lay with both self-interested domestic
clubs who refused to release players for international duties and
the country's soccer federation who failed to work out
reconciliations between the national and club soccer.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian soccer, reaching its apex at the 1994 World Cup when
bursting into the semifinals, has been going down all the way and
has now lagged far behind, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Join Coalbed Methane Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven domestic drilling
companies have been chosen to distribute China's international
cooperation projects on coalbed methane development, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd. (CUCBM) awarded 37
drilling companies with "Grade A" and "Grade B" certifications,
respectively, after careful qualification evaluations in the last
six months, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It is a significant measure for guaranteeing drilling
engineering quality and will help to promote cooperation with
foreign companies on coalbed methane projects, the newspaper
quoted Sun Maoyuan, vice-president of the company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's annual coalbed methane output is expected to reach 10
billion cu m by 2010, which means about 10,000 wells will be
drilled.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM, the country's exclusive overseer of the country's
coalbed methane sector, launched a large-scale certification
program in June 1998 in order to create a sound foundation for
Chinese drilling companies to better cooperate with foreign
partners.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 drilling companies involved in major oilfields,
coal mines and other fields sought certifications.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on four aspects -- management efficiency, equipment
condition, staff quality and operational experience, CUCBM
introduced a series of on-the-spot investigations and
comprehensive evaluations of the drilling companies, according to
Sun.
</P>
<P>
The certified drilling companies have implemented strict
quality management systems and are sufficiently acquainted with
the operation of international drilling projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Snyder, President and Managing Director of Texaco China
BV, said the certified companies are expected to become good
cooperative partners.

<HEADLINE> Financial Stability Emphasized in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Shanghai
Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the local advisory body, have called for
greater efforts to guard against financial risks and ensure
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yingliang, a senior banker, said at a recent meeting of
the committee that financial stability is important to the economy,
and financial institutions must strengthen internal supervision
and avoid violating regulations.
</P>
<P>
Special efforts must be made to educate company managers and
executives in financial matters and increase their awareness of
the importance of credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guijuan, chairwoman of a local company, said that China
can not be insulated from international financial turbulence amid
global economic integration, and she urged the government to set
up risk reserve funds, and enterprises to establish risk funds of
their own.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaoxun, an official of the Shanghai International Trust and
Investment Co., said that risk prevention must be implemented
throughout the process of asset evaluation, investment decision-
making, and loan extensions and repayment.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of
the CPPCC has received 1,143 proposals on a wide range of topics
from its members and people from various communities since the
beginning of last year.

<HEADLINE> Panama Dismisses Possible Multilateral Anti-Drug Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Eduardo Ritter on Friday ruled out the possibility of establishing
a multilateral anti-drug center in his country.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who is here on an official visit to Costa Rica, told
reporters that the opening of a new multilateral center for drug
control in Panama is very improbable.
</P>
<P>
Panama had been negotiating with the United States last year on
the creation of that center in view of the imminent withdrawal of
the U.S. troops from Panama scheduled for next December 31.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said that the negotiations failed because there was no
agreement about the status of the U.S. soldiers in that base.
</P>
<P>
The United States is dismantling what is left of its bases in
Panama, one of them an important communications complex, which
performs, among other things, drug trafficking control functions.
</P>
<P>
"All that is being dismantled, so its reinstallation in Panama
would be very costly," said Ritter to back up his view that it
will be very remote to put back those bases in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said that his country is fully capable of assuming the
Panama Canal management, starting next January.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Argentina,
the two biggest South American Common Market (Mercosur) partners,
decided on Friday to take measures to prevent trade imbalance in
the regional bloc caused by the devaluation of Brazil's currency
real.
</P>
<P>
Jose Botafogo Gonzalves, Brazilian state secretary of external
trade, said his country is ready to cut the funding for its
special export support program for products destined to other
Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is concerned over the flooding of Brazilian products
into its market, caused by the devaluation of the real starting
from January.
</P>
<P>
Botafogo said that the Brazilian government will hold talks
with an Argentine delegation to reach an understanding on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Brazilian official said that his country is
expected to increase its annual exports to 100 billion U.S.
dollars before the year 2000.

<P>
PRAGUE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda, who tested positive
for a steroid at Wimbledon, was banned from competing in the Czech
Republic for one year by the Czech Tennis Association on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Czechs demanded suspension of Korda, but the
latter succeeded in persuading the International Tennis Federation
to accept his explanation that he didn't know how the steroid
Nandrolone got into his system.
</P>
<P>
The ban will have little effect on Korda as he retired from
Davis Cup for the Czech Republic last year and seldom appears in
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Korda was free to play elsewhere on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
"This is a pradoxical situation," said Czech tennis Association
chairman Karel Papousek, "ITF has its own policy. Our decision is
based on the fact that we are signatories to the international
agreements against doping."

<HEADLINE> Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson was thrown back
to jail Friday for at least one year and fined 5,000 US dollars
for assaulting two motorists in what the judge called "potentially
lethal road rage."
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephen Johnson made a decision after a three-hour
hearing in Maryland, giving Tyson two concurrent two-year
sentences, and suspended all but one year. He sentenced him to
two year's probation after his release from jail -- which could be
in six months if he's released early for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
The decision not only threatens the former heavyweight champion'
s boxing career, it could lead to longer jail time for violating
parole in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Tyson "repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and
violently. The court views this as a tragic example of potentially
lethal road rage."
</P>
<P>
Upen hearing the judge's words, Tyson's board shoulders slumped,
and he was led away in handcuffs while his wife Monica cried.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who pleaded no contest, can appeal the sentence within
30 days, and if he won, he would stand trial on the charges. He
cannot be released on bail before Monday, when he can request a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Tyson beat Francios Botha of South Africa three weeks ago in
his comeback fight, and he was scheduled to fight on April 24 in
Las Vegas agasint an opponent to be determined.
</P>
<P>
Indiana authorities must now decide whether the 32-year-old
fighter violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. Tyson
was released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year
sentence, and his probation was set to expire in March.
</P>
<P>
The sentence could also mean Tyson has to re-apply for boxing
license, which he regained after a one-year suspension for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during a fight in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sentence is totally and completely unexpected and
unduly harsh," Tyson's lead attorney Jim Jimmerson said. "There's
going to be a careful review of his options, including perhaps
requesting a new trial in Maryland."
</P>
<P>
Jimmerson said the panel had several options, including a fine
and or a suspention or revocation of his license.
</P>
<P>
Judge Patricia Gifford, the Indiana judge who sentenced Tyson
at his rape trial, is waiting for her paperwork to come from
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor
three-car accident in Maryland on August 31. Tyson pleaded no
contest -- meaning he neither protested the charges nor admitted
guilt.
</P>
<P>
The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled
out of court, and were against sending Tyson to jail.

WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Muhammad Ali, one of the

likenesses of stars in many other sports have appeared.
</P>
<P>
"It was a long time coming," said Ali's wife, Lonnie. "But in
the sixties when Muhammad was at the height of his career, he

<P>

Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) said
Friday Nigeria is ready to host this year's 10th World Youth
Soccer Championship tagged Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
The leader of a FIFA team, Jack Warner, told a press conference
here after a week-long tour in the West African country that "the

for the championship."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA official who toured the eight destignated centers for
the championship noted that "if it were possible to begin the
championship today, I dare say that Nigeria is ready."

based on our observations during the tour," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Warner, however, expressed some concerns about inadequacies in
some venues, but stated that "we have been given the assurance
that work would be completed by the time when the team returns in

that have hosted the championship in the past," the official
pointed out.

<P>
He said that "all fears by members of the international
community and even the concerns by the local media are put to rest.
"
</P>

all the eight centers visited by the team.
</P>
<P>
He said that his team insisted on international standards in
its assessment of the facilities, adding that "I believe that
Africa should participate in football on equal footing with the

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. men's national
soccer team will play against Germany on Saturday in Florida in a
friendly game to test its new lineup.
</P>
<P>
In a few short months, coach Bruce Arena has given American
soccer hopes after finishing a disastrous last at the World Cup
last summer.
</P>
<P>
The United States tied Bolivia, the No. 61 team in the FIFA
world rankings, in a scoreless game on January 24 in its
rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
Though Germany, the world No.5 team, have beat the Americans
three times, including a 2-0 win at the France World Cup, the
Americans are eager to be tested.
</P>
<P>
"We're on our turf. We've going to go at them," midfielder
Chris Armas says. "The main thing is to compete and be aggressive,
that's what wins games."
</P>
<P>
German coach Erich Ribbeck has noticed the USA's adjustments in
rosters. "We don't know how strong they are really," he says. "We
know they have gone with younger players and have changed their
World Cup team a lot."
</P>
<P>
"We know the game of soccer is not as important as American
football, but we know it is a big opportunity for them to play
Germany," says forward Michael Preetz, the top German scorer this
year in the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
Germany is coming off a World Cup quarterfinal loss to Croatia
and a shaky start to qualifying for the 2000 European

<HEADLINE> Herbal Cigarettes May Be Harmful: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable-based herbal
cigarettes designed as an aid to quit smoking are a potential
health hazard themselves, Austrian researchers warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The herbal cigarettes are marketed in some European countries
as an aid to stop smoking. They contain no nicotine or tobacco,
but are smoked in the usual way.
</P>
<P>
However, a team from the University of Vienna, Austria, has
found that the vegetable-based cigarettes produce a level of
carbon monoxide similar to that produced by tobacco cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, who reported their findings in the medical
journal The Lancet, measured the carbon-monoxide exposure
resulting from the smoking of vegetable-based cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Carbon-monoxide concentrations in expired air were measured in
five students who volunteered to participate in the study.
</P>
<P>
They smoked first one then a second vegetable-based cigarette.
Carbon-monoxide concentrations were measured in the air breathed
out, and also for an hour after smoking one cigarette.
</P>
<P>
In two students, the carbon monoxide concentrations after the
first vegetable-based cigarette rose from 15 parts per million to
21 parts per million in one, and from 14 parts per million to 26
parts per million in the other.
</P>
<P>
Smoking the second cigarette led to higher carbon-monoxide
concentrations being reached by both students, forcing the study
to be ended early to prevent further adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable-based cigarettes are "a potential hazard to health,"
the researchers concluded, emphasising that current treatment of
nicotine dependence should consist of a combination of nicotine
substitution and behavioral therapy or psychological procedures
without medication.

<HEADLINE> Act Two to Be Raised on East Timor: U.N. Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A document on the
outcome of tripartite talks on East Timor is to be presented to
the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The curtain has come down on the first phase of our
negotiations and is about to go up on Act Two of our
negotiations," said U.N. mediator Jamsheed Marker of the talks at
the senior official level started here a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The document "could form a useful basis for a constitution for
East Timor" with essential elements such as electoral and
judiciary systems as well as citizenship, he briefed reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Marker, Annan's personal representative for East
Timor, acknowledged that there are still differences between
Indonesia and Portugal, but the document "in many ways can stand
by itself."
</P>
<P>
"It is still an ongoing process and don't expect to see any
happy signatures being signed on Monday," he said, referring to
Annan's scheduled meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas and Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama.
</P>
<P>
Annan will spend the whole Monday with them to find a more
definite idea about the next step to take.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating process started on August 5, 1998 on
Indonesia's proposal for a wide ranging autonomy for East Timor,
"without prejudices to their basic positions of principle, namely,
Indonesia wanted autonomy as a definitive solution while Portugal
would only consider autonomy for a transitional period until the
people exercise the right of determination," Marker said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to examine and discuss what they could find
as common ground in between which could help the process forward.
</P>
<P>
In October, the United Nations presented a constitutional
framework for a wide ranging autonomy, a blue-print for East Timor
self-administration either for a permanent or transitional
autonomy, Marker said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal package has been refined in the November and
current rounds of talks, with differences narrowed, said Marker,
declining to go into details.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would continue to be responsible for external
defense, foreign affairs and financial matters for East Timor in
the autonomy plan, it was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of 15,000 square kilometers and a
population of 800,000, had been a Portuguese colony for nearly
four centuries until 1975.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia annexed it the following year. The U.N. has since
been seeking "a comprehensive and just settlement" of the issue.

</P>

"We expect the plane to take off on Saturday morning and the

<HEADLINE> Leech Provides Better Way to Prevent Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Hirudin, a drug isolated from
the saliva of leeches, is better than standard treatment in
preventing heart attacks, an international team of researchers
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Current standard treatment of aspirin and heparin, taken
together, has been shown to reduce rates of mortality and further
heart attack in people with unstable angina.
</P>
<P>
However, even during treatment, 5 to 10 percent of patients go
on to have a heart attack or even more severe angina.
</P>
<P>
A study of more than 19,000 heart disease sufferers showed
hirudin was more effective in preventing deaths and further heart
attacks than the combined treatment of heparin and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
The scientists tested hirudin on more than 10,000 patients.
Half the patients were given hirudin for 72 hours and the
remainder took heparin and aspirin for the same length of time.
</P>
<P>
After seven days 213 patients, or 4.2 percent, in the heparin
group had either died or had another heart attack compared to 182,
or 3.6 percent, on hirudin.
</P>
<P>
"Hirudin is superior to heparin in preventing cardiovascular
death, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and refractory angina
(chest pains) with an accepted safety profile," Professor Salim
Yusuf at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, who led the
study, concluded in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers reported that there was a higher rate
of major bleeding in the hirudin group than in the heparin group,
though there was no difference between the groups in terms of
life-threatening episodes or strokes.

<HEADLINE> Technology Stocks Fall Sharply On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell sharply on Wall Street again Friday while
broad indexes suffered moderate losses.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index closed at 2,373.62, down 36.45, bringing a
total number of losses to 196.25 points or 7.8 percent in the past
four days. The composite suffered the third biggest point loss of
83.34 in its history Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in technology stocks was primarily a result of
profit taking by investors to lock in some of their recent gains.
But the market was worsened by investors' worries about an
expected price war among the computer-chip competitors who have
got a disappointing earnings forecast.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were caught in worries about the Nasdaq's impact
on the broad market because high-flying technology companies have
been largely responsible for the market's overall advance. They
feared that once the technology bubble burst, the entire market
will get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.26 at 9,304.24 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite dropped 9.09 at 1,239.40.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index was down 3.76 at 587.29 while the American Stock
Exchange composite was down 0.86 at 706.26.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Russia Not to Sell Arms to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has warned
Russia not to sell arms to Syria, or it would lose 500 million
dollars in aid, a State Department official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The message was passed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
when she met in Moscow last week with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Our concerns about Russian arms sales to Syria were raised
during the secretary's visit to Moscow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that U.S. law requires that certain
assistance be withheld from governments that provide arms to
states on the U.S. blacklist of countries, and Syria has been on
the list.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering whether a sanctions determination (against
Russia) is warranted under current circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has requested more than 300 million
dollars for Russia in the year 2000 budget he just sent to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sale of arms to Syria is just the latest dispute between
Washington and Moscow. The two countries also have a major
disagreement over Russian cooperation with Iran in what Washington
alleged were missile and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
The United States last month imposed sanctions on three Russian
institutes for helping Iran.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Oxygen to Miscarriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Too much oxygen may be a
significant cause of miscarriage in early pregnancy, British
scientists suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Cambridge University believed a major reason for
early miscarriages could be that foetuses receive too much oxygen
at a time when they are not developed enough to withstand it.
</P>
<P>
"Oxygen can be quite toxic. It contains free radicals which
cause premature ageing", Dr Graham Burton, who is leading the
research, was quoted by BBC as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that during the period of early development in
the womb the tissue is particularly susceptible to the toxic
effects of oxygen and that too much oxygen kills it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Research on animals shows that a higher level of congenital
abnormalities may be linked to high levels of oxygen. It may be we
are protecting ourselves by keeping oxygen levels low in the early
stages", he added.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have come to their hypothesis after 18 months of
studying normal pregnancies using new imaging techniques to study
the supply of oxygen to the foetus.
</P>
<P>
The hypothesis will be tested out over the next two years. The
researchers will study women in the process of miscarrying and
those threatening to miscarry as well as the placenta of women who
have miscarried.

<HEADLINE> SI Backs Strong Social-Democratic Segment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist International
backs the creation of a strong social-democratic segment in
Romania, Secretary-General Luis Ayala said here Friday in an
interview with Romania's national radio station.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is to keep a close eye on the unifying
tendencies. We nurture hope in this process," stressed Luis Ayala,
who Friday opened the two-day reunion of the Socialist
International Committee for Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We have trust in the process, we want the creation of a pole
of social-democratic power in Romania. It's a process we watch
closely and which we shall no doubt back," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary-general, the main actors are the
leaders of the social-democratic parties of Romania, which the
Socialist International cooperates with and are its members.
</P>
<P>
However, Luis Ayala made clear in the interview that the
Socialist International has no joint project or recipes for the
victory in elections of the social-democratic parties of Central
and Eastern Europe. "These parties have the duty to find the way
to rule," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party are the
two Romanian parties affiliated to the Socialist International.
They are both in the ruling coalition. Beside the two parties, in
Romania there are some other parliamentary parties of such an
orientation, the most important of which is the main opposition
Party of Social Democracy of Romania.

<HEADLINE> Socialist International Upholds Idea of Rapid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist International
had always upheld the idea of EU enlargement and the necessity for
this process to be quickly unfolded, a senior official of the
organization said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union enlargement to the 12 member states is the
greatest unification process, Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino
said on the first day of the reunion of the Socialist
International Committee for the Central and Eastern Europe.
Fassino is also a co-Chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Fassino added that there was a need to get the EU's commitment
that, by end-century, it will start negotiations also with the
countries that have not yet been involved in the enlargement
process. The integration strategy must be complex and turn all
applicant countries into protagonists, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day reunion of the Socialist International Committee
for Central and Eastern Europe opened on Friday in Bucharest, with
the attendance of over 60 socialist and social-democratic European
personalities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GA Convenes Special Session on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly on Friday convened its tenth emergency special
session to consider "illegal Israeli actions in occupied East
Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory".
</P>
<P>
The session, which adjourned this afternoon and is due to
continue on Monday, was convened at the request of the Group of
Arab States, a move supported by the Movement of Non-Alignment
Countries.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the session is to recommend that a
conference be convened involving the countries that have signed
the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention barring settlements on occupied
territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, Palestinian U.N. Observer Nasser
Al-Kidwa called on the parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention,
which bars settlement in occupied territory, to hold a conference
by April 8 to discuss enforcing it against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very patient, despite the pressure of the
continuous Israeli violations. Now we believe we have reached
the end of the line. Now we have to take the only required step,
that is the reaffirmation of the recommendation to convene the
conference on a specific date," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by a large number of speakers, all critical of
Israel in varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the European Union( EU), Germany Ambassador Dieter
Kastrup said it deplored Israel's failure to respond to appeals to
suspend the development of settlements and its decision to suspend
implementation of last October's Wye accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU supported the convening of a Geneva Convention
conference but sympathized with Switzwerland's concern that it
should be properly prepared and enjoy widespread support, with
the presence of all key parties.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sergei Lavrov of Russia expressed serious concern
that the Assembly's previous decisions have not yet been
implemented. He supported the idea of convening a conference,
which he said should be carefully prepared.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, Israel's Ambassador, said such a move was "creating
a mechanism that will be a precedent for selective politicized
application of the Geneva Conventions to any conflict."
</P>
<P>
The session was originally summoned in April 1997 and has
since reconvened three times, most recently last March.
</P>
<P>
Previous sessions of the emergency General Assembly
overwhelmingly condemned Israel's failure to revoke plans to
build housing at a site south of Jerusalem called Har Homa in
Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic. The site was captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution is expected to be adopted on Monday
which would again condemn Israel's failure to comply with
demands to halt work at Har Homa/jabal Abu Ghneim and all other
settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
It would reiterate previous recommendations to U.N. members
for "the cessation of all forms of assistance and support for
illegal Israeli activities" in the occupied territories, in
particular settlement activities.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Capital Mayor Nominated New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan capital mayor
Serafim Urecheanu was nominated on Friday as the new prime
minister by President Petru Lucinschi.
</P>
<P>
Serafim Urecheanu, according to the constitution, is empowered
to form a new team within 15 days and then present it for
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Urecheanu is not affiliated to any political party and is able
to organize the work of the new government, said President Petru
Lucinschi who had in these days intense consultations with the
parliamentary factions on appointing a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Urecheanu, 49, was president of the national trade unions in
the early 1990s before his appointment as mayor of Chisinau in
1994. He visited China in 1994 heading a delegation of the trade
unions, and in 1997 as the mayor.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet of Ciubuc, the sixth of the former Soviet Republic
since its independence in 1991, fell after the prime minister
handed in his resignation on February I, saying he was unable to
consolidate his cabinet because of its diverse composition.
